  "readme": "Introduction\n============\n\nPasteup is where design meets development. It is where the Guardianâ€™s globally recognised design language is turned into code for the web, and the starting point when styling Guardian branded products for both internal teams and third parties.\n\n**Why Pasteup?** It's a newspaper term for \"the assemblage of pages by pasting type onto page mockups, which are then photographed to be made into metal plates for the printing press\" (courtesy of John E McIntyre). This is quite a nice metaphor for how client-side development builds the Guardian's pages. Plus it sounds cool.\n\nUsing Pasteup\n========================\n\nLink to Pasteup CSS and JavaScript files directly. The current URLs can be found at http://pasteup.guim.co.uk/index.html.\n\n### Using Bower in your own build\n\nYou can install Pasteup using bower.\n\n    > npm install -g bower\n    > bower install pasteup\n\nThis will create a `components/pasteup` directory and you can reference Pasteup LESS and JS files directly in your own code. For example, in LESS:\n\n    @import \"components/pasteup/less/layout.less\";\n    @import \"components/pasteup/less/zones.less\";\n\nOr in you `requirejs` paths configuration:\n\n    paths: {\n    \tdetect: \"components/pasteup/js/modules/detect\",\n    \timages: \"components/pasteup/js/modules/images\"\n    }\n\n\nContributing to Pasteup\n=======================\n\nTo build Pasteup you need the following installed:\n\n* `nodejs`\n* `npm`\n* `grunt`\n\nOn linux you can run `> ./setup` to do this.\n\nWith these dependencies installed try the following.\n\n`> grunt # Runs the build, starts server on http://localhost:3000 and watches files for changes.`\n\n`> grunt build # Runs the build.`\n",
