Introduction
============

Pasteup is where design meets development. It is where the Guardianâ€™s globally recognised design language is turned into code for the web, and the starting point when styling Guardian branded products for both internal teams and third parties.

**Why Pasteup?** It's a newspaper term for "the assemblage of pages by pasting type onto page mockups, which are then photographed to be made into metal plates for the printing press" (courtesy of John E McIntyre). This is quite a nice metaphor for how client-side development builds the Guardian's pages. Plus it sounds cool.

Using Pasteup
========================

Link to Pasteup CSS and JavaScript files directly. The current URLs can be found at http://pasteup.guim.co.uk/index.html.

### Using Bower in your own build

You can install Pasteup using bower.

    > npm install -g bower
    > bower install pasteup

This will create a `components/pasteup` directory and you can reference Pasteup LESS and JS files directly in your own code. For example, in LESS:

    @import "components/pasteup/less/layout.less";
    @import "components/pasteup/less/zones.less";

Or in you `requirejs` paths configuration:

    paths: {
    	detect: "components/pasteup/js/modules/detect",
    	images: "components/pasteup/js/modules/images"
    }
