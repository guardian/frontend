 * Use UTF-8 encoding.
 * Indents are four spaces.
 * Lowercase element names, attribute names, and attribute values.
 * Lines with nothing on them should have no whitespace.
 * There should be no whitespace at the end of a line.
 * HTML5 doctype, valid document where possible.
 * XML style - ie, all elements must close.

 ## Formatting

  * Ues a new line for every block, list or table element.
  * Indent child elements.

 ## Separation of concerns

  * Avoid style attributes and other inline CSS.
  * Avoid the javascript pseudo protocol.
  * Avoid event handler attributes such as onclick.
