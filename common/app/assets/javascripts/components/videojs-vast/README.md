videojs-vast-plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theonion/videojs-vast-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theonion/videojs-vast-plugin)
===================

This plugin reads a [VAST file](https://www.iab.net/vast), grabs the first video it can, and plays it as pre-roll advertisement before your video. It will also click through to whatever url the advertiser designates, track any clicks, and fire all of the correct pixel trackers at the right times.

### Usage
Include the plugin and it's dependencies:

```
<script src="http://vjs.zencdn.net/4.4.3/video.js"></script>
<script src="vast-client.js"></script>
<script src="video.ads.js"></script>
<script src="videojs.vast.js"></script>
```

Add "ads" and "vast" to the plugins object, and pass a url:

    plugins: {
        ads: {},
        vast: {
            url: 'http://url.to.your/vast/file.xml'
        }
    }

And when you play that video, a pre-roll ad should play beforehand.

Check out the [demo](https://github.com/theonion/videojs-vast-plugin/blob/master/example.html) for a more detailed example.

This plugin is technically an integration for video.js's [ads plugin](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads). For more information on the various states in the preroll process, please refer to the  [videojs-contrib-ads documentation](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads#state-diagram).

### Credit

This plugin uses dailymotion's [vast client](https://github.com/dailymotion/vast-client-js) to read and parse the VAST files, and video.js's [ads plugin](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads) for switching from pre-roll to content.
