      * From the Joda Time documentation (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/Period.html):
      *
     * The definition of a period also affects the equals method. A period of 1 day is not equal to a period of 24
      * hours, nor 1 hour equal to 60 minutes. This is because periods represent an abstracted definition of a time
      * period (eg. a day may not actually be 24 hours, it might be 23 or 25 at daylight savings boundary). To compare
      * the actual duration of two periods, convert both to durations using toDuration, an operation that emphasises
      * that the result may differ according to the date you choose.
