    If you are reading this you have probably added a new parameter to the application.
    Before doing this you need to understand the implications this has on caching and SEO.

    This is not to stop you adding parameters, it is here to make you think before doing so.

    Please read and understand the following...

    Make sure you have done everything necessary before releasing a new parameter.

    Make sure you have discussed what you want to do with the team.

    You might need to modify the CDN to accept your new parameter.
