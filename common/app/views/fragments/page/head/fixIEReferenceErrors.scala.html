Protect against ReferenceErrors in IE:
`window.console` only exists when the dev tools are open. If you reference
something that doesn't exist, JavaScript will throw a `ReferenceError`. Here, we
ensure console always exists one can safely reference it.

<script>
    window.console = window.console || undefined;
</script>
