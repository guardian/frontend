Configuration
=============

We must first configure Sentry to allow certain hosts to report errors. This prevents abuse so somebody else couldn't start sending errors to your account from their site.

**Note**: Without setting this, all messages will be rejected!

This can be found under the *Project Details* page in Sentry.

Now need to set up Raven.js to use your Sentry DSN.

.. code-block:: javascript

    Raven.config('https://public@getsentry.com/1').install()

At this point, Raven is ready to capture any uncaught exception.

Although, this technically works, this is not going to yield the greatest results. It's highly recommended to next check out :doc:`/usage/index`.

Optional settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Raven.config()`` can be passed an optional object for extra configuration.

logger
------

The name of the logger used by Sentry. Default: ``javascript``

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      logger: 'javascript'
    }

.. _config-whitelist-urls:

tags
----

Additional `tags <https://www.getsentry.com/docs/tags/>`__ to assign to each event.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      tags: {git_commit: 'c0deb10c4'}
    }

whitelistUrls
-------------

The inverse of ``ignoreUrls``. Only report errors from whole urls matching a regex pattern or an exact string. ``whitelistUrls`` should match the url of your actual JavaScript files. It should match the url of your site if and only if you are inlining code inside ``<script>`` tags.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      whitelistUrls: [/getsentry\.com/, /cdn\.getsentry\.com/]
    }

ignoreErrors
------------

Very often, you will come across specific errors that are a result of something other than your application, or errors that you're completely not interested in. `ignoreErrors` is a list of these messages to be filtered out before being sent to Sentry as either regular expressions or strings.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      ignoreErrors: ['fb_xd_fragment']
    }

ignoreUrls
----------

The inverse of ``whitelistUrls`` and similar to ``ignoreErrors``, but will ignore errors from whole urls patching a regex pattern or an exact string.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      ignoreUrls: [/graph\.facebook\.com/, 'http://example.com/script2.js']
    }

includePaths
------------

An array of regex patterns to indicate which urls are a part of your app. All other frames will appear collapsed inside Sentry to make it easier to discern between frames that happened in your code vs other code. It'd be suggested to add the current page url, and the host for your CDN.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        includePaths: [/https?:\/\/getsentry\.com/, /https?:\/\/cdn\.getsentry\.com/]
    }

dataCallback
------------

A function that allows mutation of the data payload right before being sent to Sentry.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        dataCallback: function(data) {
          // do somethign to data
          return data;
        }
    }

shouldSendCallback
------------------

A callback function that allows you to apply your own filters to determine if the message should be sent to Sentry.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        shouldSendCallback: function(data) {
          return false;
        }
    }
