# TODO

Some features that can be added later to the library:

- [ ] Autoprefix class names in the HTML with the `atom--` string
- [ ] Minify the CSS
- [ ] Tree-shake the CSS
- [ ] Replace Twirl with something easier to work with
- [ ] Explore Web Components as a valid output type ([Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/intro))
- [ ] Local testing without resorting to frontend or apps
- [ ] Create dynamic resource bundles -- there may be a lot of redundancy between the JS/CSS of two different atom types
