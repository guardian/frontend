            Hello again …
        </h2>
        <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">
            … today we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And <span class="contributions__highlight"> unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall &ndash; we want to keep our journalism as open as we can</span>. So we think it’s fair to ask people who visit us often for their help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters &ndash; because it might well be your perspective, too.
        </p>
        <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">
            If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
