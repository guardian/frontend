                Since you’re here … we’ve got a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast.
                And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall &ndash;
                we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help.
                The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce.
                But we do it because we believe our perspective matters &ndash; because it might well be your perspective, too.

                If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
