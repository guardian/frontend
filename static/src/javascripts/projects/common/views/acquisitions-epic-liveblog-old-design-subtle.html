            … we’ve got a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast.
            And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall &ndash;
            we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help.
            The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce.
            But we do it because we believe our perspective matters &ndash; because it might well be your perspective, too.

            If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
            Get closer to the Guardian, be part of our story and <a href="<%=membershipUrl%>" target="_blank" class="u-underline">become a supporter</a>.
            Alternatively, you can <a href="<%=contributionUrl%>" target="_blank" class="u-underline">make a one-time contribution</a>.
