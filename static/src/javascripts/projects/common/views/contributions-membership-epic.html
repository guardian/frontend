        <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">... we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever. But far fewer are paying for it. And advertising revenues are falling
            fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian's independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we
            believe our perspective matters - because it might well be your perspective, too. </p>
