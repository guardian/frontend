But I'd add, tell everyone you know, who cares about the Liberty of the US to do the same. Facebook it, twitter it, make it go viral. When tens of millions are beating on the door, asking what are you going to do about this, there will be less chance of refusal.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24210266\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24211467\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">jodro</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T12:38:07Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370867887000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@GM Potts - Great article indeed. Thank you. May I suggest, Mr Ellsberg, that you and other American celebrities known for being active in protecting civil liberties, human rights, and democracy organise a long-distance vigil so that one or two celebrities is/are always physically present with Mr Ellsberg in Hong Kong? Otherwise I fear for the man's life.</p> \n<p>It would also be a way of keeping the attention on this subject. You are right in saying this is the most important leak in the US's history. The biggest danger is that people will get distracted again by the next big news story, and nothing will in the end happen, leaving the spooks and US executive free to carry on with their sinister business until any opportunity of reining them in has gone.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24211467\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24213120\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">jodro</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T13:32:28Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370871148000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@jodro - always physically present with <i>Mr Snowden</i> in Hong Kong... of course.

Any advice on how best to support Snowden and leverage the leaked information to achieve real change?</p> \n</blockquote> Wow, it is a good article. Of all the thousands of column inches already written, and that will be written on this affair, this, I suspect, will be the one article worth reading. \n<p>Its main strength comes because it it is difficult for ordinary people to appreciate why what Snowden has done is important. </p> \n<p>Ellsberg lays out very clearly for us why : </p> \n<p>- the US constitution, meant to protect the people, has been virtually suspended<br />- secret courts<br />- oversight &quot;co-opted by the agencies they supposedly monitor&quot;<br /><b>[&quot;as with issues of torture, kidnapping, detention, assassination by drones and death squads&quot;]</b></p> \n<p>When these kind of things happen, government by tyranny has already begun its slow creep towards ordinary people who think it is all in their best interests. People get extraordinarily rendited on the slimmest of evidence, whole villages are bombed, &quot;in our best interests&quot;, and because they are far away and the individuals characterised as oddballs and dangerous (by the people making them disappear), all is all right. For now. Till it is you. Or your nearest and dearest.</p> \n<p>When William Hague says, &quot;law abiding citizens have nothing to fear&quot;, you know that they should be very afraid. Those words should send a chill down your spine. the law is quietly being changed and undermined, as Ellsberg makes clear here.</p> \n<p>We owe Ellsberg a big thank you for this article, just as the Vietnamese and the parents of those being sent to their deaths in Vietnam are in his debt for the exposing of the hollowness of the reasons for that war.</p> \n<p>Daniel Ellsberg, Bradly Manning, Edward Snowden.

I thought we all know that by now. The US constitution is explicitly manipulated and not explicitly maintained. The Pentagon is effectively parliament. You have 'democracy', but you cannot really do anything to stop the Pentagon, and its propaganda.</p> \n<p>Read up on Noam Chomsky and Al Gore - they're not conspiracy theorists like the Alex Jones act we had to endure on the Sunday Politics. Effectively, you're free to have your view, but if you regularly exercise it, mobilise it, and organise it, you may as well be in China, or as you attest here - East Germany. </p> \n<p>America and western liberal democracies are forms of 'representative democracy', but certainly not very aspirational or democratic systems. Billions and billions of dollars are spent on defence and security projects that are deeply damaging and unnecessary. It's achieved through keeping people scared, divided, and above all ignorant with the propaganda machine.

It's astonishing that you are quite boldly asking someone what the viable alternatives to Fascism actually are right now. </p> \n<p>The central problem is power, and so the central solution must involve power. Unless people are prepared to challenge corporate power and the neoliberal agenda there is little alternative. Quite obviously we need an opposition and for that opposition to be politically organised, however, if there's no will from people in a democracy there is no way. Political representation only comes from organisation and if there's no political organising between people </p> \n<p>The argument - which you seem to be suggesting - that there is no alternative (to Corporate-Fascism) will certainly lead us to where-ever the corporations and the state want us to put - perhaps it may be corporate gulags, who knows?</p> \n<p>So, you asked me for an alternative. Well, my suggested alternative is for more democracy, and a greater demand and supply of what is in the self-interest of most individuals in the general public - and a very firm representation of those general interests by the state - rather than the continued very firm representation of the interests of private and powerful institutions. </p> \n<p>What's your suggestion?</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24217570\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24217707\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">baobab09</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T16:28:59Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370881739000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@artheart - </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>you're free to have your view, but if you regularly exercise it, mobilise it, and organise it, you may as well be in China, or as you attest here - East Germany</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the key point.

Do you ever get the feeling the two polars might be somehow connected? The lack of representation, the shallow acceptance, and the paranoia? The point I'm attempting to make is that the moderates, and those wanting to live in a vaguely social democratic settlement - do not seem intent on excusing themselves from the table of radical neoliberalism - in order to settle around another table and begin a different political dialogue. </p> \n<p>As a result; the only public and passionate opposition to what's going on is from alternative comedians, conspiracy theorists, and columnists in The Guardian, or The Independent. This is not a heathy position for a supposed democracy to be, and surely you agree? </p> \n<p>If so, for individuals - such as yourself - to suggest that other people who happen stray from the radical orthodoxy of corporate neoliberalism, and towards criticism - somehow - turns them into &quot;neo-Marxist conspiracy theorists&quot; - does absolutely nothing for the cause of the centre-left, or left-liberals, of which you claim association. Rather, it serves the interests and agendas of those at the other end of the spectrum, who want things to continue as they are, and to further feed paranoia and crazed conspiracies. </p> \n<p>That way lies America - and I think we're already too far in that direction, don't you?</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24218670\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24218928\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/12/29/TheLibrarianApe/80abb173-6fd3-4513-a4fe-9e802d274c1c/60x60.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">TheLibrarianApe</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T17:27:33Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370885253000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@artheart - </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>America and western liberal democracies are forms of 'representative democracy', but certainly not very aspirational or democratic systems.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That's the point.

If I can pick out just one of the things you said<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><br />to suggest that other people who happen stray from the radical orthodoxy of corporate neoliberalism, and towards criticism - somehow - turns them into &quot;neo-Marxist conspiracy theorists&quot;</p> \n</blockquote>– \n<p>Actually I pleased that people don’t like orthodox corporate neoliberalism. What I’m objecting to is the normalization of blatant untruths, for example the line I quoted from your first post.</p> \n<p>The</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>US (and the West generally) is effectively a military dictatorship </p> \n <p>No </p> \n</blockquote>it is not. The west is a series of imperfect but liberal democracies, sometimes getting stuff right, sometimes wrong. Pretending that it’s a dictatorship is insulting to people who suffer actual dictatorship and does nothing to advance any kind of social democracy. \n<p>Try this simple test: stand in the street and shout “This country is a military dictatorship”. If you are alive the next day, then it isn’t.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24219390\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24219514\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/12/31/brianboru1014/8ddf699a-7787-4b8c-b055-6ef1d5770906/60x60.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">brianboru1014</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T17:56:46Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370887006000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@artheart - </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I actually meant to write Gore Vidal, not Al Gore</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I gave you a recommend even though I wondered about Gore.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24219514\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24220488\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/06/10/4254042/7c6294c3-7042-42dc-8e32-95db7dd97f3f/60x60.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">artheart</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T18:45:33Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370889933000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@quak41 - </p> \n<p><br />You're quite correct, and I'm in full agreement. Chomsky too, and other critics, accept that the USA, and liberal democratic states, are highly free societies when compared to the vast majority of regimes across the world.</p> \n<p>However, the point is that the fundamentals are much the same: the public cannot meaningfully change or challenge things, and the public must be treated as cattle. Democracy is given to the herd but on the condition we don't properly run and organise it, i.e. genuinely bargain with powerful interests. The media and politicians have to act as the intermediaries between the stupid people and the intelligent elites, and the intermediaries largely support and perpetuate the interests of private business, rather than the public. </p> \n<p>In other words, we are afforded the important ability to speak truth to power, but we cannot meaningfully organise democracy to bargain with power and reach genuinely socially democratic settlements. Armed with only the former, and not the former, </p> \n<p>I don't believe this organisation of democracy has anything whatsoever to do with a conspiracy. However, it is to do with elites and what they consider to be efficiency. They don't want effectiveness, they want efficiency. They want a middle-class who are intelligent enough to get the work of industry, business and bureaucracy done, and a large group of labour who are manufactured as docile and apathetic as possible.</p> \n<p>This isn't ordered at the behest of shape-shifting lizards, people need to grow up, and properly engage. However, as I've outlined - the system isn't about engagement, or effectiveness, it's about efficiency and elites being given as much room as possible to do what they want, i.e. pursue power. </p> \n<p>And, as we all know - power corrupts. This is what we are witnessing, and, quite simply, we've got to do something about it.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24220488\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n        </ul>\n    \n</li>\n\n\t    \n\t        \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--top-level\n           \n           d-comment--has-replies\"\n    id=\"comment-24207813\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_00/03777a29-3911-42cb-930d-4598ea17fdad/60x60.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">Strummered</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T10:42:14Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370860934000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>.... &quot;The NSA, FBI and CIA have, with the new digital technology, surveillance powers that the Stasi in the former East Germany could only have dreamed of.

10 June 2013 11:55am<br />While we are mentioning books I can highly recommend Daniel Ellsberg's Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers.</p> \n<p>It is extremely relevant to the issues here and contains fascinating insights, such as the complete disdain of the administration for the public, the extent to which loyalty to your boss mattered far more than getting the issues right, the way groupthink slowly edges the system towards disaster and much, much more.</p> \n<p>Here he is on finding a way to suggest that the United States risked performing an act of outright aggression - that it would be in the wrong:<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I took care to tender that word not as a compelling, objective judgement or as my own. It expressed how our bombing a country that had made no overt attack against us would possibly be &quot;seen&quot; or condemned by <i>others</i>. There was no other way to get such a thought into official discussion internally even once and remain employed. </p> \n <p>I'm sure that's still true.</p> \n <p>The same holds for the words &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; applied to a policy that one's agency or the president might favor or has adopted.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>If you work in a bureacracy, toe the line, even when things start to give off a high, fishy odour.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24218331\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n        </ul>\n    \n</li>\n\n\t    \n\t        \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--top-level\n           \n           d-comment--has-replies\"\n    id=\"comment-24207861\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">samsite</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T10:43:21Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370861001000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>Obama said they've struck the right balance between security and privacy, so it must be OK then.</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24207861\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n        <ul class=\"d-thread\" data-responses=\"2\">\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24213362\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">inthebackseat</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T13:40:40Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370871640000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@samsite - I realise you're being ironic.

Must be conducted under very closed doors - the only reason political parties in Uzbekistan are allowed to discuss and criticize each other openly is because they are all selected and sponsored by the President's party.

While people of color make up about 30 percent of the US population, they account for 60 percent of those imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from 1970 to 2005, a rate that is outpacing crime and population rates. The incarceration rates disproportionately impact men of color: 1 in every 15 African American men and 1 in every 36 Hispanic men are incarcerated in comparison to 1 in every 106 white men. </p> \n<p>Consider as well a social system that propagates poverty and criminality in equal measure amongst ethnic or immigrant communities in America- and an outsourced prison system that explicitly profits from increased incarcerations. </p> \n<p>Consider also the widespread building of FEMA detention camps across America since 9/11, as yet unused, but for all intents and purposes capable of holding large numbers of people under military guard. </p> \n<p>There has been a coup both in America and indeed here, against the people and democracy of our countries- in the name of free market capitalism, corporate and political centralisation, and authoritarian control over the populations. Grassroots protest movements have no chance in this panopticon, everyone is already so convinced of how free and empowered they are, they don't notice that some chains needn't be shackled to your legs. We're entertained to the point of idiocy, we disconnect from our communities, we consume to feed a false sense of identity empowerment, all the while our countries have become corporate slave states. All our resources, wealth and prosperity is drained upwards into the hands of a few, international business owners and hedge funds, who arm themselves to the teeth against the prospect of popular revolt, monitoring the population to stifle any organic protest movement. </p> \n<p>Oh and I fully expect this comment to end up on a file in my permanent record.

Although far more likely to be stopped and searched than whites, black men are in fact statistically less likely to be found to be carrying illicit substances. They are also far more likely to be imprisoned for similar crimes than their white counterparts. The systemic racial biases in the system are well documented by now. A few examples (with sources provided) are given here:</p> \n<p><br />Note:<br />'<br />Black incarceration has exploded several times over, even while black crime has plummeted in the past twenty years (5). (And no, this is not because the incarceration itself has caused the black crime rate to plummet: crime has dropped just as much if not more in states with less punitive anti-crime tendencies) (6). Interestingly, while black and Latino crime, as a share of all crime is hardly different than in 1964, the share of persons incarcerated who are persons of color has risen from one-third to two-thirds in that period, while the share who are white has been cut in half (7).'</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24222809\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n                \n\n<li class=\"d-comment\n           d-comment--response\n           \n           \"\n    id=\"comment-24222909\">\n    <div class=\"d-comment__inner\">\n        \n        <div class=\"d-comment-header\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__media\">\n                <span class=\"d-comment__avatar-wrapper\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"d-comment__avatar\" width=\"36\" height=\"36\" /></span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d-comment__meta\">\n                <div>\n                    <span class=\"d-comment__author\">brianfp</span>\n                    \n                    \n                </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    \n                    <time class=\"d-meta-item d-comment__meta-item js-timestamp\"\n                          datetime=\"2013-06-10T20:58:04Z\" data-timestamp=\"1370897884000\">\n                        10 Jun 2013\n                    </time>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"d-comment__main\">\n            <div class=\"d-comment__body\">\n                \n                    <p>@AJQDuggan -<i> 'If black and hispanic men wish to stay out of jail they should not commit crime.

Although blacks and Latinos are ninety percent of persons incarcerated nationally for drugs, they represent only twenty-three percent of drug users, according to the most recent federal data. Meanwhile, whites, who are between seventy percent and three-fourths of users, comprise less than ten percent of those incarcerated for drugs (21). In all, black drug users are nearly twenty times more likely than anyone else to spend time in prison for their use, and in fifteen states, the rate of black incarceration for drug offenses is anywhere from 20-57 times greater than for whites, despite equal or greater rates of drug law violations by whites (22). Amazingly, when all other factors surrounding an arrest are the same, black cocaine offenders are twice as likely to be sent to prison and will serve, on average, forty months more than white offenders (23).</p>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n                <div class=\"d-comment__actions\">\n                    <div class=\"d-comment__actions__main\">\n                        <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/components/report-abuse/24222909\" class=\"d-comment__action d-comment__action--report\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            \n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    \n</li>\n\n            \n        </ul>\n    \n</li>\n\n\t    \n\t</ul>\n</div>\n",
