							"body":"<p>India's top court has issued a landmark verdict creating a third gender category that allows transgendered people to identify themselves as such on official documents.</p><p>Activists say it will give relief to millions of people who face discrimination in India's deeply conservative society.</p><p>The supreme court directed the federal and state governments to include transgendered people in all welfare programmes for the poor, including education, healthcare and jobs to help them overcome social and economic challenges.</p><p>Before Tuesday's judgment, transgendered Indians had to identify themselves as male or female in all official documents.</p><p>The court noted that it was the right of every human being to choose their gender while granting rights to those who identify themselves as neither male nor female.</p><p>\"All documents will now have a third category marked transgender. This verdict has come as a great relief for all of us. Today I am proud to be an Indian,\" said Laxmi Tripathi, a transgender activist who had petitioned the court.</p><p>The court's decision will apply to individuals who have acquired the physical characteristics of the opposite sex or present themselves in a way that does not correspond with their sex at birth.</p><p>\"The spirit of the [Indian] constitution is to provide equal opportunity to every citizen to grow and attain their potential, irrespective of caste, religion or gender,\" the court said in its order.</p><p>Recently, India's election commission for the first time allowed a third gender choice – \"other\" – on voter registration forms. The change was made in time for the national elections currently taking place.</p><p>Some 28,000 voters registered themselves in that category. Overall, there are an estimated 3 million transgender people in India.</p><p>Many transgendered people in India earn a living by singing and dancing at weddings and births, but others must resort to begging or prostitution.</p>",

							"headline":"Tory MP defends her role in Nigel Evans sexual assault case",
							"body":"<p>The Tory MP Sarah Wollaston has defended her decision to help two young parliamentary workers bring complaints of rape and sexual assault against former deputy speaker Nigel Evans, saying such serious allegations could not be laughed off or brushed aside.</p><p>Evans – who was last week cleared of all charges in court – initially claimed Wollaston \"decided to have it in\" for him, while fellow Tories have demanded she apologise and reflect on her role in the case.</p><p>But Wollaston said she had been left with no choice but to help the two men contact police after John Bercow, the Speaker, said he could not settle the matter through a disciplinary process and the Tory whips' office swept one of the allegations \"under the carpet\".</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10765503/Sarah-Wollaston-Why-am-I-being-blamed-for-Nigel-Evans-sex-case.html\" title=\"\">an article for the Telegraph website</a>, she expressed her shock at the \"rank hostility since Evans's acquittal, from those who seriously feel I should have done nothing\". She also revealed that she had offered to resign if the complainants felt that she had pressured them into doing so.</p><p>Speaking on BBC's Newsnight she said she had called the two men on Sunday and offered to step down.</p><p>\"I phoned them yesterday because I felt that it was very important … because this allegation had been made about me and my professionalism. I wanted to know if whether that is how they felt – it's how they felt about it that matters – and they were both very clear with me that they had not felt that I had pressured them.</p><p>\"But if they had said to me that they felt pressured or that I should step down then I would have done so.\"</p><p>But speaking on the same programme, former home office minister Ann Widdecombe said: \"I think the fact somebody makes the odd drunken pass does not make them a rapist, and I never believed the allegations that were made. </p><p>Widdecombe, who gave a testimonial during the Evans trial in which she said he was \"truthful, considerate, kind and gentle\", added: \"They've been through a proper process of trial and have been shown not to be sustained. </p><p>\"And I think there are now major questions to be answered, not least on the part of the CPS, because this is just the latest in a whole series of cases where high-profile people have faced not one charge but multiple charges and have then been acquitted on all of them.\" </p><p>In her Telegraph article, Wollaston also said the people who should really examine their conduct are those who have for so long ignored sexual harassment within Westminster, after a third of 70 researchers interviewed by Channel 4 News said they had experienced such problems.</p><p>\"The people who truly have questions to answer are those who have for so long turned a blind eye to the reports of such harassment,\" she said. \"I didn't, and don't, want to be one of them.\"</p><p>In a direct challenge to colleagues who questioned her role, she said: \"To them, I ask this: what would you do if, in a social setting, someone told you that they had been sexually assaulted by one of your most popular colleagues? Would you have laughed off the allegation, or brushed it aside? I did not.\"</p><p>Criticising what she called a backlash, she said: \"MPs should not use this case as a pretext to interfere with the independence of the CPS.</p><p>\"In particular, it would be completely wrong for politicians to respond to a colleague's experience by making it even harder for potential victims to come&nbsp;forward.\"</p><p>She added: \"Few cases make it to a courtroom and fewer still result in a conviction. Changing the rules on anonymity would slash reporting rates even further.\"</p><p>Evans initially criticised Wollaston in an interview over the weekend, but on Monday said she had been put in a difficult position and he did not blame her for her&nbsp;actions.</p><p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Evans denied he acted in any way inappropriately towards any of the complainants in the case, although his counsel during the trial invited the jury to consider whether the alleged incidents may simply have been inappropriate drunken passes or drunken overfamiliarity.</p><p>He also said he did not recognise an image of Westminster as full of drunken bad behaviour and sexual harassment. \"These headlines that have come forward, there have been times when I've had too much to drink – I absolutely do not doubt that,\" he said.</p><p>\"But the headlines that you hear, and indeed the accusations that were put towards you in court, sounded as if it was 365 days a year and I've got an optic above my bed. These are absolutely ridiculous … Now, I'm a social drinker, that's all I am.\"</p><p>As he pledged to help other men wrongly accused of sex offences, the Tory deputy speaker attacked his own party's cuts to legal aid, which mean he is £130,000 out of pocket after having hired a private lawyer to help clear his name.</p><p>Evans said he did not realise he would not get all his costs paid until the lawyer explained it, even though he presided over a debate on the coalition's new legislation, which capped the level of repayments for acquitted defendants to the level of legal aid fees.</p><p>The senior Tory portrayed chancellor George Osborne as \"smiling all the way to the bank\" because of VAT payments on the fees, and criticised the \"unintended consequences\" of the coalition's cuts which can \"break\" people.</p><p>As well as the attack on his party's own policy, Evans called for a fresh look at whether defendants in sex offence cases should get anonymity on the same level as people who \"sling mud\" against them.</p><p>The coalition pledged to look at this idea when it came to power but has dropped the plans amid concern about whether it would stop further victims of an alleged sex offender coming forward.</p><p>Evans said: \"The people who bring allegations have anonymity for the rest of their lives, yet those who are accused – it's not just if you're a celebrity, it could be anybody – they are not, their names are out there immediately. And it may well be that the [home affairs] committee could have a look at whether there should be some form of equanimity, whether it should be anonymity up to charge, up to trial, whatever it happens to be.\"</p>",

In a brief statement, the organisers said that it was \"with regret\" that they could confirm his name and age.</p><p>Berry collapsed at the finish, the statement said: \"He was taken to one of our medical facilities where he was treated by four consultants, including one in emergency medicine. He was transferred to St Mary's hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p><p>\"The organisers of the Virgin Money London Marathon would like to continue to express their sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr Berry and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with them all.\"</p><p>Late last night, after he had been identified, more than £23,000 had been raised on <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/Rob-Berry-uk\">his Justgiving page for the National Osteoporosis Society</a>.</p><p>In 2012, a 30-year-old runner, Claire Squires from Leicestershire, collapsed and died a mile from the finish.</p><p>An inquest in the following January said the most likely cause of her death was a dose of a then-legal performance-enhancing supplement with amphetamine-type effects.</p><p>Donations to Squires's chosen charity, the Samaritans, climbed from £500 to more than £1m.</p><p>More than 1,200 St John Ambulance volunteers assisted at this year's race. Runners were advised to keep well hydrated in the sunny conditions as temperatures rose to 16C.</p><p>Separately, police said that a woman from Sierra Leone who finished 20th in the race and then went missing has still not been found. Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, had been staying in Greenwich, south-east London, since arriving in the UK on 7 April.</p>",

							"headline":"Julian Wilson obituary",
							"body":"<p>If Peter O'Sullevan was for decades the voice of BBC television coverage of horse racing, its face for more than 30 years was the presenter Julian Wilson, who has died aged 73 of prostate cancer. With his immaculate appearance and patrician accent, Wilson's style seemed to underline the social stratification of racing, and he had forthright views on a variety of issues. Among these was the introduction in 1992 of Sunday racing, which Wilson vehemently opposed, prompting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/16/clement-freud-obituary\" title=\"\">Clement Freud</a> to observe: \"Like a member of the Flat Earth Society, his views were constant and advertised: change was not an option.\"</p><p>Familiar in the role of frontman, Wilson took over as commentator when O'Sullevan was away, and regularly covered segments of the Grand National \"out in the country\". From his position at Becher's Brook he called many famous runnings of the race, most dramatically in 1973, when he described the sensational performance of Crisp, eventually outrun by Red Rum. His exultant cry as Crisp approached Becher's second time round – \"I can't remember a horse so far ahead in the Grand National at this stage\" – remains an indelible element of the soundtrack of racing history.</p><p>Born in Sidmouth, Devon, Julian was the son of the Daily Mirror sports writer <a href=\"http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/the-giller-memorandum/bannister-and-peters-the-glory-and-grief-of-sport/\" title=\"Sports Journalists Association\">Peter Wilson</a>, the self-styled \"Man They Can't Gag\". At Harrow school he was a contemporary of John McCririck, who was to become the flamboyant betting pundit on Channel 4 Racing. \"He was my fag,\" claimed McCririck later, before adding, \"or was I his?\"</p><p>Whatever the niceties of the schoolboy relationship, years later McCririck was at the vanguard of what his former schoolmate perceived as the \"dumbing down\" of racing on television. \"For us,\" Wilson declared when the BBC called a halt to its racing coverage in 2012, \"racing was serious. We weren't interested in the gimmicks, people dressed up in purple suits, schoolboy humour.\" There was no doubting his target.</p><p>After Harrow, Wilson joined the Daily Mirror, where he worked until, in late 1965, the opportunity arose to join the BBC as racing correspondent following the departure of Peter Montague-Evans – a chance to make professional use of his extensive knowledge of a sport that he had followed since the age of nine.</p><p>From 800 applications six candidates were shortlisted – among them Michael Stoute, a young commentator freshly arrived in Britain from his native Barbados and soon to become a leading trainer – and a key part of the selection process involved going to Newbury racecourse for a paddock commentary, calling a race, and a piece to camera.</p><p>O'Sullevan later recalled how Stoute would have landed the job, \"had it not been for the pale young applicant whose lips moved as silently as a novice monk while he rehearsed his scene-set in the corner seat of a first-class carriage\".</p><p>Wilson's preparation paid off and he got the job, though his relationship with O'Sullevan soured when in 1981 Wilson declined a move to ITV on the grounds that O'Sullevan had assured him that he would soon be retiring, leaving the position of senior commentator open. In the event O'Sullevan did not retire until 1997, and a frustrated Wilson declared in his 1998 autobiography Some You Win: A Life in Racing that he felt \"betrayed\".</p><p>O'Sullevan describes that comment as \"surprising\" and the episode as \"a bit of a misunderstanding\". He said, \"When I'd told Julian that I would retire at the age of 65, I meant from writing rather than commentating. In any case, I never really thought of him as a natural commentator, though he was excellent as a presenter and served the BBC very well.\"</p><p>Increasingly impatient with what he perceived as the trivialisation of BBC racing coverage, Wilson stood down as racing correspondent at the end of 1997, shortly after O'Sullevan's own departure. He was succeeded by Clare Balding, with whom he had been sharing the presenting role since earlier that year.</p><p>Retirement from the front line of racing broadcasting gave Wilson the licence to be ever more forthright about what he saw as the decline of the best traditions and practices of racing, and in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/20/horseracing\" title=\"Julian Wilson in the Guardian\">trenchant piece</a> for the Guardian in May 2008 he made an unlikely comparison: \"There are times when the British Horseracing Authority, rulers of racing, must feel as isolated and beleaguered in their ivory tower as did the garrison at Rorke's Drift in 1879.</p><p>\"Students of the Anglo-Zulu war will recall that 139 gallant British soldiers defended the mission station heroically against 4,000 to 5,000 ferocious Zulu warriors. The incessant battery of commercial opportunists, predators, critics and legislators that threaten the financial health of British racing may be less substantial in terms of numbers, but their strategy and technique are light years ahead of the brave Zulus ... Racing is being driven by commercial realities that are not in the interest of the sport or its supporters.\"</p><p>Wilson's railing was informed with a deep love of the sport, which enhanced his experience as a racehorse owner, breeder, and racing manager to other owners. The most successful horse to carry his colours was Tumbledownwind, in whom he had a half share and who in 1977 won at Goodwood – a racecourse especially close to Wilson's heart – and the Gimcrack Stakes at York. Wilson commentated on the Gimcrack for Radio 2, and vividly recorded how once the starting stalls had opened, \"The next 1 minute 17.37 seconds were filled with hope, anticipation, concern, despair, reassurance and ultimately joyous triumph.\"</p><p>While Tumbledownwind was far from a true champion, he understandably has his place in Wilson's book 100 Greatest Racehorses (1987). He also produced Lester Piggott: The Pictorial Biography (1985) and The Racing World (1991), and elegant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julian-wilson\" title=\"Guardian: articles by Julian Wilson\">obituaries for the Guardian</a>. In retirement Wilson was able to spend more time indulging his twin passions of cricket and Swindon Town FC.</p><p>Wilson's marriage in 1970 to Carolyn Michael ended in divorce. He is survived by their son, Thomas, and his second wife, Alison Ramsay, whom he married in 1981 – the engagement ring reportedly financed by a 33-1 ante-post bet on Shergar, who won that year's Derby at 10-11.</p><p>• Julian David Bonhôte Wilson, racing presenter, born 21 June 1940; died 20 April 2014</p>",

							"body":"<p>The killing of activists protecting land rights and the environment has surged over the past decade, with nearly three times as many deaths in 2012 than 10 years previously, <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/deadlyenvironment/\">a new report</a> has found.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/deadlyenvironment/\">Deadly Environment</a>, an investigation by London-based Global Witness documents 147 recorded deaths in 2012, compared to 51 in 2002. Between 2002 and 2013, at least 908 activists were killed in 35 countries – with only 10 convictions. The death rate has risen in the past four years to an average of two activists a week, according to the report, which also documents 17 forced disappearances, all of whom are presumed dead.</p><p>Deaths in 2013 are likely to be higher than the 95 documented to date, the environmental rights organisation warned, with under-reporting and difficulties verifying killings in isolated areas in a number of African and Asian nations. Reports from countries including Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, and Myanmar, where civil society groups are weak and the regimes authoritarian, were not included in the Global Witness count.</p><p>\"Many of those facing threats are ordinary people opposing land grabs, mining operations and the industrial timber trade, often forced from their homes and severely threatened by environmental devastation,\" the report said. Others have been killed for protests over hydroelectric dams, pollution and wildlife conservation.</p><p>Brazil, the report found, is the world's most deadly country for communities defending natural resources, with 448 deaths between 2002 and 2013, followed by 109 in Honduras and Peru with 58. In Asia, the Philippines is the deadliest with 67, followed by Thailand at 16. More than 80% of the recorded deaths were in Latin and Central America.</p><p>There have been only 10 successful prosecutions connected with the killings in Brazil over the past 12 years. Isolete Wichinieski, national coordinator of the Brazilian group Commisão Pastoral da Terra, said: \"what feeds the violence is the impunity\".</p><p>The investigation unearthed information on perpetrators in just 294 of the 448 deaths, of which 54 were identified as police or military units.</p><p>In Brazil, the Amazon is the main frontier and most violent conflicts take place in newly deforested areas where communities are first confronted by illegal loggers, closely followed by cattle ranchers and soy bean farmers.</p><p>In Honduras, the second most dangerous country, 93 peasant farmers in the fertile Bajo Aguan region have been murdered since 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jan/07/honduras-dirty-war-clean-energy-palm-oil-biofuels\" title=\"\">amid land conflicts with agribusinesses</a> expanding African palms plantations that are traded globally on the lucrative carbon credits scheme.</p><p>But the murder of Brazilian ecologists José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and Maria do Espírito Santo in May 2011 suggests high-profile campaigners are not immune from the violence. Two assassins in this case were convicted.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434555548'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/4/14/1397488539862/Killing-of-land-rights-an-009.jpg' alt='Killing of land rights and the environment actvists in Brazil : Maria do Espirito Santo da Silva ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Laisa do Espirito Santo visits the graves of her sister Maria do Espírito Santo da Silva and brother-in-law José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva, rainforest activists who were murdered in Nova Ipixuna, Para, northern Brazil, on June 2011.

Yet those responsible almost always get away with it, because governments are failing to protect their citizens and the international community is not paying enough attention to their plight.\"</p><p>The insatiable global appetite for gold, silver and other minerals is powering extractive industries in countries with weak institutions, and is linked to at least 150 deaths since 2002. This includes 46 extrajudicial killings of demonstrators around mining sites across Peru. There were also deaths linked to protests against contamination, waste disposal and conservation of coastlines and wildlife.</p><p>Indigenous communities are particularly hard hit. Several in Guatemala and Honduras told the Guardian that they were unaware their territory has been sold until machinery and security guards working for mining or hydroelectric companies appeared overnight. Their resistance efforts have been denigrated as anti-development and dozens of community leaders face dubious criminal and civil charges.</p>",

Libya said it could not confirm the reports.</p><p>\"We are doing all we can to rescue the ambassador,\" said the government spokesman Ahmed Lamin.</p><p>The abduction comes two months after two Egyptian diplomats and four embassy staff were kidnapped by gunmen in Tripoli, and later released when Cairo freed a Libyan militia leader it was holding on suspicion of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Itan is a popular member of Tripoli's diplomatic community, and hours after the abduction Britain's ambassador, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HMAMichaelAron/status/456058524884549632\" title=\"\">Michael Aron, tweeted</a>: \"Strongly condemn kidnapping of Jordanian ambassador.

The original British embassy on a high bluff overlooking the port remains closed with staff relocated to a more secure city centre office block. \"Our security is kept under constant review,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman. \"We do not comment on security matters.\"</p><p>The attack comes with Libya's government in disarray. The newly installed prime minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, resigned on Sunday, citing a militia attack on his family, and the country's de facto head of state, the congress president Nuri Abu Sahmain, has left Libya, reportedly for medical treatment.</p><p>Prosectors are waiting to interview Abu Sahmain about a video in which he is seen, apparently detained, being accused by a militia leader of impropriety with two women at his home, a possible offence in the conservative Islamic country.</p><p>Royal Jordanian Airlines became the latest carrier to suspend flights to Libya on Tuesday following suspensions last month by British Airways, Al Italia, Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa after rockets struck Tripoli airport runway.</p><p>Congress is struggling to appoint a new government, with the majority of members no longer attending sessions, many complaining that parliament's mandate expired in February.

The NSC and CIA declined to comment, while the Pentagon did not respond.</p><p>The role of the squadron, and the use of its regular air force personnel in the CIA's targeted killing programme, first emerged during interviews with two former special forces drone operators for a new documentary film, Drone.</p><p>Brandon Bryant, a former US Predator operator, told the film he decided to speak out after <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/background-briefing-senior-administration-officials-presidents-speech-co\" title=\"\">senior officials in the Obama administration gave a briefing last year</a> in which they said they wanted to \"transfer\" control of the CIA's secret drones programme to the military.</p><p>Bryant said this was disingenuous because it was widely known in military circles that the US air force was already involved.</p><p>\"There is a lie hidden within that truth. And the lie is that it's always been the air force that has flown those missions. The CIA might be the customer but the air force has always flown it. A CIA label is just an excuse to not have to give up any information. That is all it has ever been.\"</p><p>Referring to the 17th squadron, another former drone operator, Michael Haas, added: \"It's pretty widely known [among personnel] that the CIA controls their mission.\"</p><p>Six other former drone operators who worked alongside the unit, and who have extensive knowledge of the drone programme, have since corroborated the claims. None of them were prepared to go on the record because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p><p>Bryant said public scrutiny of the programme had focused so far on the CIA rather than the military, and it was time to acknowledge the role of those who had been carrying out missions on behalf of the agency's civilian analysts.</p><p>\"Everyone talks about CIA over Pakistan, CIA double-tap, CIA over Yemen, CIA over Somalia. But I don't believe that they deserve the entirety of all that credit for the drone programme,\" he said. \"They might drive the missions; they might say that these are the objectives – accomplish it. They don't fly it.\"</p><p>Another former drone operator based at Creech said members of the 17th were obsessively secretive.</p><p>\"They don't hang out with anyone else. Once they got into the 17th and got upgraded operationally, they pretty much stopped talking to us. They would only hang out among themselves like a high school clique, a gang or something.\"</p><p>Shamsi said the revelations, if true, raised \"a host of additional pressing questions about the legal framework under which the targeted killing programme is carried out and the basis for the secrecy that continues to shroud it.\"</p><p>She added: \"It will come as a surprise to most Americans if the CIA is directing the military to carry out warlike activities. The agency should be collecting and analysing foreign intelligence, not presiding over a massive killing apparatus.</p><p>\"We don't know precisely what rules the CIA is operating under, but what we do know makes clear that it's not abiding by the laws that strictly limit extrajudicial killing both in and out of traditional battlefields. Now we have to ask whether the regular military is violating those laws as well, under the secrecy that the CIA wields as sword and shield over its killing activities.</p><p>\"Congressional hearings in the last year have made it embarrassingly clear that Congress has not exercised much oversight over the lethal programme.\"</p><p>In theory, the revelation could expose serving air force personnel to legal challenges based on their direct involvement in a programme that a UN special rapporteur and numerous other judicial experts are concerned may be wholly or partly in violation of international law.</p><p>Sitting 45 miles north-west of Las Vegas in the Mojave desert, Creech air force base has played a key role in the US drone programme since the 1990s.</p><p>The 432d wing oversees <a href=\"http://www.creech.af.mil/units/\" title=\"\">four conventional US air force Predator and Reaper squadrons</a>, which carry out surveillance missions and air strikes in Afghanistan.</p><p>There is another, far more secretive cluster of units within the wing called the 732nd Operations Group, which <a href=\"http://www.creech.af.mil/units/\" title=\"\">states that it \"employs remotely piloted aircraft in theatres across the globe year-round\".</a></p><p>This operations group has four drone squadrons, which all appear to be linked with the CIA.</p><p>The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron \"test-flies\" the RQ-170 Sentinel, the CIA's stealth drone which <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3743946.html\" title=\"\">made headlines after one was captured over Iran in December 2011</a>.</p><p>The 22nd and 867th Reconnaissance Squadrons each fly Reaper drones, the more heavily armed successor to the Predator.</p><p>But it is the last of the four units – the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron – that is now under the most scrutiny.</p><p>It is understood to have 300 air crew and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-seeks-to-expand-drone-fleet-officials-say/2012/10/18/01149a8c-1949-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html\" title=\"\">operates about 35 Predator drones</a> – enough to provide five or six simultaneous missions during any 24-hour period.</p><p>It operates from within an inner compound at Creech, which even visiting military VIPs are unable to access, say former base personnel. Former workers at Creech say the unit was treated as the \"crown jewels\" of the drone programme.</p><p>\"They wouldn't even let us walk by it, they were just so protective of it,\" said Haas, who for two years was a drone operator. He was also an operational trainer at Creech.</p><p>\"From what I was able to gather, it was pretty much confirmed they were flying missions almost exclusively in Pakistan with the intent to strike.\"</p><p>In the Operations Cell, which receives video feeds from every drone \"line\" in progress at Creech, mission co-ordinators from the 17th were kept segregated from all the others.</p><p>Established as a regular drone squadron in 2002, the unit transitioned to its new \"customer\" in 2004 at the same time that CIA drone strikes began in Pakistan, former personnel have said.</p><p>The operators receive their orders from civilian CIA analysts who ultimately decide whether – and against whom – to carry out a strike, according to one former mid-level drone commander.</p><p>Creech air force base would only confirm that the 17th squadron was engaged in \"global operations\".</p><p>\"The 732nd Operations Group oversees global operations of four squadrons – the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron, 22nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 30th Reconnaissance Squadron and the 867th Reconnaissance Squadron. These squadrons are all still active … their mission is to perform high-quality, persistent, multi-role intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in support of combatant commanders' needs.\"</p><p>Although the agency's drone strikes have killed a number of senior figures in al-Qaida and the Taliban, the CIA also stands accused by two United Nations investigators of possible war crimes for some of its activities in Pakistan. They are probing the targeting of rescuers and the bombing of a public funeral.</p><p>• <em>Tonje Schei's film Drone premieres on Arte on 15 April.</em></p><p><em>• Chris Woods is the author of Sudden Justice: America's Secret Drone Wars, which is published next winter in the US and Europe.</em></p>",

							"body":"<p>Work commitments are forcing parents to put children as young as four in school for eight hours a day, leaving ghost-like youngsters who are overtired and withdrawn, teachers have warned.</p><p>More than half of teachers and support staff believe children are spending less time with their parents than two years ago, according to a survey of 1,300 school staff by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL).</p><p>Mary Bousted, the ATL general secretary, said financial and work pressures were destroying families' work-life balance. \"We are the 'poor man of Europe' when it comes to unpaid overtime and more needs to be done to support families and children so that they can spend more time together,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's really important for children to have time to be children, to play with friends and spend time with their families. However, increasing living costs mean that for most families it is now unaffordable for only one parent to work.\"</p><p>Most of the teachers who believed that children spent less time with their parents put it down to work commitments, the increasing use of technology in the home and more time spent watching television.</p><p>An early-years teacher from a state school in North Yorkshire said some children were placed in before and after-school care from 8am to 6pm. \"These children walk around like ghosts, do not talk to anyone, fall asleep frequently, do not progress as quickly as their peers. Their parents are also 'too busy' to support them in an adequate way at home.\"</p><p>A primary school teacher in Bexley sympathised with parents, saying: \"I feel that, through no fault of the parents, there is an expectation to work before looking after your own family. Living costs mean it is unaffordable for only one parent to work, and there is less importance attached to bringing up children.\"</p><p>When questioned about the number of hours a young person should spend in timetabled education, 50% of education staff said five hours a day at primary school was enough, with 28% saying it should be less than five hours.</p><p>At secondary level, 38% of education staff said a six-hour day was suitable, while 45% said young people should spend no more than 5.5 hours a day in timetabled education.</p><p>Of the teachers who thought the timetabled day was too long, many said it caused tiredness among pupils (93%), damaged pupils' ability to concentrate (87%) and caused disruptive behaviour (67%).</p><p>The education minister Elizabeth Truss said last week action had been taken to allow schools to cater to younger children and to open longer to give families more flexibility.</p><p>But most teachers do not agree with recent government proposals for children to start school at an earlier age, according to the survey. About 70% of school staff said children should start school at five years or older, with only 24% believing the current school-starting age of four is suitable.</p><p>A senior teacher at a free school in Leicestershire said Britain needed to look at other European countries and learn from their results. \"Children start school at the age of seven and are ready to learn, their fine motor skills have developed and children are mature enough to understand the importance of learning.\"</p>",

The main challenge now is maintaining these standards, whatever the weather.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ed781189-f3ab-4979-a82c-3f9490d2b2a4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/11/1397226256875/a3e70a45-3f9a-443f-87ce-58a0e6b532df-460x30.jpeg\" alt=\"Beach guide key\" width=\"460\" height=\"30\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bathing quality at British beaches\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col1+from+1c2rEoXAJDaZvmrxnOlT5z5gPI4Vky0dMu0_hu7o6&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=54.230206362978245&amp;lng=-2.3687367499999255&amp;t=1&amp;z=6&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=TWO_COL_LAT_LNG\"></iframe> <figcaption>Beaches ranked by bathing quality around the UK by the <a href=\"http://www.goodbeachguide.co.uk/goodbeachguide-data\">Good Beach Guide</a>, compiled by the Marine Conservation Society</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In England, Cornwall and Devon had a high number of recommended beaches, apart from Instow Beach in north Devon which failed. Most beaches on the south, east and north-east coast were recommended, while those of the north-west coast were predominantly \"mandatory\", the second-lowest rating.</p><p>Wales was largely recommended, apart from beaches across north Wales which were mostly mandatory. Aberdyfi, Aberaeron South, Llanina and Broughton Bay failed. </p><p>Scotland's beaches were broadly divided between those in the Firth of Clyde on the west coast ranking mandatory, below the mostly recommended beaches of the east coast.</p><p>Beaches in Northern Ireland were largely recommended, except for Ballycastle, Ballyholme and Castlerock which were mandatory. No beaches in Scotland or Northern Ireland failed.</p><p>Wyatt added: \"Most people don’t realise what a big impact the weather can have on bathing water quality, but this has really been highlighted in the last few years. 2008, 2009 and 2012 were, according to the Met Office, amongst the wettest summers on record since 1910, and fewer UK bathing waters met minimum and higher water quality standards because of increased pollution running off rural and urban areas and overloaded sewers.”</p><p>The charity's guide, which has been running for 27 years, is based on water samples taken by central and local government agencies during mid-May and September.</p><p>From the end of 2015 onwards, UK beaches – where water quality has been improving over the long term – will be judged by <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/water_protection_management/co0018_en.htm\">a new, more stringent EU classification system</a>.</p>",
