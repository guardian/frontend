Lucky us, and, for the most part, lucky them. </p><p>But sometimes, things become too much, the pleasure in the show overidden by the uncomfortable tragedy of failure. Roughly, this is where we are with Alastair Cook.</p><p>A year ago, he wasn't simply an outstanding batsman but an epochal, barely believable phenomenon. Now, he is the subject either of ridicule, or a gentle, considered criticism that earnestly and tacitly acknowledges his decency, sympathising with the speed and intensity of his fall – which in some ways, is even worse.</p><p>And there is no sporting arena less forgiving than Test cricket. On the pitch and on camera for five days, nuances, airtime and erudite analysts make it impossible to obscure errors, the role of captain is more pronounced that in any sport. So it's not remotely tricky to enumerate yesterday's errors: allowing Jayawardene and Mathews - <i>Jayawardene </i>and <i>Mathews</i> – to play themselves in, not bowling Moeen with the old ball, not altering his new ball attack when it wasn't working, giving away free runs, not going at Mathews, setting defensive fields, and all the rest.</p><p>But even in Test cricket, the crucial aspect of captaincy is the same as in anything else: consistent excellence in your principal role. Currently, Cook is not worth his place in the team; were he not captain, he might already have been dropped, and relinquishing it might be the only way he can recover his form. Were Cook batting well, England would most likely win this match, his dismissal yesterday even more telling than one caused by a technical deficiency; the shot that caused him to drag on evidenced an impatient and frazzled man, precisely what he is not, but now is. </p><p>Whether he remains in his position after today remains to be seen. The ECB cannot intervene, given the extraordinary backing they gave him, but his confidence in his own ability to do the job is not obvious. A happy, equilibrious Cook does not use a press conference to argue with Shane Warne, remaining secure in the knowledge that imminent success will resolve things for him. </p><p><i>Alternatively,</i> Joe Root and Moeen Ali knock off the runs, England clinch the series sometime after tea, Cook relaxes, stops feeling for the ball outside off-stump and turning catches behind the wicket on the leg-side, punishes India, and we and he laugh at what nearly was. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T10:37:27.147+01:00\">at 10.37am BST</time></p>  </div>",

Let me kick off my tenure of this here live blog with what I, Jimmy Armfield and Graham Taylor like to call a “greeting”.  Hello, as we like to say.  And now let's look forward a little to the big match of the day, which, of course, England are not involving, Roy Hodgson having contrived to finish the Group of Death with a dead rubber.  So then, Italy v Uruguay for a place in the last 16: you have to say that's magnificent. </p><p>The Italian media have worked themselves up into a state of high agitation, with headlines  this morning such as “No more Kidding Around” and “No, We Must Not Return Home!”. TuttoSport reckon that “today is all about heart and character, we no longer have any alibi”, a theme that even manager Cesare Prandelli seems happy to take up, reminding his players that “We must remember that we are fighting for the motherland – we are the only ones representing Italy here.”   As for Uruguay, thanks to their wonderful garra charrua, they never need to be reminded to fight. “Three million of us are behind our team!” trumpets La Republica, who hail “the national team's exemplary behaviour so far, both individually and collectively.” Naturally they were saying exactly the same thing after the defeat to Costa Rica. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53a95622e4b082a9914c7370\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T11:44:19.450+01:00\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>That's it from me.</b> With day breaking and journalists waking up all over Brazil, I'm going to hand you over to Paul Doyle, who will be scouring the worldwide web to bring you news as they report it. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53a9531de4b0fbe286a71aa8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T11:41:52.005+01:00\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Yaya Touré attacks Manchester City again<br></h2><p>In the wake of his younger brother Ibrahim's death from cancer last week, Yaya Touré has used his column in France Football to launch another scathing attack on Manchester City, who he claims refused to allow him time off to spend time with his sibling in the wake of their title win. </p><p>\"I confess that I am still very sad,\" wrote Touré. \"I'm suffering because I feel I have done nothing useful for him the last few weeks. At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast. Except that City did not want to give me a few days. I went to celebrate the title championship in Abu Dhabi while my brother was in his sickbed. By fortune, Kolo was at his bedside.\"</p><p>In the wake of City's trip to Abnu Dhabi, Touré was widely criticised and ridiculed when his agent, Dimitri Seluk, suggested the player might leave the club because they had not shown him enough respect on the occasion of his birthday. At the time Touré confirmed what his agent said was true and said he would explain all in an interview after the World Cup. Following the death of his brother, however, he appears to have used his column to give his side of the story. <br></p><p>\"After that I blame myself for not insisting and for not leading them to respect me,\" he continued. \"However, club officials knew that I had been suffering for a few months seeing the health of my brother decline. This is the reason I had several injuries at the end of the season. Because my head had taken control of my body. These last four months have probably been the hardest in my life. I have had sporting success, except that when you get home and you find yourself facing the distress of someone you love, but you do not know how you can help, it's not good.\"</p><p>The Manchester Evening News reports that it is believed Touré didn't specifically request compassionate leave from City to be at his brother's bedside and points out that the club has a good record of accommodating players suffering from off-field problems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8207e46c-871f-448b-984c-b9f273499078\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/24/1403606477123/813e6afa-bf49-4038-acdd-4aaf5b016ecd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yaya Touré\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ivory Coast's midfielder Yaya Toure Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53a95101e4b0fbe286a71aa5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T11:26:44.472+01:00\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>And this week's Mexican hero is ...<br></h2><p>Having stolen the plaudits for his heroic display against Brazil last week, Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa has been usurped by his manager Miguel Herrera in the national (and internet) treasure stakes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/24/mexico-coach-miguel-herrera-world-cup-2014?CMP=twt_gu\">as Paul Campbell explains</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-88513579-0a52-450f-b15d-7bc1f1432407\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/24/1403605448366/d7b65282-e8b9-454f-9bff-ddb80161c4df-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Miguel Herrera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera looks pleased.

For the good of humanity, Alba didn't follow up on his threat but he did continue the argument later calling the journalist in question, Javier Gómez Matallanas, \"a grass\". Apparently, Matallanas had told Vicente del Bosque that Andres Iniesta had stolen Fernando Torres's calculator  when everyone knows that can't have been true because he was chemistry at the time and that's on the other side of the school from the geography classroom and anyway everyone knows that Matallanas just said that because Iniesta stole his girlfriend last year on the school trip to the train museum and didn't share any of his sweets on the coach back.

A return from Przysiezny is called out, but a challenge reveals it was in. Replay the point is the cry from the umpire! So they do. And this time Przysiezny sends a slice long, handing Hewitt a set point, which he takes by running round a forehand and whipping it down the line. Cue much fist-pumping and come-onning.

Well, he's never made much of an impression on grass and was chucked out in the first round by Lleyton Hewitt last year, while he was pulverised by Grigor Dmitrov at Queen's. Stan has a lot to do if he's going to be the man he was in Melbourne.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53a953eee4b0aa182837d333\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T11:34:25.888+01:00\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>I've just spotted Judy Murray outside Centre Court. </b>She was striding along quite purposefully.

Wimbledon hasn't been kind to them recently. Two years ago, there was the shock of seeing Nadal limp out in the second round to the the unheralded Lukas Rosol, who blasted him off Centre Court under the roof in a bravura performance late on a Thursday night, and the Spaniard didn't even get the past first round last year, losing in meek fashion to Steve Darcis, so who knows what to expect this time? The irrepressible force of nature who roared to yet another French Open or the under-powered version whose knees can't handle the slick grass against players he'd normally expect to swat away in his sleep? We'll find out soon enough. The muscles from Mallorca is on second on Centre Court against Slovakia's Martin Klizan, who will hope to pose him a question or two.</p><p>For Federer, there's the ignominy of a spot on Court 1 against Paolo Lorenzi. Again, it's hard to know what to expect from the seven-time champion. He went one better than Nadal last year but was stunned by Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round and recently lost in the fourth round of the French Open to Ernests Gulbis. But he likes grass. He likes it a lot. If it was legal to do so, you get the feeling Federer would marry grass, have little grass twins with it, live in a house made out of grass. But it's not legal to do that, so he hasn't, he's settled for winning a lot of trophies on it instead. Who wouldn't love to see Federer roll back the years one last time? </p><p>He'll have to wait for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to finish his match against Jurgen Melzer, who's hopefully feeling better than he was yesterday. What an enigma Tsonga is. He raced into a 5-0 lead after 15 minutes yesterday and had the first set wrapped up after 23, but then came the inevitable dip, the loss of the next two sets to a re-energised Melzer, Tsonga's erratic nature plaguing him again. The problem is not even he knows whether what's going to fly off his racquet will be a work of art or a piece of tennis vandalism. But he recovered sufficiently to win the fourth and was serving for the match at 5-4 in the fifth when the heavens opened. So he finds himself in the curious position of having to return this afternoon to win four more points to win the second round. </p><p>Elsewhere we have Stanislas Wawrinka, the Australian Open champion, in action against Portugal's Joao Sousa, Milos Raonic against Matthew Ebden and Richard Gasquet against James Duckworth.</p><p>We've also got two women's matches on Centre Court. Last year's runner-up, Sabine Lisicki, has hopefully wiped away the tears that flowed down her face during her defeat in the final to Marion Bartoli. The super-smiley German with the huge serve and the pounding groundstrokes is first up against Israel's Julia Glushko, while Serena Williams, who lost to Lisicki last year, is on third against her fellow American, Anna Tatishvili, who shouldn't delay her too long. Will Serena regain her title? She could. But the challengers are lining up. </p><p>Chief among them is Maria Sharapova, the 2004 champion. Having won the French Open, she will be in an airy mood and - sorry to say so - the Russian will expect to cruise past Britain's Samantha Murray on Court 1. Then there's the sublimely gifted Eugenie Bouchard, last on Court 1 against Daniela Hanutchova. The Canadian has some skill. She's one to watch. Could go far. Mark my words. </p><p>And finally, Heather Watson is in action against the unseeded Croatian, Ajla Tomljanovic. After various British disappointments yesterday, we could do with some PATRIOTIC PRIDE from Watson, who has been making great strides this year after a difficult spell. </p><p><b>Play begins at:</b> 11.30am on the outside courts, 1pm on the show courts.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-24T11:12:57.198+01:00\">at 11.12am BST</time></p>  </div>",

                    "headline": "Andy Murray begins Wimbledon defence with victory over David Goffin",
                    "body": "<p>So, only six matches to go and Andy Murray will be able to put himself through the torment of creating more tennis history at Wimbledon. Whatever his downbeat demeanour and whatever the pressure heaped on him by an expectant nation, he would not have it any other way.</p><p>The Scot began his defence of the title he won in such angst-riddled manner against Novak Djokovic a year ago with a largely untroubled 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 win over the elegant but underpowered and inconsistent Belgian David Goffin on Centre Court on Monday. It could hardly have gone more smoothly.</p><p>It took Murray a tick over two hours, less than he might have spent practising for it, to put away the world No105, and he hit his 28 clean winners with encouraging freedom and precision. There was no hint of discomfort from his back, which now seems to have just about healed after surgery nine months ago.</p><p>He struck eight aces, the last of them finishing the match, before he cast a quick glance towards his box where his new coach, Amélie Mauresmo, looked down approvingly. She might prove to be an inspired choice, although quite what the 1977 champion, Virginia Wade, thought of it was more than likely of little interest to the Murray camp.</p><p>The player and his advisers – including Mauresmo possibly, although she will not be drawn on the subject – were not best pleased with Wade’s gratuitous observation at the weekend that the Frenchwoman was “a little fragile mentally”. Even if that were a valid observation of some of Mauresmo’s playing career, especially when playing in front of her home audience, Murray offered a ringing counterpoint when he said it was just such experiences that would make her the right person to advise him, having gone through all those frustrations and doubts.</p><p>It is not as if it is a crime to suffer in sport. Failing and having doubts, as Rafael Nadal has pointed out many times after losing, are part of life. Murray knows, too, that he does not live in some perfect bubble.</p><p>Still, he was happy and maybe a bit relieved to get that first match out of the way. It will settle his nerves for bigger challenges to come, even if he is unlikely to meet much stiffer resistance in the second round on Wednesday, when he meets Blaz Rola, a left-handed Slovenian of modest accomplishments and glorious moniker. Rola beat the Spaniard Pablo Andújar 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 in 101 minutes, clearly going for his shots, with 35 winners and 35 unforced errors. He also hit four aces and four double-faults. That is revealing symmetry. This is not a man of half-measures.</p><p>The 23-year-old Rola comes from the modern mould: 6ft 4in and 175lb of lean power. He is ranked 92 in the world and spent his formative years in the American college system.</p><p>He beat Britain’s Daniel Smethurst (on court here on Tuesday against the American John Isner) in qualifying at Eastbourne last week, having lost to James Ward in straight sets at Queen’s and beaten the Londoner in the French Open.</p><p>But Rola comes with baggage, too, having retired with a knee injury when trailing 2-6, 1-3 in the first round against the Argentinian Carlos Berlocq at Eastbourne. If he is in any way fragile – mentally or physically – Murray will find him out on grass that is still fresh and tricky.</p><p>As for Murray’s state of mind, he seems just fine. For all the nonsense that swirls about him, he has learned the art of compartmentalising the various strands of his life. When asked on Monday about his recent stint as editor of the Beano, he pointed out: “Those are the sort of things that come up around this time of year for me.”</p><p>The 27-year-old champion was relaxed enough to elaborate: “That was a magazine that I read a lot when I was a kid. I was a bit like Dennis [the Menace] probably. I wasn’t particularly well behaved when I was a kid. My mum would definitely say that.”</p><p>Well, he was pretty well behaved despatching Goffin who looks young enough to be still reading the Beano. From the moment Murray broke him in the second game of the match until he saved two break points towards the end of the third set, he was in command. It was an efficient, cool performance.</p><p>For Goffin, his debut on Centre Court cannot have been that pleasant, given he often put himself into promising positions only to waste the opportunities because of his inability to adjust to the skidding ball on the slick grass.</p><p>With groundstrokes looser than Wade’s tongue, Goffin struggled to maintain a rally worth the name in the first 12 minutes, which is when 10 of his 28 unforced errors arrived, and that was way too much of a start to give a player as ruthless as the defending champion.</p>",

              "headline": "Aaron Finch’s century gives Yorkshire dominance over Warwickshire",
              "body": "<p>The Australian Aaron Finch struck only the third first-class hundred of his career to boost his Test claims and manoeuvre the joint County Championship leaders Yorkshire into a dominant position at Edgbaston, as they made 422 in reply to Warwickshire’s 228.</p><p>Finch snubbed better financial offers from around the shires to join Yorkshire as they promised him championship exposure during the New Zealander Kane Williamson’s absence. The 27-year-old wants to build a case for inclusion on next summer’s Ashes tour but arrived here with poor pedigree in red ball cricket.</p><p>An average of just 27 does an injustice to his ability. Although he possesses the hands of a woodcutter not a surgeon, there are few better ball strikers around the globe as his No1 international Twenty20 ranking testifies and two significant changes to his game since he arrived from the Indian Premier League last month appear to have been beneficial.</p><p>A tightening of his technique and a drop down the order from the opening spot he occupied for Victoria before being axed from their Sheffield Shield team last winter have seen an improvement in results. He was dismissed for nought in that final match of 2013-14 as New South Wales reduced their opponents to nine for six, but he views his future as a middle-order player, and came into this contest with scores of 34, 63, 45 and three behind him.</p><p>Here, he moved up another level to significantly develop the advantage the away side held after arriving at the crease at 150 for four, just 78 runs shy of Warwickshire’s first-innings effort. By lunch the deficit was in the teens with Finch already showing his penchant for launching the ball aerially. Having survived a sharp chance to short leg off Jeetan Patel on 24, he deposited the New Zealand spinner for a straight six on the eve of the interval.</p><p>His third six, a thump over extra-cover off the left-armer Keith Barker, landed 17 rows back in the recently built West Stand, during the over in which he celebrated three figures with a gladiatorial swish of his bat and kiss of the Yorkshire emblem. It came during his second significant stand of the innings. Having put on 92 with Jonny Bairstow, he then shared a 123-run alliance with Richard Pyrah.</p><p>“It’s a great place to be a part of and I am very grateful for the opportunity to play some four-day cricket,” said Finch. “I have been given it on the back of a couple of very poor seasons for Victoria, and hopefully I can keep scoring runs.</p><p>“My technique has changed slightly for the better. They might be very minor changes but they seem to have made a big difference. Over the last 12 months I have played a lot of one-day and Twenty20 cricket and you fall into some movement patterns – because the ball doesn’t move off the seam as significantly or for as long – across your crease to create scoring opportunities on both sides of the wicket.</p><p>“It is about getting back to basics and looking down the ground a bit more often and that seems to be working at the moment. I feel like I am in control, not falling over, playing straight, a lot more balanced and in a better position.”</p><p>Finch has been called back for a Cricket Australia camp at the end of July although Yorkshire, who signed him on the recommendation of Australia’s coach, Darren Lehmann, are considering making a request for special dispensation.</p><p>Warwickshire finally snared him for 110 when the wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose hauled down a top-edged pull at full stretch. In fact, cross-bat shots were a feature of several Yorkshire dismissals: captain Andrew Gale skied a Chris Wright bumper while Bairstow played on pulling at Boyd Rankin and Ryan Sidebottom swished fatally outside off stump.</p><p>Any chance of Warwickshire wresting the momentum went during an awful opening to the second morning when, with Chris Woakes surprisingly overlooked, Rankin and Wright served up seven boundaries in the first 19 deliveries.</p>",
