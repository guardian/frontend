              "body": "<p>George Osborne will use his Mansion House speech on Thursday to give City regulators the power to cap risky mortgage loans in a bid to allay fears of a growing housing bubble.</p><p>In a dramatic move, the chancellor plans to allow the Bank of England to limit mortgage loans that could undermine the financial stability of the UK housing market.</p><p>In a bid to show he is taking action to boost the supply of homes, Osborne will also say he is making changes to the planning regime that could see a further 200,000 homes built.</p><p>The new rules will allow the Bank of England to set a maximum multiple of income that homebuyers can borrow and prevent mortgage lenders from offering first-time buyers high loan to value mortgages.</p><p>Osborne has come under intense pressure to take the heat out of the housing market over recent months as figures showed average prices rising by more than 10% over the last year and by more than 16% in London and the south east.</p><p>City regulators have already strengthened mortgage lending rules with stricter affordablity tests and restricted a government-backed credit scheme aimed boosting lending to business customers only.</p><p>This latest move gives the central bank draconian powers to prevent excessive lending and is likely to be seen in the City as a return to more draconian 1970s-style credit controls.</p><p></p><p>Speaking a head of his speech Osborne said: \"Our economic plan has brought stability and security and I'm not going to let anything undermine that. So I am acting against future risks in the housing market by today giving the Bank of England new powers to intervene and control the size of mortgages compared to family incomes and house values and I'm also taking new steps so we build many more homes in our towns and cities.\"</p><p>But Osborne will stop short of proposals outlined on radio this morning by business secretary Vince Cable. He suggested a mortgage cap set at 3.5 times a mortgage applicant's income.</p>",

Iraqi Kurds enjoy a large degree of autonomy and self-government in the north-east but have long coveted Kirkuk, a city with huge oil reserves which they regard as their historical capital.</p><p>In Kirkuk, truckloads of peshmerga fighters patrolled the streets, but sporadic clashes continued between Kurdish forces and Isis gunmen on the outskirts of the city. A Kurdish minister responsible for regional security forces survived a bomb blast as he drove to the city after visiting peshmerga units in the surrounding region, AFP reported. Since Tuesday, black-clad Isis fighters have seized Iraq's second biggest city, Mosul, and Tikrit, hometown of the former dictator Saddam Hussein, as well as other towns and cities north of Baghdad. They continued their lightning advance on Thursday, moving into towns just an hour's drive from the capital.</p><p>About 500,000 people have fled Mosul, home to 2 million, and the surrounding province, many seeking safety in autonomous Kurdistan.</p><p>Isis's spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, said on Thursday that the group's fighters intended to take the southern cities of Kerbala and Najaf, which hold two of the holiest shrines for Shia Muslims.</p><p>US officials have said they are considering ways to help the Iraqi government even as it emerged that the Obama administration had rebuffed a secret request from the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to bomb Isis positions.</p><p>Reports from Iraq have painted a confused picture of a rapidly developing situation with fighting reported in a number of key locations on Wednesday night and on Thursday, including on the outskirts of the city of Samarra, where government officials said Isis fighters had been driven back.</p><p>According to Army Staff Lieutenant General Sabah al-Fatlawi, quoted by Agence France-Presse, \"elite forces\" backed by air strikes pushed back a \"fierce attack by Isis fighters who then bypassed the city heading towards Baghdad\".</p><p>Complicating the picture of the past few days were emerging suggestions that other Sunni insurgent groups, including Ba'ath nationalists, supporters of the executed Saddam, had played a role in the series of stunning setbacks for the Iraqi military.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/11/mosul-isis-gunmen-middle-east-states\" title=\"\">The sudden collapse of the Iraqi army</a> has raised international concerns about a rapidly widening regional crisis that has implications for Iraq's powerful neighbours, Iran and Turkey.</p><p>Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, warned in a televised address on Thursday that Iran would combat the \"violence and terrorism\" of Sunni extremists in Iraq. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, offered Iran's support for Iraq's \"fight against terrorism\" during a phone call with his Iraqi counterpart, Iranian state TV reported.</p><p>In Baghdad residents described panic buying and rising fear.</p><p>A meeting of MPs called by Maliki to vote on introducing an emergency law was cancelled after insufficient MPs attended.</p><p>The Iraqi leader – a Shia whose authoritarian and sectarian policies have been blamed by many as the root cause of the country's crisis – is trying to hold on to power after indecisive elections in April. The mounting sense of anxiety in the capital followed a statement by a spokesman for Isis who said the group had scores to settle with Maliki's government.</p><p>Hundreds of young men crowded in front of the main army recruiting centre in Baghdad on Thursday after authorities urged Iraqis to help battle the insurgents.</p><p>The army of the Shia-led government in Baghdad has essentially fled in the face of the onslaught, abandoning buildings and weapons to the fighters who aim to create a strict Sunni caliphate on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border.</p><p>In Tikrit, militants have set up military councils to run the towns they captured, residents said. \"They came in hundreds to my town and said they are not here for blood or revenge but they seek reforms and to impose justice,\" said a tribal figure from the town of Alam, north of Tikrit. \"They picked a retired general to run the town. 'Our final destination will be Baghdad, the decisive battle will be there,' that's what their leader of the militants group kept repeating.\"</p>",

We also need to make sure this becomes the international community’s priority. Northern Iraq cannot be left to cope with these crises on its own.</p><p>Save the Children is stepping up its response, distributing food, water and hygiene kits to the displaced people, and providing child protection services, including child-friendly spaces where children suffering from trauma, injuries, survivors of abuse, exploitation and neglect or who have been separated from their parents will be helped with additional services.</p></blockquote><p>The New York-based  International Rescue Committee:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The International Rescue Committee is deeply concerned by the events now unfolding in Mosul and elsewhere in Iraq. We are closely monitoring displacement and assessing how this affects both the ongoing existing problems for internally displaced Iraqis fleeing violence, as well as the impact on Syrian refugees in Iraq. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq, beyond the headlines of violent attacks, can no longer be ignored.</p><p>The potential toxic brew of two neighboring countries in such a volatile region imploding has grave humanitarian consequences. At the beginning of this year Iraq had a million internally displaced people and over 200 000 refugees. Since then almost 480,000 additional individuals have been displaced from Anbar alone and now, an estimated 500,000 people are fleeing Mosul. </p><p>Humanitarian organizations like the IRC are already meeting the needs of hundreds of thousands of displaced in Iraq, but funding is critically low; the refugee appeal is only 18% funded and the IDP appeal, at less than 10% funded.

They have been massing more forces since yesterday. The [insurgent] fighters reached Kirkuk's edges yesterday but they did not try to sweep to the city centre. This move by the fighters has alarmed the peshmerga forces and made them call up more numbers.</p><p>The new forces are deploying along Kirkuk's borders and they have reached the Kirkuk irrigation project at the north side of the province. I just got back home after a trip to the city centre. The centre is full of peshmaraga patrols. They are moving the military equipment of the Iraqi army's 12th brigade to Sulaimaniyia and Irbil provinces. This military brigade was too far away  and they could not get any closer; that is why it fell to the peshmerga. </p><p>The fighters are mainly at Hawija town in Kirkuk, which is predominantly inhabited by Arab tribes. The military forces have no control on this town, nor on the peshmerga. The fighters in this town did not advance to the city centre – they might have another tactic and they did not want to clash with the Kurds now.</p><p>It seems that Kirkuk city is not in fighters' calculations. The Turkman community are upset that the Kurds are making use of the situation to control the city. As a local Arab man in Kirkuk, I have to say that the Kurds are benefiting a lot of the current crisis  but I can also understand the wisdom behind leaving Kirkuk now to them.</p><p>Yesterday evening the fighters liberated 47th battalion, which is part of 12th brigade, near Hawija town. Soon after the peshmerga moved their equipment to deal with fighters who were massing  there but they sustained heavy losses and retreated. They tried today again but the resistance by the fighters was even tougher as they made use of the armoured vehicles that belong to the battalion to combat peshemrga fire.</p><p>We are all in state of alert. A curfew has been declared,  from 11pm to 6am. There is an abnormal situation in the city. People are stockpiling food in panic and the prices jumped up at once. You can see queues of cars at fuel pumps.</p><p> No one is leaving the city, we are receiving families from Hawija town, Mosul and Tikrit. People are worried about the government expecting reaction. All the Arab community in Kirkuk  support the fighters and the revolution to liberate Iraq but we do not want... to be part of a deal between the Kurds and Maliki. In order to get rid of the fighters, Maliki would let the Kurds take Kirkuk to get their support.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5399bd31e4b076bb7c59ca83\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-12T15:49:14.015+01:00\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has released this video of the chaotic and gridlocked scenes as huge numbers of people try to feel Mosul, by car, truck or on foot.

These segments are relatively long but fascinating, so I'm quoting them in full.<br></p><h2>Taher Hassan, 40 year-old father of six, car dealer in Samara </h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Two days before the liberation of Mosul, fighters showed up in Samara and took control of the city - every part but the military command near the holy shrines in Samara. All the local police forces have pulled out of their bases in the city. The fighters are negotiating with the tribes who are in charge of the two shrines so they can try to convince army forces near the shrine to hand themselves over without a fight. </p><p>Everyone in Samara is happy with the fighters’ management of the city. They have proved to be professional and competent. We have water and power; there is a shortage in fuel because Maliki’s forces have cut the bridges between Samara and Baghdad. The fighters themselves did not harm or kill anyone as they swept forward. Any man who hands over his arm is safe, whatever his background. This attitude is giving a huge comfort to people here. </p><p>Four days ago, Maliki’s military dirty force raided Al-Razaq mosque in the city, brought a few locals whom they picked up from different parts in Samara and killed them in the mosque. What do you think the people feeling would be towards these military forces? We have lived enough years of injustice, revenge and tyranny and we can’t stand any more.</p><p>We as Sunni people have never been treated fairly by Maliki’s fanatic government and army. If it were not a sectarian army, it would have fought to the end but they fled as soon as things got serious. A friend of mine, a shopkeeper in Samara, told me the army and police have bought more than 1000 dishdash [a smock worn commonly by men in Iraq] to prepare themselves to flee in civil clothes in case they are cornered by rebels. The army’s main interest is money – most of them are militiamen not professional soldiers. </p><p>I have not seen any Isis fighters in the city. The entire resistance is now formed of local Samara men - mainly fighters with Izzat Al-Douri [Saddam Hussein’s vice president] groups, a few ex-military officers and a few others with Al-Naqashabandiyia. They are all fighting together now to reach Baghdad. These fighters have taken the weapons of the military bases without any fight in Tikrit and Mosul and can fight for years not for days.</p></blockquote><h2>Dr Ali Abu Tiba, media coordinator for Al-Naqshabandiyia Resistance Movement in Mosul</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The situation in Mosul now is stable and quiet. There are no armed indications in the city at all, you might see two or four fighters at the main entrances of the city but not inside. Life is so normal in Mosul. Our fighters are advancing towards Baghdad without any significant resistance by the military forces. All  we are doing is negotiating with the army and police commanders, as well as tribes leaders, and they are coming over to our side.</p><p>The fight now is in the Baghdad suburbs, near the Al Taji district. We have prepared enough men and arms and been waiting for this day for more then 10 years now. All the fighters are Iraqis from different parts of Iraq, in addition to senior military leaders who are lading the battles and setting up our successful plans. This is the reason why we are advancing further day by day. </p><p>It is not true that Kirkuk is under the control of the Kurdish Peshmerga. We have no intention of opening a front with them now. We know that once we declare the liberation of Baghdad, Kirkuk can be sorted afterwards. Our main target now is Baghdad and that battle has started.</p><p>We are prepared for any attack by Maliki’s collapsed forces or the Americans. We have pilots who are ready to fight and can attack any spot in Iraq. Four airports have been liberated so far in Mosul and near Samara and their planes are confiscated.</p><p>We have declared a general amnesty to anyone, including military forces, who have handed their weapons in and volunteered to fight with us. We are not coperating with Isis in Syria - all media reports claiming we have are baseless. Still we welcome any one who wants to fight even if they are members of Isis.</p></blockquote><h2>Abu Riyad, 50 years old, tribal leader in Mosul city</h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I live in Hay Al Nour in Mosul on the left bank of the Tigris. I’m the head of a big tribe in Mosul - more than 35 members of my family live in the same neighbourhood. Not one of us has left our home.</p><p>For two days now, after the fighters took our neighbourhood, the army forces have not fought back. They left their weapons behind. </p><p>It seems the fighters have a good security plan for the city. They really know the nature of the city and have not made the same mistakes as the US forces, or Maliki’s forces, when they invaded Mosul. They are protecting all the governmental buildings in the city and have not destroyed or stolen anything. They haven’t harmed a person in the city. </p><p>[Isis] fighters have opened and cleared out all the bridges, roads and checkpoints set up by the army. Now, we can move easily. It is so quiet here – not a bullet has been fired so far. Most of the families who fled the city began to head back today. We have suffered a lot under Maliki’s unfair government. It is a sectarian Iranian government. Detention, killing and displacement against the people of Mosul has not stopped for ten years. We’ve had enough injustice and corruption and no longer accept Maliki’s army. Since the US invasion until now, an organised ethnic cleansing was taking place here. Maliki’s men would show up on TV revealing their love to peace and security but the reality is completely different. They are all killers, fanatic and sectarians.</p><p>All the fighters who are in control of our neighbourhood now – or at least those I have encountered – are Iraqis and well trained.</p><p>Last Thursday, the fighters attacked the right bank of the Tigris river.

If Isis had pre-positioned forces, then these forces likely now occupy their current target zones, which would allow the ISIS advance to continue.</p><p><br>If instead Isis is seizing a city and establishing a leave-behind force while the assault force manoeuvres, then the offensive is likely to culminate before it reaches Baghdad, depending on the nature of the force left behind. Is Isis forming relationships with local tribes to help hold their newly acquired cities? Are recently released prisoners with little training part of that force? To what extent has Isis made common cause with the Ba‘athist forces under former Saddam General Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri and theJaysh Rijal al-Tariqa al-Naqshabandia (JRTN)? Reports indicate that JRTN forces and al-Douri supporters are active in Mosul and Tikrit, but we are not able to assess the extent of this activity with any confidence at this point.</p><p><br>It should be possible to assess in the next 24-48 hours whether the current Isis offensive will continue uninterrupted or whether there will instead be a pause while ISIS regroups and consolidates. The level of activity in the areas northwest and southwest of Baghdad will likely be the most important indicator to watch.</p></blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5399753fe4b076bb7c59ca10\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-12T10:55:31.437+01:00\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kurdish peshmerga forces are filling a vacuum left by fleeing Iraqi troops near Kirkuk, writes Fazel Hawramy in Irbil.<br></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A peshmerga fighter who has been stationed at the Kaywan Iraqi army base, outside Kirkuk, since yesterday confirmed to the Guardian that Kurds hold the area.</p><p>He said: \"Kaywan is full of peshmerga forces but everything has already been taken.

As the moderates in Syria have been pushed aside, so too have their comrades in Iraq.</i></li><li><b>The policies of Prime Minister  Nouri al-Maliki. </b><i>Maliki is a militant sectarian to the core, and he had been fighting on behalf of Iraq’s long-suppressed Shia majority for years before the Americans arrived, in 2003 ... In the two and a half years since the Americans’ departure, Maliki has centralized power within his own circle, cut the Sunnis out of political power, and unleashed a wave of arrests and repression. Maliki’s march to authoritarian rule has fueled the re-emergence of the Sunni insurgency directly. With nowhere else to go, Iraq’s Sunnis are turning, once again, to the extremists to protect them.</i><br></li><li><b>The US left before they replaced the state they crushed. </b><i>For many months, the Obama and Maliki governments talked about keeping a residual force of American troops in Iraq, who would act largely to train Iraq’s Army and to provide intelligence against Sunni insurgents. (They would almost certainly have been barred from fighting.) Those were important reasons to stay, but the most important went largely unstated: it was to continue to act as a restraint on Maliki’s sectarian impulses, at least until the Iraqi political system was strong enough to contain him on its own. The negotiations between Obama and Maliki fell apart, in no small measure because of a lack of engagement by the White House. Today, many Iraqis, including some close to Maliki, say that a small force of American soldiers—working in non-combat roles—would have provided a crucial stabilizing factor that is now missing from Iraq. Sami al-Askari, a Maliki confidant, told me for my article this spring, “If you had a few hundred here, not even a few thousand, they would be co-operating with you, and they would become your partners.” President Obama wanted the Americans to come home, and Maliki didn’t particularly want them to stay.</i></li></ol> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-12T08:00:06.949+01:00\">at 8.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53994386e4b0bc906f6b5eaa\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-12T07:17:22.506+01:00\">7.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I'm going to hand over to Matthew Weaver in London now.

                    "body": "<h2>Iraqi armed forces</h2><p>After Iraq's armed forces were disbanded following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/08/usa.iraq1\" title=\"\">the United States</a> and its allies committed more than $25bn to training and building a new military. With more than 250,000 frontline troops (not counting paramilitary police units), on paper at least the Iraqi military should be effective. It is equipped with almost 400 tanks including US M1A1s and Russian T- series tanks including the T-72. It also has more than 2,500 armoured fighting vehicles and 278 aircraft, including drones, transport aircraft, amphibious aircraft and 129 helicopters.</p><p>But despite its manpower and equipment – and the huge sums invested in it – the Iraqi military has suffered constant problems with combat readiness at battalion level while struggling to attract sufficient recruits to maintain effectiveness, particularly in key areas such as training. As the security environment in Iraq has steadily worsened, the government under the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has tended to concentrate elite units in the capital, while recent operations in the west on the Syrian border and around Falluja and Ramadi have suggested both serious political and operational shortcomings. The collapse of an estimated 30,000 forces in and around Mosul underlined a lack of morale and an apparently chaotic chain of command.</p><h2>Isis</h2><p>Estimates put the fighting strength of Isis in Syria and Iraq at around 7,000 but its numbers in Iraq appear to have been bolstered by other groups, including local Sunni militants and Ba'ath nationalists particularly in Tikrit. Despite claims that they have captured helicopters in Mosul, it seems unlikely they would be able to deploy them. Lightly armed with Toyota pickup technicals, RPGs and small arms, Isis has captured some armoured Humvees, although there are suggestions that some equipment has been sent back to Syria. While they have been able to operate easily in largely Sunni areas where they have some support from a population angry and alienated from the Shia-led government in Baghdad, the capital is a different proposition. One district alone, Sadr City, has a Shia population of some 1 million and since the sectarian war that ended in 2008, the sprawling suburbs have been divided along sectarian lines with checkpoints and barriers.</p><h2>Peshmerga</h2><p>Although some 35,000 Kurdish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/iraq-kurdistan-maliki-barzani\" title=\"\">peshmerga</a> are incorporated into the Iraqi security forces, other peshmerga remain outside with published estimates varying from 80,000 to three times that number. Two years ago a Kurdish official suggested the peshmerga numbered 190,000. Increasingly well equipped – including with 2,000 armoured vehicles and rocket artillery systems – they are regarded as motivated, well trained and experienced.</p>",
