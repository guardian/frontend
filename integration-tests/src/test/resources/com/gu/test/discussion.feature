Feature: Read comments
    As a Guardian reader
    I want to read comments
    So I can engage with other users

  Scenario: Read top level comments
    Given I am on an article with comments
    When I choose to view the comments
    Then I can see 10 top level comments
    And the first comment is authored by "monkeyface"
    And the first comment body contains "Well done Guardian!"
    When I show more comments
    Then I can see 20 top level comments
