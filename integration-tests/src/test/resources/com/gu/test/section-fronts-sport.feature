Feature: Section Fronts - Sport
	As a Guardian user
	I want to get a further break-down of sections on the sport section front
	So that I can navigate content easier
	
	@scala-test
	Scenario: Page contains the top 10 stories across sport
	   Given I am on the 'sport' section front
	   Then I should see the top 10 stories across sport

    Scenario: Sport top stories should display 5 and hide the rest
        Given I am on the 'sport' section front
        Then I should see up to 5 'Sport' top stories
            And any more than 5 'Sport' top stories should be hidden
       
    @scala-test
    Scenario Outline: Sub-sections show a number of top stories, and be of the correct visual 'level'
        Give I am on the 'sport' section front
        Then there should be a '<sub-section>' section
            And the '<sub-section>' sub-section should contain up to <num-of-stories> stories
            And the '<sub-section>' sub-section should be a visual level <level>
        
        Examples:
            | sub-section  | num-of-stories | level |
            | Football     | 6              | 1     |

        Then I should see up to 3 'Football' top stories
            And any more than 3 'Football' top stories should be hidden
         
    Scenario: Users can hide sections
        Given I am on the 'sport' section front 
        When I hide a section
        Then the section will be hidden
    
    Scenario: Users can show hidden sections
        Given I am on the 'sport' section front
            And a section is hidden 
        When I show a section
        Then the section will be shown
