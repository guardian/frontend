## What does this change?

## What is the value of this and can you measure success?

## Does this affect other platforms - Amp, Apps, etc?

<!--
To test and validate AMP locally add the amp query string along with the development hash: http://localhost:3000/sport/2016/aug/25/katie-ledecky-first-pitch-washington-nationals-bryce-harper?amp=1#development=1

The AMP validation results will appear in your console.
