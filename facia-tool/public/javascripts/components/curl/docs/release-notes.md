Release notes for curl.js
---

* 0.8.1
	* Adds a build-time (cram) plugin for the new legacy module loader.
* 0.8.0
	* Adds new curl/loader/legacy module loader that provides similar
	  functionality to RequireJS's "shim config".
	* Adds dontAddFileExt config option functionality to js! plugin and
	  curl/loader/legacy module loader.
	* Fixes configuration context mixups. Modules will get their package's
	  config unless they are loaded explicitly via a plugin and that
	  plugin has a custom configuration.
	* Paths can now be objects like packages and can have all of the same
	  properties, except `main`, i.e. `location` (or `path`), `config`, `name`.
	* Fixes an issue in node on windows wherein C: was seen as a web protocol.
	* Updates READMEs in the plugin and loader folders.
	* Drops dojo 1.6 compatibility in the "kitchen sink" distribution.
	* Adds new dojo 1.8 distribution.
* 0.7.6
	* Adds compatibility with dojo 1.8 and 1.9, including the ability to provide
