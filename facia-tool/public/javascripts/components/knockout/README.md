**Knockout** is a JavaScript [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML. It uses *observers* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of *declarative bindings* to enable productive development.

##Getting started

**Totally new to Knockout?** The most fun place to start is the [online interactive tutorials](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/).

For more details, see

 * Documentation on [the project's website](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)
 * Online examples at [http://knockoutjs.com/examples/](http://knockoutjs.com/examples/)

##Downloading or building Knockout

You can [download released versions of Knockout](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/downloads) from Github.

Or, if you prefer to build the source yourself, clone the repo from Github, and then:

* To build on Linux or Mac, run `cd build` then `./build-linux`
* To build on Windows, run `build\build-windows.bat`
