All those fraudulent front groups are sucking up tax dollars to fund political campaigns and claiming their activity is 'social welfare'. What's not to target and why are why all these so-called anti-tax groups such fucking leeches? <br />You can be sure they'll continue to be targeted (because they should be), except the IRS will be less ham-handed with their internal memos.</p>  </blockquote>  <p>The Tea Party was targeted because the administration wanted to minimize their impact until after the election. It was targeted because you and your ilk don't like them because they disagree with you. </p> <p>You support attacking people exercising their First Amendment rights simply because you disagree with what they are saying. You want higher taxes for people you don't like and the Tea Party wants lower taxes, so you think the IRS should attack them. </p> <p>You deign to decide what is and what isn't social welfare based upon your own biases, and you want anybody who disagrees to be attacked by the government. </p> <p>The IRS might decide to attack some such group in the future, but next time whoever does it will find his/her picture on television as example one of a government employee that just doesn't understand how pissed off people get about violation of their Constitutional Rights.</p> <p>My best guess is that this IRS effort was promoted by a parallel track through the organization initiated and directed through the Treasury Employees Union. Google it up. Using a non-official trail provides plausible denial for the IRS management, and it gives the Obama administration the use of the most reviled government organization to attack political opponents with no official documentation. </p> <p>Look up who runs the union. How many times has she been to the White House in the past five years? Which offices did she visit? How many times did she or her predecessor go to the White House in previous administrations?</p> <p>There you have it. </p> <p>The same sort of system is bubbling along all over the government. Once you have the union leaders, you have &quot;reach around&quot; capability in every office in every branch.

The internet's fattest tubes all intersect in various places in the USA. Getting data from Australia to Argentina without that data passing through a single US wire is possible, but the routing system isn't set up to make that something you can control.</p> <p>Each packet of data you send out gets to it's destination by hopping from provider to provider. At each provider, the routers can only pass a packet on to whichever of their neighbours is closest to your destination. No single router or other device has a map of the internet and can determine in advance a preferred route. It's just a very fast and clever type of pass-the-parcel.</p> <p>Changes could be made to allow you to specify a route that doesn't touch a US server, but it would require establishing a standard and then having that implemented in the millions of routers that the internet runs on. It may even be a lot simpler than that, I haven't worked with routers for 15 years. There might be a good business opportunity in providing encrypted VPNs that are guaranteed somehow to never use US wires.

But packets can be (and with https, ssh and similar are) encrypted.

Once you use smtp, the ordinary email [totally unencrypted] protocol, you emails are less confidential than an old-fashioned postcard, without the advantage of a glossy naughty photo on one side - unless you encrypt the text with PGP or similar.</p> <p>Routing outside the US doesn't solve the problem - the NSA has very good legal and &quot;illegal&quot; listening facilities. They, with the US Navy, are rumoured to be very skilled at tapping undersea cables at almost any depth.
