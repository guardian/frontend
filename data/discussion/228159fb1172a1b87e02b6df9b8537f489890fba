Labour could run any other government close for being the party of the rich. Tuition fees were free when the Tories where last in power, it was Labour that intoduced fees (£1000 and then tripled them in the next parliament £3500), it was Labour that abolished the 10p tax rate for the poorest workers in society so they paid higher taxes, it was Labour that unmotivated the poor by saddling our country with regulation to kill off competition for new comers and entrepreneurship, it was Labour that privatised education and health through huge PFI contracts that the Tories have had to bail out, it was Labour that sent our young, poor, soldiers to fight in illegal wars in foreign lands, under resourced and under appreciated as Bush's poodle, it was Labour that bailed out the banks and put this country's debts at eye watering levels, it was Labour that only rose the state pension by a measley 75p in 13 years of government, it was Labour that ramped up youth unemployment and thanks to Labour that they UK was ranked the worst of 23 developed nations by UNICEF for children's welfare and development. Labour's 13 years of power were terrifying, the worst in my lifetime. Cash for honours makes dinner with Cameron seem like small beer. Why no illustrations of Labour and their wealthy friends? They are the worst party going.</p>","date":"17 April 2012 12:17am","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:17:33Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676177","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676177","numResponses":10,"numRecommends":28,"isHighlighted":false,"userProfile":{"userId":"4076345","displayName":"bobbytock0","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4076345","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/4076345","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/12/20/bobbytock0/aee952a5-2271-4e3d-9ea0-18d3461342ee/60x60.png","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/12/20/bobbytock0/aee952a5-2271-4e3d-9ea0-18d3461342ee/60x60.png","badge":[]}},{"id":15676194,"body":"<p>You think thats bad, the Lib Dem front bench is currently afflicted with <a href=\"http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/characters/the-thompsons\" rel=\"nofollow\">torsonic polarity syndrome</a>.</p>","date":"17 April 2012 12:20am","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:20:09Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676194","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676194","numResponses":0,"numRecommends":13,"isHighlighted":false,"userProfile":{"userId":"10153822","displayName":"memtitude","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10153822","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/10153822","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/12/19/10153822/eac008f0-99f7-4bd8-a63e-4bb9998948c0/60x60.png","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/12/19/10153822/eac008f0-99f7-4bd8-a63e-4bb9998948c0/60x60.png","badge":[]}},{"id":15676195,"body":"<p>I'm remembering...;)</p>","date":"17 April 2012 12:20am","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:20:09Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676195","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676195","numResponses":0,"numRecommends":1,"isHighlighted":false,"responseTo":{"displayName":"memtitude","commentApiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676163","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:16:11Z","date":"17 April 2012 12:16am","commentId":"15676163","commentWebUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676163"},"userProfile":{"userId":"10144649","displayName":"Flower3","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10144649","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/10144649","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","badge":[]}},{"id":15676204,"body":"<p>One or two look more like buttocks waiting to drop more crap on us!</p>","date":"17 April 2012 12:20am","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:20:47Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676204","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676204","numResponses":1,"numRecommends":12,"isHighlighted":false,"userProfile":{"userId":"4260062","displayName":"daffers56","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4260062","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/4260062","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/10/30/4260062/4abdacdc-8e05-427c-af59-5872c84dcf4f/60x60.png","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/10/30/4260062/4abdacdc-8e05-427c-af59-5872c84dcf4f/60x60.png","badge":[]}},{"id":15676210,"body":"<blockquote><p>I take it that's sarcism then</p></blockquote><p>Not at all!
