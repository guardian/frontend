This happened a short while after Labour came in, but was planned by the previous government. The 10% basic tax rate replaced the previous 23% basic tax rate,when it was raised to 20% people  personal allowances were raised considerably to lessen the impact for those on  low income. The PFI contracts though pretty awful were in no way 'privatisation, though they did open the doors further. The real privatisation began under Thatcher in the 1980's when she brought in private contracting for various hospital services such as catering, cleaning, and various ancillary jobs. Youth unemployment has been a disgrace since Thatchers time with successive waves of very high levels. In effect employment for the young never recovered from the days of the YTS schemes. I fail to see how the first Iraq war war any less dishonorable than the second, both Conservative and Labour were happy to wag tail for the US. The bank bailouts were the only thing that could possibly have happened, I believe that a Tory chancellor would have come to a similar conclusion. To call the Labour years terrifying after the Thatcher years is a nonsense. Neither were good, but I know which one I found to be more terrifying, and now it is back again and looks even more grim. I have little faith in either party, or the Lib Dems, who seem to be aping the ways of the bigger parties. Labour did this in the New Labour years to their shame, but for the person outside London away from all the media hype and awful sycophancy of both parties, the years under Labour were certainly easier to weather, and felt a welcome relief from the endless slog of Tory times. What you don't mention is the upward march of house prices from the mid 80's that turned homes into property/commodity and has forever since skewed how our society functions and has put the majority of the population in hock to the banks for their lifetimes. Prior to this people were happy to take out their mortages and have paid for their homes before retirement, when the iron yoke of debt lifted, and they became free. Under this government it looks as though many will literally be expected to work till they die. To say this is all Labour fault is to distort history. Certainly they have played along with the best of the neo-liberals, but the agenda was set by the Tories long ago. I am not an apologist for them, I just hate to see history being re-written.</p>","date":"18 April 2012 1:09am","isoDateTime":"2012-04-18T00:09:11Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15695555","apiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15695555","numResponses":3,"numRecommends":5,"isHighlighted":false,"responseTo":{"displayName":"bobbytock0","commentApiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15676177","isoDateTime":"2012-04-16T23:17:33Z","date":"17 April 2012 12:17am","commentId":"15676177","commentWebUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15676177"},"userProfile":{"userId":"4523181","displayName":"seeingclearly","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4523181","apiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/4523181","avatar":"http://static.guimcode.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static.guimcode.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","badge":[]}},{"id":15694705,"body":"<p>how can anyone approve of someone who smirks every time there is bad economic news@how can someone approve of a Chancellor who smirks ever time he makes a austerity cut that will hurt the poor,?</p>","date":"17 April 2012 11:20pm","isoDateTime":"2012-04-17T22:20:37Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15694705","apiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15694705","numResponses":1,"numRecommends":4,"isHighlighted":false,"responseTo":{"displayName":"MrsTrellice","commentApiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/15684910","isoDateTime":"2012-04-17T12:48:28Z","date":"17 April 2012 1:48pm","commentId":"15684910","commentWebUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-theguardian.com/comment-permalink/15684910"},"userProfile":{"userId":"4364972","displayName":"redmary1","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4364972","apiUrl":"http://discussion.code.dev-guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/4364972","avatar":"http://static.guimcode.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/27/redmary1/10c701e1-f395-4a0e-8ef5-0ccc197023ed/60x60.png","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static.guimcode.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/27/redmary1/10c701e1-f395-4a0e-8ef5-0ccc197023ed/60x60.png","badge":[]}},{"id":15694051,"body":"<blockquote><p>That is the core energy security problem, we can always nationalise UK based physical assets, we have no control if the French, Norwegian, Irish, Dutch or German switch off at their end..</p></blockquote><p><br>But nothing ever goes wrong in financialised economies... <a href=\"http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/programs/globalization/financialization/chapter1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">oh</a>, wait!</p><p>The rationale that it no longer matters how money is made, all money being of equal worth (Ponzi money or not) requires no such concerns.
