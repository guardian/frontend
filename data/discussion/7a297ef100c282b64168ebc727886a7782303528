All those fraudulent front groups are sucking up tax dollars to fund political campaigns and claiming their activity is 'social welfare'. What's not to target and why are why all these so-called anti-tax groups such fucking leeches? <br />You can be sure they'll continue to be targeted (because they should be), except the IRS will be less ham-handed with their internal memos.</p>  </blockquote>  <p>The Tea Party was targeted because the administration wanted to minimize their impact until after the election. It was targeted because you and your ilk don't like them because they disagree with you. </p> <p>You support attacking people exercising their First Amendment rights simply because you disagree with what they are saying. You want higher taxes for people you don't like and the Tea Party wants lower taxes, so you think the IRS should attack them. </p> <p>You deign to decide what is and what isn't social welfare based upon your own biases, and you want anybody who disagrees to be attacked by the government. </p> <p>The IRS might decide to attack some such group in the future, but next time whoever does it will find his/her picture on television as example one of a government employee that just doesn't understand how pissed off people get about violation of their Constitutional Rights.</p> <p>My best guess is that this IRS effort was promoted by a parallel track through the organization initiated and directed through the Treasury Employees Union. Google it up. Using a non-official trail provides plausible denial for the IRS management, and it gives the Obama administration the use of the most reviled government organization to attack political opponents with no official documentation. </p> <p>Look up who runs the union.

How many times did she or her predecessor go to the White House in previous administrations?</p> <p>There you have it. </p> <p>The same sort of system is bubbling along all over the government. Once you have the union leaders, you have &quot;reach around&quot; capability in every office in every branch.
