They went down the stairs and gathered on the hot tarmac. There they saw something unusual: the wheels of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/2012/07/08/gJQAZgG9UW_story.html\">US Airways jet had sunk into the black pavement</a> as if it were wet cement. The wheels were lodged so deep, in fact, that the truck that came to tow the plane away couldn’t pry it loose. The airline had hoped that without the added weight of the flight’s 35 passengers, the aircraft would be light enough to pull. It wasn’t. <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/Ir3wJ\">Someone posted a picture</a>: “Why is my flight cancelled? Because DC is so damn hot that our plane sank four inches into the pavement.”<br></p><p>Eventually, a larger, more powerful vehicle was brought in to tow the plane and this time it worked; the plane finally took off, three hours behind schedule. A spokesperson for the airline blamed the incident on “very unusual temperatures”.<br></p>","linkText":"Don't look away now, the climate crisis needs you | Naomi Klein","lastModified":1426524555000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Guardian is embarking on a major series of articles on the climate crisis and how humanity can solve it.
