We don’t think that’s a particularly meaningful metric, because the forecasts are probabilistic — Clinton’s chances of winning Florida increased to 54% from 48%, for instance, which is nontrivial but not an especially large change. Still, we know it’s something a lot of readers follow.

A debate is supposed to involve some diversity of opinion. If it is reduced to quibbling over nuance and tone, then personality becomes a substitute for clarity. Genuine political debates are good for democracy, because they force each candidate to define their views clearly and avoid relying on platitudes. With the current leadership candidates dancing inelegantly on the head of a pin, we have learned little – other than just how uninspiring, stale and vacuous a party leadership contest can be.</p><p>That’s why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/04/labour-mp-jeremy-corbyn-leadership-anti-austerity-platform\">Jeremy Corbyn’s entry</a> into the Labour leadership race is so important. Disclaimer: I’ve known Jeremy for years, and have shared numerous platforms with him on issues ranging from peace to social justice. He is the very antithesis of the negative caricature of an MP: he’s defined by his principles and beliefs, uninterested in personal self-advancement, and determined to use his platform to further the interests of people and causes that are otherwise ignored.</p>","linkText":"Jeremy Corbyn is in the Labour leadership race.

There are many questions for the immigration minister about the proposed citizenship laws and remember, no details of the laws - like a bill - have been released.</p> <p>As far as we know, the new laws involve stripping dual nationals of their Australian citizenship <strong>at the minister’s discretion</strong>, if the government suspects the person has been involved in terrorism. The minister said given the difficulty of getting evidence in overseas war-torn countries, his decision would be informed by Asio. The Abbott government has committed to this measure.</p> <p>A second element, reflecting the UK laws, involves stripping Australians of their citizenship<strong> if they have the option to a second citizenship</strong>. This measure, which caused uproar in the cabinet discussion, will be considered in the discussion paper. <strong>Philip Ruddock</strong> was appointed as captain of that discussion yesterday, with <strong>Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.</strong></p> <p>The key points from the government are these:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Peter Dutton</strong> has promised no one would be left stateless as a result of the laws.<br /></li> <li>Dutton says Australia would be compelled “constitutionally” to take back dual nationals if their second citizenship had been stripped by another country first. That is, if a UK-Australian citizen was suspected of terror and the UK government got in first, Australia would be compelled to take that person back.<br /></li> </ul> <p>Thanks to <strong>Shalailah Medhora</strong> for this little snippet from Dutton on AM:</p> <p>Q: If the boot was on the other foot, would we take them back?<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes we would if they were an Australian citizen. That’s the constitutional obligation.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“They would be rendered stateless, which we are not going to allow.”</p> <p>Already, the example delivered for debate <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/is-fighter-khaled-sharroufs-wife-and-children-seek-return-to-australia-20150526-gha5fy.html\">through The Age</a> is the case of Khaled Sharrouf and his wife and five children. This is the case where one of the children was pictured holding a severed head in the national daily. </p> <p>Marriage equality is also front and centre today. <strong>Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek</strong> have been out already. <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> is taking questions now. My head is spinning.</p> <p>However I will try to stay calm and deliver all the political news.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/27/paedophile-gerald-ridsdale-tells-abuse-inquiry-church-repeatedly-moved-him\">gave evidence to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse</a> via video link from prison, where he is serving time after being convicted of more than 140 offences against children as young as four over three decades until the 1980s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

<p>Ridsdale repeatedly said he did not recall key details of his interaction with Catholic clergy as he was being moved around parishes in Victoria where he committed the sexual offences.</p> <p>The former Catholic priest said he did not recall living with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/george-pell\">George Pell</a>, Australia’s most senior cleric, nor why Pell agreed to appear in court as a character reference for him in 1994.</p> <p>Ridsdale told the hearing, held in the Victorian city of Ballarat, said that shortly after taking up a posting in Apollo Bay, he spoke to a man who “said they are saying things in the pub about you and kids so I thought it was time to get out, so I put in for a transfer.”</p> <p>Despite being granted an early transfer, Ridsdale said he does not remember speaking to any senior church officials about this or the reasons why he was allowed to move onto another parish.</p> <p>The Ballarat area was the scene for numerous child sex offences committed by members of the Catholic church, some of whom were imprisoned. Pell, now a senior cleric in the Vatican, has agreed to appear at the hearing in person after being accused by an abuse survivor of attempting to buy his silence in the 1990s.</p> <p>Judy Courtin, a lawyer and supporter of the abuse victims, said: “Ridsdale and his selective memory just isn’t credible. I just can’t believe it.</p> <p>“He’s remembering acute details about certain events but at the same time he has no recollection at all about living with George Pell here in Ballarat, for example.</p> <p>“When it comes to anyone in the hierarchy, he has no memory at all. It’s like the final kick in the guts for the survivors. He’s 81, he’ll probably die in prison, so what does he have to lose? Why doesn’t he fess up and tell the truth?”</p> <p>Courtin said Pell should not be praised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/27/george-pell-says-he-is-prepared-to-appear-before-royal-commission\">for offering to give evidence </a>and that the former archbishop of Sydney should be in Ballarat already to support victims and their families.</p> <p>Domenico Millivoj Micich, who was sexually assaulted as a child and is supporting other survivors, said: “This is a very traumatic experience for those who knew Ridsdale all these years.</p> <p>“I thought he was still guarded and not really contrite.

Public bickering between club and coach has boiled over in the past week but the pot’s been on the stove since mid-2014, the point at which Carlton might have made motions towards extending Malthouse’s initial three-year contract beyond this 2015 season. </p>","linkText":"Mick Malthouse departure a disastrously-executed exercise in public relations | Russell Jackson","lastModified":1476150788000,"standfirst":"<p>The decision to offload their coach is a dreary microcosm of Carlton’s muddled, mostly failing quest to define what their once-great club stands for in 2015</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b5311656525901ef75796eb3b9e4c0c64702c3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/22b5311656525901ef75796eb3b9e4c0c64702c3/0_46_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bearers of bad news: Carlton president Mark LoGiudice (L) and CEO Steven Trigg speak to the media at Ikon Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bearers of bad news: Carlton president Mark LoGiudice (L) and CEO Steven Trigg speak to the media at Ikon Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4983f","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"sport/afl","url":"/sport/afl","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"AFL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/carlton","url":"/sport/carlton","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Carlton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/carlton","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","url":"/sport/australian-rules-football","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Australian rules football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-rules-football","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/australia-sport","url":"/sport/australia-sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/blog","url":"/sport/blog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sportblog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on football, tennis, cricket and the latest sports stories","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[],"editionBrandings":[{"edition":{"id":"UK"}},{"edition":{"id":"US"}},{"edition":{"id":"AU"}},{"edition":{"id":"INT"}}]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/russell-jackson","url":"/profile/russell-jackson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Russell Jackson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/russell-jackson","twitterHandle":"rustyjacko","bio":"<p>Russell Jackson is Guardian Australia's deputy sport editor.

Carlton, with the AFL great saying he’s “miles off” coaching again.</p> <p>The Blues are on the lookout for a new coach after sacking Mick Malthouse on Tuesday. Assistant John Barker has been appointed caretaker coach for the rest of the season, with the 40-year-old facing a tough task to revive the last-placed Blues ahead of Friday’s clash with Sydney at the SCG.</p> <p>Worsfold, who coached West Coast to the 2006 premiership, hasn’t been in the hot seat since stepping down from his Eagles post at the end of 2013. The 46-year-old was installed as one of the bookmakers’ favourites to be appointed Carlton’s next coach, but he swiftly poured cold water on the idea.</p> <p>“I will be telling Carlton they should look to progress with looking for a coach without adding me to the list,” Worsfold told Channel 7. </p> <p>He said 2016 was simply too early for him to return to coaching. “There is a possibility that I might want to coach again one day, but that is miles off being next year,” Worsfold told The West Australian.</p> <p>“There is no way that I am ready to consider stepping into those shoes, whether it be in the next month, or whether it be in September. If I am not seriously thinking about whether I am ready for it now, then I am definitely not.</p> <p>“If I was keen, I would have to be itching to get into it now and looking for opportunities, and I am not doing that.”</p> <p>Last week, Worsfold wrote a letter to the AFL’s coaches declaring he would resign as chairman of the AFL Coaches Association if he decides to pursue a head coaching role again.</p> <p>Barker, Stewart Dew, Brendan Bolton, Dean Laidley, Guy McKenna, Peter Sumich, and Michael Voss are among the early favourites to be appointed as Carlton’s full-time coach.</p>","linkText":"John Worsfold rules himself out of running for Carlton coach role","lastModified":1476150787000,"standfirst":"<ul><li>Former West Coast coach ‘miles off’ return to

Aloisi is set for a testing return to the A-League coaching ranks after he was confirmed as Brisbane Roar’s new coach","body":"<p>John Aloisi is set for a testing return to the A-League coaching ranks after he was confirmed as Brisbane Roar’s new coach. The former Socceroo will direct “all football operations” with the three-time champions in his first senior role since he was sacked as coach of the then-Melbourne Heart in December 2013.</p> <p>The 39-year-old will join the Roar in June with his first game in charge to be the glamour friendly against Liverpool at Suncorp Stadium on 17 July.</p> <p>“I am extremely proud and honoured to join Brisbane Roar,” Aloisi said. “The club has defined success in the first 10 years of the A-League and I am determined to ensure the high standards the Roar players, members, sponsors and supporters have come to expect continue under my stewardship.”</p> <p>The legendary former striker won just eight times in 39 matches at the helm of the Heart, who were bought out by Manchester City and rebranded the month after Aloisi’s exit. He guided the Melbourne club through a run of 17 consecutive games without a win before the axe was swung.</p> <p>But departing Roar chairman Chris Fong – who reportedly asked Ange Postecoglou for advice in finding a successor to title-winning coach Mike Mulvey – believes Aloisi is the “perfect fit” to launch the club’s new era.</p> <p>“John brings to the Roar a passionate understanding of Australian football and the A-League,” Fong said. “I am impressed by his determination to succeed and the fresh focus he will bring to the club.”</p> <p>Aloisi has been with Melbourne Victory since February as a development coach for their sides in the National Youth League and National Premier Leagues, while also appearing on Fox Sports as a pundit.</p> <p>His second chance comes amid a period of huge instability at Brisbane, which is facing a multi-million dollar loss this financial year and is on the hunt for a new chairman following Fong’s announcement this week he would be stepping down.</p> <p>Club owners The Bakrie Group are battling significant financial issues of their own, and a new joint ownership model with a local consortium could be on the cards.</p> <p>Influential director of football Ken Stead and managing director Sean Dobson have both recently left the club with commercial director David Pourre installed as interim chief executive.</p> <p>Caretaker coach Frans Thijssen is likely to stay on until Aloisi’s arrival, with the Roar to face Spanish La Liga side Villarreal in a friendly in Brisbane on 3 June.</p>","linkText":"Brisbane Roar name John Aloisi

The goalkeeper is poised to join either Melbourne Victory or Western Sydney Wanderers after being granted a release from the final two years of his Glory contract.</p> <p>Perth were stripped of their spot in this season’s finals and fined $269,000 after being found guilty of systematically rorting the salary cap. A host of Glory players were left fuming over the club’s dodgy activities, with striker Jamie Maclaren recently issuing the club with a breach notice in a bid to win an early release from his own deal.</p> <p>Dutch winger Youssouf Hersi has already left the club, and there’s a chance others could follow suit. But it appears family reasons were the sole driver in Vukovic’s decision to leave; his wife Kristy is due to give birth in July, and the pair are keen to move east in order to be closer to family.</p> <p>“I have to stress that this decision is purely based for family reasons and no other, irrespective of what may have transpired off the field in recent months,” Vukovic said. “We don’t have any relatives in Perth.</p> <p>“I approached the club four months ago about the possibility of moving closer to home to ensure we have the support network we both need from our family. No matter how we tried to look at it, the best interests of our child had to come first. What lies ahead as far as football is concerned is not clear at this stage.”</p> <p>Vukovic will be hot property on the open market after establishing himself as one of the best shot stoppers in Australia. Western Sydney and Victory are the early frontrunners to nab the 30-year-old, who is in the peak of his career. The Wanderers are in need of a classy goalkeeper after axing veteran Ante Covic, while Victory are also on the lookout after parting ways with Nathan Coe.</p> <p>Vukovic’s exit, combined with Jack Duncan’s move to Danish club Randers FC, has left Glory without a front-line goalkeeper. Former Jets goalkeeper Mark Birighitti is reportedly in the club’s sights, along with strikers Scott McDonald and Adam Taggart. Last week, Wanderers defender Antony Golec signed on with Glory on a two-year deal.</p>","linkText":"Danny Vukovic the latest player to leave embattled A-League club Perth

Mahela Jayawardene, who was coached by Bayliss and his assistant Paul Farbrace for Sri Lanka, is convinced the Australian will lead England to success in all formats of the game.</p> <p>“He’s a great guy; he’s a very good coach,” Jayawardene says. “When we took him he didn’t have much international experience but he knew exactly how teams work and he is a very old school guy in that he stays behind the limelight and gets the job done.”</p> <p>Jayawardene, who also played for Bayliss with Kolkata Knight Riders, believes Bayliss’s approach to coaching is exactly right for this young England team.</p> <p>“He is fantastic with the boys, especially the younger guys. He gives them a lot of confidence. He will allow the players to express themselves; he won’t put boundaries or constraints on them. He will allow them to play their cricket but make sure that it’s done according to the team plan. He is not very authoritative in the sense that he will sit back and allow the captain to take the decisions but help in any way he can.</p> <p>“He is strict when it comes to ethics and values, however. He’ll try and keep people within those boundaries.</p> <p>“It is exciting to see all the young cricketers around England and Trevor will definitely help them to grow. He did this with our young group when he was with us. He was with us from 2009 through to the World Cup when we got into the final and that’s the time he had young players like Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera. He created a great atmosphere for young players like that to thrive in. England has some very exciting, talented cricketers and they are playing a good brand of cricket and I don’t think Trevor will try to change that.”</p> <p>Bayliss and Jayawardene were on board the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 in Lahore when gunmen opened fire. Six policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack and six of the Sri Lanka team, including Jayawardene, were injured. He believes that experience has helped shaped Bayliss and made him stronger.</p> <p>“We all pulled together after that experience. Paul Farbrace was on the bus as well, so they have that shared experience. We all feel lucky to be alive after that and I am sure Trevor would say the same, that the experience made him feel lucky and made him stronger.</p> <p>“I think he will cope fine with the pressure. He will stay away from the limelight; he doesn’t get distracted by what the media is saying. For him the important thing is the team and the results and he’ll work mostly in the background. He is a very easy-going guy and I think he now has the experience of being around the world and understands the demands from doing different things.”</p> <p>The India all-rounder Rajat Bhatia, who also played under Bayliss at Kolkata between 2011 and 2013, believes one of Bayliss’s key strengths is his clear leadership.</p> <p>“The best thing about Trevor was that he made things very simple for everyone,” Bhatia says. “There are times when, during the IPL especially, you are confused about what is needed from you or what is expected. He makes things very clear. He explains very simply what your role in the team is and what you need to do on the field. Sometimes in your head you have two or three answers to each question. You speak to him for a bit and you have the one answer you need. He helps the focus become 100%.”</p> <p>“He will bring focus and clarity of intent. England have been struggling. They did poorly in the World Cup, which their fans didn’t expect. The team has to move forward and the team needs things to change a bit. Anything different would help them and I’m sure Trevor will bring some fresh thoughts with him that would help England.”</p> <p>Bayliss has also received the backing of fellow Australians, including Shane Warne and Darren Lehmann. Warne tweeted: “If Trevor Bayliss is the new coach of England, then England are very lucky as he is a ripper and, even better, he’s pure old school, too.”</p> <p>“He’s done a wonderful job, on all the reports, with the teams he’s coached. Everyone’s a big fan of Trevor Bayliss. He’s fair, he’s harsh and he creates a pretty good environment.”</p> <p>Lehmann said his appointment is a reminder of how tough the Ashes series will be. “Trevor has been a great servant of the game in Australia,” the Australia coach said. “He has had great success with New South Wales in both long and short format, as well as with the Sydney Sixers and Kolkata Knight Riders in T20s.” “A trademark of Trevor’s teams is they are well prepared and this just serves as another reminder to us that this Ashes will be a tough contest..</p> <p>“I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him all the best.” The former Australian bowler Brett Lee thinks England are “very very lucky” to have secured the services of Bayliss. “He’s such a calming influence over the team and I personally believe his record speaks for itself.Whatever he’s touched has turned to gold. I believe it’s his calming influence over the players that allows them to play their natural role and to be confident to play their natural role without any pressure coming from the top.”</p> <p>Bayliss joined Lee at Kolkata as head coach in 2012 with immediate results, taking the glamour franchise to its first IPL title in the competition’s then five-year history, and adding a second trophy in 2014.</p> <p>“He found a way to engage every player to make them feel as if they were the most special person in the team.</p> <p>“He’s the guy that will pull you into line. There’s no favourites. There’s no tall poppy syndrome. He doesn’t bow down to anyone which is what I like. So if you’ve got a very strong personality they’ve got to play by the by the rules.</p> <p>“No-one is bigger than the game and he believes that. Because of the way he goes about his business, everyone appreciates that and he gets the best out of every player.</p> <p>“And when he talks - in circumstances when you’re under the pump and there’s pressure - most coaches would go down a different road but he’s so relaxed . and all of a sudden from the top you’ve got the coach backing the players and it’s all happening in a controlled, relaxed environment.”</p>","linkText":"Mahela Jayawardene tips Trevor Bayliss for England success","lastModified":1476150787000,"standfirst":"<p>Former players are full of praise for the new head coach, who is known for giving younger players the opportunity to express themselves<br>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/26/trevor-bayliss-confirmed-new-head-coach-england-cricket-ecb\">Bayliss to take charge of England for Ashes</a></p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e4c4c0e2ca719ba83b0e6681a1380ac9f45ac8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432664705869/Mahela-Jaywardene-Trevor--005.jpg\" alt=\"Mahela Jaywardene, Trevor Bayliss\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahela Jaywardene, left, talks to Trevor Bayliss during a Sri Lanka nets session in 2009.

It has one of the largest calderas in the world, offering myriad viewpoints over its twisted, pitted landscape. Aso town can be reached by train (one hour from Kumamoto, two from Beppu, fares between £6 and £12). There are <a href=\"http://www.kyusanko.co.jp/aso/lang_en/\">two cable car lines, called ropeways</a>, from which to explore the Aso area. Aso Nishi (west) cable car station is a short bus ride from Aso station (£3 each way). Aso Higashi (east) cable car station can be reached by taking a local train to Miyaji station and then walking up the road to the cable car station. A toll road (about £3.50) goes right to the summit of the crater where there is a large car park.

lawyers failed to convince a court that it should be reinstated.</li> \n   <li>Three judges at the ninth US circuit court of appeals ruled unanimously that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/trump-travel-ban-temporarily-blocked-nationwide\">nationwide temporary restraining order</a> (TRO) imposed last week must stay in place, meaning the executive order banning travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugee entries cannot be enforced.</li> \n   <li>President Trump reacted angrily to the court decision, branding it “political” and declaring:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829836231802515457\"> \n   <blockquote

But the judges said future hearings could take into account earlier statements made by Trump in which he had pledged such a ban.</li> \n   <li>The government claim that a national security order from the president was “unreviewable” was dismissed by the judges:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li>You can read the full ruling from the judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/feb/10/travel-ban-judges-refuse-reinstate-trump-order-reaction-live?page=with:block-589d089ee4b0e78a1131dbee#block-589d089ee4b0e78a1131dbee\">here</a> and their key decisions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/feb/10/travel-ban-judges-refuse-reinstate-trump-order-reaction-live?page=with:block-589d6178e4b01b5caf3ce988#block-589d6178e4b01b5caf3ce988\">here</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/10/complete-victory-attorney-general-celebrates-trump-travel-ban-verdict-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5qhmy\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"3181971\" data-video-name=\"'Complete victory': attorney general celebrates Trump travel ban verdict – video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n   <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-589d11c1e4b0e78a1131dc0b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n    <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/10/170210ag_h264_publish.mp4\">\n    <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12038678&amp;format=video/m3u8\">\n    <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12038678&amp;format=video/webm\"> \n   </video> \n   <figcaption>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/10/complete-victory-attorney-general-celebrates-trump-travel-ban-verdict-video\">‘Complete victory’: attorney general celebrates Trump travel ban verdict</a>\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The government could challenge the appeals court decision or file an emergency appeal with the supreme court.

But they said previous comments by Trump and his team could be taken into account in future hearings on whether the travel ban “was motivated by a discriminatory purpose”:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The states have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban’ as well as evidence they claim suggests that the executive order was intended to be that ban …</p> \n   <p>The states’ claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions. In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <h2>No explanation of ‘urgent need’ to reinstate ban</h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The judges said they did not see “an urgent need” for the ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries to be reinstated:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although the government points to the fact that congress and the executive identified the seven countries named in the executive order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the executive order to be immediately reinstated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The federal government’s application to have the temporary restraining order lifted – and the travel ban reinstated – was denied. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T07:35:48.224Z\">at 7.35am GMT</time></p>

in an attempt to end the deadlock in stalled talks between the country and its EU-led creditors. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:</strong></p> \n  <p><em>In a last ditch effort to break the deadlock that has once again ignited fears of a new Greek crisis – and default by the summer – finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has rushed to Brussels for a meeting with the heads of the creditor institutions.</em><br></p> \n  <p><em>Speculation is rife that the Oxford-educated Tsakalotos is prepared to make what the Greek media this morning are describing as the “big compromise” in order to clinch a “technical” agreement with lenders before euro area finance minister hold their monthly Eurogroup session on 20 February. If sealed, auditors would return to Athens next week in the hopes of finally concluding the compliance review at the heart of the impasse. </em></p> \n  <p><em>Tsakalotos is expected to be presented with an alternative set of measures that Athens’ leftist-led government could put its signature to in time for a deal to be reached before Europe goes into election mode, starting with polls in the Netherlands next month. </em></p> \n  <p><em>The proposal, to be presented to the minister this afternoon, is believed to be more palatable in that the government would not have to legislate contingency measures (not least tax increases and pension cuts) before the country’s current bailout expires in the summer of 2018. The cuts are thought to amount to 2 percent of Greek gross domestic product and would only be implemented if Athens fails to meet the budget targets agreed under its latest bailout.</em></p> \n  <p><em>If true, the face-saving formula may avert the spectre of bankruptcy this summer when Greek faces a €7bn debt repayment in July, but is unlikely to resolve the lingering problem of Greece’s mountainous debt or go down well with many in the ruling Syriza party who have become increasingly restive at the prospect of inflicting yet more measures on austerity-whipped Greeks. </em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T11:11:10.729Z\">at 11.11am GMT</time></p> \n</div><div id=\"block-589d9730e4b08bb4fbbea909\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T10:52:06.669Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>So far Friday has been a day of forecast-beating data from China and the UK.</p> \n  <p>But investor sentiment is underpinned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/10/markets-boosted-by-trumps-phenomenal-tax-pledge-business-live?page=with:block-589d690ee4b01b5caf3ce99c#block-589d690ee4b01b5caf3ce99c\">comments from President Trump</a>, whose every word is closely scrutinised.

I actually think Donald Trump is going to prove a lot of people wrong, but sadly not George Orwell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-atwood\">Margaret Atwood</a>, or whoever wrote the Book of Revelation. It says a lot about the man that building a giant wall isn’t even in the top five most Game of Thrones things about him. Of course, presidents always enter office with something to prove, it’s just rarely their sanity.</p><p>You look into Trump’s eyes and you see the fear and confusion of a man who has just been told he’s got stage-four cervical cancer. He is a super-villain in a world without heroes, a man so obnoxious and unhappy that karma may see him reincarnated as himself. You kind of wish he’d get therapy, but at this stage it’s like hiring a window cleaner for a burning building. It’s still difficult to classify him exactly: he’s not a classic Nazi, but would burn books if his supporters knew how to read. Hillary Clinton was obviously the preferred establishment candidate, and whoever was on the rota for this election cycle at the Illuminati really dropped the ball, but Trump is still very much someone that the permanent powers have assessed they can work with.</p>","linkText":"Donald Trump: a man so obnoxious that karma may see him reincarnated as himself | Frankie Boyle","lastModified":1486593966000,"standfirst":"<p>All presidents come into office with something to prove, it’s just rarely their sanity.
