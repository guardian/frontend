Had Ireland hung on then it would have been their first series win south of the equator since Australia in 1979. Instead they go to Port Elizabeth with a mental and physical battle on their hands. Technically at 1-1 it’s all to play for, but it will not feel like that for the tourists. “They delivered an onslaught that we didn’t quite match up to,” Joe Schmidt said. “We weren’t able to make those tackles. The result was well and truly warranted by the South African ball carriers and we weren’t quite up to the task. And that was incredibly disappointing when we were 26-10 up going into the final quarter and 19-3 up at half-time.”</p>","linkText":"South Africa edge past Ireland with dramatic late comeback to

made light of losing CJ Stander to a red card to record a remarkable 26-20 win over the Springboks, their first on South African soil","body":"<p>Take nothing away from Joe Schmidt’s side but perhaps the most remarkable thing about Ireland’s first ever win on South African soil, which came despite their losing CJ Stander to a red card midway through the first half, is just how comfortable it was, barring a few nerve-jangling moments at the death. All over Ireland’s defensive rearguard were Andy Farrell’s fingerprints – the new defence coach clearly having a considerable impact – but they led by seven when Stander departed, and did so for most of the second half – only an intercept try from South Africa ensuring a jittery finish.</p><p>Ireland’s heroes were plentiful and defiant but they were far from desperate. Iain Henderson and Devin Toner were monumental in the second row, Rory Best an inspirational captain but Paddy Jackson excellent too at fly-half. He finished the match with 16 points and it was his drop goal just before half-time that levelled the scores. At the time it felt like delaying the inevitable; instead he marshalled Ireland’s superb second-half showing that leaves Allister Coetzee with some difficult questions to answer after his first match in charge of the Springboks and Schmidt celebrating the finest win of his tenure after a Six Nations campaign in which their title was relinquished a little too easily.</p>","linkText":"Ireland hold

I am part of a community project here in Totnes called Atmos Totnes (<a href=\"http://www.atmostotnes.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.atmostotnes.org</a>) which is using a Community Right to Build Order process on an 8 acre former milk factory, but by designing a development on the actual needs this community has, and on a deep consultation, we are seeing the development as a huge opportunity to restimulate our local economy: through the construction process, through its being held in a Community Land Trust, starting and owning assets and businesses that can generate revenue for community development. I am a firm believer that communities owning assets is key to our ability to develop more resilient local economies. There is a lot of potential of Neighbourhood Planning too, if those creating them can be sufficiently bold, ambitious, and if they place local economies at the heart of them.</p> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2015/nov/09/how-can-we-support-thriving-local-economies-live-chat#comment-63156051\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15565127\" title=\"View AliceComShares’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/15565127\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for AliceComShares\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15565127\" title=\"View AliceComShares’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">AliceComShares</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/63156051\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">11 November 2015 1:52pm</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n      <p>We hope that the government will continue to provide appropriate support for community shares and community ownership. We also hope the Government may consider how to encourage the further development of the community shares market by supporting potential investors through tax reliefs such as EIS, SEIS and SITR.</p> \n      <p>It would be great to see local businesses working with their communities and involving them as decision makers and stakeholders rather than purely as consumers.</p> \n      <p>Also, policymakers could share decision making with local communities, allowing them to more greatly influence how the local economy should be shaped.</p> \n      <p>On a larger-scale we could reconsider how we measure the health of the economy. Currently the focus is on growth – and all of the measures used by government (national, regional and local) are focused on growth, rather than whether the economy is delivering what it should, to improve the society in which we all live.</p> \n      <p>The economy is a means to an end, and looking at economics at the local level provides an opportunity for it to be led by those who have most to gain and lose - the people living and working in that particular community.

Not until the conversation was steered to the task at hand did Hunter break his silence from beneath a grey flat cap.</p> <p>“Thank you,” Hunter said abruptly upon the first mention of Algieri, nearly 20 minutes in. “Everything’s Floyd, Floyd, Floyd. I respect all you guys, you know that. But he’s got to fight Algieri. It’s just Floyd, Floyd, Floyd, Floyd, Floyd. And then if he loses, then you guys are going to rake him over the coals. He’s got to focus on Algieri. That’s who we should be talking about.”</p> <p>Mayweather towers so high over boxing that a chance to share the ring with him represents an achievement in itself, not least due to the untold riches it augurs. Even more enticing for the Bolton fighter is the sense the timing is right – that Khan’s twice being left at the altar by the American shot-caller, despite the blows to his ego, may have been a blessing in disguise. He is 28 now, more than a decade on from his breakthrough at the Athens Olympics, and a better, more complete fighter.</p> <p>Yet a pragmatist like Hunter, the phlegmatic 61-year-old retired probation officer who rose to prominence as the trainer of Andre Ward, knows how rapidly the prospect of a lucrative showdown with the sport’s box-office king will unravel should Khan take his eye off the ball. Fortunately, the fighter seems to know it too.</p> <p>“I can’t afford to make any mistakes,” he said. “There’s a lot of pressure on this fight in that sense, where if you make a mistake you’re done.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/26/anthony-joshua-boxing-prison-heavyweight-greatness\">Anthony Joshua goes from prison to punching way to heavyweight greatness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Khan’s immediate path is Algieri, a former kickboxer who holds a master’s degree in clinical nutrition and still lives in his parents’ basement in Huntington, Long Island. A virtually anonymous club fighter until a breakthrough win over Emmanuel Taylor thrust him into the world rankings, Algieri made the most of a shot at Ruslan Provodnikov’s junior welterweight title and twice came off the canvas to win the belt on a split decision. That set up a pay-per-view showdown with Pacquiao which ended in a predictable one-sided defeat but thrust his name into the mix of what’s become the sport’s prestige division.</p> <p>Algieri is a lengthy, competent boxer, but enters as an 8-1 underdog against Khan, who is widely expected to win and look good doing it. What message would it send if an opponent floored six times by Pacquiao made for a problematic night?</p> <p>Khan insists he won’t be compromised by those expectations, that he has tempered the eager taste for reckless combat with a tactical restraint. Much of that is attributable to Hunter, a teacher who champions the technical brilliance of Ward and Mayweather even as it denies the public thirst for bloodlust.</p> <p>“You don’t have educated fans today,” he said. “And the people on TV, with all due respect to them, they try to program the fan into thinking that, if it’s not a certain way, it’s not a good fight. But that same fan will watch a good strategic soccer game or a basketball game. Strategy, always strategy. Success in life comes from strategy.”</p> <p>Thus the conversation inevitably returned to Mayweather, so completely does the pound-for-pound kingpin obscure the sport. Hunter, who has emerged as one of boxing’s more lucid pop-philosophers, expounded at length over the underwhelming public reception to Mayweather’s win over Manny Pacquiao – and what it says about a culture’s fistic sense and sensibility.</p> <p>“When you see a master, isn’t he supposed to make it look easy?” Hunter said. “If you’re getting your home remodeled and you have a carpenter come in there and every other nail, he’s slamming it into the wood crooked and then pulling it out, you’re going to get rid of him, right?</p> <p>“More yet, if you had a son and he wanted to box and you took him to a coach and he said, ‘Look, I’m gonna teach your son how to go toe to toe. If he get a black eye, he’s gonna give one. If he get a bloody mouth, he’s gonna give one.’ You take him to another coach and he says, ‘I’m gonna teach your son how to hit and not get hit,’ you’re gonna leave him with that guy.</p> <p>“It gets me today about the science of boxing. ‘Oh, he ran.’ Where you going to run in the ring? Now if he jumped out the ring and ran to the dressing room, yeah, he ran. But he has a right to use every inch of that ring. That’s like telling a great tennis player, you can only play up the middle, you can’t use the whole court. That’s like telling a great soccer player, you can only go past the midfield, you can’t go no further. That’s like telling a football running back, you can’t run to the sidelines, or like telling LeBron James, ‘You have to shoot 3s, you can’t go to the hoop.’”</p> <p>The stirring yet understated sermon pressed forward as Hunter evoked the names of Meldrick Taylor, Terry Norris and Gerald McClellan, crowd-pleasing warriors who laid it all on the line at extreme personal costs.</p> <p>“I don’t see none of their fans giving them a check,” he said, matter-of-factly. “[The fans] don’t see the end result of that dumb stuff, when they’re wearing diapers at 40. Don’t know their names. I’ve seen them looking up. They come to the gym and sit there and look up. I’ve seen them walk on the hills. I’ve seen them at 45 forget who they are.</p> <p>“If it was your house like I said, or your life, you’re going to want a master to do it. If I’m a master, I’m supposed to make it look easy. It’s not supposed to be difficult. That’s where it goes wrong because it’s not [Mayweather’s] fault he don’t have a challenge. That’s not his fault. If Freddie Roach didn’t teach Manny Pacquiao how to cut off the ring, that’s his fault.”</p> <p>Hunter believes the rebuilt Khan, who has traded in his recklessness for technical maturity, is poised to rule this division for years to come. That journey begins not in September against Mayweather, but Friday in Brooklyn.</p> <p>“With his ability, with his speed, with his intelligence, he should dominate the welterweight division,” he said. “That takes time, that takes work, but that’s what I’m in it for. The bar is set high because he has a gift. I don’t want to sit around if I can make it to 85 and training fighters and say I failed this kid because I was just in it for a check. As long as we’re together, he has to be great because he as all the ingredients to be great. All the ingredients, from his gift to his family to the support he has. He’s at the right age, he’s at the right weight. You just don’t squander those kind of gifts.</p> <p>“There’s a fight in him that the world hasn’t even seen yet.”</p>","linkText":"Amir Khan can rule welterweight division for years, says Virgil Hunter","lastModified":1459774905000,"standfirst":"The trainer believes the Bolton fighter can be king of a division dominated by Floyd Mayweather but first he must get past Chris Algieri in New York on Friday","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/498p8","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"sport/amirkhan","url":"/sport/amirkhan","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Amir Khan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amirkhan","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/boxing","url":"/sport/boxing","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Boxing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/bryan-armen-graham","url":"/profile/bryan-armen-graham","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Bryan Armen Graham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bryan-armen-graham","twitterHandle":"bryanagraham","bio":"<p>Bryan Armen Graham is the deputy editor of Guardian US Sports, based in New York.

The party was established days after Tsipras announced he would accept more excoriating austerity in exchange for a third, €86bn bailout to prop up the debt-stricken Greek economy.

As we reported this morning, Tony Pidgley, founder and executive chairman at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/berkeleygroupholdings\">Berkeley</a>, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/06/bumper-payouts-for-housebuilding-executives-persimmon-berkeley\">expected to face tough questions</a> at the shareholder meeting near the group’s headquarters in leafy Cobham, Surrey, after it emerged last month that his pay package last year was worth £23.3m. </p> <p><strong>Redrow</strong> also updates the market on Tuesday and then it is the turn of <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> on Wednesday.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets UK says this crop of results could show the early effects of recent changes to stamp duty. He comments:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent changes in stamp duty thresholds announced by the chancellor last year have also helped slow down house price growth in London, while at the same time helping the lower end of the market, due to the way the changes adversely affect properties over the £2m mark. </p> <p>On the other hand it has also helped boost the cheaper end of the house price chain due to the cost savings made as a result of the removal of the slab based structure of the duty.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hewson says <strong>Berkeley Group </strong>is more exposed to the higher end London market so there is scope for disappointment, as a result of those changes in stamp duty. <strong>Redrow</strong> meanwhile is expected to deliver strong results, after an upbeat trading update in February. <strong>Barratt Developments </strong>is more exposed to the lower end of the housing market and so “it is likely to feel the benefits of the recent stamp duty changes more than most”, adds Hewson.</p> <p>Against a <strong>FTSE 100</strong> up 0.4% this afternoon, shares in <strong>Berkeley Group</strong> are down -o.6% at £33.80 but <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> is up 0.4% at 634p.

Macy’s department store as a young man, and appeared to be a successful reporter at local television news stations in California and across the American south.</p> <p>But away from the studio lights, his journalism career was troubled, marked by office disputes and legal complaints he filed that alleged racism at newsrooms in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2000 and in Virginia last year.</p> <aside

shooting: police say suspected gunman is dead - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to police, on Wednesday, Flanagan, 41, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/virginia-gunman-kills-reporter-cameraman\">carried out a deadly attack on two television journalists with WDBJ7</a>, a CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Virginia, where he once worked. Flanagan killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/virginia-tv-news-shooting-alison-parker-adam-ward\">Alison Parker, a 24-year-old morning news reporter, and Adam Ward, 27, a cameraman and photographer</a>, police said. He also injured the woman they were interviewing, Vicki Gardner.</p> <p>Officials said on Wednesday that ABC News had received a document, which <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-air-virginia-shooting-identified/story?id=33327920\">ABC reported</a> was a 23-page fax from someone purporting to be Bryce Williams, Flanagan’s onscreen pseudonym, about two hours after the attack. </p> <p>The document claimed the attack was intended as revenge for the massacre of nine African Americans in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June.</p> <p>“What sent me over the top was the church shooting,” he reportedly wrote, adding that he had paid a deposit for a gun two days after the church shootings.</p> <p>As their once shared workplace grieves for Parker and Ward, a preliminary portrait has emerged of an easily agitated employee who accused co-workers in at least two newsrooms of making racist comments. Flanagan’s most recent complaints, filed against reporters at WDBJ, were dismissed by the station manager on Wednesday as “fabricated”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e0bc892744ff72748a539725e4daa21dc6c84c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/74e0bc892744ff72748a539725e4daa21dc6c84c/0_406_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce Williams\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo from Bryce Williams’s Twitter account.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A model, and a string of allegations</h2> <p>Flanagan grew up in Oakland, California. During his high school years and into his early 20s he worked as a print and catwalk model, according to his social media profiles. On Twitter he posted several photos from his modeling days, including one of him at the age of 14 in a Macy’s Fashion show.</p> <p>He attended Skyline high school in Oakland, where he was voted homecoming prince during his junior year, according to his social media profiles. He then went on to study radio and television at San Francisco State University. He graduated in 1995, the university confirmed.</p> <p>In 2000 Flanagan sued WTWC, the NBC affiliate in Tallahassee, Florida, alleging he was fired after objecting to racism he encountered once he joined the station the year before. He sought more than $75,000 in damages.</p> <p>The lawsuit made several claims, including that in the summer of 1999 he had been called a “monkey” by a producer and learned other black employees had been called the same.</p> <p>Flanagan alleged that later that year a white employee told him it “busted her butt that blacks did not take advantage of the free money” available in scholarships to African Americans attending college.</p> <p>He further alleged that a black criminal suspect being reported on by the station was referred to as “just another thug” and that a black tape operator was told to “stop talking ebonics”.</p> <p>The station denied all of Flanagan’s allegations. The lawsuit reached federal court in Florida. According to public records, it was settled out of court in 2001.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/26/virginia-shooter-disgruntled-employee-vester-lee-flanagan-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4bpd8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2360861\"            data-video-name=\"Virginia shooter was ‘quick to take offense from co-workers’, says former boss – video\"            data-video-provider=\"WDBJ7\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55de1fece4b0a1efe15674ac\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/1/23/1358942308989/Guardian-Video-Holding-Im-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/08/26/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM-1-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/08/26/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/08/26/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/08/26/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/08/26/150826shootercomments_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>WDBJ7’s general manager says Vester Lee Flanagan had to be physically escorted from the office on the day he was dismissed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/26/virginia-shooter-disgruntled-employee-vester-lee-flanagan-video\">Link to video</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>After being dismissed from the Florida station, Flanagan made a career change, working as a customer service representative in the fraud investigations unit at Bank of America.

In a statement at the time, Daniel Dennison, the station’s news director, hailed him as a veteran reporter “with an enormous scope of experience” and described his recruitment as “a testament to the quality and professionalism” of their team.</p> <h2>In Virginia, ‘an unhappy man’</h2> <p>Yet Flanagan had a troubled time with WDBJ and ultimately lasted less than a year at the Virginia station.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/virginia-station-wdbj-journalists-killed\">WDBJ: Virginia TV station at center of fatal shooting is small but crucial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>WDBJ7 station manager Jeffrey Marks described Flanagan as “an unhappy man” who had a reputation as someone who was “difficult to work with” and was quick to “take offense”.</p> <p>“We employed him as a reporter, and he had some talent in that respect and some experience, although he’d been out of the business for a while,” Marks said.</p> <p>Flanagan was fired in 2013. The following March, he went to the city courts and sued the station, seeking money, according to public records. The case was later dismissed.</p> <p>“Eventually, after many incidents of his anger coming to the fore, we dismissed him,” Marks said. “And he did not take that well. We had to call the police to escort him from the building.”</p> <p>The Roanoke police department would not confirm that Flanagan had been escorted from the newsroom.</p> <p>Flanagan suggested on Twitter that he had also filed a complaint against the television station with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On Twitter he alleged that Parker specifically had made “racist comments”.</p> <p>“EEOC report filed,” Flanagan wrote. “They hired her after that???” In a separate tweet, he added: “Adam went to [human resources] after working with me one time!!!”</p> <p>Marks said the station investigated the complaint but none of the offenses “could be corroborated”. He concluded that they were “fabricated”.</p> <p>Virginia officials on Wednesday said: “It appears that things had spiraled out of control.”</p> <p>Asked to confirm Flanagan’s claim, a spokeswoman for the EEOC said: “With respect to the individual you mention, we cannot confirm that a complaint has been filed with the EEOC because of Title 7 confidentiality provisions. The only time we can speak publicly about a case is when, as a last resort, EEOC files a lawsuit against an employer.”</p> <p>CNN reported on Wednesday that, despite his latest career setback, Flanagan had begun looking for more work in television news and had applied for jobs with the national cable network.</p> <p>Public records indicate Flanagan did not have a criminal record. In 2004, he was charged with driving with an altered or revoked driver’s licence and having no registration on his vehicle in Pitt County, North Carolina, according to court records. </p> <p>A clerk at the Pitt County district court said on Wednesday the case was voluntarily dismissed by the district attorney’s office in June 2004. “Typically if the person complies by getting those things in order, the DA will dismiss,” said the clerk.</p> <p>On a Facebook page that appears to have been run by the gunman under the pseudonym Bryce Williams, Flanagan appears to have uploaded several silent video recordings of stories on which he worked, including one that shows him in a store holding a weapon.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Flanagan is alleged to have arrived at Bridgewater Plaza, a shopping and entertainment center near Smith Mountain Lake, where Parker and Ward were interviewing Gardner, the executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>Graphic videos posted to a Twitter account purporting to be run by the gunman show the approach toward Parker from the gunman’s point of view. The reporter is standing on a deck interviewing Gardner as Ward films. </p> <p>The three continue the live interview and do not appear to notice the approaching person. The person filming then angles alongside the cameraman and aims a handgun directly at Parker.</p> <p>A second video shows the gunman shooting at Parker as she runs away from the shots. The video then cuts. The Twitter account has now been suspended. A single video of the shooting was also posted on a Facebook page that appears to have been run by the gunman under the name Bryce Williams. </p> <p>An image taken by Ward, the cameraman, appears to show the shooter just before Ward’s death.</p> <p>The gunman then fled the scene, prompting a multi-agency manhunt. Virginia state police said they spotted the suspect’s car around 11.30am on Interstate 66, describing the confrontation with the suspect in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VirginiaStatePolice/posts/10153843969460101\">a post</a> on Facebook.</p> <p>Authorities tried to pull over the car, but the driver refused to stop. Moments later, the suspect’s car ran off the road and crashed. When troopers approached the car they found a man they identified as the suspect suffering from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p> <p>Flanagan was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died on Wednesday, according to authorities.</p> <p>“This gentleman was disturbed in some way at the way things had transpired in his life,” Franklin County sheriff Bill Overton said at a news conference.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Oliver Laughland in New York</em></p>","linkText":"Virginia TV shooter Vester Lee Flanagan was a 'disturbed' and 'unhappy man'","lastModified":1440636452000,"standfirst":"<p>Decade of lawsuits alleging racism at work culminated in ABC News fax claiming attack was revenge for Charleston church shooting in June</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4bpbg","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","url":"/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Virginia TV news shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/us-news","url":"/us-news/us-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/virginia","url":"/us-news/virginia","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Virginia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/us-crime","url":"/us-news/us-crime","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-crime","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/news","url":"/tone/news","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/lauren-gambino","url":"/profile/lauren-gambino","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Lauren Gambino","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-gambino","twitterHandle":"LGamGam","bio":"<p>Lauren is a reporter at the Guardian US in New York</p>","contributorLargeImagePath":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413212606419/Lauren-Gambino-R.png","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413212588187/Lauren-Gambino.jpg","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/jon-swaine","url":"/profile/jon-swaine","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Jon Swaine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jon-swaine","twitterHandle":"jonswaine","bio":"<p>Jon Swaine is a senior reporter based in New York.

reporter</h2> <p>Alison Parker was a rising star at the Virginia station where she first began her career as an intern. The WDBJ-7 newsroom was the center of her professional world and also where she fell in love.</p> <p>Parker had been quietly dating Chris Hurst, an anchor at the station, for nearly nine months. They had just moved in together and were planning to marry, Hurst said on Twitter. </p> <p>“She was the most radiant woman I ever met,” Hurst wrote. “And for some reason she loved me back.”</p> <p>Hurst said the pair had not been public about their relationship, but were “very much in love”. He said her death has left him “numb”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrishurstwdbj/statuses/636531364356063232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We didn&#39;t share this publicly, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AParkerWDBJ7\">@AParkerWDBJ7</a> and I were very much in love. We just moved in together. I am numb. <a href=\"http://t.co/tUrHVwAXcN\">pic.twitter.com/tUrHVwAXcN</a></p>&mdash; Chris Hurst (@chrishurstwdbj) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrishurstwdbj/status/636531364356063232\">August 26, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“It was the best nine months of our lives,” he wrote. “We wanted to get married. We just celebrated her 24th birthday.”</p> <p>Parker spent her birthday with family and friends on the Nantahala river in North Carolina, according to her Facebook profile. </p> <p>“I’ve been MIA for the last few days,” Parker wrote on Facebook. “I was on the Nantahala River in North Carolina with friends and family for some birthday fun and time off. I’ll be back on Mornin’ Tuesday-Friday and then on the anchor desk this Saturday!”</p> <p>Her colleagues described her as a “rockstar” with a sharp news sense who impressed everyone at the station with her zeal and passion. She had just finished working on a special report on child abuse for the station, her colleagues said. </p> <p>“She was a rockstar here at WDBJ,” said Kimberly McBroom, an anchor at the station. “She really has done a wonderful job reporting and filling in anchoring. You throw anything at that girl and she could do it.”</p> <p>Parker was a morning reporter for the Roanoke station and a native of Virginia, having spent most of her life outside Martinsville. She started with WDBJ as an intern while a student at James Madison University, her biography on the station’s website says.</p> <p>“It was that internship that took the skills I learned at JMU and allowed me to apply them. That internship made me fall in love with the business, and I knew broadcast journalism was exactly what I wanted to pursue,” she <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/arts_and_entertainment/martinsville-native-and-jmu-grad-joins-wdbj-news-team/article_e9bda08a-d7c5-11e3-b9e0-0017a43b2370.html\">told the Roanoke Times</a> in May 2014. </p> <p>She added: “I grew up watching WDBJ-7. So it’s wonderful be back [sic] in Virginia and to be a part of the news team here.” </p> <p>After graduating from university she went on to work as a producer at WCTI-TV, in Jacksonville, North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparker91\">according to LinkedIn</a>. She was also a contributing writer for Port and Main magazine. </p> <h2>Adam Ward, photographer </h2> <p>Adam Ward had an infectious smile that lit up the newsroom, even in the earliest hours of the workday. He had a lot to smile about, said his colleagues at WDBJ7, a CBS affiliate serving southern Virginia: he was engaged to Melissa Ott, a morning producer at the station, and was preparing to follow her to Charlotte, where she recently got a new job. </p> <p>“There were a lot of good things happening for Adam,” said Kimberly McBroom, an anchor at the station during an emotional broadcast following the shooting. </p> <p>Ward, who had just turned 27, was described by his colleagues as a gregarious, hardworking photojournalist, and an avid fan of his alma mater, Virginia Tech. </p> <p> “We get here really early in the morning and when we get in, they just make this newsroom come alive,” said the station’s morning meteorologist, Leo Hirshburner.</p> <p>Hirshburner added that Ward would wake up the groggy news crew with his excited banter about Virginia Tech football or anything else that happened to catch his attention that morning.</p> <p>Ward attended the local Salem high school in Virginia and graduated from Virginia Tech in 2011. Soon after, he started working in the production department at WDBJ. He then worked as a camera operator in the studio and later a cameraman in the field. </p> <p>“He proved himself to be just a fine photojournalist, and the kind of guy who [when he] was on his way home from work and heard about something breaking, he would just turn around and go do it,” said Jeffrey Marks, the station’s general manager.</p> <p>Ward was considering his impending move to Charlotte as a possible opportunity to switch careers, McBroom said. She said Ward had told her: “I think I’m going to get out of news. I think I’m going to do something else.”</p> <p>Wednesday morning was Ott’s last day at the station, McBroom said. Allison Parker brought her balloons, and McBroom brought a cake. </p> <p>Ward would then join Parker for a shoot at Bridgewater Plaza near Smith Mountain Lake while Ott returned to the production galley for her last morning shift. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/virginia-gunman-kills-reporter-cameraman\">Ward and Parker were killed</a> when a shooter approached the television crew during a live interview on Wednesday morning. Shots rang out as Parker interviewed another woman. In the footage, the woman screams. As the camera crashes to the ground, the audience glimpses the shooter. The station cuts back to the studio. </p> <h2>Vicki Gardner ‘recovering and in stable condition’</h2> <p>The only survivor of the triple shooting was listed in stable condition at a hospital following the incident, according to local news reports.</p> <p>The victim, Vicki Gardner, 61, is an economic development executive in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, where the shooting occurred. She was being interviewed by the news crew when the gunman opened fire.<br /></p> <p>“She is currently recovering and is in stable condition,” Chris Turnbull, a spokesman for Carilion Roanoke Memorial hospital, was quoted as saying. Gardner underwent emergency surgery for unspecified wounds, the hospital told reporters.</p> <p>Travelling from Florida to Virginia, Gardner’s daughter, Erin Arnold, said she learned of the shooting from her father. “He’s stoic. He never gets hysterical. But to me it all still feels surreal,” she said. </p> <p>Arnold described her mother as “incredible”: “She’s 60 years old and still wakeboards. She still climbs up and paints the lighthouse.” </p> <p>“I’m just grateful she’s alive,” Arnold said. </p> <p>On the shooter, she added: “God rest his soul.”</p> <p>A colleague on the regional chamber of commerce, Jessica Gauldin, told <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/third-victim-in-virginia-shooting-is-head-of-local-chamber-of-commerce/2015/08/26/1ad878a4-4c03-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html\">the Washington Post</a> that the outlook for Gardner was good.</p> <p>“She has suffered some internal damage, but she’s stabilized right now and it looks good,” Gauldin said.</p> <p>Gardner was being interviewed by the news crew on the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the local reservoir. She had been head of the Smith Mountain Lake regional chamber of commerce for 13 years.<br /></p> <p>“Vicki is the face of Smith Mountain Lake,” Liz Hock, a former local editor, <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/crime/franklin_county/shooting-victim-vicki-gardner-the-face-of-smith-mountain-lake/article_eda38c8a-2aa6-589d-af77-99ef5aaf256e.html\">told</a> a news outlet in the nearby city of Roanoke. “Gardner is always accessible to the media, and in answer to any question replies: ‘Life is wonderful at Smith Mountain Lake.’”</p> <p>The lake, a popular recreational boating and leisure site, is a large reservoir created in 1963 by the damming of the Roanoke River.</p> <p>According to a profile for Gardner on Facebook, she grew up in New York state and lives with her husband in a town about a mile from the lake.</p>","linkText":"Alison Parker and Adam Ward: 'rockstar' reporter and gregarious cameraman","lastModified":1441009914000,"standfirst":"<p>Ward and Parker were killed when a shooter approached their crew during a live interview, while third victim Vicki Gardner is recovering at a local hospital</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4bp7j","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","url":"/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Virginia TV news shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/virginia","url":"/us-news/virginia","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Virginia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/us-crime","url":"/us-news/us-crime","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-crime","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"us-news/us-news","url":"/us-news/us-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/news","url":"/tone/news","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/lauren-gambino","url":"/profile/lauren-gambino","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Lauren Gambino","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-gambino","twitterHandle":"LGamGam","bio":"<p>Lauren is a reporter at the Guardian US in New York</p>","contributorLargeImagePath":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413212606419/Lauren-Gambino-R.png","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413212588187/Lauren-Gambino.jpg","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/tommccarthy","url":"/profile/tommccarthy","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tom McCarthy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tommccarthy","twitterHandle":"TeeMcSee","bio":"<p>Tom McCarthy joined the Guardian US in 2012.

swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms</a> after more than 16 hours of negotiations in Brussels. He has agreed to immediately pass laws to further reform the tax and pension system, liberalise the labour market, and open up closed professions. Sunday trading laws will be relaxed, and even milk producers and bakers will be deregulated.</p> \n  <p>The Financial Times has dubbed it:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>the most intrusive economic supervision programme ever mounted in the EU.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Greece was forced to accept these measures after Germany piled intense pressure, as a price for a new deal.

If agreement is reached, talks can then begin towards a a new three-year bailout worth up to €86bn (£61bn), accompanied by further monitoring by Greece’s creditors.</p> \n  <p>The deal appears to end Greece’s five-month battle with its creditors, which has gripped the eurozone, dominated the political agenda and alarmed the markets.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live#block-55a36d79e4b05111b7559d2c\"><strong>Emerging from the summit, Tsipras admitted it had been tough</strong></a> - but insisted he had won concessions on debt relief (sometime in the future) as well as the medium-term funding plan.</p> \n  <p>He also managed to persuade the eurozone that a new investment fund, that will manage and sell off €50bn Greek assets, would be based in Athens not Luxembourg.</p> \n  <p>But generally, Tsipras appears to have finally capitulated in the face of threats that Greece would be ejected from the eurozone.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/statuses/620535643098091520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Two separate people who saw Tsipras last night described him as a \"beaten dog\" <a href=\"http://t.co/aFBx7nPWpZ\">http://t.co/aFBx7nPWpZ</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/NtQGjPahIP\">pic.twitter.com/NtQGjPahIP</a></p>— Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/620535643098091520\">July 13, 2015</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Attention now turns to Athens, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live#block-55a2b47be4b07fc6a121fc54\">Tsipras will arrive home to swirling speculation of cabinet reshuffles, unity governments and even fresh elections</a>.</p> \n  <p>To catch up with the action, visit our new liveblog here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/13/greek-crisis-tsipras-battle-bailout-deal-backlash-live\">Greek crisis: Tsipras faces uphill battle to implement bailout deal - live updates</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T11:22:38.484Z\">at 12.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div><div id=\"block-55a3916be4b05111b7559dc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katieallen\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T10:44:28.035Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Stock markets around Europe have welcomed the tentative deal reached in Brussels this morning.</strong></p> \n  <p>The eurozone’s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index hit a two-week high in morning trading and is currently up around 2%.

Over her breakfast coffee, she watched the last of Georgia’s hills recede and the red earth appear, and with it tin-roofed houses set in the middle of swept yards, and in the yards the inevitable verbena grew, surrounded by whitewashed tires. She grinned when she saw her first TV antenna atop an unpainted Negro house; as they multiplied, her joy rose.<br></p>\n <p>Jean Louise Finch always made this journey by air, but she decided to go by train from New York to Maycomb Junction on her fifth annual trip home. For one thing, she had the life scared out of her the last time she was on a plane: the pilot elected to fly through a tornado. For another thing, flying home meant her father rising at three in the morning, driving a hundred miles to meet her in Mobile, and doing a full day’s work afterwards: he was seventy-two now and this was no longer fair.</p>\n <p><br>She was glad she had decided to go by train. Trains had changed since her childhood, and the novelty of the experience amused her: a fat genie of a porter materialized when she pressed a button on a wall; at her bidding a stainless steel washbasin popped out of another wall, and there was a john one could prop one’s feet on. She resolved not to be intimidated by several messages stenciled around her compartment – a roomette, they called it – but when she went to bed the night before, she succeeded in folding herself up into the wall because she had ignored an injunction to PULL THIS LEVER DOWN OVER BRACKETS, a situation remedied by the porter to her embarrassment, as her habit was to sleep only in pajama tops.</p>\n <p><br>Luckily, he happened to be patrolling the corridor when the trap snapped shut with her in it: “I’ll get you out, Miss,” he called in answer to her poundings from within. “No please,” she said. “Just tell me how to get out.” “I can do it with my back turned,” he said, and did.</p>\n <p><br>When she awoke that morning the train was switching and chugging in the Atlanta yards, but in obedience to another sign in her compartment she stayed in bed until College Park flashed by. When she dressed, she put on her Maycomb clothes: gray slacks, a black sleeveless blouse, white socks, and loafers. Although it was four hours away, she could hear her aunt’s sniff of disapproval.</p>\n <p><br>When she was starting on her fourth cup of coffee the Crescent Limited honked like a giant goose at its northbound mate and rumbled across the Chattahoochee into Alabama.</p>\n <p><br>The Chattahoochee is wide, flat, and muddy. It was low today; a yellow sandbar had reduced its flow to a trickle. Perhaps it sings in the wintertime, she thought: I do not remember a line of that poem. Piping down the valleys wild? No. Did he write to a waterfowl, or was it a waterfall?</p>\n <p><br>She sternly repressed a tendency to boisterousness when she reflected that Sidney Lanier must have been somewhat like her long-departed cousin, Joshua Singleton St Clair, whose private literary preserves stretched from the Black Belt to Bayou La Batre. Jean Louise’s aunt often held up Cousin Joshua to her as a family example not lightly to be discountenanced: he was a splendid figure of a man, he was a poet, he was cut off in his prime, and Jean Louise would do well to remember that he was a credit to the family. His pictures did the family well – Cousin Joshua looked like a ratty Algernon Swinburne.</p>\n <p><br>Jean Louise smiled to herself when she remembered her father telling her the rest of it. Cousin Joshua was cut off, all right, not by the hand of God but by Caesar’s hosts. </p>\n <p><br>When at the University, Cousin Joshua studied too hard and thought too much; in fact, he read himself straight out of the nineteenth century. He affected an Inverness cape and wore jackboots he had a blacksmith make up from his own design. Cousin Joshua was frustrated by the authorities when he fired upon the president of the University, who in his opinion was little more than a sewage disposal expert. This was no doubt true, but an idle excuse for assault with a deadly weapon. After much passing around of money Cousin Joshua was moved across the tracks and placed in state accommodations for the irresponsible, where he remained for the rest of his days. They said he was reasonable in every respect until someone mentioned that president’s name, then his face would become distorted, he would assume a whooping crane attitude and hold it for eight hours or more, and nothing or nobody could make him lower his leg until he forgot about that man. On clear days Cousin Joshua read Greek, and he left a thin volume of verse printed privately by a firm in Tuscaloosa. The poetry was so ahead of its time no one has deciphered it yet, but Jean Louise’s aunt keeps it displayed casually and prominently on a table in the living-room.</p>\n <p><br>Jean Louise laughed aloud, then looked around to see if anyone had heard her. Her father had a way of undermining his sister’s lectures on the innate superiority of any given Finch: he always told his daughter the rest of it, quietly and solemnly, but Jean Louise sometimes thought she detected an unmistakably profane glint in Atticus Finch’s eyes, or was it merely the light hitting his glasses? She never knew.</p>\n <p><br>The countryside and the train had subsided to a gentle roll, and she could see nothing but pastureland and black cows from window to horizon. She wondered why she had never thought her country beautiful.</p>\n <p><br>The station at Montgomery nestled in an elbow of the Alabama, and when she got off the train to stretch her legs, the returning familiar with its drabness, lights, and curious odors rose to meet her. There is something missing, she thought. Hotboxes, that’s it. A man goes along under the train with a crowbar. There is a clank and then <em>s-sss-sss</em>, white smoke comes up and you think you’re inside a chafing dish. These things run on oil now.</p>\n <p><br>For no reason an ancient fear gnawed her. She had not been in this station for twenty years, but when she was a child and went to the capital with Atticus, she was terrified lest the swaying train plunge down the riverbank and drown them all. But when she boarded again for home, she forgot.</p>\n <p><br>The train clacketed through pine forests and honked derisively at a gaily painted bell-funneled museum piece sidetracked in a clearing. It bore the sign of a lumber concern, and the Crescent Limited could have swallowed it whole with room to spare. Greenville, Evergreen, Maycomb Junction.</p>\n <p><br>She had told the conductor not to forget to let her off, and because the conductor was an elderly man, she anticipated his joke: he would rush at Maycomb Junction like a bat out of hell and stop the train a quarter of a mile past the little station, then when he bade her goodbye he would say he was sorry, he almost forgot. Trains changed; conductors never did. Being funny at flag stops with young ladies was a mark of the profession, and Atticus, who could predict the actions of every conductor from New Orleans to Cincinnati, would be waiting accordingly not six steps away from her point of debarkation.</p>\n <p><br>Home was Maycomb County, a gerrymander some seventy miles long and spreading thirty miles at its widest point, a wilderness dotted with tiny settlements the largest of which was Maycomb, the county seat. Until comparatively recently in its history, Maycomb County was so cut off from the rest of the nation that some of its citizens, unaware of the South’s political predilections over the past ninety years, still voted Republican. No trains went there – Maycomb Junction, a courtesy title, was located in Abbott County, twenty miles away. Bus service was erratic and seemed to go nowhere, but the Federal Government had forced a highway or two through the swamps, thus giving the citizens an opportunity for free egress. But few people took advantage of the roads, and why should they? If you did not want much, there was plenty.</p>\n <p><br>The county and the town were named for a Colonel Mason Maycomb, a man whose misplaced self-confidence and overweening willfulness brought confusion and confoundment to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. The territory in which he operated was vaguely hilly in the north and flat in the south, on the fringes of the coastal plain. Colonel Maycomb, convinced that Indians hated to fight on flat land, scoured the northern reaches of the territory looking for them. When his general discovered that Maycomb was meandering in the hills while the Creeks were lurking in every pine thicket in the south, he dispatched a friendly Indian runner to Maycomb with the message, <em>Move south, damn you</em>. Maycomb was convinced this was a Creek plot to trap him (was there not a blue-eyed, red-headed devil leading them?), he made the friendly Indian runner his prisoner, and he moved farther north until his forces became hopelessly lost in the forest primeval, where they sat out the wars in considerable bewilderment.<br></p>\n <p>After enough years had passed to convince Colonel Maycomb that the message might have been genuine after all, he began a purposeful march to the south, and on the way his troops encountered settlers moving inland, who told them the Indian Wars were about over. The troops and the settlers were friendly enough to become Jean Louise Finch’s ancestors, and Colonel Maycomb pressed on to what is now Mobile to make sure his exploits were given due credit. Recorded history’s version does not coincide with the truth, but these are the facts, because they were passed down by word of mouth through the years, and every Maycombian knows them.<br></p>\n <p>“…get your bags, Miss,” the porter said. Jean Louise followed him from the lounge car to her compartment. She took two dollars from her billfold: one for routine, one for releasing her last night. The train, of course, rushed like a bat out of hell past the station and came to a stop 440 yards beyond it. The conductor appeared, grinning, and said he was sorry, he almost forgot. Jean Louise grinned back and waited impatiently for the porter to put the yellow step in place. He handed her down and she gave him the two bills.</p>\n <p>Her father was not waiting for her.<br></p>\n <p>She looked up the track toward the station and saw a tall man standing on the tiny platform. He jumped down and ran to meet her.<br></p>\n <p>He grabbed her in a bear hug, put her from him, kissed her hard on the mouth, then kissed her gently. “Not here, Hank,” she murmured, much pleased.<br></p>\n <p>“Hush, girl,” he said, holding her face in place. “I’ll kiss you on the courthouse steps if I want to.”<br></p>\n <p>The possessor of the right to kiss her on the courthouse steps was Henry Clinton, her lifelong friend, her brother’s comrade, and if he kept on kissing her like that, her husband. Love whom you will but marry your own kind was a dictum amounting to instinct within her. Henry Clinton was Jean Louise’s own kind, and now she did not consider the dictum particularly harsh.<br></p>\n <p>They walked arm-in-arm down the track to collect her suitcase. “How’s Atticus?” she said.<br></p>\n <p>“His hands and shoulders are giving him fits today.” <br></p>\n <p>“He can’t drive when they’re like that, can he?”<br></p>\n <p>Henry closed the fingers of his right hand halfway and said, “He can’t close them any more than this. Miss Alexandra has to tie his shoes and button his shirts when they’re like that. He can’t even hold a razor.”<br></p>\n <p>Jean Louise shook her head. She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight. “Isn’t there anything they can do?”<br></p>\n <p>“You know there isn’t,” Henry said. “He takes seventy grains of aspirin a day and that’s all.”<br></p>\n <p>Henry picked up her heavy suitcase, and they walked back toward the car. She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out. Hardly like Atticus: if you asked him how he was feeling he would tell you, but he never complained; his disposition remained the same, so in order to find out how he was feeling, you had to ask him.<br></p>\n <p>The only way Henry found out about it was by accident. One day when they were in the records vault at the courthouse running a land title, Atticus hauled out a heavy mortgage book, turned stark white, and dropped it. “What’s the matter?” Henry had said. “Rheumatoid arthritis. Can you pick it up for me?” said Atticus. Henry asked him how long he’d had it; Atticus said six months. Did Jean Louise know it? No. Then he’d better tell her. “If you tell her she’ll be down here trying to nurse me. The only remedy for this is not to let it beat you.” The subject was closed.<br></p>\n <p>“Want to drive?” said Henry.<br></p>\n <p>“Don’t be silly,” she said. Although she was a respectable driver, she hated to operate anything mechanical more complicated than a safety pin: folding lawn chairs were a source of profound irritation to her; she had never learned to ride a bicycle or use a typewriter; she fished with a pole. Her favorite game was golf because its essential principles consisted of a stick, a small ball, and a state of mind.<br></p>\n <p>With green envy, she watched Henry’s effortless mastery of the automobile. Cars are his servants, she thought. “Power steering? Automatic transmission?” she said.<br></p>\n <p>“You bet,” he said.<br></p>\n <p>“Well, what if everything shuts off and you don’t have any gears to shift. You’d be in trouble then, wouldn’t you?”<br></p>\n <p>“But everything won’t shut off.”<br></p>\n <p>“How do you know?”<br></p>\n <p>“That’s what faith is. Come here.”<br></p>\n <p>Faith in General Motors. She put her head on his shoulder. “Hank,” she said presently. “What really happened?” <br></p>\n <p>This was an old joke between them. A pink scar started under his right eye, hit the corner of his nose, and ran diagonally across his upper lip. Behind his lip were six false front teeth not even Jean Louise could induce him to take out and show her. He came home from the war with them. A German, more to express his displeasure at the end of the war than anything else, had bashed him in the face with a rifle butt. Jean Louise had chosen to think this a likely story: what with guns that shot over the horizon, B-17s, V-bombs, and the like, Henry had probably not been within spitting distance of the Germans.<br></p>\n <p>“Okay, honey,” he said. “We were down in a cellar in Berlin. Everybody had too much to drink and a fight started – you like to hear the believable, don’t you? Now will you marry me?”<br></p>\n <p>“Not yet.”<br></p>\n <p>“Why?”<br></p>\n <p>“I want to be like Dr Schweitzer and play until I’m thirty.”<br></p>\n <p>“He played all right,” said Henry grimly.<br></p>\n <p>Jean Louise moved under his arm. “You know what I mean,” she said. <br></p>\n <p>“Yes.”<br></p>\n <p>There was no finer young man, said the people of Maycomb, than Henry Clinton. Jean Louise agreed. Henry was from the southern end of the county. His father had left his mother soon after Henry was born, and she worked night and day in her little crossroads store to send Henry through the Maycomb public schools. Henry, from the time he was twelve, boarded across the street from the Finch house, and this in itself put him on a higher plane: he was his own master, free from the authority of cooks, yardmen, and parents. He was also four years her senior, which made a difference then. He teased her; she adored him. When he was fourteen his mother died, leaving him next to nothing. Atticus Finch looked after what little money there was from the sale of the store – her funeral expenses took most of it – he secretly supplemented it with money of his own, and got Henry a job clerking in the Jitney Jungle after school. Henry graduated and went into the Army, and after the war he went to the University and studied law.<br></p>\n <p>Just about that time, Jean Louise’s brother dropped dead in his tracks one day, and after the nightmare of that was over, Atticus, who had always thought of leaving his practice to his son, looked around for another young man. It was natural for him to engage Henry, and in due course Henry became Atticus’s legman, his eyes, and his hands. Henry had always respected Atticus Finch; soon it melded to affection and Henry regarded him as a father.<br></p>\n <p>He did not regard Jean Louise as a sister. In the years when he was away at the war and the University, she had turned from an overalled, fractious, gun-slinging creature into a reasonable facsimile of a human being. He began dating her on her annual two-week visits home, and although she still moved like a thirteen-year-old boy and abjured most feminine adornment, he found something so intensely feminine about her that he fell in love. She was easy to look at and easy to be with most of the time, but she was in no sense of the word an easy person. She was afflicted with a restlessness of spirit he could not guess at, but he knew she was the one for him. He would protect her; he would marry her.<br></p>\n <p>“Tired of New York?” he said.<br></p>\n <p>“No.”<br></p>\n <p>“Give me a free hand for these two weeks and I’ll make you tired of it.”<br></p>\n <p>“Is that an improper suggestion?”<br></p>\n <p>“Yes.”<br></p>\n <p>“Go to hell, then.”<br></p>\n <p>Henry stopped the car. He turned off the ignition switch, slewed around, and looked at her. She knew when he became serious about something: his crew cut bristled like an angry brush, his face colored, its scar reddened.<br></p>\n <p>“Honey, do you want me to put it like a gentleman? Miss Jean Louise, I have now reached an economic status that can provide for the support of two. I, like Israel of Old, have labored seven years in the vineyards of the University and the pastures of your daddy’s office for you –”<br></p>\n <p>“I’ll tell Atticus to make it seven more.”<br></p>\n <p>“Hateful.”<br></p>\n <p>“Besides,” she said, “it was Jacob anyway. No, they were the same. They always changed their names every third verse. How’s Aunty?”<br></p>\n <p>“You know good and well she’s been fine for thirty years. Don’t change the subject.”<br></p>\n <p>Jean Louise’s eyebrows flickered. “Henry,” she said primly, “I’ll have an affair with you but I won’t marry you.”<br></p>\n <p>It was exactly right.<br></p>\n <p>“Don’t be such a damn child, Jean Louise!” Henry sputtered, and forgetting the latest dispensations from General Motors, grabbed for a gearshift and stomped at a clutch. These denied him, he wrenched the ignition key violently, pressed some buttons, and the big car glided slowly and smoothly down the highway.<br></p>\n <p>“Slow pickup, isn’t it?” she said. “No good for city driving.” Henry glared at her. “What do you mean by that?”<br></p>\n <p>In another minute this would become a quarrel. He was serious. She’d better make him furious, thus silent, so she could think about it.<br></p>\n <p>“Where’d you get that appalling tie?” she said. <br></p>\n <p>Now.<br></p>\n <p>She was almost in love with him. No, that’s impossible, she thought: either you are or you aren’t. Love’s the only thing in this world that is unequivocal. There are different kinds of love, certainly, but it’s a you-do or you-don’t proposition with them all.<br></p>\n <p>She was a person who, when confronted with an easy way out, always took the hard way. The easy way out of this would be to marry Hank and let him labor for her. After a few years, when the children were waist-high, the man would come along whom she should have married in the first place. There would be searchings of hearts, fevers and frets, long looks at each other on the post office steps, and misery for everybody. The hollering and the high-mindedness over, all that would be left would be another shabby little affair à la the Birmingham country club set, and a self-constructed private Gehenna with the latest Westinghouse appliances. Hank didn’t deserve that.<br></p>\n <p>No. For the present she would pursue the stony path of spinsterhood. She set about restoring peace with honor:<br></p>\n <p>“Honey, I’m sorry, truly sorry,” she said, and she was.<br></p>\n <p>“That’s okay,” said Henry, and slapped her knee. “It’s just that I could kill you sometimes.”<br></p>\n <p>“I know I’m hateful.”<br></p>\n <p>Henry looked at her. “You’re an odd one, sweet. You can’t dissemble.”<br></p>\n <p>She looked at him. “What are you talking about?”<br></p>\n <p>“Well, as a general rule, most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you <em>are</em> hateful.”<br></p>\n <p>“Isn’t it fairer for a man to be able to see what he’s letting himself in for?”<br></p>\n <p>“Yes, but don’t you see you’ll never catch a man that way?”<br></p>\n <p>She bit her tongue on the obvious, and said, “How do I go about being an enchantress?”<br></p>\n <p>Henry warmed to his subject. At thirty, he was an adviser. Maybe because he was a lawyer. “First,” he said dispassionately, “hold your tongue. Don’t argue with a man, especially when you know you can beat him. Smile a lot. Make him feel big. Tell him how wonderful he is, and wait on him.”<br></p>\n <p>She smiled brilliantly and said, “Hank, I agree with everything you’ve said. You are the most perspicacious individual I’ve met in years, you are six feet five, and may I light your cigarette? How’s that?”<br></p>\n <p>“Awful.”<br></p>\n <p>They were friends again. <br></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>This is an extract from Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee, published on 14 July by William Heinemann at £18.99.

She watches the familiar pine forest stream past the window and tussles with the unfamiliar mechanics of the foldaway bed in her sleeping car. And along the way, Harper Lee fills us in on family background and civic history – because this is intended as a scene-setting chapter and she assumes we have no prior connection to the woman on the train. Instead, we alight on these pages like visitors from the future. Back in the mid-1950s, when these words were set down, Lee’s prose would have come across as easy, elegant and assured. In 2015, knowing all that we do, her bright rush of information arrives with the force of a blow to the chest.</p> <p>Take, for instance, what many will single out as the chapter’s key line: “She had turned from an overalled, fractious, gun-slinging creature into a reasonable facsimile of a human being.” Originally meant to sketch Watchman’s 26-year-old protagonist, it has since turned on its head to become a piercing elegy for the six-year-old Scout, who grew up and changed. Elsewhere the pages contain other shocks that might have blown merrily past our ears were it not for the fact that we have spent time with these people. We are told that a major character from Mockingbird later died suddenly, and that unbending, heroic Atticus Finch suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and is too sick to make the drive out to the station.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/10/listen-to-reese-witherspoon-reading-the-first-chapter-of-harper-lees-go-set-a-watchman\">Listen to Reese Witherspoon reading Harper Lee's Go Set A Watchman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“His hands and shoulders are giving him fits today,” explains young Hank Clinton, who drives out in his stead. Hank, we learn, loves Jean Louise and she very nearly loves him back. Tellingly, Lee’s beautifully-written introduction ends with the two in the car heading home, and with a jokey, intimate exchange that turns several shades darker when viewed at a distance. Jean Louise (whom I still think of as Scout) is delighted to see Hank but suspects the relationship might flounder outside Maycomb County. And while she is pleased to be home, her happiness is cut with an undercurrent of sadness.</p> <p>All of this, it turns out, is entirely appropriate – albeit not in the way that the author intended. The intervening decades have worked a bittersweet magic on Go Set a Watchman. Time has reversed the points beneath Lee’s lovely opening chapter. Instead of clattering towards virgin territory, this carries us, bewitchingly, deep into the past.</p>","linkText":"Go Set a Watchman's first chapter, first review: a beguiling journey into the past","lastModified":1436521241000,"standfirst":"<p>Harper Lee’s companion novel to To Kill a Mockingbird introduces characters we already know, adding up to a moving reunion</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter\">Read the first chapter of Go Set a Watchman here</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/10/first-chapter-of-go-set-a-watchman-what-do-you-think\">What do you make of Go Set a Watchman’s first chapter?

Those of you still Harper Lee-obsessed and looking to watch and read on may want to have a look at this take from Bloomberg News, which updates us on the intrigue surrounding its publication. One interesting tidbit it reveals is that the editors and Lee’s lawyer, Tonja Carter, debated editing the n-word out of the original manuscript: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Already, the decision to leave it as is has made some anxious. For example, “there was some concern from Tonja’s end about the word ‘n-----.’ It’s in there quite a lot,” says Nurnberg. “I said, ‘This book was written in the 1950s. You can’t call someone a n----- by any other anodyne title.’ ”</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, tonight PBS will air <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/harper-lee/harper-lee-meeting-exclusive-report-from-filmmaker/3954/\">a 2012 documentary tonight</a> called Hey Boo, prepared by Lee’s friend Mary Murphy. (Check your local listings.) According to PBS, the documentary has been updated, and Murphy also apparently filmed a recent meeting with Lee, at which the ailing author was presented with a copy of her new book.</p> <p>Murphy plans to tweet during the broadcast on the hashtag #HarperLeePBS, if you want to ask questions about the full book.<br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559fe174e4b07fc6a121f87c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T15:23:51.776Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This just in from my colleague Lindesay Irvine: William Hill have <a href=\"http://www.williamhillplc.com/media/newsroom/media-releases/2015/could-harper-lee-win-the-booker-prize-with-go-set-a-watchman/\">set the odds</a> on Go Set a Watchman<em> </em>winning the Booker Prize at 33/1.

The bookstore’s release party (from midnight to 2am Monday night) will include finger food and a Gregory Peck imitator.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like a riot. There’s also a nice anecdote about a Harper Lee and a comma:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“She looked at it and said there should be no comma after the word ‘Go,’ ” says Sentell. “It was then pointed out to her by one of the editors that in the King James Version of Isaiah 21:6 there is a comma.” According to Sentell, Lee responded, ‘That’s the Lord’s Book. This is my book. And there is no comma.’”</p> </blockquote> <p>Can’t argue with that.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T14:36:47.107Z\">at 3.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559fd20be4b07fc6a121f7f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T14:25:28.714Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague and R Kelly fan, Lindesay Irvine, has directed me to this <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/book-blog/to-kill-a-mockingbird-inspires-generations-of-atticuses/article_a0f1ec1b-ae96-5fd5-9069-ca252937a2d5.html\">St Louis Dispatch report</a>, which is all about people naming their children after Harper Lee characters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Maybe we’re in for a future of solemn, nearsighted, fair-minded lawyers, all named Atticus.</p> <p>Well, they won’t all be lawyers. “I hope not,” said Susan Barrett with a laugh.</p> <p>But she does hope her little Atticus, just 4, grows up with a strong sense of justice.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b5eb98bcdaa0cb4ba7ddf59e08947826743213\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/42b5eb98bcdaa0cb4ba7ddf59e08947826743213/130_83_3046_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite that slightly dystopian opening sentence, things brighten up with an interesting look at the people who’ve named their children not only after Harper Lee characters and literary stars, but possibly Guardian journalists:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Heidi Langston of Jackson, Mo., also thinks her daughter Scout will love books.

And for a northern girl, I was completely absorbed by the children's story, and consternation at how injustices so obvious to an innocent could be so complicated.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-first-chapter-to-be-released-live-coverage#comment-55415598\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4611805\" title=\"View Liofa73’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Liofa73\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4611805\" title=\"View Liofa73’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Liofa73</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/55415598\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">10 July 2015 1:36pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>We read TKAM in high school when I was about 14. </p> <p>Our English teacher used to put on a deep south accent (she was English) when it was her turn to read aloud. </p> <p>I used to find it a bit weird, but thinking back it was quite special really, I can't imagine many teachers doing that now, they would probably be too afraid of ridicule from students.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>While Reese Witherspoon’s narration won over some readers (listeners?) …</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-first-chapter-to-be-released-live-coverage#comment-55417920\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10278458\" title=\"View Sherman Ellen’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/06/14/10278458/6c7fb34d-86ba-466f-b36e-d4deef9e5f2d/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Sherman Ellen\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10278458\" title=\"View Sherman Ellen’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Sherman Ellen</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/55417920\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">10 July 2015 2:13pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>At first I wanted Reece to read faster, then I settled in and was determined to use patients.

It reads like Harper Lee, it feels like <em>Mockingbird</em>. The only real difference, so far, is that <em>Watchman</em> is not told in the first person through the eyes of Scout ...</p> <p>There are a couple of gently comic scenes, which will put readers in mind of <em>Mockingbird</em> — “Trains changed; conductors never did. Being funny at flag stops with young ladies was a mark of the profession.”</p> <p>There is also the same sense of the importance of family background and one’s standing in the community (“Henry Clinton was Jean Louise’s own kind”). Also as in <em>Mockingbird</em>, there is a familiar passage on Colonel Maycomb and the foundation of Maycomb County, though the historical details are different.</p> <p>In this short extract we can see the seeds of future conflict, of the city girl returning to the deep South. Living in New York clearly has changed Jean Louise. At a superficial level, she dresses differently. On the train “she put on her Maycomb clothes: gray slacks, a black sleeveless blouse, white socks, and loafers”. Within minutes of arriving, she has rowed with Hank.</p> <p>Looking out of the train window, delighting at the passing scenery, “She wondered why she had never thought her country beautiful.”</p> <p>Though this first chapter is suffused with the nostalgia of homecoming, you get the strong sense, that the times are a-changin’ and it won’t necessarily make for a happy ending. Very promising.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f9b3de4b05111b75596eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/xanbrooks\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T10:17:53.258Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The intervening decades have worked a bittersweet magic on Go Set a Watchman, writes<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-first-chapter-review-moving-reunion-harper-lee\"> <strong>Xan Brooks</strong> in his first take on opening chapter</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Back in the mid-1950s, when these words were set down, Lee’s prose would have come across as easy, elegant and assured. In 2015, knowing all that we do, her bright rush of information arrives with the force of a blow to the chest.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Take, for instance, what many will single out as the chapter’s key line: “She had turned from an overalled, fractious, gun-slinging creature into a reasonable facsimile of a human being.” Originally meant to sketch Watchman’s 26-year-old protagonist, it has since turned on its head to become a piercing elegy for the six-year-old Scout, who grew up and changed. Elsewhere the pages contain other shocks that might have blown merrily past our ears were it not for the fact that we have spent time with these people. We are told that a major character from Mockingbird later died suddenly, and that unbending, heroic Atticus Finch suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and is too sick to make the drive out to the station.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“His hands and shoulders are giving him fits today,” explains young Hank Clinton, who drives out in his stead. Hank, we learn, loves Jean Louise and she very nearly loves him back. Tellingly, Lee’s beautifully-written introduction ends with the two in the car heading home, and with a jokey, intimate exchange that turns several shades darker when viewed at a distance. Jean Louise (whom I still think of as Scout) is delighted to see Hank but suspects the relationship might flounder outside Maycomb County. And while she is pleased to be home, her happiness is cut with an undercurrent of sadness.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f9931e4b07fc6a121f6ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T10:12:19.809Z\">11.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lee’s first chapter has the blessing of Friar Lee Barrett, a priest at St. Paul’s Cramlington, in Northumberland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zadokthepriest7/statuses/619446557503586304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I confess I was in two minds about this but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a> is off to a lovely start. <a href=\"https://t.co/7YIiE9cHlv\">https://t.co/7YIiE9cHlv</a></p>&mdash; Fr.

Scout’s conscious naivety, her humour, the dialogue and the unlaboured but brilliantly drawn description of the red earth and verbena of Maycomb take one right back to the halcyon days of To Kill A Mockingbird. It is like an old friend turning up unannounced after decades without contact only for the conversation to flow as it always did. Some have commented that the written voice is almost ghostly – which it is, being so firmly rooted in a time and space that is hardly recognisable. Scout’s priorities, and her position as one of literature’s loudest and most important advocates for civil rights, are still made clear, however subtly, as she smiles joyously within the first paragraph at signs that inequality is beginning to change in her home town: “She grinned when she saw her first TV antenna atop an unpainted Negro house; as they multiplied, her joy rose.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f8d2ee4b07fc6a121f67c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T09:21:01.769Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some bookshops and cinemas across the world are building up to the publication of the full version of Go Set a Watchman by showing screenings of the acclaimed film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/vromans/statuses/618175310824140800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FREE Screening of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToKillAMockingbird?src=hash\">#ToKillAMockingbird</a> film TONIGHT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SouthPasadenaCA\">@southpasadenaca</a> library @ 7pm!! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gosetawatchman?src=hash\">#gosetawatchman</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/dZrji4y07e\">http://t.co/dZrji4y07e</a></p>&mdash; Vroman&#39;s Bookstore (@vromans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vromans/status/618175310824140800\">July 6, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Isadoradoo/statuses/615912368497930240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the subject of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/films?src=hash\">#films</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/books?src=hash\">#books</a> the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DukeofYorks\">@DukeofYorks</a> are screening <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToKillAMockingbird?src=hash\">#ToKillAMockingbird</a> w/ launch of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fX3H2NlEig\">https://t.co/fX3H2NlEig</a></p>&mdash; Laura Harper (@Isadoradoo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Isadoradoo/status/615912368497930240\">June 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WstoneSheffield/statuses/619145134731620353\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5 Days! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a>  Launch party on Monday!

But what it sets up is lots of fascinating scenarios. The childhood friendships have gone ... Obviously Scout has a romantic association with the Black community which I suspect is going to really develop. It has also got a nice line in irony. It has this line: ‘Recorded history’s version does not coincide with the truth, but these are the facts, because [they were passed down by word of mouth through the years] and every Maycombian knows them.’</p> <p>So it is sort of setting up the idea of a reality that doesn’t accord with the facts.

Ms. Lee wrote “Watchman” in the mid-1950s, and she set it aside when her editor told her to rewrite it from the perspective of Scout as a child — advice that gave rise to the story that would become “Mockingbird.” When the news of the publication was announced last February, questions quickly arose about why Ms. Lee, who had long claimed she was satisfied with her single contribution to American literature, decided to release it after all this time.</p> <p>But whether or not it holds up to her <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1JYipnh\">Pulitzer Prize-winning debut novel</a>, “Watchman” will offer readers an unprecedented and unfiltered look into the mind and creative process of one of the country’s most revered and enigmatic authors. The novel, however flawed, promises to shed new light on familiar characters, and to offer a rare look at the unedited prose of a writer who was so rattled by fame and the weight of expectations that, for decades, it seemed all but certain that she would never publish another word.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f74cde4b05111b7559660\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T07:35:35.406Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Blowing our own trumpet alert...</p> <p>Lots of readers have been impressed by the way Guardian has presented the chapter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andrewmcdonald/statuses/619408114526240768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Guardian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a> page sets a new standard for book extracts online.

Jean Louise is shown to be grappling with two things as she comes home. Atticus, an almost godlike figure to the Scout of Mockingbird, is now in constant pain. “She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight … She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out.”</p> <p>She is also pondering whether or not she should marry a childhood friend of her brother’s, who muses ruefully that “most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you are hateful.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f4e34e4b07fc6a121f608\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T04:58:10.454Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few quick reviews from the Guardian Australia staff, who are a tough crowd.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What can you really judge about a book from one chapter?

And there’s beauty in the description. So in precis: not sure yet, but promising. - Emily Wilson</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I thought it was pretty clunky. Two nice turns of phrase – the one about Cousin Joshua’s poetry and the one about the troops and settlers being her ancestors – but otherwise so full of cliches and implausible dialogue that it’s pretty hard to read. - Alan Evans</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I listened rather than read and it sounded like someone reminiscing, which I guess is what it is, but in a vaguely annoying way. It verged on stream of consciousness but was also over-written; at times evocative, more often twee (though that may have been Witherspoon’s accent).

He’s shared his thoughts on a favourite quote from the book. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of To Kill a Mockingbird’s most enduring features is Harper Lee’s portrayal of Atticus Finch. He represents the very best of the law and the idea of due process. My favourite scene in To Kill a Mockingbird is Atticus Finch’s powerful courtroom showdown. It’s an incredible moment that has quite probably inspired a generation of lawyers. During the hearing, Finch gets up and says:</p> <p><em>“We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe – some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others – some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.</em><br /></p> <p><em>“But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal – there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of any Einstein and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court.”</em></p> <p>These lines are as powerful – and relevant – today as they were 50 years ago.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T03:59:57.556Z\">at 4.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559f40aae4b05111b7559614\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T03:49:42.641Z\">4.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Book people and their jokes, hey?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/twyodor/statuses/619351952170680320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q: What does Harper Lee tell people who have no interest in Wimbledon?&#10;A: Go Watch a Set, Man.&#10;&#10;(Don&#39;t forget to tip your waiter.)</p>&mdash; Twyodor Dostoevsky (@twyodor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twyodor/status/619351952170680320\">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559f3d44e4b05111b7559612\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-10T03:36:51.531Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chapter will be released soon!

Men with exotically striped blazers mix with tweed, fur and quilt. Tables groan with champagne and glistening quails’ eggs. “We’re all Tories here, aren’t we?” murmurs one patron, gesturing airily around him prior to this year’s England v Scotland game.</p> \n  <p>To many, Twickenham encapsulates English rugby. As with Marylebone Cricket Club and the All England Club, those other elite bastions, it can be a curious mix of modern business and old school. The late Philip Toynbee – “A bomb under the west car park at Twickenham on an international day would end fascism in England for a generation” – would these days find more new money at the Rugby Football Union’s headquarters but still recognise a certain breed of customer. It is an image of a sport that has proved resilient in the public mind – posh schoolboys, affluent country types and City suits at play.</p> \n  <p>A certain breed of customer: the crowds gather at Twickenham before England’s 2015 Six Nations match against Italy</p> \n  <p>The 2015 Rugby World Cup, frequently billed as the third largest sporting event on the planet, will bring a whole new audience into contact with the game. It is also a once in a generation chance to update some preconceptions. The World Cup is the RFU’s opportunity to convert those not around when Jonny Wilkinson landed his life-changing drop goal in Sydney in 2003. Over 2.2 million tickets for the event have been sold but Bill Beaumont, the chairman of the RFU whose younger son Josh represented England against the Barbarians this year, knows there is one other key ingredient. “The big thing that will drive participation – and no pressure on Stuart Lancaster – is the team succeeding. Kids like to be associated with success. We’ve got to ensure that when little Jimmy comes down to enjoy his first taste of rugby he enjoys it and we keep him. If he doesn’t like it he won’t come back. By the end of the year the World Cup will have come and gone and it won’t come again for a very long time.”</p> \n  <p>English rugby, despite the acclaim that greeted Clive Woodward’s World Cup-winning side of 12 years ago, remains a sport of confused identities. The English psyche, so cluttered with class-based, geographical and historical baggage, does not always help. New Zealand, with its hakas, silver ferns and cradle-to-grave devotion, knows no such confusion. It is a similar story in Wales, while in 1995 South Africa’s rugby team were hailed as a unifying force for a nation. But the English? The only characteristic upon which their neighbours agree is their alleged arrogance.</p> \n  <p>It is a familiar accusation. England are the biggest (and wealthiest) union in the world and are traditionally the least loved.</p> \n  <p>The conjunction of these two facts is no coincidence. The former Scotland and Lions forward Nathan Hines says arrogance was always a core theme of his side’s team talks before Calcutta Cup games at Twickenham. “Even if it wasn’t actual arrogance, there was that perception. It comes from way back, from history not just rugby. When a small nation plays a big nation, the big nation always likes to to stand up and try and bully everyone.”</p> \n  <p>By the time visitors actually get inside Twickenham, with its hashtag-heavy messages, references to ”Your England Team” and blizzard of corporate branding, such prejudices are frequently reinforced.</p> \n  <p>“I’d like to see this place after a 10-year barren spell to see how many true supporters there are,” mutters a kilted Scotland fan in the car park, convinced Twickenham attracts a different breed of spectator to other Six Nations grounds.</p> \n  <p>Twickenham, categorically, is not the whole or even the sum of English rugby. But our journey through the English game, from its western heartlands to northern outposts, might as well begin there. The Morris family from Ealing – father clad in a Russian-style winter hat, chucking a ball around with his son, Geronimo, in the Cardinal Vaughan – say the car park experience is an integral part of their day out. “The car park’s a big portion of it; I’d say it is 30% the car park and 70% the match,” says Mr Morris.</p> \n  <p>Geronimo might also enjoy a trip to Rugby School’s excellent museum. The majority of rugby men and women have always possessed a contrary streak, although whether this dates from William Webb Ellis’s era is debatable. A game that involved throwing a large ball around was played in Roman times and Webb Ellis’s “fine disregard” for the prevailing laws in 1823 was not trumpeted as such at the time. Even Rugby school’s archivist, Rusty MacLean, says Webb Ellis would not, contrary to popular legend, have picked up the ball but instead caught it prior to running upfield.</p> \n  <p>What is indisputable is the influence of Rugby school on the sport that shares the town’s name. Walk across the immaculate first-team pitch in the famous Close and it is easy to understand how the game’s upmarket reputation took hold. The ethos of muscular Christianity promoted during Dr Thomas Arnold’s period as headmaster had found the perfect vehicle and the educated classes spearheaded the sport’s development. The first five presidents of the RFU were Old Rugbeians and England’s white jerseys also originated at the school. Ten Old Rugbeians also featured in the first England side to play an international game, against Scotland at Edinburgh’s Raeburn Place in 1871. When the northern clubs broke away in 1895, it was not to become professional but because the RFU would not sanction broken time payments – compensation for missed hours of work. The schism that created the sport of rugby league still shapes the way union is perceived 120 years later.</p> \n  <p>Outside Wigan’s DW Stadium there is still little love lost between union and league. Two longstanding female fans are adamant league is far more exciting. “I find union boring,” complains one. “They get the ball and you think they’re going to run but then they kick it. They’re not as good-looking either.” There are few RFU debenture holders in a town where the 13-a-side game exerts an iron grip.</p> \n  <p>Most local schoolboys here would no more dream of playing union than they would lacrosse. No school within the town plays union seriously any more. At John Fisher Catholic high school – alma mater of umpteen international players, including Shaun Edwards and Chris Ashton – league is the undisputed king. “They might [watch England at the World Cup] if Sam Burgess is playing,” suggests Andy Unsworth, the school’s head of PE.</p> \n  <p>Which makes people such as Ian Hollis all the more extraordinary. It is a damp, cheerless night in January as we turn off the thundering M6 and inch towards the union oasis of Orrell. The club came within a whisker of winning the English title in 1992, losing just twice all season with a side studded with international players and expertly coached by Des Seabrook. Then professionalism arrived and the northern powerhouse fell apart. The former owner Dave Whelan pulled the financial plug in 2004, the club reverted to amateur rugby three years later and their old Edge Hall Road home is now the training ground for Super League’s Wigan Warriors’. Last season Orrell finished sixth in South Lancs/Cheshire Division 2 and are currently without their own pitch or clubhouse. Given their decline in circumstances and league’s dominance locally, it is easy for outsiders to wonder why they still bother.</p> \n  <p>Orrell are battling to survive in the face of local fans and players who prefer the game’s other code</p> \n  <p>En route to a post-training beer in the Delph Tavern, Hollis offers a clue. He has made just three visits to Twickenham in 40 years and one of those was to watch Orrell in a junior final. “This is rugby league land. They think that if you play rugby union you’re soft, even if you’re 6ft 2in and 18 stone. Around here they still think union’s a game of kick and clap. They’ve not seen it played at grassroots the way we play it. It’s like chess and draughts. League’s bang-bang-bang. In union you’ve got to think a little more. Once you get the bug you’re bitten for life.”</p> \n  <p>It is this kind of diehard persistence that has sustained Orrell in their darkest hours. It costs them £45 just to rent the artificial pitch at St John Rigby college for training on a midweek evening, plus another £45 on matchdays. Chuck in the cost of a referee and washing the kit and they have to find at least £150 each week, with no bar proceeds and a maximum attendance of 120 if the weather’s half decent.</p> \n  <p>Another long-time stalwart, Tony Pegg, confirms life has often been “incredibly tough” for the club’s custodians. “Sometimes I ask myself why I do it. But what would I do if I didn’t? It’s in the blood.” Even during the period when Whelan and the Wigan RL chairman, Maurice Lindsay, were involved, it was an awkward marriage. “The first time we hosted a home game they subcontracted out the running of the clubhouse and ran out of bitter and Guinness,” recalls Pegg. “Afterwards the bar manager said Maurice Lindsay had told him rugby union supporters only drink lager and gin and tonic. It summed up his complete lack of appreciation for the sport.”</p> \n  <p>‘This is rugby league land. They think that if you play rugby union you’re soft, even if you’re 6ft 2in and 18 stone’</p> \n  <p>More than a decade later plenty in the area will also tell you the RFU could do far more to assist rugby union in the north. “They would deny it but I don’t think there’s an appreciation of the health of rugby in the north-west … make that the north full stop,” says Pegg. “I don’t think there’s a club around here that doesn’t run fewer teams than it used to. It’s not dying but it’s been a real struggle for us. There are a lot more alternatives than there used to be.”</p> \n  <p>On a sodden afternoon on the Lancashire coast, at his beloved Fylde RFC, one of England’s most fondly remembered captains, Bill Beaumont, accepts not everything in the English garden is rosy. There is only one professional side – Sale Sharks – in the whole of the north-west and the landscape has changed utterly since Beaumont, now 63, captained the North to their famous victory over New Zealand at Otley in 1979. Gone is the era when sides such as Orrell, Waterloo, Broughton Park, Liverpool St Helens and Fylde all had first-class fixture lists. Beaumont is also aware how significantly football’s reach has extended over the same period.</p> \n  <p>“I do think we’ve got enormous challenges. When you go around the country how many rugby posts do you see in public parks? Our challenge is to get all those people playing soccer to come down to their nearest rugby club and see what rugby has to offer.”</p> \n  <p>Beaumont’s lifelong affair with club rugby dates back to the day he was invited to play for Fylde’s third team away at Percy Park as a 17-year-old, little knowing what post-match revelry lay in store. He finally rang home at 2am from a transport cafe at Scotch Corner to reassure his parents that, contrary to their worst fears, he was still alive. “My mum turned to my dad and said: ‘That’s it, he’s never playing again.’”</p> \n  <p>His subsequent journey – captaining England to the 1980 grand slam, leading the Lions and representing his country on the old International Board (now World Rugby) – has taught him plenty more. He is adamant rugby is a game for all classes. “If you look at the schools where the England players come from it would have changed dramatically from 10 to 15 years ago. When I played it was perceived you either went to a grammar school or a private school.”</p> \n  <p>Even then the reality was subtly different. “In the dressing room you’d meet people from all walks of life. We had roofers, coppers, teachers and travel reps, yet when we put on the jersey we were as one. In my experience most people on a rugby field will take a hospital pass themselves, rather than drop their mate in it. For me that sums up what rugby’s about.”</p> \n  <p>They will snort with derision in Dewsbury but Jason Leonard, once a carpenter from Barking, has just become the RFU’s president. Even rugby’s sternest critic would find it hard to argue the sport is not more inclusive these days. The number of women and girls registered to play rugby in England last season, for example, rose by 20% to 18,000 on the back of their 2014 World Cup success and the RFU hopes to boost that figure to 25,000 by 2017.</p> \n  <p>There are more registered adult male players in England than in New Zealand, Australia, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Italy and all the Pacific Islands combined, yet England have won just one Six Nations title – and no grand slam – since winning the World Cup in 2003. “In a way our size is our weakness from a playing point of view,” says Beaumont. “There are a lot more choices to make as a coach and selector than in, say, Scotland.”</p> \n  <p>Perhaps. Others argue that the RFU, for all its good intentions and ample resources, is still suffering for not contracting the top players centrally at the outset of professionalism 20 years ago. Should the host nation fall short in this World Cup the club v country debate will rapidly reignite.</p> \n  <p>To understand why Twickenham is not particularly representative of English rugby union it helps to look at a map. By and large this is not a city game – even if City boys love it – but a sport of provincial towns, suburbs and rural heartlands. Talk sport to anyone in Cornwall, for example, and they are far more likely to mention Jack Nowell than Jack Wilshere. There are hotspots in the Midlands – Leicester, Coventry – as well as Kent, Surrey and Sussex.</p> \n  <p>Wharfedale, located just outside Grassington in the Yorkshire Dales, is a good case study. Burnley and Leeds are not a million miles away but beyond the mill towns and post-industrial sprawl there has always been a defiant sprinkling of union. To stand at the river end on a sunny spring day, with dry stone walls just beyond the dead ball line and sheep munching away contentedly beyond, is to experience something close to spectator heaven.</p> \n  <p>The local side – aka The Green Machine – are also a throwback, having just completed their 19th season in the third tier of the English league structure.</p> \n  <p>Michael “Clarty” Harrison, who farms locally and has served for decades as captain, coach and chairman, says sustaining the club at their present level costs £120,000 per year, with first-team players receiving the princely sum of £80 per game. The RFU used to chip in £70,000 per annum but now only helps with travel expenses. Survival is a perennial struggle.</p> \n  <p>The Wharfedale model, however, is thriving: four sides, 150-200 mini players, enthusiastic crowds of 700 odd, a coaching role in local schools. “We want to give the people of the Dale the chance to watch some decent sport,” says Harrison, who played for England Schools 50 years ago but whose solitary visit to Twickenham for an international was to watch the club president, John Spencer, represent England.</p> \n  <p>Spencer, who lives a drop-kick away from the club and was born in Grassington, has a foot in both camps; like Beaumont he holds a senior RFU board position and will be the manager of the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand in 2017. Even he shakes his head at some of the ideas emerging from Twickenham as the RFU seeks to streamline the English club system.</p> \n  <p>Spencer feels particularly strongly about a proposed reduction in league sizes, which would mean fewer home games for clubs such as Wharfedale. Given the club’s bar takings each week are roughly equivalent to their gate receipts, two fewer games would be a sizeable blow. “To us it’s a nonsense,” says Spencer, a Lion in New Zealand in 1971. “The guys telling us what to do don’t know how to run a club. Why do we want to play two fewer games per year? We’re told it’s about player welfare. Well, rolling subs have taken care of that. Our players can’t get enough rugby. We’re not anywhere near player welfare limits.”</p> \n  <p>Nor does he feel union is as endangered a game as some are telling him. “I’m told extreme frisbee is going to challenge us. The mind boggles.”</p> \n  <p>Listening to the crowd cheering the resident pre-match announcer – “Welcome to the chrysanthemum growers and artichoke producers of Fylde. If you ever want to come to the Dales to avoid fracking we can arrange it” – and growling “River! River!” whenever their forwards get a shove on, you suspect Wharfedale will remain on rugby’s map of life-enhancing destinations for a while yet.</p> \n  <p>If English rugby still has something of a split personality, there is one region where it can truly claim to be the people’s game. Umpteen towns in the south-west have their oval ball chapels of pain; the Mennaye Field in Penzance and Redruth’s Hellfire Corner are just two evocative shrines. It is Gloucester, however, where such quasi-religious fervour runs deepest. The days when the Cherry and Whites could field a team almost exclusively harvested from local clubs are gone but it remains English rugby union’s unofficial capital city. To watch a game in the Shed, the choir stalls of Gloucester’s alternative cathedral, is to enter a world as distant from Twickenham as Lidl is from Fortnum &amp; Mason.</p> \n  <p>The night Gloucester beat Saracens in early January, courtesy of a last-gasp kick from James Hook, the roar was probably audible in Cheltenham. Many of the inmates are lifers. Graham – “sometimes they call me Salty” – has not missed a home game for 25 years. Nigel, now in his mid-50s, used to be a football referee but got “fed up” with the lack of respect from the players. Two hours before every game he takes up his preferred front-row spot, keen to give the match officials a helping hand. “There’s 4,500 of us in the Shed and we can all referee better than the actual referee,” he insists. “Rugby’s so deep-rooted in Gloucester. It’s more than a rugby club, it’s what the city is.”</p> \n  <p>Then there is Ken, who travels to games from near Oxford wearing a straggly wig and bucket hat in tribute to the club’s Australian forwards coach, Laurie Fisher. “Twickenham is for the occasional supporter, this is where you come to watch real rugby,” he pronounces, pausing only to sip his pint and shout “Glaws-terr” at deafening volume.<br></p> \n  <p>“There’s no other sport in Gloucester,” says Mike Teague, the former England international and Gloucester veteran. “There’s no soccer, it’s totally one-eyed towards the Cherry and Whites. All you want to do as a youngster is put on a Gloucester shirt. I remember listening to my old team-mate Richard Mogg. He used to say that when he ran out at Kingsholm he loved watching the faces of the opposition. He said you could see the fear and anticipation in their eyes.”</p> \n  <p>Tucked within Gloucester’s ring-road is Longlevens RFC, one of the dozens of small rugby clubs within half an hour’s drive of Kingsholm. You would struggle to find any with a tighter community bond or more generous to passing strangers. The day we visited they were serving Christmas lunch in mid-January and celebrating a successful season under Rich Rudge, their admirably positive coach. The club’s ethos is refreshingly simple: develop your own youngsters, play decent rugby, make the rest of the family feel welcome and player retention takes care of itself. Rudge is so committed to the cause he even moved his family to a house adjoining the club and knocked through the brick wall bordering their pitches to make getting to training easier.</p> \n  <p>“In rugby there’s no airs and graces about anyone,” Rudge says. “You could be a solicitor, carpenter, anything. There are some bloody battles at times but afterwards we shake hands and have a beer. I class this as my second family.”</p> \n  <p>Clockwise from above: Longlevens celebrate their 77-12 victory over Old Colstonians, spectators watch a scrum and a Longlevens player is injured. The club’s ethos is simple: develop your own youngsters, play decent rugby and make the family feel welcome</p> \n  <p>There are even fewer frills in Stuart Lancaster’s home village of Culgaith in Cumbria. Standing on an exposed ridge above the River Eden, the family’s dairy farm is tucked away off the deserted main street. The Black Swan pub is similarly quiet. If any tourists venture beyond the Lake District to these parts they tend to head for Center Parcs – or the Llama Karma Kafe – down the road.</p> \n  <p>Yet in conjunction with the west Cumbrian coastal town of St Bees where Lancaster went to school, this is the birthplace of the cultural revolution that has swept through England’s national squad under their head coach. Along with everyone else, Lancaster was dismayed by the last World Cup campaign in New Zealand in 2011 and has been working hard to instil more pride in the shirt. He believes Wharfedale, Longlevens and Orrell should feel just as much a part of English rugby as Bath, Leicester and Gloucester and wants English rugby to be more connected from top to bottom. It is in junior clubs up and down the country, after all, that the next generation of players and supporters will be reared.</p> \n  <p>‘We’re reserved but, ultimately, when our backs are against the wall, the English always come out fighting’</p> \n  <p>The starting point was to make his players more aware of their predecessors and what the red rose represents. “Every team has an identity, whether you’re playing for your club or your school team. We’ve talked a lot about the identity of English rugby, to educate the players about those who played before them. When you’re an Englishman wearing the red rose that identity is the strongest pull of all. You’re representing not just yourself but your country and the family and friends who have helped you. It’s the ultimate strength.”</p> \n  <p>Among other things, Lancaster has also trawled English military history for inspiration. The team’s weekly defensive award is named after Arthur Harrison, the only England rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, and specific English character traits have been highlighted. “We’ve developed key anchors about what it means to be English; things like resilience, being at your best when everything is on the line, never taking a backward step. We’ve got examples throughout history of England sides showing those characteristics. Once you’ve got those anchors you’ve got something to build your identity around.”</p> \n  <p>“Sometimes I think we need to be a bit more front foot about being proud to be English. We often get accused of being arrogant as English people but I think that’s completely wrong. There’s a difference between arrogance and self-confidence. At our best we’re self-confident and front foot and never take a backward step. There’s no arrogance in this England team.”</p> \n  <p>Replay with soundStuart Lancaster: ‘When you are wearing the red rose, you’re not just representing the rugby fraternity but every person that lives in the country’</p> \n  <p>Talk to England’s players and the emergence of a new, improved kind of Englishness is clearly something they have also spent a lot of time considering. The Northampton flanker Tom Wood spent a formative period in New Zealand and is keenly aware of the emotional power that something such as the haka can bring. Wood was also involved in Cardiff in 2013 when England, on the verge of a potential grand slam, were swept aside 30-3 on a crimson tide of Welsh passion.</p> \n  <p>Stuart Lancaster on the World CupThe England coach believes the competition will have a huge impact on rugby union in the country0:38</p> \n  <p>That day proved a pivotal moment in the team’s development. “We felt we were overcome by the power of the emotion in the stadium,” says Wood. “We went in confident and we’d prepared well but ultimately the passion of the Welsh fans and the cauldron that was the Millennium Stadium caught us off-guard. I’m slightly embarrassed to say that but it must have been the case.</p> \n  <p>“Subsequently we thought: ‘Let’s get back to a bit of English identity.’ As a nation we’ve always struggled with that. We’re reserved but, ultimately, when our backs are against the wall, the English always come out fighting. We’ve got a great military and sporting history but we don’t shout from the rooftops the way others do. We’re so afraid of the arrogant tag that gets thrown at us that we’re scared to come out and say: ‘We’re confident, we’re passionate and we’re proud to be English.’”</p> \n  <p>Record levels of partisan fervour will be guaranteed at Twickenham in the coming weeks. It could be 30 years, if not longer, before England stages another home World Cup, although that advantage cuts two ways. For years England have underestimated the galvanising effect of the red rose on the opposition; what could be more satisfying for a New Zealand rugby player than winning a World Cup at Twickenham? This time, though, England will not have to worry about unfamiliar hotels, training pitches, climates, food or southern hemisphere media taunts.</p> \n  <p>“Playing for England is a dream you have as a kid but I take more satisfaction from making my parents proud and seeing the excitement on people’s faces as you walk through the west car park,” says Wood. “Looking up at the tiers of the stadium during the anthems you really do get a sense you’re representing the whole country. We like to think we’re the mirror the fans hold up to themselves. We want to embody what they want an English rugby team to be.”</p> \n  <p>Lancaster, as he approaches the biggest challenge of his life, hopes the entire country will get behind his squad, regardless of whether they can distinguish a ruck from a maul. “I think back to the 2005 Ashes and Euro 96 and the patriotism we saw then … I would love to rekindle that in this World Cup. We think we can and should be as patriotic as anyone else. Sometimes we just need to get it out there.”</p> \n  <p>Maybe he is right. Constantly being told to apologise for centuries of empire building and military activity would get on anyone’s nerves after a while. Then again, how much of an impact should British imperialism be having on England’s ability to win games of rugby in 2015? As Manu Tuilagi’s assault conviction earlier this year has underlined, not all Lancaster’s players were listening when the coach was delivering his “make your country proud” speech.</p> \n  <p>From Wharfedale, Longlevens and Orrell to Bath, Leicester, Gloucester and England: can English rugby be more connected from top to bottom?Replay with sound</p> \n  <p>Yet as Lancaster outlines his ethos – calm, measured, determined – you cannot help mentally returning to Culgaith and St Bees and the Cumbrian landscape that shaped him. English rugby may still be constrained by too much conservative thinking but it seldom lacks for yeoman spirit, regardless of what schools its foot soldiers went to.</p> \n  <p>If nothing else, English rugby also has a common, unifying goal. When the tournament is over there will still be significant divisions: a solitary pool game against Uruguay in Manchester, for instance, simply cannot be the last time England play a senior men’s international north of Shepherd’s Bush for 20 years.</p> \n  <p>But from Ian Hollis at Orrell to “Clarty” Harrison at Wharfedale, Rich Rudge at Longlevens and little Geronimo in the Twickenham car park, there will still be a remarkably diverse cross section of the population backing the national team this autumn. Nonbelievers will find themselves invited to follow suit. “We’ve got to get out of the pool stages first but if we do that and our momentum builds it’ll be a powerful force,” says Lancaster.

Really small tomatoes.

Though undeniably much loved by Pilton’s sizeable Smooth FM set, her brand of innocuous poolside soul, Prada rapping and extended romantic advice lacks the unifying anthems needed to make her this year’s Dolly.</p> <p data-dropid=\"1\">Some tracks from her UK-recorded London Sessions album appear to have absorbed some urgent metropolis beats and Disclosure samples during their stay, but no one wants the four-song, new-album hard sell in a downpour. A cover of U2’s One and an impassioned, fist-pumping No More Drama leaves her in tears and on her knees, though it seems scant pay off.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Two Kanyes.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-sad.fda48c2f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-sad.fda48c2f.png&quot;/&gt;﻿&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b47f03cd8301a6d6152aff5c9c8458810d7cc69a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b47f03cd8301a6d6152aff5c9c8458810d7cc69a/0_0_3500_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dancing in the rain to MJB.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancing in the rain to MJB.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T17:45:09.814Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-558d7eb5e4b024248ae9a114\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T16:33:52.675Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Catching raindrops ...</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dfa42e57541d97233a71febc93168836c17074f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435336372823/9215c247-cb7c-4372-9bb5-25ef3526004e-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"#guardianglasto Catching raindrops.

Sadly the gods of Having to Review Mary J Blige, Looking Like It Might Piss Down and Other Shit to Do Frankly have combined to prevent me staying for the entire four-hour DJ stint from Ben UFO, Pangea, Pearson Sound and Joy Orbison, but the half-hour I do catch is a crowd-drawing throb of glitchy deep dub, space house, crunchy New York krautronica and bits that sound like Chic trapped in a tumble dryer.

And my heart goes out to the guy in the Black Flag T-shirt eating celery.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"two stars\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-sad.35d50a0f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-sad.35d50a0f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T14:53:33.860Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-558d5c74e4b003b03c6417c9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T14:08:04.570Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rain</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is raining quite heavily at the Glastonbury festival now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d712a77bd9c4ae74e2e6889b0d41c57d2e88cd8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435328877415/a9aa502a-7f7f-4dc3-8194-06a185121cb4-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"Kidz Field in the rain. #guardianglasto Photo by David Levene\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kidz Field in the rain. #guardianglasto Photo by David Levene <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/4ZTf-6rmiY/\">Photograph: guardianphotos/Instagram</a></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There appear to be some who won’t mind this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8d45d17f5112acb5a55579cd21cac33b5559b8d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435328771264/e4da6855-fdfd-48bc-b96d-85934cb79bd5-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"The rain has started.

One aspect of the event that is rarely commented on is its amassing of the world’s most eclectic hat collection, however. I stand surrounded by sequined top hats. Beaten up wicker hats. Bucket hats. Sun hats. Cowboy hats. Those pink plastic hats people wear on hen parties. But there’s only one hat people are interested at 1.30pm on the Pyramid stage, and that’s James Bay’s trademark wide-brimmed fedora. </p> <p>As the rain sporadically falls throughout the Hertfordshire twentysomething singer’s set, he draws a massive crowd for a performance that’s full of conviction and cocksure crooning. A sombre selection of songs fill his set, the kind of sincere, hugely successful guitar-driven pop that’s been peddled by the likes of Ed Sheeran, only dustier and bluesier; and with his chiselled good looks and lank hair he’s almost like a one-man Kings of Leon. </p> <p>Despite the rapturous singalong that accompanies his cover of Alicia Keys’ If I Ain’t Got You and his biggest hit, Hold Back the River (which he leaves until last), it’s an enormously earnest hour – Bay almost brilliantly uninhibited in his gurny stadium-rock stride. So much so the blokes in the daft hats must feel a little foolish for displaying such frivolity. </p> <p>Apart from this guy.

A man dressed in Russian military uniform declared this “the People’s Republic of Glastonbury” and then Nadya and Masha mounted the truck, said “Fuck you!”, put a rainbow coloured balaclava on his head, forced him to his knees and taped him up. Before then reading out the “10 rules of Pussy Riot”, they said: </p> <blockquote> <p>I have to officially warn you before our event – and it’s not a joke - that feminist punk really can drive you crazy, but it’s worth it. Do not resist it. And you have to sign an official agreement that if you will become crazy because of feminist punk, you will not go to court against us.</p> <p>The second remark is: Don’t follow our art. It could offend you. </p> <p>I’m standing on the military vehicle of my country because I believe that we – me and you, the people – have to take back arms from our government ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Among their 10 rules – “Develop a culture of rebellion”, “Every change begins with a riot” – we particularly liked: “Start your new day with a cup of coffee and a good riot”. To this they added: </p> <blockquote> <p>There is a one valid question for Pussy Riot. “What the hell you are doing, ladies? Why don’t you just sit on your couch and drink some beer?” What makes us act out?

Hooked on You sounds better than ever after its recent remix revival. Supernature has even those who’ve never heard of him before, of which there are a few, singing along. The outdoor dancefloor doesn’t offer quite the sound system or vibe of a 1970s disco club but Cerrone still manages to send us off dancing into the night well and truly warmed up.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"four stars\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-happy.7dbf95a9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-happy.7dbf95a9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-happy.7dbf95a9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/kanye-happy.7dbf95a9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cerrone\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/4XhZtkA_pE/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Cerrone o clock #guardianglasto #legend #block9 #hookedonyou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sarah Phillips (@sairphillips) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-06-25T21:39:30+00:00&quot;&gt;Jun 25, 2015 at 2:39pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T11:33:01.585Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-558d22b6e4b0ec49dbd1f506\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/timjonze\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-26T10:04:22.173Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Gig of the festival ... and it was only Thursday!</h2> <p>Hello! Tim Jonze here taking over the liveblog for a couple of hours. I arrived on site last night and immediately went to see one of the strangest, funniest and most joyous performances I’ve ever seen at Glastonbury: Lekiddo Lord of the Lobsters at the Rabbit Hole. You can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/26/lekiddo-lord-of-lobsters-glastonbury-2015-review-unrelentingly-joyous-euro-disco\">read the full review here</a>, but here’s a little snippet ... </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is undoubtedly one of the daftest performances Glastonbury has ever staged. “Let me see your claws,” Lekiddo tells his cult devotees at one point, before handing out santa hats and launching into, of all things, a Christmas song.

It’s the day the festivities begin in earnest, with around 3,254 bands and 1,176 DJs appearing on 824 stages. But there was live music last night, with secret shows at William’s Green, and Mark Beaumont was there to catch them …</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You hunt around all Thursday for a secret set and then three come along at once. After the sex, drugs and genital discharge-obsessed Rebel Bingo has called its last risqué number (“your mum’s a whore, 34!” is the only remotely printable example) the pot-luck hordes descend for a trio of TBAs listed at William’s Green, which is essentially Glastonbury catnip. There’s no Kitty, Daisy &amp; Lewis-level disappointment either. At 8.30pm, Derbyshire’s Drenge take to a rammed tent with the grunge-Zep onslaught of Running Wild and split the tent. Half the crowd are blown away by their mongrel crossbreed of White Stripes and Nirvana, doused in overdrive that may well be rattling the stone circle to gravel. The other half are blown away by the fact that a band called Drenge don’t sound like a sludge metal dirge fronted by Julian Cope.</p> <p>Only a bunch of grunge pop maniacs boasting a midweek N0 1 album described as “the debut of the decade” (copyright this writer, in a gibbering fit, elsewhere) could comfortably follow them, so it’s lucky Wolf Alice take the second unannounced slot. Leaping for a high-set bar, they come out scratching and squealing, rampaging through the ferocious Pixies homage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USmBzNBI-ec\">You’re a Germ</a> before showcasing the subversive subtleties that make their album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/21/wolf-alice-my-love-review-cool-giddy-vim-potential\">My Love Is Cool</a> such a delight. Few bands write songs that, like Your Loves Whore, sound by turns like Haim, Stevie Nicks and L7, or mingle Mazzy Star moments like Blush with sludgy pop stampedes like Moaning Lisa Smile, Drenge’s Eoin Loveless guesting on guitar while singer Ellie Rowsell clambers out over the crowd, yowling its euphoric chorus chant. Prince playing atop the Arcadia spider would have nothing on this.</p> <p>Expectations pumped, the tent buzzes with anticipation for TBA three. The bar-side bookies close the book on Everything Everything, and the prevalence of bow ties, pork pie hats and trombones trouping onstage for a line-check suggest this would have to mark a fairly drastic shift of style for the heavily rumoured Toy. No, it’s a band called the Ol’ Dirty Brasstards, blasting out brass covers of Uptown Funk and Don’t You Want Me. Crowd-pleasing fun, but secret set storm-chasers like us don’t stick around. Word is there’s a Foo Fighters acoustic set out there somewhere – we’re banking on the Crow’s Nest …</p> </blockquote> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

The job was strictly to study the operational issues that would arise if Greece were forced to issue scrip or if it were forced out of the euro.</li> <li>The group operated under the axiom that the government was fully committed to negotiating within the euro, and took extreme precautions not to jeopardize that commitment by allowing any hint of our work to reach the outside world. There were no leaks whatever, until the existence of the group was disclosed by the former Finance Minister himself, in response to criticism that his ministry had made no contingency plans when it was known that forces within the Eurozone were planning the forced exit of Greece.</li> <li>The existence of preliminary plans could not play any role in the Greek negotiating position, since their circulation (before there was a need to implement them) would have destabilized government policy.</li> <li>Apart from one late, inconclusive telephone conversation between MP Costas Lapavitsas and myself, we had no coordination with the Left Platform and our Working Group’s ideas had little in common with theirs.</li> <li>Our work ended for practical purposes in early May, with a long memorandum outlining major issues and scenaria that we studied.</li> <li>My work in this area was unpaid and unofficial, based on my friendship with Yanis Varoufakis and on my respect for the cause of the Greek people.</li> </ol> </ol> <p>Point 4 appears to refer to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2a0a1d94-3201-11e5-8873-775ba7c2ea3d.html\">the revelation that Syriza’s Left Platform hatched a plan to return to the drachma, after last month’s Euro summit where the bailout plan was agreed</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55b62a1ae4b09cde8f9eba3d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T13:05:51.189Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Varoufakis issues statement defending contingency plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) -- A file photo taken on March 4, 2015 shows then Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis arriving to present his ministry’s new secretaries at a press conference in Athens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis has just released a statement defending his work creating a parallel payment system during his time as finance minister.</strong></p> <p>The statement, from “the Office of Yanis Varoufakis”, insists that he was fully authorised to carry out the work. <br /></p> <p>It also criticises the media for their “far-fetched” articles, and denies the claim that he ever planned to hijack all taxpayers tax file numbers [<em>which he does not actually say on the leaked Tapes</em>].<br /></p> <h2>Here’s the full statement:</h2> <p>During the Greek government’s negotiations with the Eurogroup, Minister Varoufakis oversaw a Working Group with a remit to prepare contingency plans against the creditors’ efforts to undermine the Greek government and in view of forces at work within the Eurozone to have Greece expelled from the euro. The Working Group was convened by the Minister, at the behest of the Prime Minister, and was coordinated by Professor James K. Galbraith [<em>who has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/27/business-live-chinese-stock-market-rout-ftse-greece-live#block-55b62cb1e4b0221a8b9d3159\"> issued his own statement</a></em>]</p> <p>It is worth nothing (<em>he means noting</em>) that, prior to Mr Varoufakis’ comfirmation of the existence of the said Working Group, the Minister was criticized widely for having neglected to make such contingency plans. The Bank of Greece, the ECB, treasuries of EU member-states, banks, international organisations etc. had all drawn up such plans since 2012. Greece’s Ministry of Finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans.</p> <p>Ever since Mr Varoufakis announced the existence of the Working Group, the media have indulged in far-fetched articles that damage the quality of public debate. The Ministry of Finance’s Working Group worked exclusively within the framework of government policy and its recommendations were always aimed at serving the public interest, at respecting the laws of the land, and at keeping the country in the Eurozone.</p> <p>Regarding the recent article by “Kathimerini” newspaper entitled “Plan B involving highjacking and hacking”, Kathimerini’s failure to contact Mr Varoufakis for comment and its reporter’s erroneous references to “highjacking tax file numbers of all taxpayers” sowed confusion and contributed to the media-induced disinformation. The article refers to the Ministry’s project as described by Minister Varoufakis in his 6<sup>th</sup> July farewell speech during the handover ceremony in the Ministry of Finance. In that speech <a href=\"http://www.mnec.gr/?q=el/news/statements/%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82-%CE%B3-%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%86%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B7-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%B5%CF%85-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AC-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AE-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%85%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85\">Mr Varoufakis clearly stated</a>: “The General Secretariat of Information Systems had begun investigating means by which Taxisnet (Nb. the Ministry’s Tax Web Interface) could become something more than it currently is, to become a payments system for third parties, a system that improves efficiency and minimises the arrears of the state to citizens and vice versa.”</p> <p>That project was <em>not</em> part of the Working Group’s remit, was presented in full by Minister Varoufakis to Cabinet, and should, in Minister Varoufakis’ view, be implemented independently of the negotiations with Greece’s creditors, as it will contribute considerable efficiency gains in transactions between the state and taxpayers as well as between taxpayers.</p> <p>In conclusion, during the five months of negotiations that gripped Europe and changed the debate throughout the Continent, the Ministry of Finance did everything possible to serve the public interest against many odds. The current media campaign to besmirch these efforts will fail to dent the legacy of a crucial five month struggle for democracy and common sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/statuses/625648732969795584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statement by Yanis Varoufakis on the FinMin’s Plan B Working Group &amp; the parallel payment system <a href=\"http://t.co/9JTWNyq8JK\">http://t.co/9JTWNyq8JK</a></p>&mdash; Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/625648732969795584\">July 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T13:48:45.287Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55b62862e4b09cde8f9eba35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-27T12:52:42.296Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/27/business-live-chinese-stock-market-rout-ftse-greece-live#block-55b60ab0e4b09cde8f9eb99f\">Another point about the Varoufakis Tapes</a> -- this call took place under Chatham House rules, which means that the details can’t be reported by the participants.</strong></p> <p>However, Greek newspaper Kathimerini published large details of the transcript yesterday, prompting OMFIF to released the full recording today.

It will not be easy. The coalition of the radical left (if that is what Syriza can now be called) is in shellshock over Tsipras’ embrace of the neo-liberal policies he had once so stridently opposed, in return for talks on a third bailout.`</p> <p>The argument that no plausible alternative exists is not washing with hardliners who will be in attendance. Indicative of that stance, the Left Platform’s website, ISKRA (<em>so named for the paper set up in exile by Vladimir Lenin</em>) has declared “the battle continues” with hardliners drawing their line in the sand.</p> <p>Tellingly, at the same time that Tsipras attempts to win over his doubting comrades, the Left Platform’s leader Panagiotis Lafazanis will be addressing supporters at a separate rally (in celebration of ISKRA’s fifth anniversary) under the banner:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“No has not been defeated.

Pressure is now building on Syriza’s dissidents to step down. </p> <p>Over the weekend, several of his closest allies, including minister of state <strong>Nikos Pappas</strong>, threw down the gauntlet saying the time had come for the rebels to either back the government or leave. Speaking on behalf of the hardliners, Lafazanis has repeatedly ruled out resigning saying that it is they who have remained faithful to the party’s pre-electoral commitments.</p> <p>“In no way do I seek the break-up of Syriza, I am a founding member of Syriza,” Lafazanis told media outlets on Sunday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“What I want is for the new memorandum [outlining the tough terms of further financial assistance] to be cancelled and for Syriza to not be transformed into a memorandum force like New Democracy and Pasok. I will support the government in the implementation of the radical programme with which it was elected.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Tsipras is expected this afternoon to ram home the message that with Greece’s exit from the euro zone presaging assured catastrophe, a third bailout is the only option. “We will demand a central committee party convention,” said one well-placed source who now aligns with the hardliners.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Tsipras won’t want that because the central committee [Syriza’s governing body] is against the measures but that is what we will do.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Insiders say Tsipras has a road-map of sorts – one that starts with the new loan agreement being negotiated by August 18, Syriza calling an urgent party conference (which would deal with dissidents) at the end of September and elections being held on <strong>November 8. </strong></p> <p>A new election could give young leader a new mandate to enforce controversial reforms.</p> <p><strong>But much, in the meantime, will rest on the prime minister retaining control of his party.

The benchmark Shanghai index is has slumped by around 7% in late trading, in another rush of late selling.</p> <p>That’s likely to hit Europe’s stock markets this morning too.</p> <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>Negotiators from Greece’s creditors are due to arrive in Athens today formally begin talks on a €86bn bailout, after talks were aborted on Friday due to a row over access to ministries -

rap to rock, Splendour in the Grass got the muddy crowds dancing whatever the genre, and the Aussie acts more than held their own","body":"<h2>Azealia Banks</h2> <p>It’s safe to assume most of those gathered to see Azealia Banks at Splendour in the Grass were there on the strength of one song. I was one of those people – half attracted by the idea of that irresistible beat reproduced live and half interested in what else she has to offer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/24/iggy-azalea-azealia-banks-hip-hop-appropriation-problem\">Azealia Banks, Iggy Azalea and hip-hop's appropriation problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, taken as a whole, the set delivered. Sure, the musical highlight is 212 – played last and a little lacklustre – but the crowd remained onside throughout, even as we waited for the payoff. Desperado stood out as a tune to revisit. Others kept us bobbing despite sounding, as one friend put it, like generic beats waiting to be sampled in better tracks.</p> <p>Banks focused on the crowd and seemed happy to be here, which is notoriously not always the case. However, it was the backup dancers we came away talking about. This male duo appeared at random intervals to dance with an explosive energy that belied their tight choreography. They even took solo turns front and centre, whipping the mainstream crowd into a frenzy with some high camp freestyle, like entrants at a drag ball walk-off.<br /></p> <p>Perhaps another day, a less mud-soaked, more sober audience would demand more. Then again, perhaps rolling out a closer like 212 all but guarantees any mediocrity elsewhere is forgiven. <strong>Fred McConnell</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Rubens</strong></h2> <p>Sam Margin may well be the next great Aussie frontman. The charismatic lead of the Rubens, back live in their first major shows since 2013, has the Splendour crowd dancing from the moment the band walks on stage, and when he crowd-surfs in a large, colourful rubber boat, he’s buoyed by a sea of adoring fans.</p> <p>As if reading the collective mind, he runs with a few bars of the Doors’ Riders on the Storm as the opening for hit song My Gun, conjuring up visions of the charismatic Jim Morrison.</p> <p>Throughout their tight, fast-paced one hour set, The Rubens offer a taste of their eagerly awaited second album, out later this year. The hard driving guitar riffs and lovelorn lyrics on Hoops and The Fool sit comfortably alongside hits like Never be the Same, Elvis and of course Lay Me Down. Finally they close with new song Hallelujah, and the promise of many more great things to come. <strong>Alexandra Spring</strong></p> <h2><strong>Dandy Warhols</strong></h2> <p>The Dandy Warhols essentially have two types of song. There are the catchy, upbeat pop songs and the stoner jams. But how do you balance the two at a festival show?The Dandies’ answer, it seems, is just to alternate, more or less. A slow opener eases us in before Get Off gets people dancing.<br /></p> <p>But it’s a three-song run in the middle that enervates the crowd. We Used To Be Friends gets them clapping and singing along and Horse Pills has them jumping around before the inevitable Bohemian Like You sends them into a frenzy. <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4280832.htm\">Flares are lit</a>, beer cans are thrown and at least one girl bares her breasts to the camera surveying the audience.</p> <p>Then they launch into Godless, and it’s like the whole thing never happened – back to long, rhythmic jams and head-nodding. <strong>Alan Evans</strong></p> <h2>UV Boi</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e22840ef0e0cd387d12920fd63083984769769f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3e22840ef0e0cd387d12920fd63083984769769f/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UV boi behind the Splendour decks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UV Boi behind the Splendour decks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2015/jul/18/uv-boi-flume-showed-if-you-make-what-you-love-you-can-achieve-anything\">UV boi: Flume showed if you make what you love, you can achieve anything</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of several Brisbane acts at the festival, UV boi has been touted as one to watch this year, and didn’t disappoint a feisty crowd who made it clear early on they were baying for bass.<br /></p> <p>What they got was an exhilarating melange of dubstep, breakbeats, 808 sounds and aggressive American trap from a young innovator in Australian electronic music. It was a collection perfected to hit the spot with a crowd who went mad for every big drop and the excited punch-the-air DJing from UV boi himself.</p> <p>UV boi was having a blast, youthfully bobbing around to the throwback rave sounds and hand claps. “Am I looking handsome?” he joked into the mic when a festival photographer came on stage towards the end. He finished with the expected; his fantastic single Luv, a big crowd singing along to the catchy hook at his first Splendour.

A big, expensive piece. So special is this piece that in many ways it’s not the last piece of this jigsaw but the first piece of the next one. “Chelsea have Hazard, he can always make an action and decide a goal,” said Louis van Gaal. “City have Agüero, and Barcelona have Messi, Neymar and Suárez. We have to compete with these clubs, so we have to look also for that kind of player.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/27/real-madrid-sergio-ramos-manchester-united-move\">Real Madrid tell Sergio Ramos he will not be sold under any circumstances</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inevitably if entertainingly this mysterious potential supersigning has been dubbed a Gaalactico. United may have thought they had got one of those when they paid £59.7m for Ángel Di María last summer, or £37.1m for Juan Mata the previous January, but apparently they have failed to sufficiently gaalvanise the squad. The identity of the potential recruit has not been revealed, so nobody knows if United would like to sign a French forward – a gaallic Gaalactico – or perhaps a player from northern Spain – a Gaalician Gaalactico – or one from western Iberia – a Portugaal Gaalactico. All we know is that Cristiano Ronaldo – the prodigaal Gaalactico – will not be the one, and that the signing, if and when it happens, is extraordinarily unlikely to be particularly frugaal.</p> <p><strong>Stevan Jovetic</strong> is in Italy right now, hoping to pass a medical and sign a contract with <strong>Internazionale</strong>. Whether it’s a loan deal (as Inter would prefer) or a permanent signing (Manchester City’s desired outcome) remains to be seen, but City have resigned themselves to losing upwards of £6m on a player they signed for £20.4m.</p> <p>A similar battle is ongoing between Chelsea and <strong>Juventus</strong> over <strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong>, with the Italian club ready to end the player’s brief Stamford Bridge-based misery with a loan deal, and Chelsea never wanting to see him again, and ready to accept a £5m hit on the £23m they paid for the Colombian in January (and talking of big financial hits, <strong>Borussia Dortmund </strong>have joined Sevilla in the race for £11m-rated Spurs flop <strong>Roberto Soldado</strong>, a full £15m less than the Spaniard cost when he arrived in London two years ago).</p> <p>Quite what it is with Italians and loan moves the Mill does not know, but Tottenham’s <strong>Vlad Chiriches</strong> is also involved in one, with <strong>Fiorentina</strong> happy to have him for the season and perhaps buy him next summer if they still feel like it, and Tottenham minded to accept anything to get him out of the club, after signing two new centre-backs this summer.</p> <p><strong>Everton</strong> are considering a move for Celtic’s £10m-rated (by Celtic) <strong>Virgil van Dijk</strong>, with Roberto Martínez admitting that “maybe we need another new face at centre-half”. So apparently do <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, Leicester, Southampton, Newcastle, West Brom and Aston Villa, all of whom are after Hull’s <strong>James Chester</strong>, who might cost as much as £6m. Palace, though, have been told to leave <strong>Fabricio Coloccini</strong> alone, with Newcastle’s Steve McClaren insisting the 33-year-old “has a future here”.</p> <p>Enough defenders, though, and <strong>Arsenal </strong>will be happy to spend £8.5m on the 30-year-old Spanish beanpole <strong>Fernando Llorente</strong> if their move for Karim Benzema comes to nought, though their opening offer is a comparatively meagre £5.6m. His current club, Juventus, are also bracing themselves for an English bid for 19-year-old <strong>Kingsley Coman</strong>, with <strong>Liverpool</strong> and the Gunners both keen, though the Frenchman has also caught the eye of Bayern Munich.</p> <p>Palace and <strong>West Brom</strong> are also both competing for <strong>Adrian Ramos</strong>, Borussia Dortmund’s 29-year-old Colombian striker, though the German side are so reluctant to part with him that they are demanding £16m, not far off double the sensible valuation for a player who scored only six goals last season.</p> <p>Jordan Ayew is ready to waive a £800,000 transfer bonus to grease the wheels of his transfer from Lorient to Aston Villa, so desperate is he to follow his brother André – who has swapped Marseille for Swansea – to the Premier League. Villa’s Nathan Baker, meanwhile, is a £2m target for Burnley.</p> <p>Southampton have told <strong>Emmanuel Mayuka</strong> to please go away, having left him out of their pre-season tour and told him he won’t be in their Premier League squad. The Zambian, a £3m signing in 2012, could end up at <strong>Spartak Moscow</strong> as a result.</p>","linkText":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea’s Juan Cuadrado to

Several members of his fishing union were murdered during a pipeline protest a few years ago. Petrobras denies any connection with the deaths, but Alexandre says his friends were killed by guards and militias linked to the company.</p> \n  <p>He’s now under a federal protection programme, but he still patrols the bay in search of oil spills, illegal construction and other environmental crimes.</p> \n  <p>“Guanabara Bay is a sacred place for us. We respect it like a church,” he says. “But the bay is becoming an industrial hub in a disgusting and criminal way.”</p> \n  <p>Few Cariocas, as Rio’s residents are known, are aware of the extent of Petrobras’ sprawl across the land and water.</p> \n  <p>It started in 1961 and has accelerated dramatically since the discovery of the pre-salt fields. To demonstrate, Alexandre takes The Guardian on patrol. Starting from his quiet fishing village in Magé, we first pass by a propene and ethylene terminal, which began operating in 2008, then the Iesa shipyard where several oil tankers are being refitted.</p> \n  <p>Further along the shore, Alexandre points out the vast Duque de Caxias refinery, which stretches across the horizon, belching murky smoke from six chimneys, then a liquified natural gas terminal and a smaller refinery on Redonda Island, which is undergoing expansion.</p> \n  <p>Near Rio-Niterói bridge, we spy the famous tourist sites - Sugar Loaf Mountain and the Christ the Redeemer statue - but closer to the shore are storage tanks, huge warehouses, factories and shipyards - almost all of which are geared towards the oil industry: General Electric pipes and cables, a huge drilling platform waiting for a refit, a cluster of shiny-new mini refineries waiting to be loaded on to floating platforms by an enormous crane painted in the canary yellow and green colours of the national flag, the national team and the national oil company.</p> \n  <p>Guanabara, it seems, has become Petrobras Bay.</p> \n  <p>Altogether, there are at least two refineries, four terminals, four shipyards, as well as countless storage tanks, support ships, service factories and underwater pipelines.</p> \n  <p>The waters - now deemed too dirty to swim in - are like the forecourt of a giant petrol station.</p> \n  <p>Instead of cars lining up at the pumps, there are 30 huge tankers waiting to load or unload oil and gas at the terminals. A huge new refinery will soon be added to the list. Petrobras’s Comperj plant is now under construction close to the northeast - and currently least spoiled - corner of the bay. It will be the destination for gas from the pre-salt fields once a new pipeline is completed later this year.</p> \n  <h2>Alexandre vows to fight this threat.</h2> \n  <p>“Once Comperj is finished, the impact of Petrobras will spread right across the bay. We hope that refinery won’t be viable because of the low price of oil, because of the struggle by people like us, and because of the growing clamour in society about the environment,” he says.</p> \n </noscript> \n</figure>","linkText":"Brazil's gamble on deep water oil","lastModified":1442411739000,"standfirst":"<p>The discovery of billions of barrels of oil off the coast of Rio de Janeiro was billed as one of the biggest finds of this century.

Now women’s rights activists are helping them fight back","body":"<p>Santa Devi Meghwal was married off when she was 11 months old. She knew that, on turning 16, she would move in with her husband and his parents.</p> <p>The reality hit her when they turned up at her house in Rohicha Kallan village in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district on a scorching day three years ago to take her away. It was the first time she had set eyes on her husband, Saanval Ram. </p> <p>“My strongest emotion was the unfairness of it. Why should I go along with something I wasn’t party to, or even aware of? I couldn’t face being treated like a parcel to be picked up by a man I didn’t care for,” she said, speaking on the telephone from Jodhpur.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://wcd.nic.in/cma2006.pdf\">2006 Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</a>, it is illegal for girls under 18 and boys under 21 to marry in India. Those convicted of involvement face up to two years in jail and fines of up to 200,000 rupees (about £2,100). However, 2014 figures from Unicef, the UN children’s agency, show that <a href=\"http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/child-marriage\">47% of girls in India were married before they turned 18</a>. The practice is common in rural areas.</p> <p>“Almost all the people know that there is a law in place against child marriage – however, it still takes place as societal norms and pressure pushes people into breaking these rules,” said Dora Giusti, a child protection specialist with Unicef in New Delhi.</p> <p>Child marriage can result in girls <a href=\"http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/themes/education/\">dropping out of school</a>, early pregnancies, and mothers who are ill-equipped to raise children, activists say.</p> <p>Parents sometimes marry off their daughters because they fear that later, as teenagers, they might have sexual relations and bring shame upon their families. Another factor is peer pressure: parents worry that unless they act, they won’t be able to find their daughters a husband. Opposition to change is entrenched.</p> <p>“Villagers don’t like city people coming and telling them their customs are wrong. Changing attitudes is a slow process,” said Kavita Srivastava, a Jaipur-based women’s rights activist.</p> <p>Meghwal found herself hemmed in by these traditions. During that first visit by Ram and his family she made an excuse not to leave with them. The excuses continued as she turned 18, then 19. Ram’s family grew angry.</p> <p>Elders in Meghwal’s village imposed a fine of 1.6 million rupees on her parents. With no way to pay such a colossal sum, the family moved to Jodhpur.</p> <p>Running out of excuses to go to her husband, Meghwal called Kriti Bharti, a child rights campaigner who runs the <a href=\"http://saarthitrust.com/\">Saarthi Trust</a> in Jodhpur.</p> <p>Bharti, 27, made headlines in 2012 for obtaining <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17838022\">India’s first annulment of a child marriage</a>. Since then, she has won 27 more annulments in the family courts.</p> <p>A child psychologist, Bharti says the law on child marriage makes provision for annulments, but previously it had never been tested in court. She describes her first petition as “a stab in the dark”. Laxmi Sargara, who was married off when she was one, was Bharti’s first case. That victory set a legal precedent and gave hope to other girls. The case made it into <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/child-brides-story-is-now-cbse-lesson/1/393948.html\">school textbooks</a>. </p> <p>When Sargara was 16, and about to move to her husband’s house in Rajasthan, she heard that another girl, who married into the same family, had killed herself after years of abuse. She decided not to go, and contacted Bharti.</p> <p>India <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32547360\">still has one of the lowest divorce rates</a> in the world. Ending a marriage still carries stigma in rural areas, where a woman will find it very hard to remarry. Divorce also takes longer to rule on in India’s overburdened courts and is very expensive.</p> <p> For an annulment, however, one only has to prove that the bride was underage at the time of marriage. A birth certificate or school certificate can prove this. Bharti said this process can take between three days and six months.</p> <p>In Sangara’s case, the Jodhpur magistrate was sympathetic, and her husband also consented. The marriage was declared null in April 2012. Two years ago, when she reached 19, Sargara married a man of her own choosing.</p> <p>“Kriti saved me from misery. Child marriage is a form of abuse and exploitation of helpless children,” said Sargara. Bharti is still in touch with her. “She is the queen of her home. Her husband gives her so much affection and respect that she always looks like a radiant bride,” she said.</p> <p>With Meghwal’s marriage, however, annulment proceedings may not be so straightforward.</p> <p>Ram opposes the annulment and has threatened to abduct his unwilling bride, Bharti said. He has also warned Bharti that her “health” is at risk if she persists with the case.</p> <p>But Meghwal refuses to be cowed. She says she has glimpsed a better future and is now studying to be a teacher. “Kriti has given me a new life. I can’t wait to see what it holds for me,’ she said.</p> <p>“It will take longer than we would have wanted but it will happen,” said Bharti. “His [Ram’s] so-called honour has been slighted. But all he can do is drag it out. In the end, Santa Devi will win because the law is on her side.”</p> <p><em>(Additional reporting by Zeeshan Mukhtar)</em><br /></p>","linkText":"Child marriage in India finally meets its match as young brides turn to courts | Amrit Dhillon","lastModified":1442235269000,"standfirst":"<p>Almost half of Indian girls marry before they turn 18, even though it is illegal.

after Israel carried out air strikes following a rocket attack from the Gaza Strip.<br /></p> <p> No casualties were reported on either side of the border, and the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Yaalon, blamed the rocket attack late on Tuesday on “elements in the Islamic Jihad”, an Islamist group in the Hamas-run enclave.</p> <p> Israeli media reported that infighting among Islamic Jihad militants may have precipitated the rocket firing without the permission of Hamas authorities.</p> <p> The reports said Hamas, whose forces are dominant in the territory of 1.8 million Palestinians, had arrested Islamic Jihad members behind the rocket strike, the furthest into Israel since the end of last year’s 50-day Gaza war.</p> <p>The projectile struck near the Israeli port city of Ashdod, 12 miles from the Gaza frontier, Israeli security forces said.<br /></p> <p>An Islamic Jihad spokesman was not available to comment. Hamas officials had no comment on the reported arrests.</p> <p>Israeli warplanes hit back early on Wednesday, striking four “terror infrastructures” in the southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said. Gaza residents said the targets included training camps used by Islamic Jihad militants.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

</aside>  <p> No further fighting was reported, and it appeared that Israel chose to attack evacuated or open areas in a signal to Hamas that it hoped to avoid escalation.</p> <p> Israel issued a warning that further rocket strikes would draw a more powerful response. “If there is no quiet in Israel, the Gaza Strip will pay a very heavy price, which will cause anyone planning to challenge us to regret their actions,” Yaalon said in a statement.</p> <p> Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, said Israel was responsible for “the escalation last night and it must stop these foolish acts”.</p> <p> Last year militants in Gaza launched thousands of rockets and mortar bombs into Israel during a July-August war in which Israeli shelling and air strikes battered the enclave.</p> <p> The region has been largely quiet since an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire that halted seven weeks of fighting.</p>","linkText":"Israel launches Gaza air strikes after rocket

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Oh! And young people. Thank you for being here and thank you for supporting us with what we’re doing. You don’t understand how weird it is to be standing here as a MAN – yes, not a boy, a man, from my community, talking about Female Genital Mutilation. Believe me, Somali men never talk about women’s bits, even amongst themselves. And perhaps that’s the problem. Too many people have been quiet for too long. But the point is IF FGM is to stop, and it HAS to stop, then everybody, regardless of gender or race, has to take a stand. I stand here as a brother, a cousin, a son, and a future father… hopefully. I also stand here as a friend and a human being.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bristol, July 2012. The opening of the first National Conference on Female Genital Mutilation. The person speaking was a skinny fourteen year old boy. I’d heard him practise, at an after school session in a hot classroom, during the previous week. He had never spoken in public before and couldn’t get to the end of his introduction without breaking into nervous giggles. But now, facing a huge hall full of students, FGM survivors, journalists, programme makers, international experts, MPs (well, one MP – the heroic Jane Ellison), he spoke with passion and confidence. It was the audience who laughed nervously when he mentioned “women’s bits”, but as he got into his stride, we held our breath. We all knew that we were witnessing something extraordinary – the powerful voice of a young person set on changing the world, and he wasn’t alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/aug/22/amnesty-teen-takeover-rita-williams-garcia-fgm\">Amnesty teen takeover: Rita Williams-Garcia on writing about FGM for teens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 2012 conference was organized by a group of young people calling themselves <a href=\"http://integratebristol.org.uk/\">Integrate Bristol</a>. I was there to research a novel, and to run a writing workshop with Sasha Hails who was writing a story about FGM for Casualty. At this point I wasn’t very clear what shape the book would take, but I knew one thing – the young people of Integrate Bristol were my starting point.</p> <p>After finishing my first novel, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/chocolate-cake-with-hitler.html\">Chocolate Cake with Hitler</a>, in 2009, I found it very difficult to decide what to write about next. I’d written big chunks of three different possible books, and then abandoned them. One day my editor emailed me with a suggestion for a novel that had come to her from a teenage girl. The idea was for a book told through the voices of a number of girls who came from different religious backgrounds. It didn’t particularly grab me but because I’d been dithering for so long, I decided to give it one day’s research. </p> <p>And one day turned out to be enough. I came across Integrate Bristol. I’d found my inspiration.</p> <p>In May 2012 I started visiting Integrate Students at City Academy Bristol, the school where they have their headquarters. I went to all kinds of campaigning events. I watched their films, plays, lesson plan demonstrations and listened to fabulous songs which they had written and performed in their determined fight against FGM, but more widely against all kinds of violence against women and girls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/mar/07/teen-opinion-how-books-made-me-a-feminist\">Teen opinion: How books made me a feminist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the final months of writing the book, I read chunks of it to kind and patient girls who stayed after school to answer all sorts of questions about learning the Qur’an, making Somali tea and, in some cases, memories of life before they came to England. There are many amazing young people in Bristol’s Somali community. They are bridging different cultures: questioning and respecting the traditions of their parents and grandparents whilst questioning and respecting the challenges of contemporary British culture. Their thinking is nuanced and their campaigning is effective.</p> <p>The students of Integrate Bristol have achieved a huge amount in terms of getting the abuse of FGM into public consciousness. Some of them have been on Newsnight, lobbied Michael Gove in person, met Ban Ki-Moon and shared a stage with Malala. But the novel that finally emerged, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/275694/s/what-was-never-said/\">What Was Never Said</a>, is not, in itself, a campaigning novel. It’s the story of a young girl growing up and overcoming adversity. It does not tell the story of any of the students I met, but rather it imagines the situation of a girl who doesn’t have the support of their campaign. And there are many. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/07/24/335003587/unicef-report-on-female-genital-mutiliation-holds-hope-and-woe\">UNICEF estimates</a> that 133 million women have undergone FGM worldwide.

Never mind a trip to Glamorous Nails for that must-have, quarterly pedicure (a ritual I’ve enthusiastically embraced, as I’ve got older). My beauty regime may be low-maintenance but, thankfully, I do take a bit more care of my face than my feet.<br></p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/20/suzanne-moore-shoes-sex-feminism\">Prescribing the correct footwear is idiotic.

Japan</h2><p>There is some concern that Mount Fuji is showing signs of eruption in the near future, but as things stand, Japan’s most-active volcano is Mount Aso, in Aso Kujū national park on the southern island of Kyushu. It has one of the largest calderas in the world, offering myriad viewpoints over its twisted, pitted landscape. Aso town can be reached by train (one hour from Kumamoto, two from Beppu, fares between £6 and £12). There are <a href=\"http://www.kyusanko.co.jp/aso/lang_en/\">two cable car lines, called ropeways</a>, from which to explore the Aso area. Aso Nishi (west) cable car station is a short bus ride from Aso station (£3 each way). Aso Higashi (east) cable car station can be reached by taking a local train to Miyaji station and then walking up the road to the cable car station. A toll road (about £3.50) goes right to the summit of the crater where there is a large car park. There is a lot to explore within the caldera but visitors must remember to check on accessibility before setting off: Aso is a gassy beast and its emissions often see areas of the caldera closed off.<br>• <em>More information at </em><a href=\"http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4552.html\"><em>japan-guide.com</em></a><em>.

Still a spry and self-sufficient figure, his centenary has been marked by publication of a study of 14 eminent cases in which he was briefed for the defence. Space limitations have excluded several fascinating cases: Hutchinson defended the Great Train Robber Charlie Wilson, the corrupt Labour leader of<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northeast/series2/tdansmith_newcastlepolitics.shtml\"> Newcastle council, T Dan Smith</a>, and won in the court of appeal on behalf of Commander Christopher Swabey, after a 16-year fight against conviction by a Royal Navy court martial for indecent assault (Swabey had supposedly put his hand on a sub-lieutenant’s knee).</p><p>Hutchinson is a scion of the Bloomsbury set (his mother was a Strachey, who became a model for Virginia Woolf’s character Clarissa Dalloway as well as the lover of Clive Bell). He remembers both TS Eliot and John Maynard Keynes before they became the celebrity authors of <em>The Waste Land</em> and <em>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</em>. For much of the war he was a naval officer on ships commanded by Louis Mountbatten, and he was swept overboard when German dive-bombers sank the destroyer HMS Kelly. Mountbatten made the survivors sing “Roll out the Barrel” to lift their spirits.</p>","linkText":"Jeremy Hutchinson’s Case Histories review – from Lady Chatterley to Christine Keeler and the Great

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

A mother of two in her 20s, she is currently on maternity leave from her part-time retail job. Finances were tight enough when she had her first child. But now she is on statutory maternity pay, it’s even harder. Her husband Micha is a manual worker in a nearby factory on the minimum wage, and has been doing overtime to try to bridge the financial gap. As a result, the £52 a week working families tax credits the couple used to receive has been cut to £26. At the same time their rent, council tax, and utility bills have increased. Now it’s a struggle to make ends meet.</p><p>Her six-month-old son wriggles and laughs on her lap as she discusses the extra strain having a second child has put upon the family’s finances. “Micha is on minimum wage, full time. But he’s doing overtime, because I’m on maternity leave, and last week he did 74 hours,” she explains. “It costs our family life, we hardly see him. And you don’t even see the money because he pays more tax on it.” After rent, bills and food, the family have £44 left over, which they’re rarely able to save. Their car needs new tyres, but they can’t afford to replace them yet and Karolina’s daughter Lydia has returned home with a letter about a school trip costing £10. When Nowak looked into whether it was worth getting a full-time job and finding a childcare place for her son, she worked out that at £33 for six hours of childcare a day, while she earned £39, with travel costs on top, it simply made no financial sense. Instead, she will work at weekends, when her husband is at home.</p>","linkText":"On the edge: the working families who struggle to make ends meet | Dawn Foster","lastModified":1468497856000,"standfirst":"<p>A new report tells the stories of people experiencing in-work poverty in Liverpool, with further cuts only set to make it worse</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/496jg","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"society/poverty","url":"/society/poverty","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/society","url":"/society/society","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/socialexclusion","url":"/society/socialexclusion","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Social exclusion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/socialexclusion","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/benefits","url":"/society/benefits","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Benefits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/benefits","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"politics/welfare","url":"/politics/welfare","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Welfare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"politics/politics","url":"/politics/politics","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/public-sector-cuts","url":"/society/public-sector-cuts","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Public sector cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/public-sector-cuts","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/policy","url":"/society/policy","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Public services policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/policy","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/public-finance","url":"/society/public-finance","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Public finance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/public-finance","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"uk/liverpool","url":"/uk/liverpool","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"uk/uk","url":"/uk/uk","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/minimum-wage","url":"/society/minimum-wage","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Minimum wage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/minimum-wage","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/children","url":"/society/children","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/children","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/dawn-foster","url":"/profile/dawn-foster","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dawn-foster","bio":"<p>Dawn Foster is a writer on politics, social affairs and economics for The Guardian, London Review of Books, Independent and Times Literary Supplement, and is a regular political commentator for Sky News, Channel 4 News, and BBC Newsnight.

This is not what I want to hear. I want to hear that there is more to come and better, more dazzling concepts and descriptive tours de force to look forward to. Ishiguro also suggested that, as artists age, their output can be categorised according to three specific types – the Neil Young (who carries on enthusiastically doing more of the same), the Philip Roth (who distills his earlier work to an elegant minimalism) or the Bob Dylan model (who creates work that embraces age).</p><p>Ishiguro seems to be saying that an unconscious inclination to conform, and to repeat your earlier work, takes over for many artists. To me this undermines the basic concept of creativity, a bit like saying the opposite of “the best is yet to come”. But I refuse to lose hope, because the simple fact that his triumvirate of creative brains are exclusively male seems to fatally disrupt his theory. Where are the equally awesome older women? If we’re going to insist on genderising things (how quaint) I will, if I may, have a go at redressing the balance and suggest a few of my own models for being creative as you age.</p>","linkText":"Growing old artistically: five role models for women | Helen Walmsley-Johnson","lastModified":1432798048000,"standfirst":"Some creative flames may dim with age, but those of female artists tend to burn all the brighter.

Van Gogh comes to mind, as does F Scott Fitzgerald – and Duane Hanson. Hanson created hyperrealist figurative work at a time when it was academically anathema. His sculptures were enormously popular with the public and this also made him critically suspect, a fact of which he was well aware. To be underrated because of transient political fashions left Hanson without a full sense of artistic community, and this feeling of isolation is in evidence in his work, particularly in the solo figures created in the last two decades before his death in 1996. Their loneliness is almost achingly beautiful, and is reminiscent of a fellow American unique, Edward Hopper.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/may/26/larger-than-life-duane-hanson-hyperreal-sculptures-serpentine-in-pictures\">Larger than life: Duane Hanson's hyperreal sculptures – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Duane Hanson: ‘An artist tailor-made for the age of the selfie’","lastModified":1432681246000,"standfirst":"The late artist was derided for his hyperreal sculptures of everyday Americans doing everyday things.

He has 33 from 37 balls; when he batted No3 in Australia, it took him 100 balls to make 33. From Root to Woakes to Cook, this England team is full of really impressive self-improvement.</p> \n  <p>“Cook doesn’t often get significantly outscored these days does he?” says Gary Naylor. “And his captaincy has come on leaps and bounds since... well, we all know since what. His ‘performance’ is beginning to catch up with his numbers and maybe his reputation will follow in tow soon.” Let’s hope so; he certainly deserves it, especially after all that despicable abuse in 2014. It’ll be interesting to see how long he stays as captain; I assume until after the next Ashes. He could easily have five years as a batsman after that, which is quite unusual for a former captain.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div><div id=\"block-5788dbc3e4b08239dbab7812\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-15T12:52:18.028Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>14th over: England 74-1 (Cook 36, Root 32)</strong> I wasn’t sold on the Root move, and in truth was a bit affronted that Trevor Bayliss did not consult me, but the early signs have been really good. Wahab is trying to rip him from his bubble, following a sharp bouncer with a stare and then a tempting full delivery, the sort that has often led to Root’s downfall in recent years. Root ignores it, not once but twice. Then, when Wahab goes short again, Root uppercuts brilliantly for four more.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9945e5d0794ad50170cd856d55af319ced8dd4c3\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9945e5d0794ad50170cd856d55af319ced8dd4c3/0_0_2336_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Joe Root avoids a bouncer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Joe Root avoids a bouncer.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-15T12:56:31.708Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p> \n</div>","linkText":"England v Pakistan: first Test, day two – live!","lastModified":1468587485000,"standfirst":"<ul><li>Over-by-over reports from day two of the first Test at Lord’s</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/15/joy-of-six-england-pakistan-cricket\">The Joy of Six: England v Pakistan</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/15/schedule-announced-for-england-winter-tour-of-india-cricket\">Schedule announced for England’s winter tour of India</a></li><li>Send your thoughts to <a href=\"mailto:rob.smyth@theguardian.com\">rob.smyth@theguardian.com</a></li></ul>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pvjk","isLive":true,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"sport/england-v-pakistan-2016","url":"/sport/england-v-pakistan-2016","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"England v Pakistan 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-v-pakistan-2016","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/cricket","url":"/sport/cricket","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Cricket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","url":"/sport/england-cricket-team","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"England cricket team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/pakistancricketteam","url":"/sport/pakistancricketteam","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Pakistan cricket team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pakistancricketteam","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/over-by-over-reports","url":"/sport/over-by-over-reports","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Over by over reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/over-by-over-reports","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/sport","url":"/sport/sport","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","url":"/tone/minutebyminute","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/adam-collins","url":"/profile/adam-collins","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Adam Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-collins","twitterHandle":"collinsadam","bio":"<p>Adam Collins is a Melbourne-based cricket writer and commentator for, among others, the ABC and ESPNCricinfo.
