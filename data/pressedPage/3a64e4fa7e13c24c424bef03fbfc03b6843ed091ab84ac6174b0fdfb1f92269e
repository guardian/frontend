broadcaster briefs producers, Fairfax Media cuts cartoonists and the Australian praises Chris Uhlmann for striking ‘a blow for freedom of speech’","body":"<p>Mark Scott wasn’t kidding when he told the National Press Club on Wednesday that losing 10% of the ABC’s $200m news allocation in the May budget would mean <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/mark-scott-tells-press-club-sbs-could-be-cut-to-one-channel-under-merger-with-abc\">“significant cuts to jobs and programming”</a> . On Tuesday ABC News’s executive producers were briefed on possible budget cuts and asked to start making contingency plans should their budgets be trimmed again. (The word from Canberra was that the Turnbull government would not be as forthcoming as the Gillard government had been in topping up the ABC’s news coffers three years ago.) At risk is an additional $20m in tied funding allocated to the ABC each year for three years to create the national reporting team, establish the fact check unit and boost resources for the regions and digital content. “It also funded major, award-winning, in-depth prime-time documentary series like The Killing Season and George Megalogenis’s TV series Making Australia Great – compelling award-winning work, unlike anything else on Australian television,” Scott told the press club. If the additional $60m is not part of the triennial funding package the ABC may see even more reporters walk out the door or more programs disappear.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/mark-scott-tells-press-club-sbs-could-be-cut-to-one-channel-under-merger-with-abc\">Mark Scott lets fly at $350m cut to ABC funding by Abbott government</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: ABC braces for budget cuts as Mark Scott exits","lastModified":1456377481315,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>National broadcaster warns producers, Fairfax Media cuts cartoonists and the Australian praises Chris Uhlmann for striking ‘a blow for freedom of speech’</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3dd","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","url":"/australia-news/australia-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mark-scott","url":"/media/mark-scott","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Mark Scott","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mark-scott","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/fairfax-media","url":"/media/fairfax-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Fairfax Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/fairfax-media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/news-corporation","url":"/media/news-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"News Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

too pleased with the shabby treatment of the actor Kristin Davis by the Sunrise program on Thursday. Weekly Beast understands the latest antics have embarrassed the network. The former Sex and the City star, who played Charlotte to great acclaim, agreed to an interview on the Seven breakfast show to discuss her work with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The award-winning humanitarian has devoted herself to travelling to the world’s hot spots, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-10/sex-and-the-%20city-star-kristin-davis-on-the-refugee-crisis/7157686\">particularly in Africa</a>, and visited Canberra for meetings with government officials. <span tabindex=\"-1\">But after questions about her humanitarian work the Sunrise crew bombarded her with multiple questions about the series – which ended in 2004 – and then ambushed her into appearing in a cringeworthy Sex and the City skit. She was made to sit at a table with Samantha Armytage – dressed as Carrie Bradshaw in a comedy blonde curly wig – and Natalie Barr and Edwina Bartholomew and act out a scene from the </span><span tabindex=\"-1\"> show. While Davis remained polite and good-humoured on air, she did venture, “I don’t know that this is a great idea, frankly.” After the segment aired, however, Davis took to Twitter to confirm her displeasure, retweeting a fan who said: “That was the worst piece of TV I’ve ever seen. Kristin, you and your charity work is great. Shame Sunrise.”</span></p><figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"one\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;><p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;><a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KristinDavis&quot;>@KristinDavis</a> just wow.
