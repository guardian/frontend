On Tuesday ABC News’s executive producers were briefed on possible budget cuts and asked to start making contingency plans should their budgets be trimmed again. (The word from Canberra was that the Turnbull government would not be as forthcoming as the Gillard government had been in topping up the ABC’s news coffers three years ago.) At risk is an additional $20m in tied funding allocated to the ABC each year for three years to create the national reporting team, establish the fact check unit and boost resources for the regions and digital content. “It also funded major, award-winning, in-depth prime-time documentary series like The Killing Season and George Megalogenis’s TV series Making Australia Great – compelling award-winning work, unlike anything else on Australian television,” Scott told the press club. If the additional $60m is not part of the triennial funding package the ABC may see even more reporters walk out the door or more programs disappear.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/mark-scott-tells-press-club-sbs-could-be-cut-to-one-channel-under-merger-with-abc\">Mark Scott lets fly at $350m cut to ABC funding by Abbott government</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: ABC braces for budget cuts as Mark Scott exits","lastModified":1456377481315,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>National broadcaster warns producers, Fairfax Media cuts cartoonists and the Australian praises Chris Uhlmann for striking ‘a blow for freedom of speech’</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3dd","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","url":"/australia-news/australia-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mark-scott","url":"/media/mark-scott","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Mark Scott","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mark-scott","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/fairfax-media","url":"/media/fairfax-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Fairfax Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/fairfax-media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/news-corporation","url":"/media/news-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"News Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

too pleased with the shabby treatment of the actor Kristin Davis by the Sunrise program on Thursday. Weekly Beast understands the latest antics have embarrassed the network. The former Sex and the City star, who played Charlotte to great acclaim, agreed to an interview on the Seven breakfast show to discuss her work with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The award-winning humanitarian has devoted herself to travelling to the world’s hot spots, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-10/sex-and-the-%20city-star-kristin-davis-on-the-refugee-crisis/7157686\">particularly in Africa</a>, and visited Canberra for meetings with government officials. <span tabindex=\"-1\">But after questions about her humanitarian work the Sunrise crew bombarded her with multiple questions about the series – which ended in 2004 – and then ambushed her into appearing in a cringeworthy Sex and the City skit. She was made to sit at a table with Samantha Armytage – dressed as Carrie Bradshaw in a comedy blonde curly wig – and Natalie Barr and Edwina Bartholomew and act out a scene from the </span><span tabindex=\"-1\"> show. While Davis remained polite and good-humoured on air, she did venture, “I don’t know that this is a great idea, frankly.” After the segment aired, however, Davis took to Twitter to confirm her displeasure, retweeting a fan who said: “That was the worst piece of TV I’ve ever seen. Kristin, you and your charity work is great.

popular international current affairs show Foreign Correspondent from its prime-time spot of 8pm on a Tuesday night to the less populated 9.30pm slot for the 2016 schedule. The decision has angered the ABC’s news division because the move will likely cause audience numbers to crash from 800,000 to about 500,000 – but the top brass at SBS are fuming too. </p><p>Why SBS? Well, the other public broadcaster also has an international current affairs show – Dateline – which is already occupying the 9.30pm slot on Tuesdays. Both shows attract a similar audience but are now going to cannibalise each other. High-level talks between news bosses at ABC and SBS have failed to reach a compromise because the decision was made by the ABC’s TV division, which controls the schedule, and they wanted to put Catalyst at 8pm. </p>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: SBS fumes as Foreign Correspondent faces off with Dateline","lastModified":1455158282000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>ABC bumps current affairs show from prime time, the Australian loses a voice of reason and Daily Mail still estranged from Ten after spoiling The Bachelorette</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gd6q","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","url":"/australia-news/australia-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/sbs","url":"/media/sbs","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"SBS","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sbs","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Special Broadcasting Service","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/australian-television","url":"/culture/australian-television","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Australian television","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australian-television","description":"The latest news and comment on Australian television","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/news-corporation","url":"/media/news-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"News Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/media","url":"/media/media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/television","url":"/culture/television","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Television","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","url":"/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

As well as losing several senior executives and outsourcing the printing and distribution of its 60 titles, Bauer parted company with the editor-in-chief of the Australian Women’s Weekly, which is still Australia’s bestselling magazine.

Weekly Beast understands Bauer’s top brass is keen to get back to the magazine’s roots in middle-class suburban life and away from the focus on news, politics and executive women that marked McCabe’s tenure. </p>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: drama at Australian Women's Weekly, Cleo and Dolly","lastModified":1453416909000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Cleo is dumped and Helen McCabe’s tenure editing AWW ends as News Corp beds down new year appointments and Daily Mail Australia splits with Nine</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4g2am","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/magazines","url":"/media/magazines","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Magazines","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/bauer","url":"/media/bauer","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Bauer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bauer","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/media","url":"/media/media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","url":"/media/pressandpublishing","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mail-online","url":"/media/mail-online","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Mail Online","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/digital-media","url":"/media/digital-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Digital media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mediabusiness","url":"/media/mediabusiness","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediabusiness","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/foxtel","url":"/australia-news/foxtel","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Foxtel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/foxtel","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

SBS presenter Lee Lin Chin may be banned next week after the Advertising Standards Bureau’s board fast tracked its review. The advertisement for lamb, by industry group Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, has received an unprecedented 300-plus complaints since it went to air on Monday. In the ad Chin leads a military operation to extract “stranded” Australians from around the world, bringing them home for an Australia Day lamb meal. But hundreds of viewers have complained about the violence in the commercial during which a vegan’s home is torched by the military. A spokeswoman for the watchdog told Weekly Beast up to 90% of the cases considered by the board are dismissed. Complaints about the Australia Day lamb campaign featuring “lambassador” Sam Kekovich have been dismissed in previous years. Each year only about 10% are upheld and in those cases the ads have been found to have breached the advertising codes of practice.

broadcaster briefs producers, Fairfax Media cuts cartoonists and the Australian praises Chris Uhlmann for striking ‘a blow for freedom of speech’","body":"<p>Mark Scott wasn’t kidding when he told the National Press Club on Wednesday that losing 10% of the ABC’s $200m news allocation in the May budget would mean <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/mark-scott-tells-press-club-sbs-could-be-cut-to-one-channel-under-merger-with-abc\">“significant cuts to jobs and programming”</a> . On Tuesday ABC News’s executive producers were briefed on possible budget cuts and asked to start making contingency plans should their budgets be trimmed again. (The word from Canberra was that the Turnbull government would not be as forthcoming as the Gillard government had been in topping up the ABC’s news coffers three years ago.) At risk is an additional $20m in tied funding allocated to the ABC each year for three years to create the national reporting team, establish the fact check unit and boost resources for the regions and digital content. “It also funded major, award-winning, in-depth prime-time documentary series like The Killing Season and George Megalogenis’s TV series Making Australia Great – compelling award-winning work, unlike anything else on Australian television,” Scott told the press club.
