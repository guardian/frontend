National Press Club on Wednesday that losing 10% of the ABC’s $200m news allocation in the May budget would mean <a

On Tuesday ABC News’s executive producers were briefed on possible budget cuts and asked to start making contingency plans should their budgets be trimmed again. (The word from Canberra was that the Turnbull government would not be as forthcoming as the Gillard government had been in topping up the ABC’s news coffers three years ago.) At risk is an additional $20m in tied funding allocated to the ABC each year for three years to create the national reporting team, establish the fact check unit and boost resources for the regions and digital content. “It also funded major, award-winning, in-depth prime-time documentary series like The Killing Season and George Megalogenis’s TV series Making Australia Great – compelling award-winning work, unlike anything else on Australian television,” Scott told the press club. If the additional $60m is not part of the triennial funding package the ABC may see even more reporters walk out the door or more programs disappear.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/mark-scott-tells-press-club-sbs-could-be-cut-to-one-channel-under-merger-with-abc\">Mark Scott lets fly at $350m cut to ABC funding by Abbott government</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: ABC braces for budget cuts as Mark Scott exits","lastModified":1456377481315,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>National broadcaster warns producers, Fairfax Media cuts cartoonists and the Australian praises Chris Uhlmann for striking ‘a blow for freedom of speech’</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3dd","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","url":"/australia-news/australia-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mark-scott","url":"/media/mark-scott","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Mark Scott","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mark-scott","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/fairfax-media","url":"/media/fairfax-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Fairfax Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/fairfax-media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/news-corporation","url":"/media/news-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"News Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

too pleased with the shabby treatment of the actor Kristin Davis by the Sunrise program on Thursday. Weekly Beast understands the latest antics have embarrassed the network. The former Sex and the City star, who played Charlotte to great acclaim, agreed to an interview on the Seven breakfast show to discuss her work with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The award-winning humanitarian has devoted herself to travelling to the world’s hot spots, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-10/sex-and-the-%20city-star-kristin-davis-on-the-refugee-crisis/7157686\">particularly in Africa</a>, and visited Canberra for meetings with government officials. <span tabindex=\"-1\">But after questions about her humanitarian work the Sunrise crew bombarded her with multiple questions about the series – which ended in 2004 – and then ambushed her into appearing in a cringeworthy Sex and the City skit. She was made to sit at a table with Samantha Armytage – dressed as Carrie Bradshaw in a comedy blonde curly wig – and Natalie Barr and Edwina Bartholomew and act out a scene from the </span><span tabindex=\"-1\"> show. While Davis remained polite and good-humoured on air, she did venture, “I don’t know that this is a great idea, frankly.” After the segment aired, however, Davis took to Twitter to confirm her displeasure, retweeting a fan who said: “That was the worst piece of TV I’ve ever seen. Kristin, you and your charity work is great. Shame Sunrise.”</span></p><figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"one\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;><p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;><a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KristinDavis&quot;>@KristinDavis</a> just wow.

popular international current affairs show Foreign Correspondent from its prime-time spot of 8pm on a Tuesday night to the less populated 9.30pm slot for the 2016 schedule. The decision has angered the ABC’s news division because the move will likely cause audience numbers to crash from 800,000 to about 500,000 – but the top brass at SBS are fuming too. </p><p>Why SBS? Well, the other public broadcaster also has an international current affairs show – Dateline – which is already occupying the 9.30pm slot on Tuesdays. Both shows attract a similar audience but are now going to cannibalise each other. High-level talks between news bosses at ABC and SBS have failed to reach a compromise because the decision was made by the ABC’s TV division, which controls the schedule, and they wanted to put Catalyst at 8pm. </p>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: SBS fumes as Foreign Correspondent faces off with Dateline","lastModified":1455158282000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>ABC bumps current affairs show from prime time, the Australian loses a voice of reason and Daily Mail still estranged from Ten after spoiling The Bachelorette</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gd6q","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","url":"/australia-news/australia-news","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/sbs","url":"/media/sbs","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"SBS","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sbs","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Special Broadcasting Service","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/australian-television","url":"/culture/australian-television","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Australian television","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australian-television","description":"The latest news and comment on Australian television","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/news-corporation","url":"/media/news-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"News Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/media","url":"/media/media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/television","url":"/culture/television","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Television","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","url":"/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/australia-culture-blog/2013/jun/02/paper-giants-magazine-wars\">Paper Giants</a>. The once-proud Australian company owned by the late Kerry Packer is being slowly downsized by its German owners, Bauer Media, who bought the company for $500m in 2012. </p><p>One by one, titles have been closed or merged until this week a big-name title steeped in Australian cultural history, Cleo, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/20/cleo-magazine-to-close-and-dolly-to-become-bi-monthly-bauer-media-says\">was unceremoniously dumped</a>. As well as losing several senior executives and outsourcing the printing and distribution of its 60 titles, Bauer parted company with the editor-in-chief of the Australian Women’s Weekly, which is still Australia’s bestselling magazine. After six years at the Weekly, former News Corp senior journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/13/australian-womens-weekly-editor-in-chief-helen-mccabe-resigns-after-six-years\">Helen McCabe was suddenly out the door</a>, reportedly with the remaining six months of her contract to be served on “gardening leave” and no job lined up. Weekly Beast understands Bauer’s top brass is keen to get back to the magazine’s roots in middle-class suburban life and away from the focus on news, politics and executive women that marked McCabe’s tenure. </p>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: drama at Australian Women's Weekly, Cleo and Dolly","lastModified":1453416909000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Cleo is dumped and Helen McCabe’s tenure editing AWW ends as News Corp beds down new year appointments and Daily Mail Australia splits with Nine</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4g2am","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/magazines","url":"/media/magazines","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Magazines","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/bauer","url":"/media/bauer","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Bauer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bauer","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/media","url":"/media/media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","url":"/media/pressandpublishing","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mail-online","url":"/media/mail-online","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Mail Online","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/digital-media","url":"/media/digital-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Digital media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/mediabusiness","url":"/media/mediabusiness","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediabusiness","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"australia-news/foxtel","url":"/australia-news/foxtel","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webTitle":"Foxtel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/foxtel","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

SBS presenter Lee Lin Chin may be banned next week after the Advertising Standards Bureau’s board fast tracked its review. The advertisement for lamb, by industry group Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, has received an unprecedented 300-plus complaints since it went to air on Monday. In the ad Chin leads a military operation to extract “stranded” Australians from around the world, bringing them home for an Australia Day lamb meal. But hundreds of viewers have complained about the violence in the commercial during which a vegan’s home is torched by the military. A spokeswoman for the watchdog told Weekly Beast up to 90% of the cases considered by the board are dismissed. Complaints about the Australia Day lamb campaign featuring “lambassador” Sam Kekovich have been dismissed in previous years. Each year only about 10% are upheld and in those cases the ads have been found to have breached the advertising codes of practice. When a complaint is upheld, the advertiser has to pull the offending ad off air. </p><h2> The ABCs of running Aunty</h2>","linkText":"The Weekly Beast: silence of the lambs as Australia Day Lee Lin Chin ad faces ban","lastModified":1452721356000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Chin’s controversial ad promoting Australian lamb; new ABC head needs to brush up on interview skills; it’s Logies voting time and streaming is on the rise</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4fnxx","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"media/series/the-weekly-beast","url":"/media/series/the-weekly-beast","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-weekly-beast","description":"Guardian Australia's weekly media diary","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australia-media","url":"/media/australia-media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media","description":"Latest news and analysis on Australian media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/media","url":"/media/media","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/sbs","url":"/media/sbs","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"SBS","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sbs","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Special Broadcasting Service","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","url":"/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/australian-broadcasting-corporation","description":"Latest news and analysis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"sport/super-bowl","url":"/sport/super-bowl","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webTitle":"Super Bowl","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/netflix","url":"/media/netflix","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Netflix","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"technology/facebook","url":"/technology/facebook","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Facebook","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"media/socialnetworking","url":"/media/socialnetworking","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Social networking","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/socialnetworking","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"technology/technology","url":"/technology/technology","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/amanda-meade","url":"/profile/amanda-meade","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Amanda Meade","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-meade","bio":"<p>Amanda Meade is Guardian Australia's media correspondent and writes media diary the Weekly Beast.

The letters desk receives a significant number of these per day, perhaps because, while we omit the addressee when publishing a letter, other newspapers, including the Telegraph and the Times, continue to use this more formal style. It is, to my mind, an archaic convention, and one that the Guardian dispensed with long ago in 1988 as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/archive-educational-resource-february\" title=\"\">the Hillman redesign</a>. But more important, addressing your letter to “Sir” or “Sirs” no longer makes any sense.</p><p>The Guardian has had a female editor-in-chief for almost a year now – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/20/guardian-appoints-katharine-viner-new-editor-in-chief\" title=\"\">Katharine Viner</a> took over in June 2015. Many readers have cottoned on to this and address their letters either “Dear Madam”, “Madam”, or simply: “To the Editor”, but a surprising number either remain oblivious or continue the “Sir” tradition regardless. You might think that the continued use of “Sir/Sirs” is because letter writers have sent their musings to a number of different newspapers, some of which still use the convention.

stars (Simon Calder, Patrick Cockburn, Grace Dent, Robert Fisk) so far officially confirmed as mighty brands who will be staying when they become online-only, less illustrious hacks talk of a worsening “civil war” atmosphere between printies and webbies – so that a mutinous cheer could be heard on Thursday from some of the former when the <a

left</a> or is a hardline God-botherer, but that he’s just too gigantic to be a co-anchor at all? Being well over 6ft is fine for solo anchormen, as 6ft 5in Jon Snow showed over the 22 years when he ruled Channel 4 News alone; and if you’re tallish but no giant, there isn’t a big issue if you and your co-presenter are sitting down (as with 6ft 3in Jeremy Paxman and Kirsty Wark, in their improbable stint as BBC breakfast hosts, or 6ft 2in Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan), which reduces the difference. At 6ft 6in, though, he is only compatible with people as tall as the strikers and centrebacks who tend to be his guests on Football Focus; Walker and Louise Minchin will always look distractingly ill-matched together, whichever way round they sit.</p>","linkText":"Media Monkey: Dan Walker, Theresa May’s cleavage and Barack Obama","lastModified":1458518708000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>BBC

stars (Simon Calder, Patrick Cockburn, Grace Dent, Robert Fisk) so far officially confirmed as mighty brands who will be staying when they become online-only, less illustrious hacks talk of a worsening “civil war” atmosphere between printies and webbies – so that a mutinous cheer could be heard on Thursday from some of the former when the <a

left</a> or is a hardline God-botherer, but that he’s just too gigantic to be a co-anchor at all? Being well over 6ft is fine for solo anchormen, as 6ft 5in Jon Snow showed over the 22 years when he ruled Channel 4 News alone; and if you’re tallish but no giant, there isn’t a big issue if you and your co-presenter are sitting down (as with 6ft 3in Jeremy Paxman and Kirsty Wark, in their improbable stint as BBC breakfast hosts, or 6ft 2in Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan), which reduces the difference. At 6ft 6in, though, he is only compatible with people as tall as the strikers and centrebacks who tend to be his guests on Football Focus; Walker and Louise Minchin will always look distractingly ill-matched together, whichever way round they sit.</p>","linkText":"Media Monkey: Dan Walker, Theresa May’s cleavage and Barack Obama","lastModified":1458518708000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>BBC

stars (Simon Calder, Patrick Cockburn, Grace Dent, Robert Fisk) so far officially confirmed as mighty brands who will be staying when they become online-only, less illustrious hacks talk of a worsening “civil war” atmosphere between printies and webbies – so that a mutinous cheer could be heard on Thursday from some of the former when the <a

left</a> or is a hardline God-botherer, but that he’s just too gigantic to be a co-anchor at all? Being well over 6ft is fine for solo anchormen, as 6ft 5in Jon Snow showed over the 22 years when he ruled Channel 4 News alone; and if you’re tallish but no giant, there isn’t a big issue if you and your co-presenter are sitting down (as with 6ft 3in Jeremy Paxman and Kirsty Wark, in their improbable stint as BBC breakfast hosts, or 6ft 2in Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan), which reduces the difference. At 6ft 6in, though, he is only compatible with people as tall as the strikers and centrebacks who tend to be his guests on Football Focus; Walker and Louise Minchin will always look distractingly ill-matched together, whichever way round they sit.</p>","linkText":"Media Monkey: Dan Walker, Theresa May’s cleavage and Barack Obama","lastModified":1458518708000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>BBC
