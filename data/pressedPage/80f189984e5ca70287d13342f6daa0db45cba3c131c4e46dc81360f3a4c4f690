In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

True to her role as the co-creator – with frenemy Courtney Love – of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderwhore\" title=\"\">kinderwhore fashion</a>, Bjelland is a fragile figure in a delicate minidress, her black hair teased into a precarious bird’s nest.

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Now the Nottingham rapper immortalised in the Shane Meadows film is back with his first album, Aeon","body":"<p>“I was a chubby white kid who wasn’t very cool at school,” says <a href=\"http://www.scorzilla.com/aeon-peace-to-the-puzzle/\">Scor-zay-zee</a>. “I took up rapping because I wanted to be cool.” For one fleeting moment in 2004, the underground Nottingham rapper became exactly that: the most talked-about man in music. His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

2016 Brit Awards, were it not for the fact that using the phrase “ideological disparity” seems a bit much when discussing an ITV show whose dedicated light-entertainment bent was underlined by the

Murs and Robbie Williams recreating the Dancing in the Street video Bowie and Mick Jagger made for Live Aid.</p>","linkText":"Brit awards 2016: there's no fun in being told what you already

underground band’s following has grown in a way they never would have anticipated. This is evident from their triumphant reformation at <a href=\"http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/04/the-10-best-moments-from-coachella-2012.html\">Coachella in 2012</a> and traces of their seminal album The Shape Of Punk To Come lurking within much of modern punk music. And let’s not forget their militant <a href=\"http://www.aux.tv/2013/04/qa-refused-on-the-prophecy-of-the-shape-of-punk-to-come/\">stance on veganism</a>, which lives on within the dietary requirements of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/02/beyonce-vegan-food-service-celebrity-trend\">Beyoncé and Lil B</a>. Big fans of the Scandinavian post-hardcore scene, apparently.</p><p>It makes sense, then, to return with a full album. In <a href=\"http://epitaph.com/artists/refused\">Freedom</a>, out on 30 June, the youthful exuberance of “full-on anarchist jargon” is gone, and in its place are songs inspired by time spent “talking about politics, existential issues and what we wanted to present as a band in 2015,” says vocalist Dennis Lyxzén. “We talked about the political situation in Europe, capitalism and how it affects people.”</p>","linkText":"Listen to Refused's new track Françafrique","lastModified":1432630805000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Premiered ahead of new album Freedom, the Swedish punk band ditch

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432309754000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

Within a few months of moving here, a friend and I set up a record label – <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.howlingowlrecords.com/\">Howling Owl </a>– and now, the thing that keeps us motivated is the perpetual flow of new music and sense of risk. It’s a place where progression is key and genres and “scenes” happily splice with one another, creating beautiful hybrids that get discovered five years later – by which time the next future has already been cut on to a dub-plate. I’m not going to gush about the city as there are enough sponsored “best places to live in the UK” polls driving the house prices up already, but it is one hell of an audiovisual treat.<br

Bevan’s refreshing virtuosity pairs splendidly with the Dunedins in this enjoyable romp through Bach and Handel ","body":"<p>Bach never wrote an opera but he knew all the tricks and came darn close. Much of his sacred vocal music is dramatic enough for any stage — emotionally charged enough, too, from a singer as charismatic, playful and expressively frank as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/06/young-eno-singers-ready-for-top-roles\">Sophie Bevan</a>. This week the soprano joins conductor John Butt and the Dunedin Consort for <a href=\"http://www.dunedin-consort.org.uk/diary/\">a tour of Bach and Handel solo cantatas</a> cut with spirited ensemble concertos.</p><p>It’s an evening essentially designed to showcase Bevan’s splendid voice, which it does, but the band provides the right style and personality for her to spark against. There’s something brilliantly robust and natural about her singing: no artifice, no fuss, a healthy wit, a refreshing kind of virtuosity that’s grounded and almost casual but still totally dazzling. Her voice is bigger and richer than we’re used to hearing with the Dunedins, but it works. In Bach’s cantata Falsche Welt (False World) she entered full-throttle with images of snakes and scorpions then gave beaming confidence to the effusive line: “God is faithful.” In Handel’s early cantata Alpestre Monte she was all ardent anguish in the aria Almen Dopo il Fato Mio. In his 1706 Gloria setting – lost for centuries but unearthed in 2001 at the Royal Academy of Music library – she brought a hint of cheek to the lavish repetitions of Laudamus te (“We praise you”).</p>","linkText":"Dunedin Consort / Butt / Sophie Bevan review – baroque fireworks lit by natural spark","lastModified":1456351234000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>University of Glasgow Chapel<br></strong>Bevan’s refreshing virtuosity pairs splendidly with the Dunedins in this enjoyable romp through Bach and Handel <strong><br></strong></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h2tc","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.

to bare his soul. His cathartic hymns, describing life, death, despair and loneliness, have made one of Manchester’s music scene’s biggest names a leading candidate for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/22/money-shadow-of-heaven-review\">mainstream success</a>. Standing alone in a spotlight, however, hands on hips and staring down at a silent crowd, Lee seems more vulnerable than ever. “I don’t know what you know or what you’ve read,” he says. “But I want to say thank you to the people who looked after me when I needed help.

With most of the familiar characters propelled into a recognisably current political instability from which they must flee, the challenge is to make us care about their fate and about them as individuals.

greatest enigmas. “Where’m I at?” he asks quizzically, once the initial applause has receded. In his pinstripes and fedora, he looks sharp enough not to have forgotten what city he’s in. But then he turns and repeats the question to his saxophonist. Terminally flaky or too cool to care? It’s hard to tell. Despite his age, Otis is not what you could call a seasoned performer.</p><p> Following the commercial failure of his 1974 masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/inspiration-information-mw0000116207\">Inspiration Information</a> – an intoxicating blend of psychedelic soul and folky introspection, marked by a prescient use of electronics – he vanished for almost 27 years. When that album was rereleased to great acclaim in 2001, he fluffed his comeback shows spectacularly, while his last appearance in London three years ago was marred by technical glitches.</p>","linkText":"Shuggie Otis review – R&B phenomenon radiates cool","lastModified":1456178440000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Koko, London<br></strong>Otis returned to his virtuoso

Then, as the swirl of Edwin Congreave’s keyboards and the twin guitars of Yannis Philippakis and Jimmy Smith climbs to a peak – as it does on the early song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0IKAQVVksQ\">Red Socks Pugie</a>, or the newer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4boJyTwQ4U\">Inhaler</a> – dozens of half-naked people launch themselves at each other. At the back of the stage, Kit Monteith, a sixth, recent auxiliary member of Foals, occasionally thwacks a cowbell you can’t really hear.</p><p>This is Foals at Wembley, the pinnacle of the Oxford quintet’s career (at least, thus far: you suspect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/28/foals-and-disclosure-announced-as-reading-and-leeds-headliners\">their headline slot at this summer’s Reading and Leeds festivals</a> might be another one). A gig where the indie rock outfit’s nimble, awkward origins could easily be bulldozed in the pursuit of the big moment, but are never quite trampled underfoot. Not long ago, commentators were wondering where the next generation of festival headliners was going to come from, when the top spots were being hogged by a rotating cast of usual suspects – a vicious cycle of cause and effect (“Foo Fighters fatigue” is one name for the situation). Leftfield rock has spat out an obvious answer.</p>","linkText":"Foals live review – feel the muscle","lastModified":1456045220000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<strong>SSE Wembley Arena, London</strong><br />Foals complete the journey from punk-funk to rock, without losing their subtlety","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gzzf","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/foals","url":"/music/foals","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Foals","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/foals","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/muse","url":"/music/muse","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Muse","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/muse","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/vampire-weekend","url":"/music/vampire-weekend","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Vampire Weekend","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/vampire-weekend","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kittyempire","url":"/profile/kittyempire","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kitty Empire","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kittyempire","twitterHandle":"kittyempire666","bio":"<p>Kitty Empire is the Observer's pop critic.

Matthews pays homage to Beethoven, with thrilling results","body":"<p>Beethoven has been a lifelong source of inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.david-matthews.co.uk/homepage.asp\" title=\"\">David Matthews</a>, so it was natural for him to take a bagatelle by his hero as the starting point for his own monumental String Quartet No 11, a set of 13 variations, similar in scale to Beethoven’s late

Heavy on the German experimental past (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/19/brand-neu-album-review\" title=\"\">Neu!</a>, chiefly), and free with early techno, the bloop ’n’ burble of modular synths and Joe Dilworth’s live drumming pack a surprising number of facets on this debut album (though the limited double-LP <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DMFV-O9aIU&amp;list=RD2DMFV-O9aIU#t=11\" title=\"\">Blood Drums</a> was released in 2013). The default groove might be early 70s motorik – Tardis Cymbals is a typically beatific workout – but tracks Blowing My Nose Under Close Observation and Hi-Hats Bring the Hiss are proper dance music, while the Sonic Boom-enhanced Planetary Folklore is both spacey and creepy. The only downer is the solitary sung vocal on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPfPQslS-s&amp;index=2&amp;list=RD2DMFV-O9aIU\" title=\"\">Liquid Gate</a>, courtesy of Deerhunter’s Bradford

No worthier candidate, of course: Staples’ voice accompanied the civil rights movement and inspired musicians from Bowie to Prince. But at times the music feels less like a tribute to her remarkable legacy than an exercise in smooth, award-ceremony funk. There are exceptions – Cave’s Jesus Lay Down Beside Me is a beautifully bruised gospel number; Action by Tune-Yards combines political anger with slinky call-and-response – but you wish more of

conventional jazz big band. But that idea is soon dispelled. <a href=\"http://www.amibotheringyou.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Formanek</a> has reimagined the tones and textures that these 18 familiar instruments can create together, and the result is, to say the least, unsettling. From massive blocks of solid sound to delicate, wandering melodies, this music is bewildering in its sheer, determined difference. But it’s also gripping, because the ensemble acts as a setting for a parade of remarkable soloists. Over <a href=\"https://www.ecmrecords.com/catalogue/1452521208/the-distance-michael-formanek-ensemble-kolossus\" title=\"\">the CD</a>’s 71 minutes, it gradually becomes clear that the unique sound of

What an irony that he should have <a href=\"http://www.harnoncourt.info/en/\" title=\"\">felt it necessary to retire</a> last year without completing his return to those works with his own Concentus Musicus of Vienna. This single disc of the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies thus has special poignancy.

From the sublimely mysterious opening of the Fourth, to the electric coda of the last movement of the Fifth with added pauses, this recording burns with intensity and vitality.</p>","linkText":"Beethoven: Symphonies 4 & 5 CD review – Harnoncourt bows out with blazing intensity","lastModified":1456041319000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Concentus Musicus Wien/Harnoncourt<br>(Sony)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gnkh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/ludwig-van-beethoven","url":"/music/ludwig-van-beethoven","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Ludwig van Beethoven","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ludwig-van-beethoven","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/nicholas-kenyon","url":"/profile/nicholas-kenyon","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Nicholas Kenyon","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholas-kenyon","bio":"<p>Nicholas Kenyon is managing director of the Barbican Centre and was director of the BBC Proms from 1996 to 2007.

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432306641000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of

mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

The Cocteaus’ initial releases –1982’s Garlands album, followed by the Lullabies and Peppermint Pig EPs – were almost proof-of-concept efforts with flashes of inspiration, something also borne out by sessions for John Peel. It’s easy to hear what fed into the dark, overwhelming flow of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teS_ig-6aNU\">Garlands</a> – Siouxsie and the Banshees, in particular – but at the same time, the rigid punch of their electronic beats gave them as much of a distinct mark, blended together with Liz Fraser’s understated, unusual vocals. If there’s a standard on Garlands, Wax and Wane is it – the buildup of percussion, Will Heggie’s murmuring bassline then Robin Guthrie’s cascading sheets of guitar sets the stage for Fraser’s still comparatively quiet but nonetheless strong singing turn.

career spanning more than 40 years as a guitarist and songwriter, Deniz Tek has been remarkably consistent, though not necessarily prolific. Tek, who is best known for his work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/20/popandrock2\">the Australian proto-punk band Radio Birdman</a>, averages a studio album or EP release every two to three years, and has often gone several years between releases. However, he has a few other strings to his bow. By the time Radio Birdman released their scorching debut EP Burn My Eye in 1976, Tek was already studying medicine. He became a flight surgeon with the US navy, where he also trained as a fighter pilot, and now divides his time between rock’n’roll and working as a trauma surgeon in in Australia and Hawaii. Clearly, he’s not one of those musicians who’s at a loss when they haven’t got a gig lined up.</p><p>Tek was born and grew up in the US, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he would sneak into gigs by the MC5 and the Stooges, who proved to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fsMo7OAzXQ\">among his primary influences</a>. When his father, an engineering professor, was offered a year’s secondment at the University of New South Wales in Sydney in 1967, the family temporarily relocated to Australia. After graduating from high school in the US, Tek wanted to pursue his own degree in medicine and he decided to study in Sydney. By the time he had seen the Rolling Stones on their 1972 Australian tour – and <a href=\"http://www.deniztek.com/#!1958-national-baron/c1rdq\">sold a vintage National guitar to Keith Richards</a>, no less – it was clear that music was going to be as much a part of his life as his curative vocation.</p>","linkText":"Cult heroes: Deniz Tek – Stooges fan and fighter pilot who took punk to

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-\"Fame\" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called \"ambient\" – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1452445457000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","linkText":"Joy Williams: What got me through the Civil Wars breakup?

It’s fitting, then, that her&nbsp;first long-playing solo project since 1997’s <em>Lipslide</em> – her new album, <em>Red Kite</em> – is a gorgeous, bucolic affair.</p>","linkText":"Sarah Cracknell: ‘I like being in a gang.

More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness.

from somewhere in the past: 2012, and a studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “How could I have known,” it goes, synthesisers shimmering gorgeously, “the god of my youth would come crashing down on my heart?” The song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5O1JHUP1u0\">Ablaze</a>, continues more joyously: it is a fabulous pop song about love and how it can create “a new fire” in your heart. That sadder line from the first verse sticks in the mind, though, given all that followed for School of Seven Bells.</p><p>This celebratory opening track, and much of their new, fourth album, <em>SVIIB</em>, was written the summer before one half of the duo, Benjamin Curtis, was diagnosed with a rare form of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma,. Curtis’s diagnosis came in the autumn of 2012; he died on 29 December 2013. He was 35. His best friend, ex-girlfriend and surviving band member, Alejandra Deheza, who is singing the words they recorded, was left with an album they couldn’t finish together. A year later, she began completing it for the two of them.</p>","linkText":"School of Seven Bells’ Alejandra Deheza: ‘Ben feels part of everything now’","lastModified":1456231026000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"With the release of SVIIB, the American duo’s final album, Alejandra Deheza explains the importance of completing the record following the death of her bandmate and soulmate, Benjamin Curtis","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gnm4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/indie","url":"/music/indie","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Indie","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/indie","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/interview","url":"/tone/interview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Interviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/juderogers","url":"/profile/juderogers","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Jude Rogers","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/juderogers","bio":"<p>Jude Rogers writes for publications including the Observer, Guardian, New Statesman, Marie Claire and Q.

AMA. He’s a bit surprised by its monotony. Fans asked about working with Trent Reznor, how he felt about Bernie Sanders’ chances in New Hampshire (“Bernie’s chances are growing every day and I’m happy about that”), and his thoughts on Kanye West’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>.</p><p>“The questions were all what I expected,” he says, almost annoyed. “They played it kind of safe.” Williams has forged a successful career doing just the opposite: he’s a poet, musician, actor, activist and an esteemed rapper who last released a full-length project in 2011, the hyper-experimental Volcanic Sunlight.

It was received with almost universal rapture, and comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush\">Kate Bush</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/laurie-anderson\">Laurie Anderson</a> and Nico flooded in. Music blogs dedicated themselves to decoding the enigmatic lyrics and cryptic allusions. The album was ubiquitous in critics’ end-of-year lists: it was chosen as the best album of 2015 by <em>Mojo</em> and <em>Uncut</em>, and in the top five by the <em>Guardian,</em> the<em> Sunday Times, Loud and Quiet</em>, <em>Q</em> and the <em>Wire</em>.</p><p>Yet, Julia Holter says, her life has not changed “at all”. She doesn’t get stopped for autographs. “No one recognises me on the street ever,” she says. “Maybe once or twice in my entire life, if at all. I think people have an idea that if you have a record out you’re famous.” Ask a roomful of critics what they think of Julia Holter and you’ll be submerged in breathless adoration; ask a random person in the street and you’re likely to get a blank stare. This suits her perfectly well. “I prefer this; I’m happy that way. You can have an internet presence but it doesn’t mean anyone has any idea who you are or what you look like. Which is great.”</p>","linkText":"Julia Holter: ‘I tend to feel like everything I’m doing is crazy’","lastModified":1455442213000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"The singer-songwriter’s dazzling 2015 album Have You in My Wilderness was a fixture in end-of-year lists.

Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>£30</p>\n <p>£175</p>\n <p>£1,500</p>\n <p>£3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times. But which band has he never appeared at the festival as a member of?</p>\n <p>Them Crooked Vultures</p>\n <p>Nirvana</p>\n <p>Queens of the Stone Age</p>\n <p>Foo Fighters</p>\n <p>10 After the Leeds leg of the festival moved from Temple Newsam to Bramham Park, the owner of the Bramham estate said the extra revenue would enable him to undertake renovations and improvements. Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

Perhaps the last thing you need when you’ve arrived there, brain fuddled with jetlag, is a conversation with Damon Albarn in full manic flow. One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work?

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

2016 Brit Awards, were it not for the fact that using the phrase “ideological disparity” seems a bit much when discussing an ITV show whose dedicated light-entertainment bent was underlined by the

celebration of British music to draft in the biggest global names it can get, in order to make British music look like the poor relation to what’s happening in America – the big noise was a tribute to

Murs and Robbie Williams recreating the Dancing in the Street video Bowie and Mick Jagger made for Live Aid.</p>","linkText":"Brit awards 2016: there's no fun in being told what you already
