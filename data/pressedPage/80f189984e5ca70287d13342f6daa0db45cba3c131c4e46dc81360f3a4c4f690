In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

True to her role as the co-creator – with frenemy Courtney Love – of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderwhore\" title=\"\">kinderwhore fashion</a>, Bjelland is a fragile figure in a delicate minidress, her black hair teased into a precarious bird’s nest.

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Now the Nottingham rapper immortalised in the Shane Meadows film is back with his first album, Aeon","body":"<p>“I was a chubby white kid who wasn’t very cool at school,” says <a href=\"http://www.scorzilla.com/aeon-peace-to-the-puzzle/\">Scor-zay-zee</a>. “I took up rapping because I wanted to be cool.” For one fleeting moment in 2004, the underground Nottingham rapper became exactly that: the most talked-about man in music. His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

She could handle earthy blues and sophisticated ballads with equal facility, could improvise like a jazz musician, and her honeyed sound with its churchy overtones was always a compelling listen. In a six-decade career, she made more than 30 albums, was nominated four times for Grammys, and was garlanded with accolades and awards from her home town of Seattle, whose mayor called her “Seattle’s ambassador to the world”.</p><p>Her big breakthrough came in 1958 with the release in the US of the album Hot Cargo, with the bandleader Harry Arnold. It was so popular that she was featured on the cover of Time magazine, appeared at the initial Monterey jazz festival in 1958, won the New Star award in Down Beat magazine’s Critics Poll of 1959, and signed up with Mercury Records, with whom she released half a dozen albums.</p>","linkText":"Ernestine Anderson obituary","lastModified":1458491995000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"American jazz and blues

It spins the listener on his/her head, rewiring their brains to maximum capacity, then brings them home, sweet home.”</p>","linkText":"The Orb – Moonbuilding 2703 AD:

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly.

singing again on Convenanza, a dubby, dark album that once more bears the influence of post-punk as well as Weatherall’s esoteric reading habits, this time involving early 20th-century central European literature: ‘I’m quite proud of the fact that I’ve made the first disco record to mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/07/hans-fallada-alone-berlin-rereading\">Hans

Both of which were likely to have been carried out wearing a biscuit-coloured sports bra. By 1997, young women around the globe marched to the pop group’s buffalo-booted manifesto; something that I observed with awe but was totally unable to replicate myself. It wasn’t until four London girls – rather women – called Mel, Shaznay, Nicole and Natalie arrived, that the British pop explosion delivered an understated ethos I could fully latch on to.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X28-olxweYk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X28-olxweYk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The way they were … \n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X28-olxweYk\">watch the video for Never Ever by All Saints</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Welcome back, All Saints: leaders of an understated girl power","lastModified":1456252111518,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>With a new single, One Strike, written to exorcise the demons of divorce, the 90s girl band have resettled straight into their laidback groove.

of BFFs – Ellie Goulding turns and dramatically retreats from a spotlit platform in the middle of the arena.

On a towering wall of tangram-shaped screens, a montage of candid Facebook snaps is seamlessly intercut with live footage that captures fans lustily singing along.</p><p> For anyone else, this would be the perfect zenith – a rousing showstopper to bring down the curtain.

Bloodshot eyes, matted hair and beard, skin puffy and sallow, eyes distant yet wild: within days, Mussorgsky (1839-81) would be dead of drink, aged 42. He received no proper training in composition. Nor did he ever earn his living from music. Born into Russian nobility, he went into the army then spent his increasingly dissolute life as a government clerk, suffering alcohol-induced epilepsy, bouts of madness and destitution. The rumour that his grave is now under a bus stop is hard to verify but completes the sad picture.</p><p>Yet he had friends and admirers, most of them fellow composers.

He was working for the forestry department when he wrote this awkward, misshapen masterpiece based on Pushkin. It was rejected by St Petersburg’s Mariinsky theatre in part for its lack of a leading female role.

href=\"http://www.johannesbrahms.org/\">Brahms</a>’s D major Serenade was his first orchestral work, completed in 1859, while he was working on his First Piano Concerto. But it had begun life as a chamber piece, first as an octet and then a nonet for four strings and five wind, with a second clarinet replacing the usual oboe. The nonet score has long since disappeared, but the Argentinian conductor <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.naxos.com/person/Jorge_Rotter/31838.htm\">Jorge Rotter</a> has reconstructed it, using the vestiges of the original that persist in the orchestral version as his starting point, to produce the substantial chamber piece that made up the bulk of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ensemble-modern.com/en\">Ensemble Modern</a>’s programme.</p><p>Rotter has certainly done a plausible job. Most of his version of the Serenade sounds Brahmsian enough; only some unison string lines in the big funeral march Adagio strike a false note. But what’s lost in this reduction are the pre-echoes of the way Brahms would use the orchestra in his symphonies. If any of the textures in the nonet scoring look forward to later works, it’s to the Clarinet Quintet composed at the very end of his life, while there are many more connections backwards, to earlier 19th-century models such as Beethoven, Schubert and Spohr.</p>","linkText":"Ensemble Modern review – string theory and Brahms

At the opera’s centre we find Berenice, queen of Egypt, embroiled in a five-way emotional chain, each member of which is hopelessly attracted to another. This precarious configuration, and with it Egyptian political stability, is threatened by the queen’s obsessive desire for the unpopular Macedonian prince Demetrio, while the Roman ambassador Fabio is determined that the Republic’s hero Alessandro should marry into the Egyptian royal family – any available female member of which will seemingly do as the bride. </p>","linkText":"Berenice review – strong singing doesn't make the plot any clearer","lastModified":1458338449000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>St George’s, Hanover Square, London</strong><br>La Nuova Musica valiantly grapple with Handel’s overcomplicated work about ancient Egyptian politics and a five-way love affair<br></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hkm4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/opera","url":"/music/opera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Opera","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/opera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

Unlike Stipe, however, Merchant has spent the past 20 years uncoupling herself from the world of rock’n’roll, borrowing from classic poetry, children’s songs, Shakespearean sonnets, folksong and the textures of the orchestra.</p><p>That distinctive Appalachian yelp is still present and correct, but tonight’s show has none of the thump or the jangle that her audience fell for 30 years ago.

The 10 originals on this third solo outing confirm Drever’s songwriting talents, eschewing tradition for deft, heartfelt pieces focused on love and loss. Unlike its predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/kris-drever-mark-hard-earth\" title=\"\"><em>Mark the Hard Earth</em></a>, there is no great array of instrumentation, Drever relying instead on simple acoustic backings and his own agile guitar playing. If the mood is often rueful, Drever always finds an upturn – “No one gets shipwrecked any more,” as he puts it – and there are tart social observations like the title track’s “I wish that politicians’ ties would tighten up when they tell lies.” Understated and unaffected, its simplicity proves winning.</p>","linkText":"Kris Drever: If Wishes Were Horses review – deft, heartfelt

Much of this is down to the instrumentation of alto saxophone, vibraphone, bass and drums, which has the lightness and clarity to convey quite adventurous ideas without losing the listener along the way.

Light</em> as their best since <em>XTRMNTR</em>, returning as it does to short, sharp, shiny songs. They’ve also turned inwards, Bobby Gillespie’s lyrics less concerned with “the dead heart of the control machine” than the light heart of the reformed man. Trippin’ on Your Love opens on cheesy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/05/the-10-best-albums-inspired-by-drugs-in-pictures\" title=\"\"><em>Screamadelica</em></a> rave piano and a cocky riff with powerhouse backing vocals from Haim, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/02/sky-ferreira-album-drugs-sexual-abuse-interview\" title=\"\">Sky Ferreira</a> pops up on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC77NtzW7U4\" title=\"\">Where the Light Gets In</a>, whose dance-rock rush borrows its healing message from Sufi mystic Rumi (the album’s cringey title, meanwhile, comes from a book by French psychologist Félix Guattari). From the gothic guitar and gleaming synths of the pounding 100% or Nothing to the barroom piano and 8-bit bleep of Carnival of Fools, <em>Chaosmosis</em> is bright, honed and fun, though too many past stylistic bases are covered at the expense of new ground.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC77NtzW7U4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\"

ballet score and great wartime symphony dazzle","body":"<p>Prokofiev’s earthy <em>Scythian Suite</em> has its origins in Stravinsky’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/stravinsky-rite-of-spring\" title=\"\"><em>Rite of Spring</em></a>. In 1915, the young composer was commissioned to write for the Ballet Russes in Paris, the company that had created such a sensation with Stravinsky’s revolutionary work. Alas, the resulting ballet was thought too similar to be staged. Instead, Prokofiev fashioned his score into a four-movement concert suite, captured here in all its excitable glory, Tugan Sokhiev urging his Berlin players into something of a frenzy. It’s worth hearing for the mighty closing crescendo alone. The Fifth Symphony dates from 1944 and, like Shostakovich’s Seventh, appears on the surface to embody the defiance of wartime Russia, but as this performance amply suggests, it is no mere piece of propaganda but a blazing hymn to the enduring spirit of all humanity. <strong> </strong></p>","linkText":"Prokofiev: Symphony No 5; Scythian Suite CD review – a blazing hymn to humanity","lastModified":1458463887000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin/Sokhiev<br>(Sony)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hj5h","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/stephenpritchard","url":"/profile/stephenpritchard","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Stephen Pritchard","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephenpritchard","bio":"<p>Stephen Pritchard is a board member of the <a href=\"http://newsombudsmen.org/\"> Organization of News Ombudsmen</a> and has recently completed his second term as president.

The hiatus has done them good. Their seventh album radiates vitality and a renewed sense of purpose, impressive for a dance act nearly 30 years on the move.

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432306641000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89dGC8de0CA\">Dream on</a></h2><p>Steven Tallarico wrote Dream on during stolen moments on a hotel Steinway piano, four years before Aerosmith came to be, and longer still before he assumed the stage name Steven Tyler. Initially the band had to pay their dues not just with the public, but with their record company CBS; competition was strong from contemporaries the New York Dolls, who were critically adored and deemed much cooler by almost everyone, and from within their own label – there was a young songwriter called Bruce Springsteen who seemed to release an album every time they did and took up most of CBS’s promotional resources. Aerosmith’s first album, with deep southern-influenced barroom boogie standards such as Mama Kin, gave little hint of the unit-shifting, power-balladeering behemoth the Boston quintet would become in the 1990s. One song stuck out, however, and still stands out as maybe their finest moment. The left hand and right hand on the piano – taken up by bassist Tom Hamilton and guitarist Joe Perry respectively – weave a hauntingly baroque and instantly recognisable musical tapestry, even if you’ve never heard the song before. You could say it’s their Stairway to Heaven, but it’s better than that. “Every time I look in the mirror,” sings a 24-year-old Tyler, “All these lines on my face getting clearer …” He’s oddly morose for one so young, but the crux of the song is about dreaming until your dreams come true. Tyler also chucks in the strangely prescient line: “You’ve got to lose to know how to win.” That they would do abundantly later down the line. </p>","linkText":"Aerosmith – 10 of the

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-\"Fame\" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called \"ambient\" – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1452445457000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it.

Why have I missed out on hearing this?

They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

Sun lights up the fields between two converted pig sheds, one of them hosting a band’s history, the other its present. Two men in their late 50s settle in the former: the taller, a gentle headmasterly type in a cable-knit jumper and glasses; the shorter, a bleached-blond imp in plaid jacket and scarf. Nearby is a huge archive of computers, synthesizers and tapes that tell their long story. It’s a remarkable one: from a resolutely unsuccessful 1980s, through a hugely fruitful 1990s, to a 21st century that has included online ventures, long periods working independently, and soundtracking the biggest festival of all – the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony. Across a gravel path is their recently renovated live studio, where their future – together again – is thriving.</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/14/underworld-barbara-barbara-we-face-a-shining-future-exclusive-album-stream\">Underworld: Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future – exclusive album stream</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Underworld: ‘It doesn’t matter where music comes from – it’s how it connects’","lastModified":1458310868000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Two decades ago, Karl Hyde and Rick Smith helped rewrite British dance music.

The notable thing is that she has avoided the personality-erasure that marks the social-media splutterings of many of her pop contemporaries. Scrolling through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alessiacara\">her Twitter feed</a>, you encounter self-deprecation (“Describe Alessia in a video,” requests a follower; “Mess,” she replies), sarcasm and a ringing endorsement of Kesha’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/26/kesha-dr-luke-contract-sony-protest\">fight to sever ties with producer Dr Luke</a>. Cara – born Alessia Caracciolo, in Brampton, Ontario – is signed to a major label, Def Jam, but so far hasn’t been subsumed into the machine; she still projects the believable awkwardness that made last year’s fantastic debut single, Here, a touchstone for adolescents who would rather sit in their rooms than go to a party.</p>","linkText":"Alessia Cara: ‘Social media is like a fake reality and it’s hard to block things out’","lastModified":1458233148000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"She’s struck pop gold in the US and has befriended Taylor Swift and Drake – despite describing herself as an ‘antisocial pessimist’.

Given his multiple talents – from international soloist to musical ambassador to exuberant bling-and-glamour fashionista (<a href=\"http://langlangparfums.com/default/index/\">he has his own perfume</a>, headphones and, coming soon, piano-themed Swiss watch) – maybe it’s not an improbable comparison.</p><p>“No, no, no! <em>Please</em>, I’m not saying I’m Google!” Lang Lang laughs, clapping his hands to his head in mock horror. His name means sunny, twice over. He is. Fringe flopping, casually dressed in sweatshirt, jeans and Air Jordan trainers (he’s a big fan of the basketball player), Lang Lang bounces into a windowless basement meeting room in a Madrid hotel as if it’s the only place he’d want to be. He comments, in passing, that he is getting so sick of being on aeroplanes, in halls and hotels that he may take up marathon running, just to get some oxygen into his lungs.</p>","linkText":"Lang Lang: 'It's about the joy that music can give'","lastModified":1457530628000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>He started playing at two, retired at nine, staged a comeback at 10 – and now has his own perfume, and duets with Pharrell.

Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971.

What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times.

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

Perhaps the last thing you need when you’ve arrived there, brain fuddled with jetlag, is a conversation with Damon Albarn in full manic flow. One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work?

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

Dave Grohl</h2><p>News broke this week that David Bowie refused the offer to work with Dave Grohl, making him one of the few musicians ever not to have collaborated with the Foo Fighters’ leader. To be fair, nothing has emerged featuring Grohl performing with Father Abraham and the Smurfs, either, though we’ve heard rumours there’s a bootleg on the internet of the Foos performing The Smurf Song with Father Abraham at the Amsterdam Paradiso, but without any actual smurfs on stage. Grohl approached Bowie two years ago, asking him to sing on a piece of music for a film. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/dave-grohl-david-bowie-rejection/\">Bowie’s response</a>: “David, I watched the movie and I got to be honest, it’s not my thing … I’m not made for these times. So thanks, but I think I’m gonna sit this one out.” Grohl replied, and received a response from Bowie: “Alright, well that’s settled, then. Now fuck off.” Perhaps Bowie was worried that him plus a hard rock guitarist might have resulted in Tin Machine 3.</p>","linkText":"Just say no: 10 things David Bowie turned down","lastModified":1458061029000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Dave Grohl is only the latest to have revealed his rejection by David Bowie, despite working together on two occasions previously.

","body":"<p>Numbers. All around me are a series of humiliatingly high numbers. The pathetic 87 attempted calls on my iPhone. The ostentatious sum of £1,200 on secondary ticketing service Viagogo for one solitary standing ticket. A tab on my laptop that tells me I am miserable 13,073 in a queue that once snaked across the internet in its probable millions. It is 9.33am and tickets to Radiohead’s three London Roundhouse shows have sold out. Yet for some reason the booking ticker continues to refresh itself every 10 seconds, giving me false hope, giving me cruel encouragement. “Don’t worry, you’ll move forwards automatically and will be at the front of the queue in more than 15 minutes,” a message on the venue’s website assures me. If I hold out for the nebulous time of “more than 15 minutes” then maybe I will still get a ticket. If I stay in this queue forever maybe I need not face up to the truth. The 9,900 tickets to the Oxford band’s first show in the capital for four years are gone. </p><p>When the band originally announced details of their comparatively small tour – stopping in at venues in Amsterdam, Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles and Mexico City, in addition to festivals in Lyon, Barcelona, Reykjavik, St Gallen, Lisbon, Montreal, Osaka, Tokyo and Berlin – there was a slight sense of relief that the band had chosen to play venues less cavernous and sprawling than their King of Limbs arena tour. For all of its slightly distant properties however, the O2 arena dates allowed 20,000 fans in London to see the band perform in 2012, compared to the 3,300 capacity of the intimate Roundhouse venue. Given the high demand and limited seats, I knew getting tickets would be tricky. But I still woke with a sense of twinkly-eyed optimism, mostly due to a dream I had last night (unfortunately you are about to read a dream story; but if you’ve got this far into a blog about a woman unable to get tickets to see Radiohead then I bet you’re willing to read an anecdote about a woman’s dream about successfully obtaining Radiohead tickets) which involved a series of strange, Hunger Games-styled survival tasks and resulted in a ticket that looked like virtual reality headset handed out by an old man working in a makeshift kiosk on a motorway roundabout near Slough.

Bloodshot eyes, matted hair and beard, skin puffy and sallow, eyes distant yet wild: within days, Mussorgsky (1839-81) would be dead of drink, aged 42. He received no proper training in composition. Nor did he ever earn his living from music. Born into Russian nobility, he went into the army then spent his increasingly dissolute life as a government clerk, suffering alcohol-induced epilepsy, bouts of madness and destitution. The rumour that his grave is now under a bus stop is hard to verify but completes the sad picture.</p><p>Yet he had friends and admirers, most of them fellow composers.

He was working for the forestry department when he wrote this awkward, misshapen masterpiece based on Pushkin. It was rejected by St Petersburg’s Mariinsky theatre in part for its lack of a leading female role.
