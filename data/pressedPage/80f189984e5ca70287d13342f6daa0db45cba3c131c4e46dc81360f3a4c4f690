In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

True to her role as the co-creator – with frenemy Courtney Love – of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderwhore\" title=\"\">kinderwhore fashion</a>, Bjelland is a fragile figure in a delicate minidress, her black hair teased into a precarious bird’s nest.

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

For me, the appeal of<a href=\"http://www.jaapvanzweden.com/\"> Jaap van Zweden</a> is his lack of pomp or histrionics, his no-nonsense rigour, his steady hand. Yet while his control is impressive, this isn’t the most exciting Mahler 3. He plots a clean path through the sprawling first movement and makes the climax an unambiguous joy. As a violinist (once youngest-ever leader of the Concertgebouw), he knows how to strip away clutter and let players do their thing: listen to the simple but still-fluid wind and brass solos. Kelly O’Connor sings an elegant fourth movement and the finale has a touching modesty to its quiet opening, but there’s nothing especially interesting about the bright and shiny sound of the Dallas orchestra and I longed for some grit and rogue character.</p>","linkText":"Mahler: Symphony No 3 review – Van Zweden brings unambiguous joy","lastModified":1460040416000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Dallas Symphony Orchestra/Van Zweden<br>(DSO Live)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5z7","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.

It’s a setting of the Pentecost story, taken mostly from biblical sources, fleshed out with other texts. They are sung mostly in Latin American Spanish (chosen for its “crisp rhythmic articulations, and possibilities for salsa-like syncopations”, says Wood), apart from a climactic section when the description of Christ’s followers speaking in tongues triggers an eruption of different languages from the chorus – Hebrew, Maori, Jamaican English, Latin, Hungarian, German and French. It’s an especially virtuoso moment in Wood’s exuberant choral writing, which is constantly propelled by his equally inventive writing for the percussion quartet playing on oil drums, from which they extract an amazing range of textures and colours, which are vividly realised by the <a href=\"http://earmassage.com/English/about_us.htm\">Ear Massage Percussion Quartet</a>.</p><p>Cloud-Polyphonies is an equally rigorous exploration of percussion sonorities, a sextet that takes three kinds of natural “cloud” phenomena – pre-roost gatherings of starlings; the movements of a herd of American bison; clouds themselves seen from a hot-air balloon – as the inspiration for its three movements.

He began recording under his own name in the early 00s, way out in the leftfield, becoming labelmates with a selection of fearsome noise artists including Merzbow and Masonna. But since the release of his acclaimed 2011 album, <a href=\"http://kranky.net/stream/krank154/\">Ravedeath, 1972</a>, the Vancouver-born electronic auteur has found himself inching towards the mainstream. Critics stopped merely praising his albums and started going bananas: Spin magazine called him “one of the most important artists of our generation”. He has been twice nominated for the Canadian answer to the Mercury prize and won his homeland’s equivalent of a Grammy. If you’re looking for evidence of increased commercial appeal, you might note that he’s also traded up record companies. No more jockeying for space on the release schedules with Maggot Breeder, Knurl and Bastard Noise: he now inhabits the more genteel surroundings of revered British indie 4AD.</p>","linkText":"Tim

He dreamed of composing a symphony, but the Beethoven’s shadow loomed too large, so the concerto plays out a massive wrangle: an intense, self-questioning young artist meets the corpulent orchestral sound of Brahms’s future symphonies. Some pianists go one way or the other in interpretation; <a href=\"http://www.paullewispiano.co.uk/biography.aspx\">Paul Lewis</a> masterfully spans both. His account has clarity, muscle and steely pride, but also intimacy, vulnerability and volatility: the combination is magnetic. Conductor <a href=\"http://www.danielharding.com/profile.html\">Daniel Harding</a> goes for full-out symphonic bulk from the start and his Swedish orchestra sounds hearty and brooding – fuzzier-edged than Lewis’s metallic attack, but generally the partnership works. As a bonus, Lewis plays Brahms’s four Ballades Op 10; quiet, urgent and full of singing lines.</p>","linkText":"Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1; Ballades Op 10 review – Lewis balances muscle and vulnerability","lastModified":1460037680000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Paul Lewis/Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra/Daniel Harding <br>(Harmonia Mundi)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5z4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/paul-lewis-pianist","url":"/music/paul-lewis-pianist","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Paul Lewis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paul-lewis-pianist","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.

He’s joined by a puckish clarinet player echoing his top line, then a ragtag “family” of musicians gathers; a trio of strident strings in party frocks, longhair electric guitarists, indie banjo players, a wild west villain with an accordion and a jigging violinist in a deerstalker whom Zimmer, he’ll later explain, stole from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/17/ennio-morricone-hateful-eight-oscar-nomination-interview-60-years-of-music\">Ennio Morricone</a>.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432309754000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

\n</aside><p>When the soundtrack to Empire entered the US charts at No 1 in March, no one could have been particularly surprised, with one possible exception: Madonna, who unexpectedly found herself debuting at No 2. All that effort promoting your new album – the interviews, the online courting of controversy, unceremoniously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/madonna-falls-but-it-was-the-brit-awards-that-took-a-tumble\">falling on your arse at the Brits</a> – and you’re pipped at the post by one of the oldest tricks in the book, the one that Micky Dolenz of the Monkees famously described as “the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan”. It’s almost 60 years since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvUGi0xBm84\">Ricky Nelson performed Fats Domino’s I’m Walkin’</a> on his parents’ sitcom and ended up a real-life pop star, but launching a musical career by pretending to have a musical career on a TV show still seems to work like a dream. It’s not just that the soundtrack album of Empire – a soapy musical drama about a feuding family and their urban entertainment company that’s swiftly become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">one of the biggest TV shows in the US</a> – was successful: two members of the cast now have major-label deals in their own right.

For me, the appeal of<a href=\"http://www.jaapvanzweden.com/\"> Jaap van Zweden</a> is his lack of pomp or histrionics, his no-nonsense rigour, his steady hand. Yet while his control is impressive, this isn’t the most exciting Mahler 3. He plots a clean path through the sprawling first movement and makes the climax an unambiguous joy. As a violinist (once youngest-ever leader of the Concertgebouw), he knows how to strip away clutter and let players do their thing: listen to the simple but still-fluid wind and brass solos. Kelly O’Connor sings an elegant fourth movement and the finale has a touching modesty to its quiet opening, but there’s nothing especially interesting about the bright and shiny sound of the Dallas orchestra and I longed for some grit and rogue character.</p>","linkText":"Mahler: Symphony No 3 review – Van Zweden brings unambiguous joy","lastModified":1460040416000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Dallas Symphony Orchestra/Van Zweden<br>(DSO Live)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5z7","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.

It’s a setting of the Pentecost story, taken mostly from biblical sources, fleshed out with other texts. They are sung mostly in Latin American Spanish (chosen for its “crisp rhythmic articulations, and possibilities for salsa-like syncopations”, says Wood), apart from a climactic section when the description of Christ’s followers speaking in tongues triggers an eruption of different languages from the chorus – Hebrew, Maori, Jamaican English, Latin, Hungarian, German and French. It’s an especially virtuoso moment in Wood’s exuberant choral writing, which is constantly propelled by his equally inventive writing for the percussion quartet playing on oil drums, from which they extract an amazing range of textures and colours, which are vividly realised by the <a href=\"http://earmassage.com/English/about_us.htm\">Ear Massage Percussion Quartet</a>.</p><p>Cloud-Polyphonies is an equally rigorous exploration of percussion sonorities, a sextet that takes three kinds of natural “cloud” phenomena – pre-roost gatherings of starlings; the movements of a herd of American bison; clouds themselves seen from a hot-air balloon – as the inspiration for its three movements.

He began recording under his own name in the early 00s, way out in the leftfield, becoming labelmates with a selection of fearsome noise artists including Merzbow and Masonna. But since the release of his acclaimed 2011 album, <a href=\"http://kranky.net/stream/krank154/\">Ravedeath, 1972</a>, the Vancouver-born electronic auteur has found himself inching towards the mainstream. Critics stopped merely praising his albums and started going bananas: Spin magazine called him “one of the most important artists of our generation”. He has been twice nominated for the Canadian answer to the Mercury prize and won his homeland’s equivalent of a Grammy. If you’re looking for evidence of increased commercial appeal, you might note that he’s also traded up record companies. No more jockeying for space on the release schedules with Maggot Breeder, Knurl and Bastard Noise: he now inhabits the more genteel surroundings of revered British indie 4AD.</p>","linkText":"Tim

","body":"<p>Brahms planned his First Piano Concerto as a sonata for two pianos, but the music’s stormy grandeur soon needed bigger forces. He dreamed of composing a symphony, but the Beethoven’s shadow loomed too large, so the concerto plays out a massive wrangle: an intense, self-questioning young artist meets the corpulent orchestral sound of Brahms’s future symphonies. Some pianists go one way or the other in interpretation; <a href=\"http://www.paullewispiano.co.uk/biography.aspx\">Paul Lewis</a> masterfully spans both. His account has clarity, muscle and steely pride, but also intimacy, vulnerability and volatility: the combination is magnetic. Conductor <a href=\"http://www.danielharding.com/profile.html\">Daniel Harding</a> goes for full-out symphonic bulk from the start and his Swedish orchestra sounds hearty and brooding – fuzzier-edged than Lewis’s metallic attack, but generally the partnership works.

The first disc, containing the First and Third Symphonies, appeared in 2009, the next, featuring the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/16/sibelius-pohjolas-daughter-oceanides-review\">Second</a>, came out in 2013. This pairing of the Fifth and Seventh leaves just the Fourth and Sixth, and hopefully Kullervo, to complete the cycle.</p><p>The Fifth Symphony is usually seen as one of the more optimistic and outward-looking of Sibelius’s later works, certainly compared with the angst-ridden Fourth before it. But there <em>is</em> something rather cool, not to say downright chilly, about Elder’s approach to one of the 20th century’s greatest symphonic achievements, as though the atmosphere of the genuinely austere and implacable Seventh had permeated this work, too. It’s all played with immense care, but Elder’s view of the miraculously organic opening movement, which transforms from ambiguous exposition to hyperactive scherzo, is brisk and matter of fact, almost peremptory at times, so that the weight of the great affirmative climaxes and the sense of release when the scherzo finally takes wing don’t carry the charge they do in some performances.</p>","linkText":"Sibelius: Symphonies Nos 5 & 7;

Their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IamcaGta7hY\">second album</a> fulfils the premise of its title with more ravishing arrangements by Owen Pallett, while leaning less on the Scott Walker/Morricone stylings that gave their 2008 debut a whiff of pastiche. The impression that Turner and Kane are soundtracking some kind of ironic double-bro-seven flick in their heads remains, however (not eased by Kane’s <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/2016/03/the-last-shadow-puppets-interview/\">recent sleazy behaviour</a> towards a female journalist), only partly tempered by Turner’s nuanced lyrics. Also nagging is the feeling that even the best tracks (the dreamy Miracle Aligner, despite the winces caused by “get down on your knees again” and “go and get ‘em tiger”, and the lushly creepy Dracula Teeth) are just Monkeys offcuts in orchestral pop clothing.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9YzPEu1TSw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\"

In comparison with the gentle minimalism of that set, it sounds quite ferocious at times. Then approaching 50, <a href=\"http://www.stangetz.net/\">Getz</a> had left his suave, cool-school approach far behind, and with a fresh, energetic young band was attracting a new generation of admirers. Pianist Joanne Brackeen is outstanding. Her wide-ranging solos clearly inspire Getz to produce some wonderfully urgent and exciting improvisations, notably on Wayne Shorter’s composition Infant Eyes. Getz remarked at the time that he had never felt as free and “totally supported” as he did with Brackeen, bassist Clint Houston and drummer Billy Hart.<br></p>","linkText":"Stan Getz: Moments in Time

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”.

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAF3BksqxZ0\">Mother Love Bone</a> were poised for success until their flamboyant frontman, Andy Wood, fatally overdosed on heroin days before their debut album, Apple, was due for release. In the aftermath, Chris Cornell – singer with grunge originators Soundgarden and Wood’s former flatmate – went into the studio with Mother Love Bone’s Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard to record an album as Temple of the Dog, in tribute to their late friend. One track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUb450Alpps\">Hunger Strike</a>, featured guest vocalist Eddie Vedder, who had also been working with Gossard and Ament. </p>","linkText":"Pearl

The Move’s Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne first conceived their side-project Electric Light Orchestra as a way to “pick up where the Beatles left off” by bringing classical instruments into their songwriting, but their early experiments lurched lopsidedly between the two. Though the first ELO song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-RFwFjaVAk\">10538 Overture</a>, perfected the formula from the off, their 1971 debut album let the classical dominate; pop hooks played second fiddle to lengthy baroque evocations of English civil war battles that couldn’t have been more prog if they’d pulled on a fox’s head 24 minutes in and announced supper. In 1973, after Wood departed to form Wizzard, ELO 2 upped the tune tally, but buried them within lengthy classical structures to mimic a five-movement pop concerto. Beethoven rolled over. On the Third Day refined the recipe by sifting Lennon tributes like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rLRBwWg4tc\">Bluebird Is Dead</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJhs4eoevpQ\">Oh No Not Susan</a> from their take on Grieg’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Bt7_vslAc\">In the Hall of the Mountain King</a>, but it wasn’t until 1974’s Eldorado that Lynne struck on the magic formula, thanks in no small part to his father telling him he was crap. “My dad said to me one day: ‘The trouble with your tunes is they have no tune,’” Lynne said in 2012. “I said, ‘Bastard! You rat! I’ll show you a tune!’”</p>","linkText":"Electric Light Orchestra – 10 of the best","lastModified":1459341381000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>From space-age weepie Telephone Line to the mariachi flounce of Livin’ Thing, here are 10 tracks that capture Jeff Lynne’s showstopping sonic majesty</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hn44","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/mark-beaumont","url":"/profile/mark-beaumont","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Mark Beaumont","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-beaumont","bio":"<p>Mark Beaumont is a music journalist whose work has appeared in publications including NME, The Guardian, Shortlist, Classic Rock, The Times, The Mail On Sunday, Uncut, Melody Maker, Loaded and The Modern Review.

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-\"Fame\" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called \"ambient\" – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1452445457000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it. Until one day the teenage Williams went for a meeting with her drama teacher about a play her high school was putting on.</p><p>“I saw this disc and it said, ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jimi-hendrix-biopic-london-1967-changed-sound-for-ever\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/26/jimmy-page-robert-plant-how-we-made-led-zeppelin-iii\">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a>,’” the singer says. “I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘You don’t know who they are?’ ‘No.’ And he said: ‘You need that more than I do.’ And I wore that CD out.” Doors were opened and music flooded in, especially once she got a car and had access to a radio outside the conservative, Christian family home. “The first time I heard the Beatles it was like my brain was melting, in all the right ways. Why have I missed out on hearing this? And I don’t think it was because my parents tried to hide it from me – they just weren’t listening to it.”</p>","linkText":"Joy Williams: What got me through the Civil Wars breakup?

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

Waking at 5am, he would fill his days with blindfolded yoga and transcendental meditation. This wasn’t the only unusual thing going on in Hyde’s life at the time. In the period leading up to this week-long retreat, Hyde had become increasingly fixated with the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Way\">fourth way</a>”, a form of philosophical thinking, not to mention conspiracy theories about the cure for cancer. </p><p> It was the beginning of three emotionally anarchic years, during which Hyde experienced a journey of extremes; believing that he was reborn and, at one point, convinced that he was dead. Long gone were the days of NME tours and backstage riders filled with crisps and breadsticks.

She’s the winner of two Grammys and 21 Academy of Country Music awards, unbeaten in the female vocalist category of the <a href=\"http://www.cmaworld.com/\">Country Music Association</a> awards since 2010 and named the eighth highest-paid woman in music by Forbes at the end of last year, but she can’t retreat from the implication of her trailblazing status quickly enough. Pushed, she stretches to admitting that “I hope that I helped keep the door open,” before conscientiously naming Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Patsy Cline as the women who opened that door.<br></p><p>As self-effacing as Lambert is, it’s not a view shared by many. “She reopened the door for a movement of women singer-songwriters that had closed during the pop gloss of the late 90s,” says Nashville songwriter Shane McAnally, who first worked with Lambert on her 2011 hit Mama’s Broken Heart. “She didn’t play by the rules of her contemporaries, and it gave the entire genre – not just women – a new-found freedom.” In 2013, the critic <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/06/06/188997881/country-musics-year-of-the-woman\">Ann Powers said Lambert had reshaped the genre</a>, calling her “the most important thing in mainstream country”.

Austin Brown, one of Parquet Courts’ two&nbsp;singer-guitarists is no different.

Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971.

What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times.

Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

Popular, successful, highly influential upon the genre and critically admired both within and beyond it, he also acquired the status of a spokesman for his core audience, his songs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4AgZST_TG8&amp;nohtml5=False\" title=\"\">Okie from Muskogee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrLkMR7nUUI&amp;nohtml5=False\" title=\"\">The Fightin’ Side of Me</a> appearing to rally blue-collar Americans round Old Glory and old-fashioned values. But Haggard was an altogether more complicated and interesting man than that status might suggest.</p><p>His family background was an archetypal Dust Bowl story. In 1934, James Haggard and his wife Flossie Mae (nee Harp), like the Joads in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, quit the worn-out soil of Oklahoma to find work in California. They lived in migrant workers’ camps and, when Merle was born after three years, their home in Oildale, near Bakersfield, was a converted railway boxcar. James died when Merle was nine, and five years later the restless youth left home to become an itinerant worker and petty criminal. These early years of poverty and frustration, punctuated by spells in reform school, would inspire some of his most enduring songs, such as <a

lyricism in modern hip hop. In an open letter written for Medium entitled <a href=\"https://medium.com/cuepoint/gza-speaks-the-lost-art-of-lyricism-ee84510e7268\">The Lost Art of Lyricism</a>, the rapper praised science, artists such as Nas and lamented the absence of storytelling in contemporary rap. “I’m sure there are great lyricists out there today,” he says, “but when you look at mainstream hip-hop, lyricism is gone.”</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There are some artists out there that think they’re great storytellers, but they’re not. Nowadays there are certain things I don’t hear anymore from rappers: I haven’t heard the word “MC” in so long; I haven’t heard the word “lyrical”. A lot of rappers think they’re hardcore or say they’re from the streets and there’s that thing where they always say, “I live what I rhyme about, I rhyme about what I live.” But you don’t always have to do that. Because for me it’s not about telling the story – it’s about weaving the tale.</p> \n</blockquote>","linkText":"Wu-Tang's GZA says 'lyricism is gone' from modern

church’</a> </p> \n</aside><p>Tim Hecker is an artist whose star has risen considerably in recent years. He began recording under his own name in the early 00s, way out in the leftfield, becoming labelmates with a selection of fearsome noise artists including Merzbow and Masonna. But since the release of his acclaimed 2011 album, <a href=\"http://kranky.net/stream/krank154/\">Ravedeath, 1972</a>, the Vancouver-born electronic auteur has found himself inching towards the mainstream. Critics stopped merely praising his albums and started going bananas: Spin magazine called him “one of the most important artists of our generation”. He has been twice nominated for the Canadian answer to the Mercury prize and won his homeland’s equivalent of a Grammy. If you’re looking for evidence of increased commercial appeal, you might note that he’s also traded up record companies. No more jockeying for space on the release schedules with Maggot Breeder, Knurl and Bastard Noise: he now inhabits the more genteel surroundings of revered British indie 4AD.</p>","linkText":"Tim

Philharmonic. For me, the appeal of<a href=\"http://www.jaapvanzweden.com/\"> Jaap van Zweden</a> is his lack of pomp or histrionics, his no-nonsense rigour, his steady hand. Yet while his control is impressive, this isn’t the most exciting Mahler 3. He plots a clean path through the sprawling first movement and makes the climax an unambiguous joy. As a violinist (once youngest-ever leader of the Concertgebouw), he knows how to strip away clutter and let players do their thing: listen to the simple but still-fluid wind and brass solos. Kelly O’Connor sings an elegant fourth movement and the finale has a touching modesty to its quiet opening, but there’s nothing especially interesting about the bright and shiny sound of the Dallas orchestra and I longed for some grit and rogue character.</p>","linkText":"Mahler: Symphony No 3 review – Van Zweden brings unambiguous joy","lastModified":1460040416000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Dallas Symphony Orchestra/Van Zweden<br>(DSO Live)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5z7","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.

It’s a setting of the Pentecost story, taken mostly from biblical sources, fleshed out with other texts. They are sung mostly in Latin American Spanish (chosen for its “crisp rhythmic articulations, and possibilities for salsa-like syncopations”, says Wood), apart from a climactic section when the description of Christ’s followers speaking in tongues triggers an eruption of different languages from the chorus – Hebrew, Maori, Jamaican English, Latin, Hungarian, German and French. It’s an especially virtuoso moment in Wood’s exuberant choral writing, which is constantly propelled by his equally inventive writing for the percussion quartet playing on oil drums, from which they extract an amazing range of textures and colours, which are vividly realised by the <a href=\"http://earmassage.com/English/about_us.htm\">Ear Massage Percussion Quartet</a>.</p><p>Cloud-Polyphonies is an equally rigorous exploration of percussion sonorities, a sextet that takes three kinds of natural “cloud” phenomena – pre-roost gatherings of starlings; the movements of a herd of American bison; clouds themselves seen from a hot-air balloon – as the inspiration for its three movements.

With their red piled hair, heavy eye makeup and strange costumes, they could have stepped from the set of Nic Roeg’s Bowie film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/14/man-who-fell-to-earth-review\">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>, although those matching capes could also double as Auntie Ada’s curtains. </p>","linkText":"Lucius review – meaty, beaty pop revelation","lastModified":1460042342000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Gorilla, Manchester </strong><br>With their extraterrestrial twins-style outfits, Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig lack recognisable hits but are cheered to the rafters</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6he","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/davesimpson","url":"/profile/davesimpson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Dave Simpson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davesimpson","bio":"<p>Dave Simpson is a Guardian music critic.

of the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECHyxIvjVjE\">Rhythm Method</a> started the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/indieamnesty?src=hash\">#indieamnesty</a> hashtag on Wednesday morning, he probably didn’t know quite how deep the well would go. People were soon stepping forward with their deepest darkest indie confessions, from the laconic (“<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BRyderJones/status/717709850352959489\">Was in the coral #indieamnesty</a>” - @bryderjones) to the iconic (“Got Kung-fu kicked down some stairs by Pete Doherty and Klaxons went to look for him to beat him up for me #indieamnesty” – @grimmers) to the tectonic (“<a href=\"https://twitter.com/grimmers/status/717731330935619584\">I married Jeremy Wamsley #indieamnesty</a>” – @sankles). “This is our Panama Papers,” exclaimed @sahilv, as we watched a wormhole rip wide open. For some of us this is a wormhole that never closed, but for those sane enough to throw their CD collections away with their MySpace profiles, it meant a lot of skeletons and a lot of closets. By mid-afternoon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/07/fans-and-franz-ferdinand-line-up-to-confess-all-in-an-indieamnesty\">the hashtag</a> (50k tweets and counting) was charting higher than the second Cooper Temple Clause album.

The central panel of this triptych began with Mozart’s B flat Sonata, K570, and went, via Beethoven’s Op 110 and Haydn’s Sonata in D HXVI:51, to Schubert’s A major Sonata, D959.

He began recording under his own name in the early 00s, way out in the leftfield, becoming labelmates with a selection of fearsome noise artists including Merzbow and Masonna. But since the release of his acclaimed 2011 album, <a href=\"http://kranky.net/stream/krank154/\">Ravedeath, 1972</a>, the Vancouver-born electronic auteur has found himself inching towards the mainstream. Critics stopped merely praising his albums and started going bananas: Spin magazine called him “one of the most important artists of our generation”. He has been twice nominated for the Canadian answer to the Mercury prize and won his homeland’s equivalent of a Grammy. If you’re looking for evidence of increased commercial appeal, you might note that he’s also traded up record companies. No more jockeying for space on the release schedules with Maggot Breeder, Knurl and Bastard Noise: he now inhabits the more genteel surroundings of revered British indie 4AD.</p>","linkText":"Tim

","body":"<p>Brahms planned his First Piano Concerto as a sonata for two pianos, but the music’s stormy grandeur soon needed bigger forces. He dreamed of composing a symphony, but the Beethoven’s shadow loomed too large, so the concerto plays out a massive wrangle: an intense, self-questioning young artist meets the corpulent orchestral sound of Brahms’s future symphonies. Some pianists go one way or the other in interpretation; <a href=\"http://www.paullewispiano.co.uk/biography.aspx\">Paul Lewis</a> masterfully spans both. His account has clarity, muscle and steely pride, but also intimacy, vulnerability and volatility: the combination is magnetic. Conductor <a href=\"http://www.danielharding.com/profile.html\">Daniel Harding</a> goes for full-out symphonic bulk from the start and his Swedish orchestra sounds hearty and brooding – fuzzier-edged than Lewis’s metallic attack, but generally the partnership works. As a bonus, Lewis plays Brahms’s four Ballades Op 10; quiet, urgent and full of singing lines.</p>","linkText":"Brahms: Piano Concerto No 1; Ballades Op 10 review – Lewis balances muscle and vulnerability","lastModified":1460037680000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Paul Lewis/Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra/Daniel Harding <br>(Harmonia Mundi)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5z4","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/paul-lewis-pianist","url":"/music/paul-lewis-pianist","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Paul Lewis","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paul-lewis-pianist","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-molleson","url":"/profile/kate-molleson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Molleson","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-molleson","bio":"<p>Kate Molleson is a Glasgow-based music critic.
