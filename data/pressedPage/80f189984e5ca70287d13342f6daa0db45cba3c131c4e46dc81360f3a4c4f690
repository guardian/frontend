In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

True to her role as the co-creator – with frenemy Courtney Love – of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderwhore\" title=\"\">kinderwhore fashion</a>, Bjelland is a fragile figure in a delicate minidress, her black hair teased into a precarious bird’s nest.

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Now the Nottingham rapper immortalised in the Shane Meadows film is back with his first album, Aeon","body":"<p>“I was a chubby white kid who wasn’t very cool at school,” says <a href=\"http://www.scorzilla.com/aeon-peace-to-the-puzzle/\">Scor-zay-zee</a>. “I took up rapping because I wanted to be cool.” For one fleeting moment in 2004, the underground Nottingham rapper became exactly that: the most talked-about man in music. His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

amps, assaulting their audience with sheets of pure noise – as well as taunting a certain Britpop band with their infamous “Blur: Are Shite” T-shirts.</p> \n  <p>A more stately sound has emerged from that early insanity. The Scots are now celebrated exponents of a craggy but uplifting kind of instrumental rock, increasingly laced with electronics. They’ve just released their ninth studio album, Atomic, a reworked version of their soundtrack to Mark Cousins’ BBC documentary Atomic: Living In Dread and Promise, which adds to their soundtracks for Douglas Gordon’s documentary Zidane, Darren Aronofsky film The Fountain and French TV drama Les Revenants.</p> \n  <p>With Atomic out now, Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison from the band are joining us to answer your questions in a live webchat on Wednesday 6 April, from 1pm BST onwards. Post them in the comments below, and they’ll answer as many as possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T10:25:22.094Z\">at 11.25am

href=\"http://www.cnvill.net/mfhome.htm\" title=\"\">Morton Feldman</a> is one of the exceptions to the oft-quoted rule that composers’ reputations go into sharp decline in the decades immediately after their deaths. Feldman died in 1987, but he is now regarded as a far more important and influential figure in 20th-century music than he ever was during his lifetime. The <a href=\"https://www.sjss.org.uk/news/principal-sound\" title=\"\">Principal Sound festival</a> is marking the 90th anniversary of his birth with a weekend of concerts exploring that significance. Framed by two of his epic late scores, Piano and String Quartet and For Philip Guston, the programmes place Feldman’s music alongside works he admired as well as pieces by composers who admired and learned from him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.exaudi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Exaudi</a>’s concert with their conductor James Weeks began with the earliest of Feldman’s published works, Only, a tiny solo-soprano setting from 1947 of a Rilke sonnet. Juliet Fraser perfectly shaped its seamless modal melody. It was followed by James McVinnie’s performance of&nbsp;Feldman’s only work for&nbsp;organ, Principal Sound, which hypnotically layered irregularly pulsing chords and far-flung constellations of notes over long-held dissonances.</p>","linkText":"Exaudi review – fine tributes to Morton Feldman","lastModified":1459717218000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>St John’s, Smith Square</strong><br>In a

It spins the listener on his/her head, rewiring their brains to maximum capacity, then brings them home, sweet home.”</p>","linkText":"The Orb – Moonbuilding 2703 AD:

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly.

Meanwhile, bassist Connor Ball zips along the 200ft runway on an illuminated hoverboard.

encore. Lines of old-school incandescent bulbs light up his Last Shadow Puppets, a touring five-piece in which the twin guitars of Turner and his co-Puppet Miles Kane come augmented by keyboards. A string section, arranged by noted wunderkind Owen Pallett, adds velvety gravitas. It’s the fifth night of the Puppets’ tour in support of their second album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/24/the-last-shadow-puppets-everything-youve-come-to-expect-review-more-a-smirking-in-joke-than-a-band\" title=\"\"><em>Everything You’ve Come to Expect</em></a>, an outing in which elegant arrangements adorn retro love songs – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0qXM3V9y24\" title=\"\">Sweet Dreams, TN</a>, say, performed with Turner’s best Elvis croon to the fore – and controversy simmers off stage.</p><p>The exploits of “Milex” – as the composite of Turner and Kane has come to be known – have cast something of a shadow on this Shadow Puppets record.

One of the best is Lady Bracknell’s to Cecily Cardew: “There are distinct social possibilities in your profile,” she pronounces, having discovered the wretched girl is worth a hundred and thirty thousand pounds and therefore decidedly more fascinating that she was a minute ago. Money talks, or in Lady Bracknell’s case swoons, caresses, screams, shrieks, abandons all vestige of musical pitch and bursts out into a fortissimo volley of high-pitched German as if addressing a rally, having earlier led the assembly in her own aberrant version of Schiller’s Ode to Joy.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/jan/07/contemporary-music-guide-gerald-barry\">Gerald Barry</a>’s 2011 opera, revived at the Barbican theatre in the Royal Opera House’s Linbury Studio production, Lady Bracknell is played by a man. The composer instructs the singer, a bass, to wear a dark suit and avoid hamming: “Less is more in this situation. The music and text do not need camp decoration. To feminise the role in this way can emasculate it, and make it less.” Barry issues many such instructions in his score. The 48 dinner plates that have to be smashed must be white and not less than 27cm in diameter. The telephone should be the kind found in Hitchcock films. Megaphones used by Cecily and Gwendolen must be the hand-held variety. When the big hammer strikes, it needs to sound as it does in Berg’s Three Orchestral Pieces. The gun should be a starting pistol, and fire like the revolver in Satie’s <em>Parade</em>. And so on. Comedy lives or dies by detail and timing. Barry is spot-on with both.</p>","linkText":"The Importance of Being Earnest; St Matthew Passion – review","lastModified":1459671774000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Barbican, London</strong><br>Natural comedians abound in a splendidly silly revival of Gerald Barry’s The Importance of Being Earnest.

href=\"http://www.operasettecento.com/\">Opera Settecento</a> at this year’s <a href=\"http://www.london-handel-festival.com/\">London Handel festival</a>, Elpidia, or The Generous Rivals, is one of Handel’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasticcio\">pasticcios</a>. It is a work which the composer, in his role as entrepreneur, assembled from pre-existing music – in this case mostly from arias by Leonardo Vinci and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Maria_Orlandini\">Giuseppe Maria Orlandini</a>. Though frowned on by later generations, the practice was common in the 18th century and occasionally resulted in some strikingly successful music theatre.</p><p>Elpidia is set in 6th century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna\">Ravenna</a> during the war between the Byzantine forces under Belisario and the Goths led by King Vitige. The “generous rivals” in the title refers to the friends Olindo and Ormonte. Both in love with Elpidia, Queen of Puglia, and each willing to give her up for the sake of the other, they are different from Vitige, who also desires her but is prepared to use underhand means to win her over. The concocted score combines heady beauty with some fine psychological insights. Olindo’s hauteur contrasts nicely with Ormonte’s gentleness. Vitige, in particular, is superbly characterised as a man capable of sincere affection and dangerous anger.</p>","linkText":"Elpidia review – Handel's pastiche sung with magnificence","lastModified":1459520205000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>St George’s, Hanover Square, London<br></strong>Opera Settecento gave Handel’s insightful story of love and war a fine modern airing with superb performances</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t2kh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/george-frideric-handel","url":"/music/george-frideric-handel","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"George Frideric Handel","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/george-frideric-handel","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

Philharmonic Orchestra</a> is always at its best when playing for their principal conductor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dutoit\">Charles Dutoit</a>. Their latest concert together, flanking Dvořák’s Cello Concerto with Respighi’s Fountains of Rome and Stravinsky’s Petrushka, was a wonderfully engaging affair, notable for the beauty of the orchestral sound as well as for the depth of Dutoit’s insights. Respighi and Stravinsky were both pupils of Rimsky-Korsakov, and their colouristic range and wonderfully textured sonorities owe much to the finesse and brilliance of their teacher. It’s a repertory to which Dutoit and the RPO are admirably suited.</p><figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32aa2d974528111236af10e919569c6f2b5e3b0f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/32aa2d974528111236af10e919569c6f2b5e3b0f/0_87_4896_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conductor Charles Dutoit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conductor Charles Dutoit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"RPO/Dutoit review – eloquence, dark intensity and insights into Stravinsky","lastModified":1459371606000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London<br></strong>Charles Dutoit brought out the beauty of the RPO’s engaging orchestral sound and cellist Gautier Capucon was gracefully beguiling playing Dvořák</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4tx4d","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

Kane, for which read “60s strings”. Their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IamcaGta7hY\">second album</a> fulfils the premise of its title with more ravishing arrangements by Owen Pallett, while leaning less on the Scott Walker/Morricone stylings that gave their 2008 debut a whiff of pastiche. The impression that Turner and Kane are soundtracking some kind of ironic double-bro-seven flick in their heads remains, however (not eased by Kane’s <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/2016/03/the-last-shadow-puppets-interview/\">recent sleazy behaviour</a> towards a female journalist), only partly tempered by Turner’s nuanced lyrics. Also nagging is the feeling that even the best tracks (the dreamy Miracle Aligner, despite the winces caused by “get down on your knees again” and “go and get ‘em tiger”, and the lushly creepy Dracula Teeth) are just Monkeys offcuts in orchestral pop clothing.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9YzPEu1TSw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\"

Then approaching 50, <a href=\"http://www.stangetz.net/\">Getz</a> had left his suave, cool-school approach far behind, and with a fresh, energetic young band was attracting a new generation of admirers. Pianist Joanne Brackeen is outstanding. Her wide-ranging solos clearly inspire Getz to produce some wonderfully urgent and exciting improvisations, notably on Wayne Shorter’s composition Infant Eyes. Getz remarked at the time that he had never felt as free and “totally supported” as he did with Brackeen, bassist Clint Houston and drummer Billy Hart.<br></p>","linkText":"Stan Getz: Moments in Time

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/17/pop-rock-rap-whatever-who-killed-the-music-genre\">blurring of genres</a>, Babymetal’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvD3CHA48pA\">signature sound</a> is a bewildering proposition. Their mix of speed metal’s whipsmart riffs and pummelling rhythms with dance dynamics topped with J-pop vocals, courtesy of teenage girls Su-metal, Yuimetal and Moametal, is not one for the purists (the existence of a shadowy svengali figure, Kobametal, doesn’t help on that score). And yet this high-speed collision of apparent opposites works surprisingly well. Their second album is a relentless blur of ideas and rule-breaking, with GJ! and Sis. Anger particularly strong. Wisely, they save their only two missteps for the end: power-ballad No Rain, No Rainbow is wearyingly formulaic, while the one foray into English lyrics on The One unpicks some of their exoticism with its platitudinous observations.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvD3CHA48pA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvD3CHA48pA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Karate.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Babymetal: Metal Resistance review – genre mashup breaks all the rules","lastModified":1459666826000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"(earMUSIC)","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4tvfx","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/metal","url":"/music/metal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Metal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/phil-mongredien","url":"/profile/phil-mongredien","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Phil Mongredien","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phil-mongredien","bio":"<p>Phil Mongredien works on the Guardian's opinion desk.

This mixed repertoire recital, part chamber, part orchestral, draws on Menuhin’s own eclectic interests: he gave the world premiere of Mendelssohn’s less well-known violin concerto, in D minor, when it surfaced in 1951. Vivaldi’s Concerto for Two Violins RV 522 was one Menuhin liked to play alongside pupils. As a boy he met Elgar: Hope plays the delicious salon piece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Hl0CcM-A4\">Salut d’amour</a>. There’s also Hans Werner Henze, Steve Reich, John Tavener, Enescu, Ravel and Bartók.

getting photographed in the gossip pages. He’s unlikely star material after all, a young man in a dress and vigorously applied make-up, singing about his Jewish faith, his depression, his anger and his joy, to a backing of 50s rock’n’roll, interspersed with bits of garage rock and Velvet Undergroundish R&amp;B. Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432306641000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

The Move’s Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne first conceived their side-project Electric Light Orchestra as a way to “pick up where the Beatles left off” by bringing classical instruments into their songwriting, but their early experiments lurched lopsidedly between the two. Though the first ELO song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-RFwFjaVAk\">10538 Overture</a>, perfected the formula from the off, their 1971 debut album let the classical dominate; pop hooks played second fiddle to lengthy baroque evocations of English civil war battles that couldn’t have been more prog if they’d pulled on a fox’s head 24 minutes in and announced supper. In 1973, after Wood departed to form Wizzard, ELO 2 upped the tune tally, but buried them within lengthy classical structures to mimic a five-movement pop concerto. Beethoven rolled over.

He would later explain the Flaming Lips ethos: “We wanted to sing about shit that we truly didn’t understand, but then we would come up with these lines that cut right to the heart of things.” That was their essence: to find pockets of meaning in the most peculiar places.<br></p>","linkText":"The Flaming Lips – 10 of the best","lastModified":1458812067000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>In 33 years of sonic experimentation, Wayne Coyne’s band has lost members, won Grammys and released a catalogue of soaring, magical pop songs.

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-\"Fame\" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called \"ambient\" – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1452445457000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it.

Why have I missed out on hearing this?

They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

It’s getting harder to haul my ass around everywhere, but there are less overheads.”</p><p>Customarily, he’ll fly and then hire a car if he’s hitting several cities within driving distance. “It’s hard for me to write on the road, just because it takes every ounce of energy I have to get there, rest a little bit, then go up and do the show.

She’s the winner of two Grammys and 21 Academy of Country Music awards, unbeaten in the female vocalist category of the <a href=\"http://www.cmaworld.com/\">Country Music Association</a> awards since 2010 and named the eighth highest-paid woman in music by Forbes at the end of last year, but she can’t retreat from the implication of her trailblazing status quickly enough. Pushed, she stretches to admitting that “I hope that I helped keep the door open,” before conscientiously naming Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Patsy Cline as the women who opened that door.<br></p><p>As self-effacing as Lambert is, it’s not a view shared by many. “She reopened the door for a movement of women singer-songwriters that had closed during the pop gloss of the late 90s,” says Nashville songwriter Shane McAnally, who first worked with Lambert on her 2011 hit Mama’s Broken Heart. “She didn’t play by the rules of her contemporaries, and it gave the entire genre – not just women – a new-found freedom.” In 2013, the critic <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/06/06/188997881/country-musics-year-of-the-woman\">Ann Powers said Lambert had reshaped the genre</a>, calling her “the most important thing in mainstream country”. And as for her heroine, Loretta Lynn? Last month, releasing her first album in 12 years, <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/183836_exclusive_loretta_lynn_sweetly_compares_herself_to_miranda_lambert_praises_taylor_swift_for_going_pop/\">she singled Lambert out for some high praise</a>: “I think Miranda and me, we’re the same type of singer.”</p>","linkText":"Miranda Lambert: 'I'm not just that girl with fire in my head'","lastModified":1459522843000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>She has blazed a trail through the beer and testosterone ‘bro-country’ scene with her vitriolic songs about domestic abuse.

Austin Brown, one of Parquet Courts’ two&nbsp;singer-guitarists is no different. The man was there, and Brown stuck it to him, albeit the man wasn’t a police chief or a corrupt politician. “I think I’m personally responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/houston-texans\" title=\"\">Houston Texans</a>’ general manager getting off of Twitter,” he says, referring to the NFL team he used to support. “I would constantly be tweeting at him: ‘Fuck you!

He doesn’t any more. “The more I&nbsp;watched [American] football, and learned how fucked up it was, the less I&nbsp;could responsibly even watch it.” He rails against the pro game, and against college football, a multibillion-dollar industry “where players spend their prime athletic years playing for free, hoping they don’t get injured, so they can get their one deal where they play for five seasons, and hopefully not be so concussed by the time they’re done they can live a functioning life”.</p>","linkText":"Parquet Courts: ‘Winning is the whole point’","lastModified":1459241255000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>On Human Performance, the Brooklynites have found the lyrical intensity to match their breathless live act.

Listen to me.” Though because <a href=\"http://www.sondraradvanovsky.com/\">Sondra Radvanovsky</a> is the soprano who happens to be singing the role, this spring, the textual meaning of the line has a superfluous feel.

Radvanovsky is upfront about the fact that Donizetti didn’t conceive of these operas as a formal trilogy. But putting them on in the same year is a delight for bel canto fans. And given the power of Radvanovsky’s voice, her performances offer an invaluable chance to hear these operas with fresh ears.</p>","linkText":"Sondra Radvanovsky: 'Singing bel canto means living like

Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>£30</p>\n <p>£175</p>\n <p>£1,500</p>\n <p>£3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times. But which band has he never appeared at the festival as a member of?</p>\n <p>Them Crooked Vultures</p>\n <p>Nirvana</p>\n <p>Queens of the Stone Age</p>\n <p>Foo Fighters</p>\n <p>10 After the Leeds leg of the festival moved from Temple Newsam to Bramham Park, the owner of the Bramham estate said the extra revenue would enable him to undertake renovations and improvements. Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

facility in a city that already has a few of them, you need to make an entrance. So as Limor Tomer, the Metropolitan Museum’s general manager for concerts and lectures, began to think about the programming that could introduce the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/02/the-met-breuer-review-museums-new-outpost-has-an-uncertain-start\">Met Breuer</a>, she seized on an opportunity to claim a US premiere for the overall institution: a complete performance of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s final series of compositions. On 25 and 26 March, the Met’s three campuses – the main museum on Fifth Avenue, the Met Breuer and the Cloisters – will <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-live-arts/klang\">jointly host performances</a> of every piece from Stockhausen’s Klang (or Sound). </p><p>Begun in 2004 and developed until the composer’s death in 2007, Klang<em> </em>carries the subtitle “the 24 hours of the day”. Filled with spiritual references to Stockhausen’s childhood Catholicism as well as his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/arts/music/stockhausens-work-flourishes-five-years-after-his-death.html?_r=0\">later interest</a> in the mystical Urantia Book, the hours of Klang often reflect the composer’s typical desire to melt minds and ears – an effect with which any avant-classical fan who’s taken in earlier Stockhausen works like the three-orchestra Gruppen <a

Kane, for which read “60s strings”. Their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IamcaGta7hY\">second album</a> fulfils the premise of its title with more ravishing arrangements by Owen Pallett, while leaning less on the Scott Walker/Morricone stylings that gave their 2008 debut a whiff of pastiche. The impression that Turner and Kane are soundtracking some kind of ironic double-bro-seven flick in their heads remains, however (not eased by Kane’s <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/2016/03/the-last-shadow-puppets-interview/\">recent sleazy behaviour</a> towards a female journalist), only partly tempered by Turner’s nuanced lyrics. Also nagging is the feeling that even the best tracks (the dreamy Miracle Aligner, despite the winces caused by “get down on your knees again” and “go and get ‘em tiger”, and the lushly creepy Dracula Teeth) are just Monkeys offcuts in orchestral pop clothing.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9YzPEu1TSw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\"

And true, for the past eight years or so she has worked closely with the photographer and filmmaker Seamus Murphy.

The Move’s Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne first conceived their side-project Electric Light Orchestra as a way to “pick up where the Beatles left off” by bringing classical instruments into their songwriting, but their early experiments lurched lopsidedly between the two. Though the first ELO song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-RFwFjaVAk\">10538 Overture</a>, perfected the formula from the off, their 1971 debut album let the classical dominate; pop hooks played second fiddle to lengthy baroque evocations of English civil war battles that couldn’t have been more prog if they’d pulled on a fox’s head 24 minutes in and announced supper. In 1973, after Wood departed to form Wizzard, ELO 2 upped the tune tally, but buried them within lengthy classical structures to mimic a five-movement pop concerto. Beethoven rolled over. On the Third Day refined the recipe by sifting Lennon tributes like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rLRBwWg4tc\">Bluebird Is Dead</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJhs4eoevpQ\">Oh No Not Susan</a> from their take on Grieg’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Bt7_vslAc\">In the Hall of the Mountain King</a>, but it wasn’t until 1974’s Eldorado that Lynne struck on the magic formula, thanks in no small part to his father telling him he was crap. “My dad said to me one day: ‘The trouble with your tunes is they have no tune,’” Lynne said in 2012. “I said, ‘Bastard! You rat! I’ll show you a tune!’”</p>","linkText":"Electric Light Orchestra – 10 of the best","lastModified":1459341381000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p>From space-age weepie Telephone Line to the mariachi flounce of Livin’ Thing, here are 10 tracks that capture Jeff Lynne’s showstopping sonic majesty</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hn44","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/mark-beaumont","url":"/profile/mark-beaumont","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Mark Beaumont","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-beaumont","bio":"<p>Mark Beaumont is a music journalist whose work has appeared in publications including NME, The Guardian, Shortlist, Classic Rock, The Times, The Mail On Sunday, Uncut, Melody Maker, Loaded and The Modern Review.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/17/pop-rock-rap-whatever-who-killed-the-music-genre\">blurring of genres</a>, Babymetal’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvD3CHA48pA\">signature sound</a> is a bewildering proposition. Their mix of speed metal’s whipsmart riffs and pummelling rhythms with dance dynamics topped with J-pop vocals, courtesy of teenage girls Su-metal, Yuimetal and Moametal, is not one for the purists (the existence of a shadowy svengali figure, Kobametal, doesn’t help on that score). And yet this high-speed collision of apparent opposites works surprisingly well. Their second album is a relentless blur of ideas and rule-breaking, with GJ! and Sis. Anger particularly strong. Wisely, they save their only two missteps for the end: power-ballad No Rain, No Rainbow is wearyingly formulaic, while the one foray into English lyrics on The One unpicks some of their exoticism with its platitudinous observations.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvD3CHA48pA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvD3CHA48pA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the video for Karate.\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Babymetal: Metal Resistance review – genre mashup breaks all the rules","lastModified":1459666826000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"(earMUSIC)","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4tvfx","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/metal","url":"/music/metal","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Metal","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/metal","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/phil-mongredien","url":"/profile/phil-mongredien","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Phil Mongredien","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phil-mongredien","bio":"<p>Phil Mongredien works on the Guardian's opinion desk.

class=\"block-title\">Post your questions for Mogwai</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>When they emerged in the mid-90s, Mogwai would create screaming feedback between their guitars and amps, assaulting their audience with sheets of pure noise – as well as taunting a certain Britpop band with their infamous “Blur: Are Shite” T-shirts.</p> \n  <p>A more stately sound has emerged from that early insanity. The Scots are now celebrated exponents of a craggy but uplifting kind of instrumental rock, increasingly laced with electronics. They’ve just released their ninth studio album, Atomic, a reworked version of their soundtrack to Mark Cousins’ BBC documentary Atomic: Living In Dread and Promise, which adds to their soundtracks for Douglas Gordon’s documentary Zidane, Darren Aronofsky film The Fountain and French TV drama Les Revenants.</p> \n  <p>With Atomic out now, Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison from the band are joining us to answer your questions in a live webchat on Wednesday 6 April, from 1pm BST onwards. Post them in the comments below, and they’ll answer as many as possible.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T10:25:22.094Z\">at 11.25am

href=\"http://www.cnvill.net/mfhome.htm\" title=\"\">Morton Feldman</a> is one of the exceptions to the oft-quoted rule that composers’ reputations go into sharp decline in the decades immediately after their deaths. Feldman died in 1987, but he is now regarded as a far more important and influential figure in 20th-century music than he ever was during his lifetime. The <a href=\"https://www.sjss.org.uk/news/principal-sound\" title=\"\">Principal Sound festival</a> is marking the 90th anniversary of his birth with a weekend of concerts exploring that significance. Framed by two of his epic late scores, Piano and String Quartet and For Philip Guston, the programmes place Feldman’s music alongside works he admired as well as pieces by composers who admired and learned from him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.exaudi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Exaudi</a>’s concert with their conductor James Weeks began with the earliest of Feldman’s published works, Only, a tiny solo-soprano setting from 1947 of a Rilke sonnet. Juliet Fraser perfectly shaped its seamless modal melody. It was followed by James McVinnie’s performance of&nbsp;Feldman’s only work for&nbsp;organ, Principal Sound, which hypnotically layered irregularly pulsing chords and far-flung constellations of notes over long-held dissonances.</p>","linkText":"Exaudi review – fine tributes to Morton Feldman","lastModified":1459717218000,"blocks":[],"standfirst":"<p><strong>St John’s, Smith Square</strong><br>In a
