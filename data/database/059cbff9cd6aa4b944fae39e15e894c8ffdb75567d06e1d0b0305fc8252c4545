Crowds gathered in the wind and rain to watch her attend a service of thanksgiving in the Anglican St Macartin's Cathedral, then cross the road to St Michael's Roman Catholic church, where she met members of the community.</p><p>It was the first time in her 60-year reign the Queen had set foot in a Catholic church in Northern Ireland. But then this visit, probably the most significant she has made to the province, has promised some ground-breaking moments. Chief among them is the much-anticipated meeting between McGuinness, the Sinn Féin deputy first minister, and the Queen, the ultimate symbol of British rule in Ireland.</p><p>Wednesday's planned meeting, at an arts event in Belfast and agreed at the 11th hour, has set the tone of the tour. With a focus on reconciliation, Enniskillen was the perfect prelude, given that the bombing of the town caused such widespread revulsion that it kick-started the peace process.</p><p>Among the survivors to meet her privately was Stephen Gault, who was wounded that day, and whose father, Sam, 49, was killed. \"Today brings back some terrible memories, to be sure,\" said Gault, \"but above all, it shows us that the Enniskillen victims have not been forgotten.\"</p><p>Speaking ahead of her visit, he said he believed the Queen's meeting with McGuinness would be difficult for some. \"Nobody has been brought to justice for Enniskillen so it's very hard for the families to accept Mr McGuinness shaking the Queen's hand,\" he said.</p><p>Noel McIlfatrick , whose wife and children were injured, and whose brother-in-law Edward Armstrong was killed in the attack, said: \"I certainly wouldn't shake his hand. It will be difficult for the Queen.\"</p><p>But Robin Eames, the former Anglican Primate of All Ireland, welcomed the gesture. \"When I arrived in Enniskillen today, I found it difficult to forget what happened,\" said Eames, who was in in the town on the day of the attack. \"But I believe the handshake tomorrow is another milestone in the peace process in Northern Ireland. It is a genuine step forward.\"</p><p>In entrenched republican areas, such as the Bogside in Derry, graffiti reading \"Marty U Dare\" and \"Sinn Féin sellouts\", made clear the feelings of dissidents. At a rally in Belfast at the weekend, McGuinness was denounced as a \"traitor\" and a \"Judas\". Had he forgotten, they asked, that the Queen decorated the Parachute Regiment of Bloody Sunday notoriety?</p><p>But on this tour, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will also be required to set aside past emotions. It cannot be easy meeting a man once part of an organisation which assassinated Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, by blowing up his fishing boat in 1979.</p><p>The handshake is the result of prolonged discussion and exact details of its delicate choreography were still not clear on Tuesday. First indications were that there would be no photographic record. McGuinness has recently stated Sinn Féin has no problems with photographs, and \"for it not to be recorded I think it would be cowardly\".</p><p>As final preparations were under way, he stoked up the symbolism further. It would not just be the Queen's gloved hand he was preparing to shake, but, \"when shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth, I'm extending the hand of peace to all my unionist brothers and sisters\". So, it will be Queen Elizabeth's hand he shakes, not \"the Queen's\", a proper noun and a step too far, nor Elizabeth Windsor's, as Sinn Féin has referred to her in the past. Queen Elizabeth would seem to be a compromise in a visit laden with them.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6349111","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-27T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1765366","internalContentCode":"392218180","publication":"The

We were nervous, but she made us feel at ease,\" said Stephen Gault, who was among a group of bombing survivors to meet the Queen and Prince Philip in a Protestant minister's home.

Locals invited the Queen into the town's neighbouring Protestant and Catholic cathedrals. The queen received thunderous applause as she entered St Michael's, her first visit to a Catholic church in Northern Ireland during her 60-year reign.</p><p>Earlier, she and Prince Philip had been honoured at a service of thanksgiving at the Anglican St Macartin's Cathedral, where leaders of all the main churches took turns leading 700 dignitaries in hymns and

The event has been made possible by the earlier negotiated surrender of the IRA.</p><p>Surrendering honourably is better than holding out to the last. The leaders of the 1916 rising in Dublin chose to surrender rather than subject the city's population to further bloodshed – in politics as in other areas of life it is often necessary to compromise principles.</p><p>But there is a gulf between compromise and abandonment that should not be bridged. Otherwise radical ideas and the notion of oppositional currents are devalued. What does it say about the plausibility of the adversarial position if the values espoused in opposition are jettisoned just to make it into office?</p><p>McGuinness will not be standing in front of the British head of state on equal terms, as head of another state that had gained its independence from Britain. He is there as deputy head of a state over which the British hold unalloyed sovereignty and which he ostensibly spent much of his adult life trying to destroy.</p><p>Peter Hain, the former secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has said that \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18557029\" title=\"\">many republicans will see it as a betrayal</a>\". He is right. They will feel that McGuinness and Sinn Féin have not simply compromised core principles but also abandoned them, principles in pursuit of which he and his colleagues in positions of leadership directed others to both take life and risk losing their own.</p><p>In County Derry, where McGuinness is domiciled, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18580864\" title=\"\">graffiti has appeared</a> on walls – \"U Dare Marty\" and \"Sinn Féin sellouts\". At a rally in south Armagh on Sunday, McGuinness was <a href=\"http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/mcguinness-a-judas-say-ex-ira-men-1-3986748\" title=\"\">denounced as a traitor</a> who had persistently lied to his volunteers. Despite the intemperate language in which it is sometimes expressed, the substance of republican opposition to the meeting does not render it the perspective of past-hugging dinosaurs.</p><p>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood recently declined to attend a service in the Queen's presence at Llandaff cathedral which was laid on to mark the diamond jubilee. The Plaid Cymru assembly member for South Wales West, <a href=\"http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18582056\" title=\"\">Bethan Jenkins, described Martin McGuinness as \"naive\"</a> for going ahead with the meeting. Boycotting monarchy is a perfectly legitimate position for republicans to adopt.</p><p>Irish republicans who express that dissent do so in the context of a British state which continues to behave badly: just last week it <a href=\"http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/21963\" title=\"\">denied a public inquiry into the massacre of civilians in Belfast in 1971</a> while continuing to seek prosecution of republicans it suspects of involvement in the IRA campaign. This week it is indulging in gratuitous flag-waving by having the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18546644\" title=\"\">armed forces flag hoisted</a> for six days at Belfast City Hall, riding roughshod over nationalist protests that such action is triumphalist.</p><p>The British monarchy, in opting to shake the hand of McGuinness, must be aware of the perspective <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-23/metro/32368592_1_sinn-fein-leader-ira-commander-ira-bomb\" title=\"\">outlined in the Boston Globe</a>: \"There are many law enforcement officials, Irish and British, who believe McGuinness was running the IRA or was at least on its ruling army council, when the plan to blow up Mountbatten was approved.\"  Yet it is the path the monarchy has decided to tread. Why? <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100167200/on-martin-mcguinness-meeting-her-majesty-the-queen/\" title=\"\">Norman Tebbit, who survived the Brighton bomb in 1984, explained it succinctly</a>: McGuinness and Sinn Féin have \"now accepted the sovereignty of Her Majesty over Northern Ireland\".  Strange bedfellows, perhaps, but the Daily Telegraph is not out of sync with peeved republicans when it proclaims \"<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the British establishment completes the decommissioning of Martin McGuinness</a>\".</p><p>Tomorrow's event will be dressed up in the discourse of the peace process, which invariably serves to mask the truth. Despite much discursive massaging, the matter has little if anything to do with reaching out to unionists. If Sinn Féin and McGuinness were really concerned with embracing unionist sensitivity they would stop denying that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13871535\" title=\"\">the IRA carried out the Kingsmill massacre</a> in 1976, an act on an ethical par with Derry's Bloody Sunday in 1972. The strategic thinking behind tomorrow's meeting is consistent with Sinn Féin's expansionist strategy in the south of Ireland. Its electoral ambitions, not reconciliation with unionism, are what fuels McGuinness's meeting the Queen.</p><p>However, having scorned the opportunity during the royal visit to Ireland last year, Sinn Féin's transparently crass manipulation of tomorrow's event may end up alienating more votes than it attracts.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6347257","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1765166","internalContentCode":"392201402","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>Anthony McIntyre:</strong> He is not just compromising core principles of republicanism, the former Provisional IRA chief of staff is abandoning them","allowUgc":"false","headline":"By shaking the Queen's hand, Martin McGuinness accepts her sovereignty","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Anthony McIntyre","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/26/1340722929901/An-anti-queen-poster-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"42523","commentCloseDate":"2012-06-29T15:20:01Z","standfirst":"He is not just compromising core principles of republicanism, the former Provisional IRA chief of staff is abandoning them","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:50:46Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/shaking-queen-hand-martin-mcguinness","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/shaking-queen-hand-martin-mcguinness","sectionName":"Comment is free","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","references":[]},{"id":"uk/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Ireland","description":"The latest news and comment on Northern Ireland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/northernireland","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/martin-mcguinness","webTitle":"Martin McGuinness","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/martin-mcguinness","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/queen","webTitle":"The Queen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/queen","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"uk/ira","webTitle":"IRA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/ira","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uksecurity","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/monarchy","webTitle":"Monarchy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/monarchy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/monarchy","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"world/ireland","webTitle":"Ireland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/ireland","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/anthony-mcintyre","webTitle":"Anthony McIntyre","r2ContributorId":"51576","firstName":"anthony","lastName":"mcintyre","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Dr Anthony McIntyre, a former IRA prisoner, writes on Irish history and current affairs.

Today it is a happy milestone on the rocky path of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18586783\" title=\"\">Irish reconciliation</a>. Within a year, the monarch has made the first ever visit to the Republic of Ireland and is today greeting a republican leader in Belfast. That greeting is across a political divide but also a religious one, the divide that created <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland\" title=\"\">Irish partition in 1922</a> and has underlain Ulster's troubled history ever since. For a monarch to cross a divide is not to unite it, but it is better than not crossing at all.</p><p>The history of attempts to end communal violence in Northern Ireland since the 1960s is sobering for all who claim for Britain some unique genius for domestic harmony, one that it is entitled to visit on Yugoslavs, Iraqis, Afghans, Libyans and others alike. At least until recently, each hesitant dawn has been followed by bloody dusk. From the collapse of power-sharing in 1974 to its stuttering resumption in Gordon Brown's \"second Good Friday\" in 2009, London's attempt to bring peace to Northern Ireland has demonstrated the maxim that no corner of the British empire is ruled so ineptly as one that is&nbsp;closest to hand.</p><p>Under British ministers, the evils of the old Protestant ascendancy were exacerbated by hamfisted security, school apartheid, state dependency and housing segregation, all contributing to a 30-year upsurge in communal division and bloodshed. Figures indicate that twice as many Ulster parishes are now more than 80% single faith as before direct rule. Each year, yet another incident of sectarian violence emanates – largely from young people educated wholly apart from half their fellow citizens. Far from being reconciled, most of Belfast has merely been segregated.</p><p>As a result, Northern Ireland had, at the last count, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/28/peace-walls-belfast-ceasefire\" title=\"\">80 barriers and \"peace walls\"</a> dividing its urban and suburban neighbourhoods, three times as many as at the time of the partial ceasefire in 1994. Such a collapse in community concord is unknown elsewhere in Europe. It is hypocritical for Britain to lay down the law for \"trouble spots\" round the world when it cannot remove these social obscenities from its own backyard.</p><p>For four decades, a parallel \"peace process\" assumed that power to deliver reconciliation lay somewhere between London, Dublin and possibly Washington. Conferences on \"conflict studies\" used to lump together Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel-Palestine as if they were identical cases. A regular attender was the old IRA watcher, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7791006.stm\" title=\"\">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a>, who predicted that Northern Ireland would find peace not when London or Dublin ordained it but when local militants had grownup children, and craved respectability in retirement. He was right.</p><p>Peace has come to the streets of Northern Ireland crucially because the current generation of politicians, most from extremist groupings, tired of war and decided peace was in their interest. The old Provisionals, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, turned their coats and renounced the bullet in favour of the ballot. A bitterly divided Unionist majority, led by David Trimble, Ian Paisley and the current first minister, Peter Robinson, drifted hesitantly into an oligarchy of frigid and fragile power-sharing.</p><p>This oligarchy remains afloat on huge sums of Treasury cash, enough to make Greece seem a model of fiscal self-reliance. Fewer people than live in Greater Manchester are governed through 12 ministerial departments and a 400-strong first minister's office, bigger than Downing Street. The Belfast academic, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/mar/09/highereducation.highereducationprofile\" title=\"\">Paul Bew</a>, refers to the British&nbsp;taxpayer as \"the great unsung hero of the Troubles\".</p><p>Yet it has eventually worked. To visit Northern Ireland today is to sense a novel stability in the air. In Belfast, two separate citizenries that inhabit one city and who once never met, worked, studied, conferred, let alone governed together, now do at least some of these things. The economic problems of the Republic have halted the depopulation of the north. Security, the bugbear of divided communities, has at last come under local control, lubricated by a £1bn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/21/gordon-brown-northern-ireland-police\" title=\"\">subvention from Gordon Brown in 2009</a>.</p><p>That said, the future needs realism rather than hope. Ulster's present rulers, honed in a bitter struggle, have undoubted calibre, but they are mortal. They can shake hands with each other, not to mention the Queen, because they know they carry the confidence of their constituencies. That confidence may not outlive them. Northern Ireland politics is full of dark woods and frightening places. Sharing power across an ethnic or religious divide is inherently unstable. When the present generation passes, deluge may yet return.</p><p>For the old division remains. Belfast has not achieved religious reconciliation comparable with Glasgow or Liverpool. Northern Ireland was partitioned from the new Irish state to stave off the threat of armed revolt by its Protestant community. Ever since, its politics has relied on a Unionist majority wielding the power of plebiscite. It has relied on London's acceptance that whatever Ulster wants, Ulster gets. But were an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alexsalmond\" title=\"\">Alex Salmond</a> to emerge and demand independence or reunion with the Republic, England would be unlikely to complain.</p><p>Unionism is vulnerable to demography. The first minister, Peter Robinson, admits that it may soon need to preach its virtues to a swath of Catholic voters. The religious division is already in the region of 50-50. A recent poll had 54% of schoolchildren claiming to be Catholics, while only 35% of students now call themselves Protestant.</p><p>This \"population time-bomb\" was once used to explain, if not excuse, unionist paranoia. It is now inverted. Unionists will eventually lose their automatic veto on Irish reunion. They cannot forever coerce Catholics into being British, and must resort to an unfamiliar methodology, that of persuasion. Demography may yet be the&nbsp;greatest peacemaker of all.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6347189","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-27T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1765362","internalContentCode":"392217995","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Simon Jenkins:</strong> It is good that the Queen's visit has crossed a divide.
