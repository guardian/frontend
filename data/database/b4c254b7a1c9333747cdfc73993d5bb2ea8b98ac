But the same might almost be said of Enrico Letta.</p> <p>&nbsp;A real win would have been to crush a defiant Silvio Berlusoni in parliament and go forward with a new, more cohesive majority. That is the prospect that caused Tuesday's market euphoria. But it has not happened.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Nevertheless, the media tycoon has been challenged, and effectively so.</strong></p> <p><strong>And now it looks as if there is going to be a split, with perhaps 26 of his deputies (out of 97) and 18 of his Senators (out of 91) leaving to form a new group.</strong></p> <p>Those numbers would probably have been enough to give Letta a bare majority. So Berlusconi no longer has an indisputable veto over the government, and that should make Letta’s life easier in future.</p> <p>&nbsp;But the future in Italy still looks tempestuous, and the prospects for radical economic reform distinctly uncertain. On Friday, a parliamentary panel is due to begin the process of ejecting Berlusconi from the Senate.&nbsp;He could resign rather than face that indignity. But thereafter the focus will shift from the parliament to the courts: there is a humiliating decision for the TV magnate to take as to whether he should do community service or accept house arrest; then the appeal in the ‘Bunga Bunga trial’ and another for leaking confidential judicial evidence; then possible indictment for bribery.</p> <p>&nbsp;It is small compensation for him that the shenanigans of the last few days have enabled him to disown what will doubtless be an unpopular VAT rise.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-089c31a7-c4bd-4b78-9cd3-e63f022c7cb8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380721519392/dd3b7c9d-356b-4d6b-9a21-9d64f24b377b-281x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Enrico Letta attends the confidence vote for his government at the Italian Senate, Palazzo Madama on October 2, 2013 in Rome, Italy.\" width=\"281\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Prime Minister Enrico Letta today.

If not, Italy could be plunged deeper into chaos.</p> <p>But Letta could win, and wins well, if Berlusconi's centre-right party defy their disgraced leader and through their support behind the PM. Yesterday, key members of the People of Freedom party (PdL) said they would support the coalition [an alliance between Letta's own centre-left PD and the PdL].</p> <p><strong>The big question is how many PdL members of the Senate decide to throw their support behind Letta today.</strong></p> <p>Letta is due to start giving his first speech at around <strong>9.30am Rome time, or 8.30am BST</strong>.

        "headline":"Italy's latest coalition crisis is a morbid symptom of deeper political malaise",
        "body":"<p>Crisis is a term that originated in the world of ancient Greek medicine. It referred to that turning point in an illness when the fate of the patient was to be decided. Italy's latest political crisis was triggered by Silvio Berlusconi's most recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/berlusconi-party-riven-pull-out\" title=\"\">survival tactic</a>: to order the resignations from the cabinet of his ministers, in an obvious bid to impede the judicial procedure that would lead to his arrest for tax fraud and dismissal from the Senate. Amid the petty chaos of recriminations, and the parliamentary horse-trading in view of a possible second government under current prime minister Enrico Letta, there is a widespread, despairing sentiment that this particular crisis won't decide anything.</p><p>The collapse of Berlusconi's government in 2011 under the shadow of a Greek-style sovereign debt crisis, and the constitution of Letta's improbable coalition government created this spring after post-electoral deadlock, were similar crises. Their sole function was to hold at bay the commandeering of the Italian economy by the Troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) – which is now again being raised as a possibility.</p><p>Neither Mario Monti, the technocrat who served as prime minister from 2011 to 2013, nor Letta have been able to gather any significant support for their plans to adapt Italy to the EU's fiscal restrictions. How could they? Monti introduced balanced budgets into the Italian constitution, effectively neutering its provisions for social need's precedence over market imperatives. The Letta government, bringing his centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) into a doomed alliance with its historical nemesis, Berlusconi, resolved a crisis of governability by intensifying a crisis of legitimacy.</p><p>At the time, the victor appeared to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a> and his Five Star Movement. But his refusal to form alliances, while an initial asset in an understandably anti-political climate, appears to have diminishing returns. His irrepressible rants against the establishment often blur into the general climate of political disgust, while his periodic browbeating of Five Star MPs reminds voters of Berlusconi. His stance on alliances is both his strong point and his ultimate weakness, and it would be a surprise to see a repeat of his unexpected surge of 2013, though the rudderlessness of other parties might still play into his hands.</p><p>What of the other political forces? Somewhat like the British Lib Dems tarnished by coalition with the Tories, the PD's now imploded alliance with Berlusconi can't have endeared  a constituency that will now regard it as having colluded, mainly through staggering strategic incompetence, in Berlusconi's Houdini act. Let's not forget that some of its voters were once communist supporters, and shoring up a corrupt anti-communist tycoon is bound to rankle them.</p><p>The odds are that the PD will adopt Matteo Renzi, the mayor of Florence, as leader. By most accounts, Renzi is angling for early elections. His image is that of a Blairite upstart, trying to channel public exhaustion with the political class into a modernisation – which is to say an Americanisation – of the Italian centre-left.</p><p>Ever since the ex-PD leader Walter Veltroni started praising President Kennedy as a way to jettison communism, this has been an abiding theme, manifesting itself institutionally in the desperate attempt to engineer a US-style two-party system through breathtakingly inept electoral reforms – the latest one, the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2013/feb/18/italy-tales-information-is-crap\" title=\"\">Porcellum</a>\" (after porcello, swine), was behind the impasse earlier this year.</p><p>On the right, some of Berlusconi's ministers, having done their boss's bidding, now warn about the danger of their party lurching to the extreme right. Meanwhile, attempts are afoot to manoeuvre existing MPs into another rightwing coalition, possibly to shore up a second Letta government.</p><p>So Italy's future centres around one man willing to overturn the political system to save his hide; a government agenda with little legitimacy and even less popular support; and mounting disgust which fails to find political expression.</p><p>Evidently, this crisis, whatever its short-term outcome, is but an inflection of a much deeper and more complex one, a crisis of political representation with roots in a declining economy. Antonio Gramsci described this phenomenon quite aptly in his prison notebooks: \"The old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418759503|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|4ce7d32ee539f6a6ba6b4a035249c8009c115027 -->",

        "headline":"Italy: Red Letta day",
        "body":"<p>Silvio Berlusconi has been challenged before by former political allies, like<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/30/silvio-berlusconi-italy-gianfranco-fini\" title=\"\"> Gianfranco Fini,</a> and survived. Maybe it's wish fulfilment, but this time it feels different. His party is in chaos afte<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/silvio-berlusconi-u-turn-italy-coalition-letta\" title=\"\">r the handbrake turn</a> he performed hours before he was due to face a humiliating split on a no-confidence vote. Having pulled five ministers out of government on Saturday and instructed his party to vote \"in unanimity\" against the government, 25 MPs from the centre-right Freedom People party (PdL) were reportedly ready to defy their leader by voting against and a similar number could have stayed away. His climbdown was curt and, maybe this time, conclusive. Whatever else happens, Mr Berlusconi is no longer in full control of his party.</p><p>This political crisis was entirely of his own making. It was about him. That was the whole problem in the eyes of his former supporters in the industrial north. The country is wedged firmly in the longest recession since the second world war, and they see their party leader playing games with the coalition, ready to tip up the board if he loses. A significant portion of his party could not see the justification for bringing the coalition down now, simply because the ruling centre-left party refused to delay a vote, due on Friday, to expel Mr Berlusconi from the senate. Everyone, from the financial markets to industrialists, told the ageing leader that an election now would be unpopular and change little. Italy needed a government that could carry out reforms.</p><p>For Enrico Letta,  the scenes in the upper house of parliament were something of a pyrrhic victory. Mr Letta saw the revolt down but he did not achieve a real win. That would only have happened if Mr Berlusconi had gone ahead with his original project and lost. Mr Letta was certainly bolstered by the prospect of a split in the PdL's ranks, but until that definitively happens and a new centre-right faction is formed, the current coalition will limp on from one crisis to the next. Mr Letta's primary goal is to push through political reforms – such as changes to Italy's voting system, which would deliver decisive results and strong governments. With Beppo Grillo's Five Star Movement on 25% of the vote, Mr Letta can do little to reform Italy's electoral law without the centre right. So Mr Letta needs Mr Berlusconi to quit the political scene sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, he will not have endeared himself to those in his party who thought his coalition was about shoring up a corrupt, anti-communist, media tycoon.</p><p>So although one can see the beginning of the end of an era in which Mr Berlusconi has dominated the centre-right, until a modern pro-reform party emerges to displace Forza Italia that dream is still some way from fruition. Extracting Mr Berlusconi could still be painful.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418900143|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|41cf7d4d338d52cebb3823fcc3d9ee37e56a3e7d -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p>The politics of the eurozone's third largest economy was in a state of uncertainty as the prime minister, Enrico Letta, urged MPs to search their consciences and support his government in a make-or-break confidence vote.</p><p></p><p>In a speech before the upper house of parliament, the head of Italy's five-month-old grand coalition said it was up to MPs from all sides of the spectrum to save the country from the \"potentially fatal risk\" of government collapse.</p><p></p><p>About 25 minutes into the speech, Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister whose decision to withdraw his centre-right ministers from the coalition sparked the crisis, entered the senate.</p><p></p><p>Facing what appeared to be an unprecedented rebellion within his own Freedom People (PdL) party, on Tuesday night Berlusconi had told loyalists to vote against the confidence vote.</p><p></p><p>But, on his way in to Palazzo Madama on Wednesday, he said the vote could yet go either way. \"Let's see what happens,\" he told reporters. \"We will listen to Letta's speech and then decide.\"</p><p></p><p>The Ansa news agency later reported that the PdL's official party line would be to vote against the confidence vote, paving the way for a dramatic but as yet unquantifiable split in the main centre-right party.</p><p></p><p>As the debates went ahead in the Senate, it was unclear how much support Letta could count on from PdL dissidents.</p><p></p><p>In the most important speech of his career, Letta urged senators to accept that Italy's government could not be held hostage by Berlusconi's increasingly pressing legal woes. The billionaire media magnate was convicted in August of tax fraud and faces imminent expulsion from the Senate.</p><p></p><p>In a direct rebuke to the 77-year-old, who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, Letta said the interests of one person and those of an entire nation \"neither could nor can overlap\". In a democratic state, he added, \"sentences are respected and enforced\".</p><p></p><p>Berlusconi has to choose by the middle of this month whether to serve his sentence under house arrest or in community services. Italians, he said, were sick and tired of \"blood and theatrics\" and of \"politicians who butcher each other and then change nothing\".</p><p></p><p>As Italy showed signs of emerging from its worst recession since the second world war, he said, the country needed a government that focused on its pressing socio-economic problems, which include record youth unemployment and a public debt of over €2tn.</p><p></p><p>Plunging it back into political limbo would delay efforts to help struggling businesses, embarrass Italy in Europe, and hit hardest ordinary families who have suffered the most during the economic downturn, he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Italy is running a risk that is potentially fatal, without remedy,\" he said. \"Thwarting this risk, to seize or not seize the moment, depends on the choices we will make in this chamber. It depends on a yes or a no.\"</p><p></p><p>In a final appeal that referred obliquely to Berlusconi, he asked senators for \"courage and confidence\" to avoid being hit by \"shameful regret\". He said it would be \"a confidence [vote] that is not against anyone; a confidence [vote] that is for Italy\".</p><p></p><p>If the government is able to continue, he said, it would exercise tight control over public finances and avoid the deficit running over 3%. If it was struck down and a new election had to be held, he said, Italy ran a risk of fresh ungovernability, with a deadlocked parliament likely due to an electoral law that Letta says is a reform priority.</p><p></p><p>The prime minister's speech began by quoting Luigi Einaudi, a former Italian president. \"In the lives of nations, the mistake of not knowing how to seize the fleeting moment is irreparable,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418835047|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|1343bc9fb67c6c32f8319db882943beeca76e139 -->",

Alfano then emerged as de facto leader of a breakaway rebel faction. In an increasingly bizarre political dance, Letta then refused the resignations that they had offered.</p><p>Upon entering the senate on Wednesday, Berlusconi had indicated he was keeping an open mind on which way to order the party to vote. Later senior PdL figures said the party had decided to vote \"in unanimity\" against the government.</p><p>But, as the true nature of that \"unanimity\" became clear and 25 MPs were reported to be ready to vote for the government, with a further 24 prepared to absent themselves, the three-times prime minister was confronted with the prospect of being on the losing side of a historic battle.</p><p>Berlusconi's forced U-turn was a significant victory for Letta. Italy, a country still in its longest postwar recession, will be spared an immediate crisis, which the 47-year-old, of the centre-left Democratic party, had earlier warned would be \"potentially fatal\".</p><p>But for a prime minister who had hoped the vote could just possibly open the way to a new majority with more moderates and fewer hawkish Berlusconi allies, it was arguably a hollow victory. For almost its entire five-month lifetime, the coalition has jumped from crisis to crisis, and been fraught with tensions, spats and profound ideological differences.</p><p>Christopher Duggan, professor of Italian history at the University of Reading, said: \"Berlusconi's humiliating U-turn, in the face of the impending defection of some two dozen of his party's senators, is an enormous boost to the prime minister, Enrico Letta, and to his government. It leaves Berlusconi greatly weakened, and with the judicial noose tightening around him, his political star now looks to be firmly waning. However, the increasingly fraught and unstable character of the party political landscape in Italy leaves the government facing some difficult times ahead if it is to pass much-needed reforms.\"</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Letta urged senators to search their consciences and support his government in a make-or-break confidence vote. In a speech, he said it was up to MPs from all sides of the spectrum to save the country from government collapse.</p><p>\"Italy is running a risk that is potentially fatal, without remedy,\" he said. \"Thwarting this risk, to seize or not seize the moment, depends on the choices we will make in this chamber. It depends on a yes or a no.\"</p><p>In the most important speech of his career, Letta urged senators to accept that Italy's government could not be held hostage by Berlusconi's increasingly pressing legal woes. Because of his conviction, the billionaire media magnate faces imminent expulsion from the Senate.</p><p>In a direct rebuke to Berlusconi, Letta said the interests of one person and those of an entire nation \"neither could nor can overlap\". In a democratic state, he added, \"sentences are respected and enforced\".</p><p>Berlusconi has to choose by the middle of this month whether to serve his sentence under house arrest or in community services. Italians, said Letta, were sick and tired of \"blood and theatrics\" and of \"politicians who butcher each other and then change nothing\".</p><p>As Italy showed signs of recovering economically, the country needed a government that focused on its pressing socioeconomic problems, which include record youth unemployment and a public debt of over €2tn (£1.7tn).</p><p>Plunging it back into political limbo would delay efforts to help struggling businesses, embarrass Italy in Europe, and hit hardest ordinary families who have suffered the most during the economic downturn, he said.</p><p>In a final appeal that referred obliquely to Berlusconi, he asked senators for courage and confidence to avoid being hit by \"shameful regret\". He said it would be \"a confidence [vote] that is not against anyone; a confidence [vote] that is for Italy\".</p><p>If the government was able to continue, he said, it would exercise tight control over public finances and avoid the deficit running over 3%. If it was struck down and a new election had to be held, he said, Italy ran a risk of fresh ungovernability, with a deadlocked parliament likely due to an electoral law that Letta says is a reform priority.</p><p>The prime minister's speech began by quoting Luigi Einaudi, a former Italian president. \"In the lives of nations, the mistake of not knowing how to seize the fleeting moment is irreparable,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418855910|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|de4a5ecc2ec3510ff1b1bef26f4cb5ec1924dbd5 -->",

        "headline":"Silvio Berlusconi makes humiliating climbdown in Italian parliament",
        "body":"<p>Even before he'd started to speak, the signs were of a performance that lacked his usual panache. To begin with, the microphone that Silvio Berlusconi picked up to address the senate didn't work properly. Once it did, his speech was uncharacteristically flat. There were no histrionics or garrulous jokes – just a final sentence which, in a few rather sheepish words, spoke volumes.</p><p>The man who had dominated Italian politics for two decades had been forced into a humiliating climbdown by a rebel faction of his own MPs. Outfoxed, out of luck and abandoned as never before, he looked tired and downcast. But he brought a smile and incredulous chuckle to the face of Enrico Letta, the prime minister.</p><p>\"Italy needs a government that can carry out structural and institutional reforms which the country needs to modernise,\" said Berlusconi, his hands clasped in front of him, an Italian flag pin on his lapel. \"We have decided, not without internal strife, to vote in confidence.\"</p><p>There was a burst of applause. But <em>Il Cavaliere</em>, as the Italian media like to call the billionaire former prime minister and convicted tax fraudster, had nothing to cheer about.</p><p>In a fittingly dramatic denouement to a political saga that a former minister likened to a tragicomedy and an MP said was more like a farce,  Italy's government crisis – a week of mounting dread and trembling markets that had risked scuppering the grand coalition and plunging the eurozone heavyweight into turmoil – was over, just like that.</p><p>Letta, the centre-left leader of a government which since its inception has been plagued with tensions and ideological splits, went on to win the senate confidence vote with a sweeping majority. Only 70 of 305 MPs voted against; 235 MPs voted for. Berlusconi – the man who triggered the crisis and spent days clamouring for the government's downfall – was one of them.</p><p>Later, in the lower house of parliament, a vindicated  Letta said it was time to call a halt to the threats and ultimatums which had dominated the coalition since Berlusconi's first definitive criminal conviction on 1 August.</p><p>\"Italy needs there to be no more blackmail of the 'do this or the government falls' sort,\" he said. \"Italy doesn't need any old government, but a government at the height of its abilities with a clear majority supporting it.\"</p><p>The prospect of more stability was music to the markets' ears. The FTSE MIB was the best-performing stock market index in Europe, up 0.7%, while Italian debt strengthened in value, pushing down borrowing costs and sending the yield on Italy's 10-year bonds to 4.37% from as high as 4.74% on Monday morning. They were not the only ones to be relieved. Ever since ominous drumbeats started sounding last week, concern had grown not only among Berlusconi's opponents but large parts of Italian society about what lengths he was prepared to go to in order to – in Letta's words – \"protect his personal interests\".</p><p>Facing imminent expulsion from the senate and the enforcement of his commuted one-year sentence, the recently convicted People of Freedom (PdL) party chief had insisted that his motive for suddenly withdrawing his ministers from the government was a sales tax hike imposed by the coalition that he had vehemently opposed.</p><p>Even by Berlusconi's standards, however, this was hard for Italians to swallow – even, it transpired, for most of the very ministers he had ordered to resign. One by one, four of them lined up to voice their misgivings. Their exact status was unclear; La Repubblica, translating the uncertainty into punctuation, referred to one of them as an \"ex(?) minister\". By Tuesday night, however, in the latest step in an increasingly bizarre political dance, Letta made an announcement to the effect that the five could resign all they liked; he was not accepting their resignations.</p><p>In the senate on Wednesday, the stage was set not only for a showdown between Berlusconi and - as Il Sole 24 Ore wrote – \"the whole world – Europe, the United States, the markets, the [semi-official Vatican newspaper] Osservatore Romano\". It would also be a vital test of whether the leader of what has always been a personal party built around Berlusconi the man - his success, his power and his bravado - still called the shots.</p><p>As it turned out, he did not – not, at least, in the way he once would have done.  With his family newspaper condemning the flabbergasting \"patricide\" of Angelino Alfano, the PdL secretary widely seen as Berlusconi's heir who emerged as leader of the rebels, the 77-year-old arrived at the senate around 25 minutes into Letta's make-or-break speech</p><p>\"Italy is running a risk that is potentially fatal, without remedy,\" the prime minister told MPs, warning them of the damage to the country's economy and image that a government collapse and eventual fresh elections would inflict. \"Thwarting this risk, to seize or not seize the moment, depends on the choices we will make in this chamber. It depends on a 'yes' or 'no'.\"As he sat in Palazzo Madama, his expression grim, Berlusconi, the longest-ruling prime minister Italy has known since the second world war, was greeted by a succession of supporters, many of them among the so-called PdL \"hawks\". One of them, a former MP named Daniela Santanchè, a loyalist so fierce she is known as \"the pythoness\", was reported to have offered on Sunday to give Alfano her \"head on a platter\" if it helped her boss.</p><p>But as the day wore on it became clear that a significant portion of Berlusconi's party was going to defy his wishes and vote for the government to continue. Arithmetic on a scribbled piece of paper that Alfano displayed had 32 senators voting with their leader, 24 absenting themselves, and 25 against him. With such numbers, Letta was home and dry. And Berlusconi, not long after the party line was voted and confirmed to be for the \"sfudicia\", then got up in parliament and performed a screeching U-turn.</p><p>The prime minister, perhaps, could be forgiven a small smile. Later, the editor of La Stampa, tweeted him reminding him that, on Sunday, Letta had likened Italian politics to Groundhog Day, the film in which every day turns out the same. After all that, Mario Calabresi seemed to suggest, Italy had ended up with exactly the same government, with the same problems, as before.</p><p>But, said Vincenzo Scarpetta, an analyst at Open Europe, it would be a mistake to think that Wednesday's vote changed nothing. On the one hand, the set-up that Letta has been left with is still far from ideal and \"there are still doubts about this government's ability to push forward with painful, unpopular measures,\" he said. Many suggested Letta would have preferred to have kept Berlusconi out of the majority altogether, thus giving himself a more unified government.</p><p>On the other, Scarpetta said, Berlusconi's ability to pull strings and dictate events had definitely been compromised. \"He clearly comes out weaker from this. The initial situation when they formed the government was that he would be able to pull the plug on it whenever he wanted, because the government depended on his support. But now, that's exactly what he tried to do … and it didn't work,\" he said. Analysts said that what happens to the centre-right now will be key in determining whether this is the beginning of the end for Berlusconi, or just a major setback. On Wednesday night, in the lower house,  a group of 26 PdL deputies had reportedly signed up to a new centre-right group led by Alfano. Berlusconi loyalists were expected to stay with him under the relaunched Forza Italia party name. \"Of course, he remains the leader of the party,\" said Scarpetta. \"We will just have to see what happens to the party.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418887678|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|338a01ca5446612b5f90d409da04f107303a61ae -->",

        "headline":"Silvio Berlusconi believed the world revolved around him – not any more",
        "body":"<p>One of the most telling anecdotes from Silvio Berlusconi's long career is to be found in a book published in 1994 by a journalist and a sociologist, just as the former Italian leader was entering politics.</p><p>The writers' aim was to observe him \"in his natural habitat\", and they tracked him to a training session for sales reps of the advertising subsidiary of his TV empire.</p><p>Every morning, Berlusconi told them, he stood in front of a mirror and repeated: \"I like myself. I like myself.\"</p><p>It was a way of building that unassailable self-confidence that has kept him at the top level of international politics for longer than any leader except maybe Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe. Combined with boundless optimism and titanic energy, it has enabled Berlusconi to achieve an ascendancy over the life of his country without parallel in the democratic world.</p><p>\"Berlusconi believes that the world revolves around him – the ultimate narcissistic fantasy,\" his American biographer, Alexander Stille, observed. \"But he has bent reality to fit his fantasy, so that much of life in Italy does indeed revolve around him.\"</p><p>As he stood in front of his mirror on Thursday morning, however, even Berlusconi must have realised this was suddenly no longer true: for the first time in almost 20 years, he is no longer the undisputed master of his party, and for the first time since 2001, he neither leads the government of Italy nor has any credible prospect of destroying it if it fails to do his bidding.</p><p>The previous morning, a visibly humbled Berlusconi announced to an incredulous senate that he would instruct his party to vote against a motion of no confidence in Enrico Letta's left-right coalition government that he himself had inspired.</p><p>It was a tacit admission that he had lost the backing of a sizable number of his own politicians and – more importantly – that he no longer had power of veto over government policy.</p><p>Berlusconi has climbed back out of his political coffin so many times – in 2001, 2008 and 2012 – that it is a brave commentator who pronounces him politically dead. But the odds are now stacked against him, not just politically, but judicially and even financially. Italians who have achieved undisputed dominance over their contemporaries have usually come to sudden and violent ends. Julius Caesar was stabbed to death by members of the Senate a few hundred metres from where Berlusconi this week addressed their modern-day successors. Cola di Rienzo, who seized power in Rome in the 14th century was hacked to pieces by the mob. Benito Mussolini was shot dead on the shores of Lake Como, then strung up in a Milan square for passersby to spit at his corpse.</p><p>Berlusconi, too, faces execution. But it will be legitimate, democratic and less brutal, though excruciatingly protracted.</p><p>First, in all likelihood, will be his expulsion from parliament. Berlusconi is a criminal, convicted in August of tax fraud, and under a law passed last year, he must be thrown out of the senate – a process that began on Friday when a panel voted for his removal. The full house will take a final decision later this month.</p><p>By 15 October, he will have to decide on the punishment for his crime. Berlusconi is 76 years old and Italian courts seldom imprison anyone of his age. But that still leaves a choice between community service, which he has discounted as insufferably humiliating, and the constraints of 12 months under house arrest. Neither would necessarily make it impossible for Berlusconi to continue leading his party.</p><p>But the looming problem for Berlusconi is which party he can now lead. His crisis moment came on Wednesday as he was changing the name of his party from the Freedom People (PdL) back to Forza Italia! (Come on, Italy!).</p><p>Leading the rebellion in his ranks is Angelino Alfano, the 42-year-old interior minister who had an almost filial relationship with Berlusconi until the split. As secretary of the PdL, Alfano is the legal owner of its name.</p><p>According to a source close to him, his aim is to lure into – or rather, keep in – the PdL a majority of Berlusconi's elected representatives: a kind of political reverse takeover that could leave the former prime minister as the leader of a radical rightist rump.</p><p>Berlusconi's legal situation also looks certain to deteriorate. Under law, defendants have the right to two appeals.</p><p>He is currently contesting a one-year sentence for leaking judicial evidence and seven years in the bunga-bunga trial: 12 months for paying for the services of an underage prostitute and six years for taking advantage of his position as prime minister to try to cover up their relationship. He is also under investigation for allegedly paying a senator €3m to switch sides in his 2008 effort to topple the then centre-left government.</p><p>The billionaire's iron self-belief has enabled him to achieve remarkable things: embark on the construction of an entirely new town on the outskirts of Milan aged 34; create a party out of nothing and lead it to victory within a year, and – not least – persuade world leaders to hold a G8 summit amid the ruins of an earthquake.</p><p>Such a man will not easily accept the time has come for him to leave centre stage and quietly withdraw into the wings.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419064502|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|6a021cdba3e06cc5cea482c958e5709a41e16963 -->",
