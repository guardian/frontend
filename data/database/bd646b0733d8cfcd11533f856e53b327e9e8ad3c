        "body":"<p>Ninety minutes before the first race here at Longchamp on Sunday, four hours before the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe itself, nearly 100 people were queuing for a betting booth set aside for Japan's travelling fans and the man behind the window was fighting a losing battle. For every punter who left clutching a ticket two more seemed to join the back of the line.</p><p>It was, as it turned out, a futile exercise. Orfevre and Kizuna, who had drawn an estimated 6,000 Japanese racegoers to Paris, one for every mile between Tokyo and Paris, ran well in defeat but could finish only second and fourth respectively. The punters' money stayed in France.</p><p>But a fair percentage of it would have stayed behind in any case because, while the man in the betting booth would not have had time to ponder the irony, many of the bets he was struggling to process were not being placed in the expectation of being cashed.</p><p>There was no lack of confidence behind Orfevre and Kizuna and their supporters had travelled not just in hope but with a realistic expectation that at last there would be a first victory for Japan in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The Japanese fans wanted to be there to see it and to back the winner.</p><p>But what many did not want, or need, was to pick up the money afterwards. The winning slips, if such they proved to be, would not be mere souvenirs but artefacts too, a sign that those who placed the bets were not just there for a horse race on a pleasant afternoon in the Bois de Boulogne but to witness a moment of history too.</p><p>It was the same in 2006, when the great Japanese champion Deep Impact could finish only third with the weight of a nation's expectation on his back. That afternoon there were estimates of between 10,000 and 15,000 visiting fans from Japan and, though Orfevre and Kizuna did not have quite the same pulling power, the enthusiasm and excitement were just as compelling.</p><p>Longchamp itself played its part on an afternoon when three cultures came together in Paris: west, east and the middle east, via the meeting's sponsor, Qatar. As well as the betting windows with Japanese-speaking staff, there were bilingual guides roaming the main enclosure, and many signs in Japanese too. On the front of Paris-Turf, the French equivalent of the Racing Post, Orfevre and Christophe Soumillon were exploding like a firework from the Arc de Triomphe itself.</p><p>As Orfevre went to post he was a 6-5 chance on the PMU, the tote system which monopolises French betting, yet he could be backed at 5-2 with British bookmakers. After the disappointment of last year, when a first Japanese success in the race was snatched away in the dying strides, the sense of imminent history increased as each of the 17 runners went into the stalls.</p><p>It was not to be. Orfevre let no one down but nor did he ever threaten to achieve anything more than his second-place finish, while Kizuna too came up short in one of the best Arc fields to assemble for many years.</p><p>\"He was feeling very well and I was confident,\" Soumillon said. \"We had a good run. I would have preferred to sit fifth or sixth with a stronger pace but I don't think Treve was beatable today.\"</p><p>Orfevre and Kizuna are just the latest names on a list of gallant Japanese-trained failures at Longchamp on the first weekend in October. The near-misses began in 1999, when El Condor Pasa led from the start until well inside the final furlong before the outstanding Montjeu somehow summoned the energy to launch a winning run on desperate ground.</p><p>Deep Impact finished third behind Rail Link seven years later, though he was later disqualified after he failed a drugs test, believed to be the result of a nasal spray. Four years after that, in 2010, Nakayama Festa was just a head behind Workforce, that year's Derby winner. Orfevre's sudden capitulation with the race at his mercy 12 months ago was surely as close as Japan will ever get to winning an Arc without actually doing so.</p><p>It is possible that Orfevre will return to Longchamp once again in 2014, when he will be six years old. He is trained by Yasutoshi Ikee, whose father Yasuo was responsible for Deep Impact, and he at least will need little invitation to try his luck for a third time.</p><p>Kizuna, meanwhile, showed enough in defeat in Sunday's  race to suggest that he would not need to find much improvement to stand a chance in a less competitive field.</p><p>Yet both may have had, and missed, their chance, Orfevre more painfully than Kizuna. Somewhere in Japan, however, there may even now be a two-year-old or a yearling colt who will one day fly halfway round the world with several thousand racing fans and deliver the result which they crave.</p><p>When it happens, as it surely will, the delight will be felt most deeply of all by those travelling Japanese fans who were there for the disappointments too.</p><p>It will be a pleasure, too, to leave their betting money behind in Paris, if it means that they can head home with an uncashed ticket for the winner to prove that they were there.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419193568|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|bbeab93665ba7a4e82c949850a8575c8c22d66a8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Breeding matters in Flat racing, not just in the horses but also in those who create and care for them. Treve, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe here by five lengths on Sunday, was born with immense natural talent but she had the good fortune as well to be bred, raised and trained by two generations of the Head family, surely as accomplished a racing dynasty as there has been on the turf, in France or anywhere else.</p><p>Had bitter misfortune not intervened, it would have been Frankie Dettori soaking up the applause on the way back to the winner's enclosure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/frankie-dettori-fractured-ankle\" title=\"\">Dettori, the retained rider for Treve's owner, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, fractured his ankle when he was unseated before a race at Nottingham last Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Treve won so easily for Thierry Jarnet, his replacement, that she would almost certainly have done the same for Dettori or any jockey with a licence.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/16/frankie-dettori-godolphin-drugs-test-shame\" title=\"\">Twelve months after being beaten here on Camelot, a ride which effectively terminated his 20-year association with the Godolphin operation</a>, and four months after his return from a six-month ban for using cocaine, it would have been a moment of supreme vindication for Dettori. But it would have distracted, too, from the achievement of Criquette Head-Maarek, who welcomed back her second Arc winner 34 years after the first, Three Troikas, in 1979.</p><p>Three Troikas, too, was a filly and, again like Treve, a product of the Head family's stud, the Haras du Quesnay in Normandy. Alec Head, Criquette's father, trained four Arc winners himself and now has yet another as a breeder.</p><p>Alec Head, who is now 89, was moved to tears by the occasion as a horse-drawn carriage took Treve's connections out into the middle of the track for the prize presentation. It was more than just the emotion of the moment, however, that prompted him to insist afterwards that of all the excellent fillies he has bred or trained over more than half a century Treve is the best.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/18/prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-greatest-ever\" title=\"\">This appeared beforehand to be one of the finest renewals of the Arc for at least a decade</a> and, while Treve beat her field with ease thanks to an irresistible burst of speed at the top of the home straight, that is no reason to suggest that it was not as strong as it seemed.</p><p>The \"right\" horses finished in the frame, including the Japanese-trained favourite Orfevre, who finished second last year after veering to his right with victory in sight but was simply no match for his younger opponent. Intello, the French Derby winner, was another neck away in third and Kizuna, the Japanese Derby winner, was fourth.</p><p>Not one horse from this high-class field could raise any kind of challenge to Treve, who started from a difficult high draw – 15th out of 17 – and could get no cover in the early stages, which left her pulling for her head as a result. If she was wasting energy, it made no difference. \"I thought before the race that she had six gears,\" Head-Maarek said afterwards. \"Now I know that she has seven.\"</p><p>Treve is unlikely to race again this season but she remains unbeaten after five starts and Head-Maarek is more than hopeful that Sheikh Joaan will keep her in training for another season in an attempt to become the first horse since Alleged to win back-to-back Arcs.</p><p>She is also a reason for Dettori to look forward to next season, when he is expected to make an early start to the campaign at Dubai's Carnival meeting.</p><p>\"I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori, as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille [last month],\" Head-Maarek said. \"I said to save her for today and that's what he did. I'm sorry he is not here today.</p><p>\"I told Jarnet to hide himself and he took a position on the outside but she's so good, she's incredible. To do that and stay unbeaten like that, she's the best I've ever had. When horses are that good, numbers [the draw] make no difference and the ground makes no difference.</p><p>\"He [Jarnet] said that she was travelling so easily that he just let her do what she likes to do and then quicken like she does.</p><p>\"I was scared of the horses behind herbut she is good and, when fillies are good, they are very good.</p><p>\"I'm so proud for Papa, who bred her, and for the Sheikh also, because when he bought her, he said, 'I want to win the Arc with her.' I said, \"I can't promise but I'll do my best and, with a filly like that, the trainer looks good.\"</p><p>Al Kazeem, who stayed on into sixth place from the worst draw of all, did best of the two-British trained runners in the Arc, on an afternoon when not one of the seven Group One events on the card was won by a British yard.</p><p>The most significant performance outside the Arc itself came in the Prix de la Foret, won by Moonlight Cloud under Jarnet with an extraordinary burst of speed from well off the pace when Gordon Lord Byron, a proven Group One winner, appeared to have opened up a decisive lead inside the final furlong.</p><p>Freddy Head, her trainer, said: \"I knew she was very well and, if it all went well, she would be hard to beat. For the moment we have no plans.</p><p>\"Of course I'd love her to stay in training but, at six, who knows? Nothing is definite. Thierry said she never had a hard race, so maybe she would be as good at six as she is at five.</p><p>\"If she ran again, it would be over a mile in Hong Kong. Mr [George] Strawbridge [owner] is not keen on going to Santa Anita [for the Breeders' Cup].\"</p><p>Head, Criquette's brother, was on board when Three Troikas was victorious in 1979. There may never have been an Arc day when pedigree seemed so important.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189840|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8f6250925881cc9a7d96396068e2e7e9aa999359 -->",

I said to save her for today and he did. A big kiss and thank you to Frankie, I am sorry he is not here today. She won so well, the way she won was incredible. She got no cover and had to come on the outside the whole way.\"</p><p>Jockey Christophe Soumillon was pleased with the performance of the runner-up, but thought Treve was unstoppable on the day.</p><p>He said: \"This year he was feeling very well and I was confident. [But] with the weight [allowance] the older horses give to the three-year-olds it is quite difficult for them. We had a good run. I would have preferred to sit fifth or sixth with a stronger pace but I don't think Treve was beatable today.</p><p>\"It's not my decision [if Orfevere will return next year], it's for the team to discuss. It is always difficult to think a horse can come back as a six-year-old but we will see. I think he's a great champion but Treve was the top horse today.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187433|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d84c1ac591479701f50eb4c54a0bddfb186d9891 -->",

        "body":"<h2>3.55pm Magnificent Treve an Arc angel</h2><p></p><p>Treve demolished her rivals to run out a spectacular winner of the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. Trained by Criquette Head-Maarek, the three-year-old filly was due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori until he suffered a season-ending injury on Wednesday at Nottingham.</p><p></p><p>With Dettori sidelined, Thierry Jarnet stepped in for the ride and he never had a moment of worry as his mount powered clear of Japanese star Orfevre, who finished runner-up for the second successive year, and Intello in third.</p><p></p><p>Head-Maarek said: \"I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille. I said to save her for today and he did. \"A big kiss and thank you to Frankie, I am sorry he is not here today. She won so well, the way she won was incredible.</p><p></p><p>\"She got no cover and had to come on the outside the whole way.\" Referring to the draw, she said: \"When horses are that good numbers make no difference and the ground makes no difference.\"</p><p></p><p>She went on: \"The jockey said she was travelling so easily he just let her go. I'm so proud for papa (Alec Head) who bred her and for the Sheikh. When he bought her, he said 'I want you win an Arc', I said 'I cant promise but I'll do my best'.\"</p><p></p><p>Asked if it was the highlight of her career, she replied: \"Of course. To win with a filly is extra special.\"</p><p></p><p>Christophe Soumillon felt Orfevre had turned in a fine performance, but thought Treve was unstoppable on the day.</p><p></p><p>He said: \"This year he was feeling very well and I was confident. [But] with the weight [allowance] the older horses give to the three-year-olds it is quite difficult for them. We had a good run. I would have preferred to sit fifth or sixth with a stronger pace but I don't think Treve was beatable today. It's not my decision [if Orfevere will return next year], it's for the team to discuss. It is always difficult to think a horse can come back as a six-year-old but we will see.</p><p></p><p>\"I think he's a great champion but Treve was the top horse today.\" <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2>2.55pm Dalkala proves an Opera star</h2><p></p><p>Dalkala just got up in final stride to beat Tasaday and win the Prix de l'Opera Longines at Longchamp.</p><p></p><p>Trained by Andre Fabre and running in the colours of Godolphin's French arm, Tasaday was ridden handily by Maxime Guyon before assuming the lead two furlongs out in the mile-and-a-quarter heat.</p><p></p><p>However, Christophe Soumillon was just getting into stride aboard Dalkala and she rattled home in the final furlong to peg back Tasaday and edge out the grey filly in a tight photo finish.</p><p></p><p>Dalkala prevailed by the narrowest of margins for the Aga Khan and trainer Alain de Royer-Dupre with Roger Charlton's British raider Thistle Bird running a fine race in third. <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2>2.15pm Karakontie battles to Lagadare victory</h2><p></p><p>Karakontie dug deep to see off Spanish raider Noozhoh Canarias in the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp.</p><p></p><p>Christophe Soumillon was positive from the off aboard Noozhoh Canarias, setting a good clip in front while Stephane Pasquier was content to sit in behind and get some cover as one or two of the field raced keenly.</p><p></p><p>Noozhoh Canarias was one of those to take an early hold but Soumillon anchored him in front and he still looked full of running at the head of the straight. The Jonathan Pease-trained Karakontie was primed to challenge in behind though and when Charm Spirit made his move down the outside, Pasquier also kicked with his mount assuming the lead. He appeared to get a touch close to Noozhoh Canarias just short of the line with Soumillon snatching up but the better horse emerged victorious.</p><p></p><p>The Richard Hannon-trained Barley Mow was barely sighted in the seven-furlong heat and finished out of the frame.</p><p></p><p>Pease said: \"We have always thought he was a nice horse and he has proved it today, although he did have to grind it out. He's a big horse and he still has a lot of scope.\"</p><p></p><p>Alan Cooper, racing manager for the Niarchos family, expects Karakontie to be tried in Classic company next year, possibly in the French 2000 Guineas. He said: \"He has won here twice, so you would imagine you would look at the Poulains, but it's too early to say and Stephane said he is better at a mile than seven furlongs. I would think he'll have a trial next season, and then go for a Classic somewhere.</p><p></p><p>\"He is qualified for the Breeders' Cup but Jonathan felt he's had a hard race today. He's a horse who can develop over the winter and the thought is to keep him for next year now. Stephane has had a difficult year but he has come right and won us two Group Ones.\"</p><p></p><p>Pasquier was suitable impressed, saying: \"He's a horse who I have always believed in and today was perfect with a good draw. My job was only to find my way out and he did it very easily.\" <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2>1.45pm Indonesienne pulls off shock win in Boussac</h2><p></p><p>Indonesienne swooped late to spring a surprise in the Total Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp.</p><p></p><p>Lesstalk In Paris set out to make all in the hands of Ioritz Mendizabal and was still in front and travelling well at the top of the straight. Richard Hughes was poised to challenge in behind on British raider Sandiva but when Lesstalk In Paris kicked for home, she found little in response. Hughes switched out to challenge again in the middle of the track but Flavien Prat was flying down his outside on the Christophe Ferland-trained Indonesienne, who swallowed up Lesstalk In Paris only yards from the post and went on to claim a clear victory. Charlie Hills' Queen Catrine took third after she too delivered a late flourish while Sandiva could only plug on for seventh.</p><p></p><p>Ferland was gaining consolation after Chalnetta was disqualfied from first place in Saturday's Prix Royallieu. He said: \"It was disappointing yesterday with Chalnetta, but we are over that now and this is fantastic. \"We took a chance and it has worked. I knew she had great acceleration from her first race and she was able to show it.\"</p><p></p><p>Hills was delighted to see his filly make the frame on ground that he thought did not really suit. He said: \"The main thing is that she's shown us she stays a mile which opens up options for next year. \"We will give her a nice break but today's race was run on tacky ground and it turned into a bit of a slog.\"</p><p></p><p>Hughes felt Sandiva was thoroughly unsuited by the ground. He said of Richard Fahey's runner : \"The ground was very sticky and it didn't suit my filly at all. That was not her true running.\" <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2>1.15pm Maarek triumphs in Prix de l'Abbaye</h2><p></p><p>Maarek finished with a flourish to snatch the glory in the Qatar Prix de l'Abbaye, the opening event on Arc day at Longchamp.</p><p></p><p>Trained by Barry Lalor in Ireland, jockey Declan McDonogh produced his mount between horses inside the final furlong to see off Catcall. Hamza and Jwala were in a photo-finish for third, with the former just prevailing.</p><p></p><p>Hamza was quick to break and raced up the rail, but Catcall looked a likely winner as he was primed on the heels of the leaders before kicking for home. Catcall took the lead inside the distance but McDonogh weaved his way through to edge in front. Maarek responded positively and pulled clear at the line to land a first Group One success.</p><p></p><p>McDonogh said: \"They went very fast, but he got a nice lead off the horse who was second. He's very game and he loves soft ground. They've done a great job with him, and he goes to Ascot (Qipco British Champions Sprint Stakes) now with a great chance.\"  <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2>Today's best bets, by Greg Wood</h2><p></p><p>Treve, still unbeaten and representing the accumulated wisdom of four generations of the Head family, showed an exceptional turn of foot to run down Wild Coco in the Prix Vermeille last time out. He looks the best bet in today's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. Ruler Of The World, the Japanese Derby winner Kizuna, André Fabre's Intello and Flintshire, and the St Leger winner Leading Light are strong contenders from the Classic generation too.</p><p></p><p>With such a broad range of talent lined up against him, Orfevre is simply too short at around 2-1 with the British bookmakers, since he clearly has his quirks and will need to be delivered with split-second precision.</p><p></p><p>He is likely to be shorter still on the PMU meanwhile, though one possible angle for those who do fancy the favourite could be to back him for a place on the PMU, since the travelling Japanese punters seem to be very much win-only backers. Last year, Orfevre paid nearly 2-1 for finishing second, while Deep Impact, the subject of relentless Japanese support back in 2006, paid only fractionally less for a place than he would have done for a win.</p><p></p><p>Al Kazeem, who is 16-1 with the bookies and could go off at an even bigger price on the PMU, has the worst possible draw in 18, but he is the third-best horse in the field according to Timeform and still has the scope to find a little improvement for the step up to 12 furlongs on soft ground. At his current odds, he is certainly worth a small each-way interest, but for win-only purposes, it is sensible to stick with the three-year-olds, who have won 15 of the last 20 Arcs.</p><p></p><p>Flintshire is interesting at a double-figure price on the form of his win in the Grand Prix de Paris, and his fourth place in the Prix Niel last time is no reason to write him off since Fabre will have been thinking only of the Arc.</p><p></p><p>Yet the claims of Treve are simply too obvious to ignore. She heads the ratings after just four starts, showed startling acceleration to win the Vermeille and has been prepared solely with Sunday's race in mind by Criquette Head-Maarek, one of the finest trainers in the business. She gets a useful weight concession from the colts and older horses too, and though her high draw is not ideal, <strong>Treve (3.15)</strong> has the raw ability to overcome it and become the third filly in a row to win the Arc after Danedream and Solemia. Al Kazeem and Flintshire could be the ones to chase her home.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419176532|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d4d664ff40d4720be276efd3e9dc8c18604b4145 -->",

        "headline":"Arc hope Treve to deny Japanese challenge at Longchamp",
        "body":"<p>The shape of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe changed significantly on Saturday morning when it emerged that Novellist, the second-favourite with most bookmakers, was suffering from a fever and had not travelled to Paris. It is a mark of the depth in this year's field here at Longchamp, however, that even in his absence, this promises to be one of the strongest and most competitive renewals in recent memory.</p><p>The first nine names in the betting for Sunday's race would all be perfectly plausible winners, and the fact that horses of the calibre of Ruler Of The World, this year's Derby winner, and Al Kazeem, who has taken three Group Ones already this season, are trading at up to 9-1 and 16-1 respectively demonstrates the quality of the field.</p><p>There is little doubt that Orfevre will start favourite, however, because there will be several thousand Japanese racing fans in attendance to swell the Longchamp PMU pool. Orfevre looked like the best horse in the race last year, and would probably have won with the benefit of a lower draw, as Christophe Soumillon was forced to come wide on the yawning expanse of Longchamp's home straight, and Orfevre sought the sanctuary of the far rail when he needed only to keep straight to win.</p><p>While he looked like the most talented horse in an average field last year, this is a much better race and the three-year-olds in particular appear significantly stronger than those Orfevre faced then.</p><p>Treve, still unbeaten and representing the accumulated wisdom of four generations of the Head family, showed an exceptional turn of foot to run down Wild Coco in the Prix Vermeille last time out. Ruler Of The World, the Japanese Derby winner Kizuna, André Fabre's Intello and Flintshire, and the St Leger winner Leading Light are strong contenders from the Classic generation too.</p><p>With such a broad range of talent lined up against him, Orfevre is simply too short at around 2-1 with the British bookmakers, since he clearly has his quirks and will need to be delivered with split-second precision.</p><p>He is likely to be shorter still on the PMU meanwhile, though one possible angle for those who do fancy the favourite could be to back him for a place on the PMU, since the travelling Japanese punters seem to be very much win-only backers. Last year, Orfevre paid nearly 2-1 for finishing second, while Deep Impact, the subject of relentless Japanese support back in 2006, paid only fractionally less for a place than he would have done for a win.</p><p>Al Kazeem, who is 16-1 with the bookies and could go off at an even bigger price on the PMU, has the worst possible draw in 18, but he is the third-best horse in the field according to Timeform and still has the scope to find a little improvement for the step up to 12 furlongs on soft ground. At his current odds, he is certainly worth a small each-way interest, but for win-only purposes, it is sensible to stick with the three-year-olds, who have won 15 of the last 20 Arcs.</p><p>Flintshire is interesting at a double-figure price on the form of his win in the Grand Prix de Paris, and his fourth place in the Prix Niel last time is no reason to write him off since Fabre will have been thinking only of the Arc.</p><p>Yet the claims of Treve are simply too obvious to ignore. She heads the ratings after just four starts, showed startling acceleration to win the Vermeille and has been prepared solely with Sunday's race in mind by Criquette Head-Maarek, one of the finest trainers in the business. She gets a useful weight concession from the colts and older horses too, and though her high draw is not ideal, <strong>Treve (3.15) </strong>has the raw ability to overcome it and become the third filly in a row to win the Arc after Danedream and Solemia. Al Kazeem and Flintshire could be the ones to chase her home.</p><p>Cirrus Des Aigles, who was second only to Frankel in the global ratings last year, is barred from the Arc because he is a gelding, but he has a valuable alternative target in the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot in a fortnight after an impressive success by a length and threequarters in the Group Two Prix Dollar at Longchamp on Saturday.</p><p>Corine Barande-Barbe's seven-year-old has struggled to find his best form in 2013, but having travelled well through the first mile as Planteur set a strong pace, he powered clear of the field in the straight under minimal encouragement from Christophe Soumillon.</p><p>Victor Chandler cut Cirrus Des Aigles to 7-2 (from 8-1) for the Champion Stakes. \"He was nearly at his best today, and he will be at his best on the 19th,\" Barande-Barbe remarked. \"I never doubted him.\"</p><h2>Greg Wood's Longchamp tips</h2><p><strong>12.45</strong> Dutch Masterpiece <strong>1.20</strong> Lesstalk In Paris<strong> 1.55</strong> Karakontie</p><p><strong>2.30</strong> Silasol <strong>3.15</strong> Treve <strong>4.40</strong> Gordon Lord Byron</p><p><strong>5.10</strong> Tac De Boistron</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419138476|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|1aea2c220533ab0ac99bd889336513ed289a3ba8 -->",

        "trailText":"<strong>Chris Cook:</strong> Wentworth would be a popular winner at Ascot on a day of low-key racing before the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe",
        "headline":"Talking Horses: Saturday's tips in our daily racing blog",
        "body":"<h2>Today's TV tips</h2><p></p><p>It seems a pity to stage such a low-key set of races in Britain on the eve of the Arc de Triomphe, a weekend when punters are keyed up and ready to bet on good-quality action. Traditionally the Cambridgeshire gripped our attention on this Saturday but the recent reshuffling of the fixture list has left us with a handful of Group Threes and some valuable pots for two-year-olds.</p><p>The big handicap near the end of <strong>Ascot</strong>'s card serves as some kind of focus for betting activity and <strong>Wentworth (3.50)</strong> could be a popular winner. A disappointing favourite at the Royal meeting here, he finally justified his reputation at Glorious Goodwood, despite a tricky draw.</p><p>He was fancied for a Listed race last time but the heavy going proved all against him, as might have been expected from a cursory glance at his form. The going here should be much less testing after a drying 24 hours and he still looks sufficiently well treated to win another good handicap.</p><p></p><h2>Saturday's best bets</h2><p></p><p><strong>1.50 Newmarket</strong> This features a rematch between Wedding Ring and Oxsana, split by only a neck in a similar contest over six furlongs last month. That was a fifth run for Wedding Ring, whose form has rather plateaued since she was fifth in the Albany on her second outing, but Oxsana was having only her third run and it is she who is likelier to appreciate today's seventh furlong.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.05 Ascot</strong> Extortionist may cap a fine debut season for his trainer, Olly Stevens, by landing the Cornwallis. A Listed winner at the Royal meeting here over this trip, he blew out in a longer race in France next time but bounced back when third in Doncaster's Flying Childers last month. Chasing home Green Door and Wind Fire looks strong form in this context.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.20 Newmarket</strong> From the Roger Varian yard that missed August but bounced right back last month, Toofi achieved a lot in beating Jallota here a fortnight ago. He has plenty of scope for progress and appeals as the best prospect here.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.40 Ascot</strong> Godolphin may, at long last, have found the right opportunity for Secret Number, who has spent the six months since the UAE Derby offering promises to one and all but delivering nothing. He looks terribly one-paced but the cut underfoot here and the drop in class may finally get him back to the winner's enclosure. Royal Empire gives Godolphin the chance of a one-two.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.55 Newmarket </strong>The winner of two races in the spring, including one over this course and distance, Directorship got rather lost in the Hunt Cup and again in another valuable race at Sandown. Most recently he was held up off a steady pace in the Shergar Cup and could never get into the argument. He remains fairly handicapped for a much more attractive target like this one.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.15 Ascot</strong> Out of a Lockinge winner, Ladyship seems to be coming to herself in the second half of her four-year-old season. She did not quite stay seven furlongs when beaten three lengths at this level at Glorious Goodwood but stormed home in a Newmarket handicap when dropped to this trip last time. She may again benefit from a strong pace set by others.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.30 Redcar</strong> The temptation is to write off Morning Post's 100-1 success in the sales race at Doncaster as an outrageous fluke. But connections have always fancied him as a good horse, wanted to run him in the Gimcrack and believe that blinkers finally unlocked the ability that has always been there. There is no guarantee that they will work a second time but he was so impressive that day as to be attractive here, with most punters happy to field against him.</p><p></p><p><em>Click </em><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings/0,14906,04-10-2013%5E1,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em> for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results.</em></p><p></p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419111268|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2bc0b1328e1ec26471c432d71047b58b4b9435ad -->",

        "body":"<p>Wet weather and wide draws have made things difficult for a handful of the fancied runners in Sunday's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe but not for <strong>Intello (3.15)</strong>, who can provide his masterful trainer, André Fabre, with an eighth success in the Longchamp race. The colt is 12-1, having been less than half that in high summer, but it is fashion rather than failure which has left him friendless.</p><p>Intello has been beaten only twice in eight runs, both times at a mile, short of his best. In the French 2,000 Guineas he was given an impossible draw in 17 but still stormed home and was pipped by only half a length; in August he was a close third to Moonlight Cloud in a hot Marois, with Declaration Of War and Dawn Approach behind him.</p><p>No one who fancied Intello for the Arc should ever have been put off by those performances, in which he showed more pace than can reasonably be expected from a middle-distance horse. The question is whether he will be truly top-class at a mile and a half on a soft surface, having a fair amount of speed in his pedigree.</p><p>But the portents are excellent, as he pulled nicely clear of the French Derby field and cruised around on soft ground to win his warm-up race a fortnight ago, at a distance two furlongs shy of the Arc's. He may have idled in front but he did not appear tired.</p><p>Could he have a better profile? Fabre-trained three-year-olds have won six Arcs and this one is by Galileo out of a Danehill mare, a match-up which seems to make the entire bloodstock industry drool. Aboard is Olivier Peslier, seeking an unprecedented fifth Arc success.</p><p>Orfevre is much better drawn than when going so close last year but odds of 5-2 make no appeal, considering how few recent Arcs have been won by horses previously beaten in the race. His fellow Japanese raider, Kizuna, is interesting but the form of his narrow win over Ruler Of The World may not be quite good enough.</p><p>The winner of three Group Ones on the bounce, Novellist was impressive in landing Ascot's King George by five lengths. But he struggled to score at 1-6 last time and the balance of his form is not all one could wish for in an Arc second-favourite.</p><p>Treve has been drawn unhelpfully wide for her first race against males but not quite so wide as Al Kazeem, on the outside of the entire field in 18. That is a great pity for his trainer, Roger Charlton, who rarely gets the necessary material to compete in the great middle-distance races and who wanted to use the past three months to build up to this race.</p><p>Al Kazeem's owner preferred to keep the horse busy, with the result that this seems rather an afterthought. It is not only stall 18 but also five high-quality Group One races in a row that Al Kazeem has to overcome and he will be a mighty beast if he can do it. At 20-1 Leading Light is a more attractive each-way option.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419077814|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9e79c5ee678080165056338550a2b067443087c7 -->",

        "headline":"Criquette Head-Maarek wants second Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Treve",
        "body":"<p>There are many famous and familiar names scattered around the post-war history of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe but only one seems to run through it like a watermark. For three generations since 1947, when Willie Head saddled Le Paillon to win only a few months after finishing second in the Champion Hurdle, the Heads from Chantilly and the Haras du Quesnay near Deauville have trained, owned, bred and ridden Arc winners, and now their time may have arrived again.</p><p>It is 32 years since Alec Head, William's son, sent out the filly Gold River to win European racing's most prestigious and glamorous event, two years after Criquette Head-Maarek, Alec's daughter, became the first, and so far only, woman to train the winner with Three Troikas, who was owned by her mother, Ghislaine, and ridden by her brother, Freddy. She was the last of Freddy's four successes on the first Sunday in October, after Bon Mot, San San and Ivanjica. Freddy's father trained Ivanjica. His grandfather saddled Bon Mot.</p><p>It is Criquette Head-Maarek who will attempt to continue the family tradition this weekend when she sends Treve, the unbeaten winner of the Prix Vermeille, to the Bois de Boulogne, 66 years after Willie Head did the same with Le Paillon.</p><p>Arc day is a special afternoon for all the many thousands of spectators from Europe and beyond who crowd into Longchamp racecourse every year but for a member of the Head family it is something more.</p><p>\"I'll never forget that race [when Three Troikas won in 1979],\" Head-Maarek said this week. \"I can still see it perfectly clearly. This time it is nearly the same because Papa [planned] the breeding and we bred her and raised her, except that there is no Freddy on top. We still have her mother [at Haras du Quesnay], a sister in training who is beautiful and will run in a few weeks, a yearling filly coming in and [Treve's] mother is in foal to Motivator [Treve's sire] again.</p><p>\"When I won the Arc with Three Troikas my father was still training and he had good horses and I could work with them. Treve has only been working with three-year-old fillies but 34 years ago it was some colts of my dad's and I went to the Arc very, very confident when Three Troikas ran.\"</p><p>In addition to being the first woman to train an Arc winner, Head-Maarek was also – officially at least – the first to send out an English Classic winner, when Ma Biche took the 1,000 Guineas in 1983. This year's renewal is one of the strongest of the last three decades but, as in 1979, Head-Maarek will arrive at Longchamp in a positive frame of mind.</p><p>\"I'm going to the Arc with confidence this year too,\" she says. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/frankie-dettori-fractured-ankle\" title=\"\">Poor Frankie Dettori broke his ankle</a> and won't be able to ride, and it's a tough thing for a jockey to have a silly accident like that, but I've got Thierry Jarnet, who rode her [to win the French Oaks] before.</p><p>\"She is very well and physically she has put on weight and improved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/frankie-dettori-treve-longchamp-arc-trials\" title=\"\">since her prep race in the Vermeille.</a> She's been very lightly raced. This will be just her fifth race, so she hasn't been over-trained and everything that she's done she's done it so easily that the race doesn't take <sup></sup>anything out of her.</p><p>\"Now you have to see her against the three-year-old colts and the older horses.It's not the same. It will be more difficult but she's very well.\"</p><p>Treve drew stall 15 on Friday morning, towards the outside of the 18-strong field lined up on Sunday, and it is 10 years since the outstanding Dalakhani became the last horse to win the Arc from a double-figure stall. Jarnet will certainly need a little luck if they are to find their way to victory but Treve has already proved in the Vermeille that her jockey will have instant acceleration to draw up on when necessary.</p><p>\"Frankie was locked on the inside in the Vermeille but he didn't try to get out, he just waited until the gap came,\" Head-Maarek says.</p><p>\"He knew the filly had a tremendous turn of foot and that's where she's strong. She's got an incredible burst of speed, I've never trained a horse with the kind of acceleration which she can produce. I've had good fillies but like that, never.</p><p>\"Even Three Troikas, she was very good but she had a long acceleration. This one can go from zero to 100 like that, in two strides. She's got an incredible burst of speed.</p><p>\"She did it once [to get running room], and then she went on to catch [the leader] Wild Coco. Twice she accelerated and there's not many horses who are able to do those things.\"</p><p>The strongly supported Orfevre, who looked sure to become the first Japanese-trained Arc winner 12 months ago until he veered towards the rail in the closing stages, is likely to start favourite on Sunday, while Kizuna, the Japanese Derby winner, is also prominent in the betting. Runners from Germany, Britain and Ireland also hold realistic hopes of victory.</p><p>Their most dangerous opponent, though, is likely to be a filly from nearby Chantilly whose pedigree and preparation are the result of many decades of both human and equine excellence.</p><p>\"They say this year is a better Arc than the previous year but I'm not that  sure,\" Head-Maarek says. \"For me the Arc is always good. It's the best horses of every country which come and race. It's fun to be there. Where we'll finish I don't know but we will do our best and she will do her best. She will put on a good show.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419079286|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0838d07356ab6e0f2dec6162879d504fd7afa571 -->",

        "body":"<p>Breeding matters in Flat racing, not just in the horses but also in those who create and care for them. Treve, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe here by five lengths on Sunday, was born with immense natural talent but she had the good fortune as well to be bred, raised and trained by two generations of the Head family, surely as accomplished a racing dynasty as there has been on the turf, in France or anywhere else.</p><p>Had bitter misfortune not intervened, it would have been Frankie Dettori soaking up the applause on the way back to the winner's enclosure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/frankie-dettori-fractured-ankle\" title=\"\">Dettori, the retained rider for Treve's owner, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, fractured his ankle when he was unseated before a race at Nottingham last Wednesday</a>.</p><p>Treve won so easily for Thierry Jarnet, his replacement, that she would almost certainly have done the same for Dettori or any jockey with a licence.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/16/frankie-dettori-godolphin-drugs-test-shame\" title=\"\">Twelve months after being beaten here on Camelot, a ride which effectively terminated his 20-year association with the Godolphin operation</a>, and four months after his return from a six-month ban for using cocaine, it would have been a moment of supreme vindication for Dettori. But it would have distracted, too, from the achievement of Criquette Head-Maarek, who welcomed back her second Arc winner 34 years after the first, Three Troikas, in 1979.</p><p>Three Troikas, too, was a filly and, again like Treve, a product of the Head family's stud, the Haras du Quesnay in Normandy. Alec Head, Criquette's father, trained four Arc winners himself and now has yet another as a breeder.</p><p>Alec Head, who is now 89, was moved to tears by the occasion as a horse-drawn carriage took Treve's connections out into the middle of the track for the prize presentation. It was more than just the emotion of the moment, however, that prompted him to insist afterwards that of all the excellent fillies he has bred or trained over more than half a century Treve is the best.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/18/prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-greatest-ever\" title=\"\">This appeared beforehand to be one of the finest renewals of the Arc for at least a decade</a> and, while Treve beat her field with ease thanks to an irresistible burst of speed at the top of the home straight, that is no reason to suggest that it was not as strong as it seemed.</p><p>The \"right\" horses finished in the frame, including the Japanese-trained favourite Orfevre, who finished second last year after veering to his right with victory in sight but was simply no match for his younger opponent. Intello, the French Derby winner, was another neck away in third and Kizuna, the Japanese Derby winner, was fourth.</p><p>Not one horse from this high-class field could raise any kind of challenge to Treve, who started from a difficult high draw – 15th out of 17 – and could get no cover in the early stages, which left her pulling for her head as a result. If she was wasting energy, it made no difference. \"I thought before the race that she had six gears,\" Head-Maarek said afterwards. \"Now I know that she has seven.\"</p><p>Treve is unlikely to race again this season but she remains unbeaten after five starts and Head-Maarek is more than hopeful that Sheikh Joaan will keep her in training for another season in an attempt to become the first horse since Alleged to win back-to-back Arcs.</p><p>She is also a reason for Dettori to look forward to next season, when he is expected to make an early start to the campaign at Dubai's Carnival meeting.</p><p>\"I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori, as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille [last month],\" Head-Maarek said. \"I said to save her for today and that's what he did. I'm sorry he is not here today.</p><p>\"I told Jarnet to hide himself and he took a position on the outside but she's so good, she's incredible. To do that and stay unbeaten like that, she's the best I've ever had. When horses are that good, numbers [the draw] make no difference and the ground makes no difference.</p><p>\"He [Jarnet] said that she was travelling so easily that he just let her do what she likes to do and then quicken like she does.</p><p>\"I was scared of the horses behind herbut she is good and, when fillies are good, they are very good.</p><p>\"I'm so proud for Papa, who bred her, and for the Sheikh also, because when he bought her, he said, 'I want to win the Arc with her.' I said, \"I can't promise but I'll do my best and, with a filly like that, the trainer looks good.\"</p><p>Al Kazeem, who stayed on into sixth place from the worst draw of all, did best of the two-British trained runners in the Arc, on an afternoon when not one of the seven Group One events on the card was won by a British yard.</p><p>The most significant performance outside the Arc itself came in the Prix de la Foret, won by Moonlight Cloud under Jarnet with an extraordinary burst of speed from well off the pace when Gordon Lord Byron, a proven Group One winner, appeared to have opened up a decisive lead inside the final furlong.</p><p>Freddy Head, her trainer, said: \"I knew she was very well and, if it all went well, she would be hard to beat. For the moment we have no plans.</p><p>\"Of course I'd love her to stay in training but, at six, who knows? Nothing is definite. Thierry said she never had a hard race, so maybe she would be as good at six as she is at five.</p><p>\"If she ran again, it would be over a mile in Hong Kong. Mr [George] Strawbridge [owner] is not keen on going to Santa Anita [for the Breeders' Cup].\"</p><p>Head, Criquette's brother, was on board when Three Troikas was victorious in 1979. There may never have been an Arc day when pedigree seemed so important.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189840|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8f6250925881cc9a7d96396068e2e7e9aa999359 -->",

        "body":"<p>A television company boss has described John McCririck's antics as \"pretty disgusting\", as he explained to a tribunal why the flamboyant betting pundit was dropped from Channel 4's racing coverage.</p><p>McCririck, 73, is suing Channel 4 and the TV production company IMG for alleged ageism after he was dropped in a revamp of the broadcaster's racing programmes.</p><p>But Graham Fry, managing director of sports production worldwide at IMG, said in a witness statement that McCririck was ditched because of concerns that his larger-than-life style grated with the public.</p><p>\"We were concerned that John McCririck's presenting style was over-dramatic, liable to offend and would not have mainstream appeal,\" he said.</p><p>\"I was also concerned about John McCririck's credibility as a betting presenter in the context of a more serious, journalistic style of Channel 4 Racing, given the public persona he had created through appearances on other television programmes.\"</p><p>Fry, who prepared IMG's winning bid to produce the programme, said he found McCririck's stints on reality shows \"pretty disgusting and shocking\".</p><p>Jennifer Eady QC, representing McCririck, challenged Fry about a message he wrote during the preparation of the bid which asked: \"Is there a sexier picture of Francesca Cumani we can put in?\"   Fry told the tribunal that it was a \"flippant comment to a colleague\" as he believed the presenter, suggested as a potential reporter for Channel 4 Racing but never used, looked \"quite severe\" in the initial picture.</p><p>Eady suggested it was evidence that IMG was really concerned with obtaining \"young, more glamorous, sexier presenters to appeal to the young audience\"  but Fry said the company was simply trying to identify new talent.</p><p>It also emerged that IMG considered using the supermodel Erin O'Connor for a fashion segment on the show.</p><p>\"We were looking for a look that appealed to a younger and broader audience, but we were always of the view that the most important thing was to get the best people and the best presenters as they would be the ones who could educate this younger and broader audience,\" said Fry.</p><p>In his witness statement he said McCririck's betting coverage was \"difficult to follow, since it was very technical and was delivered in a loud, brash, aggressive and long-winded style which I considered to be over the top and distracting\".</p><p>He described the Channel 4 Racing team, before the revamp, as having an exclusivity that resembled \"a country club environment\".</p><p>The tribunal has previously heard that all the companies that registered bids to make the 2013 Channel 4 Racing programme scaled back – or axed completely – McCririck from their pitches. The pundit, who is seeking £3m in damages and wants his job back, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">claims that his on-screen persona was encouraged by Channel 4 and that the sole reason for his sacking is his age. </a></p><p>The hearing continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991114|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|904146f92d5876fc17e6556abf48f3358bb69d17 -->",

        "trailText":"Champion British racehorse trainer whose career was crowned by the success of Frankel",
        "headline":"Sir Henry Cecil obituary",
        "body":"<p>Sir Henry Cecil, who has died of cancer aged 70, was one of the most successful and popular racehorse trainers of the past century. His tally of 25 classic winners is unsurpassed since 1900, while his achievement in becoming champion trainer 10 times has been bettered only once. In 2012 his career was crowned by his training of the \"wonder horse\" Frankel, regarded by many as the best racehorse worldwide of the past 40 years. Frankel gave Cecil two of his record 75 Royal Ascot wins.</p><p>Cecil's effete, theatrical manner might have suggested an artistic lifestyle rather than a role in a competitive, cut-throat sport, but single-minded ambition enabled him to succeed. At his peak, in the 1980s, he trained 220 horses, in two stables, for many of the world's most distinguished owners, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum and Prince Khalid Abdullah. But his career was overshadowed and almost destroyed by a catalogue of controversies, personal catastrophes and social misjudgments.</p><p>His home and stables, at <a href=\"http://www.sirhenrycecil.com/\" title=\"\">Warren Place, Newmarket</a>, were acquired through his marriage in 1966 to Julie Murless, daughter of the legendary trainer Sir Noel Murless. They were a formidable team. In 1990 Cecil won his ninth trainer's title, but that season saw his life, and career, begin to unravel. His affair with and subsequent marriage to the former stable girl Natalie Payne, 24 years his junior, brought about the gradual disintegration of all that had been built up in the past 25 years.</p><p>Following their divorce, Julie set up her own training business elsewhere in Newmarket. Many of the most valued staff left Warren Place, some to join Julie, while many key owners, notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/jul/12/guardianobituaries.davidhadert\" title=\"\">Lord Howard de Walden</a>, moved their horses elsewhere. The hammer blow came in 1995 when Sheikh Mohammed removed his entire string, with thinly veiled comments indicating his dissatisfaction with the new Mrs Cecil's involvement. By 2005, by which time the second marriage had been dissolved, and Cecil's heavy drinking had led to a five-year drink-driving ban, he was training just 56 horses, 22 of which were owned by the ever-loyal Prince Khalid.</p><p>But Cecil never forfeited his popularity with the racing public and the last years of his life brought about a remarkable transformation in his fortunes.</p><p>Cecil was born in Aberdeen, with a twin brother, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1373863/David-Cecil.html\" title=\"\">David</a>. He also had two older brothers. Their mother, Rohays, was the daughter of a baronet, their father, also Henry, the younger brother of Lord Amherst of Hackney and a descendant of the earls of Exeter. Just two weeks before the twins' birth, their father was killed in action with the Parachute Regiment in North Africa.</p><p>The widowed Rohays moved from her family home, Crathes Castle near the banks of the River Dee, to Wickhambrook, near Newmarket, where her late husband had been given a house and farm by his brother. There she met the distinguished Irish-born racehorse trainer Captain Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, who had bought the Freemason Lodge stables in Newmarket 20 years earlier after a distinguished war in the Scots Guards, and whose success resulted in his appointment as royal trainer in 1943. Within the year, Rohays had married the 57-year-old bachelor, who became the boys' rather austere stepfather.</p><p>Despite his racing pedigree, and the immediate proximity of a successful racing stable, Cecil showed little interest in racing during his days at Canford school, Dorset. On leaving school, with no career in mind, the twins were sent by their stepfather to work in Lord Derby's Woodland Stud in Newmarket. This kindled their interest in the thoroughbred, and after work experience at studs in France and America, and an animal husbandry course at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, Henry became assistant trainer to his stepfather in November 1964.</p><p>Boyd-Rochfort had enjoyed 40 years of consistent success as a trainer, but the anatomy of day-to-day racing was changing, and he no longer trained the quality of horse to pursue his traditional agenda at the top meetings. In 1968 he retired and returned to Ireland and Henry took over what remained of his string at Freemason Lodge.</p><p>In his first year, adopting the attitude \"anywhere for a winner\", he sent his horses to race on courses unfamiliar to the Captain, and won 27 races, including the Eclipse Stakes and the Observer Gold Cup. But his stepfather sold Freemason Lodge at the end of 1969, and Cecil began the following season in a stable rented from the Jockey Club in Hamilton Road, Newmarket.</p><p>It was in the autumn of 1976 – his first year as a champion trainer – that he was able to buy Warren Place, and that December he moved with his family and horses to what would be (except for a period in 1990) his home and workplace for the rest of his life.</p><p>In 1979 his association with Joe Mercer enabled the veteran jockey to become champion for the first time, aged 45, and the following season the partnership won the St Leger with Light Cavalry. But that autumn, amid some mystery, the jockey \"resigned\" from his position, and Lester Piggott, who had ridden for Cecil's father-in-law in the 1960s, took over as stable jockey.</p><p>In the four years that followed, the duo were rarely far from the headlines. The new team got off to the best possible start, when Jim Joel's filly Fairy Footsteps won the 1981 1,000 Guineas. The following season Cecil was champion trainer for the fourth time, with record winnings of £872,614, and Piggott champion jockey for the 11th time, with his biggest total of wins (188) since 1966.</p><p>But in 1984 a scandal erupted over an unofficial payment contract, not registered with the Jockey Club, that Cecil attempted to arrange with his owners on Piggott's behalf. Cecil, always shy and sensitive beneath his self-effacing, dilettante exterior, found the complications of \"life with Piggott\" too much, and on 5 June that year it was announced that the American Steve Cauthen would ride for the stable the following season.</p><p>The next five years were perhaps the happiest and most successful of Cecil's career. There were his first two Derby wins, Slip Anchor (1985) and Reference Point (1987); Sheikh Mohammed's great filly Oh So Sharp's wins in the 1,000 Guineas, Oaks and St Leger; two other Oaks winners in Diminuendo (1988) and Snow Bride (1989); a win in the French Oaks with the grey filly Indian Skimmer; and a fourth St Leger success in 10 years with Michelozzo (1989). His delight in training winners at Warren Place was matched by his pleasure in showing off his rose garden, often for a charitable cause.</p><p>But then came the headlines of 1990, which revealed the marital split between the Cecils. There was another threat to his dominance in the trainers' ranks: his long-time rival and near-neighbour Michael Stoute, who won his third trainer's title the previous year, and was gradually becoming the trainer of choice for the top owners, notably Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>Two more Derby winners were to follow for Cecil, Commander in Chief (1993) and Oath (1999), but the number of winners, and of horses in the yard, declined. After his remarkable total of 180 wins in 1987, by 1994 the tally had dropped to 76. He continued to enjoy Classic success with homebred fillies, and won the 1,000 Guineas three times in four years, and the Oaks four years out of five, in the late 90s. But by the early years of the new century the great days appeared to be over. By 2005, Cecil no longer featured among the top 50 trainers. Royal Ascot winners, once plentiful, were now a memory. His only financial option was to rent out Warren Place's spare boxes to other trainers.</p><p>After six barren years from 2000, he bounced back to the delight of his friends, with an eighth Oaks success in 2007. He developed stomach cancer in 2006. In the following years he stopped drinking; his stable strength reverted to 150; he married Jane McKeown; he was knighted in 2011 in the Queen's birthday honours; and in 2012 his 2,000 Guineas winner, Frankel, was hailed as one of the all-time greats. Frankel went on to retire unbeaten in 14 races, the last of which was the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October 2012. It was a fitting and emotional climax to Cecil's legendary career.</p><p>Frankel was assessed as the world's best racehorse since official ratings began in 1977 and retired to stud in the spring of this year. He covered 133 mares at a reported fee of £125,000, justifying his estimated value of £100m.</p><p>Cecil's courage throughout this period was remarkable. The ravages of chemotherapy and his difficulty in digesting food saw his weight plunge. Yet at 6am every day, he would brave the sharp East Anglian winds to watch his string galloping and to welcome his friends.</p><p>He is survived by Jane; a son, Noel, and daughter, Katie, from his first marriage; and a son, Jake, from his second.</p><p>• Henry Richard Amherst Cecil, racehorse trainer, born 11 January 1943; died 11 June 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410525101|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|65b77062b91254c7ef2136c0b09c9039db1e3573 -->",

        "headline":"Kentucky Derby: who will win America's most famous race?",
        "body":"<p>There's something elemental about the Kentucky Derby that taps into the nation's psyche. Against the backdrop of Churchill Downs' iconic twin spires, the Derby is a race that stirs America's penchant for a ripping yarn in a theater of high-stakes drama. Every year, it seems, America's most recognizable race comes attached with a story gilt-edged for the headlines, good and bad.</p><p>Last year was the furore surrounding Doug O'Neill, trainer of the winner, I'll Have Another. Before I'll Have Another had time even to remove his garland of roses, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/sports/trainer-of-kentucky-derby-winner-has-a-troubled-record.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">the attention was swiftly diverted to O'Neill's litany of drug offenses that have blighted his training career</a>. Barbaro's stunning win in 2006 was a story of brilliance marred by tragedy when he broke down in the Preakness Stakes, his next race. Stories mined from further back include Secretariat's win in 1973 that catapulted him to triple-crown immortality. The headlines surrounding this year's renewal seem sterile in comparison – to this point, at least.</p><p>Much of the news generated thus far by the 2013 Kentucky Derby surrounds the new qualification system, an overhaul of the old formula that rewarded graded-stakes earnings – earnings accrued at any point in a horse's career. Without going into great detail, the old system recognized a horse's whole career over more recent efforts. To put it bluntly, your Derby contender could go from Pegasus to pit pony between two and three, and still enjoy a Derby berth at the expense of a horse who had shown the same generational transformation, only in reverse – or so the thinking went.</p><p>The revamped system is an attempt to rectify that problem. Under its new guise, Derby hopefuls are given a 36-race window of opportunity to qualify. The top four finishers in those races are awarded points on a sliding scale. Special emphasis and more points are given to certain races run during a 10-week period between February 23 and April 27 in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately kind of deal.</p><p>The new system, however, has its share of detractors. But one gets the impression that the machinery of the revamped formula is going to be tinkered with before the greater portion of leading racing figures are satisfied or appeased, albeit somewhat. But that's for the future.</p><p>This year, the experiment is over, and the leading contenders have come to the fore. Here's a look at the horses with the likeliest chances on Saturday.</p><h2>Verrazano</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> John Velazquez</p><p><strong>Post position:</strong> 14</p><p><strong>Wood Memorial win:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>If this year's Kentucky Derby were the World Poker Championships, trainer Todd Pletcher would be holding a royal flush. Chief among his cabal of Churchill contenders is Verrazano, whose resum&eacute; is an immaculate read of four wins from four starts. He's a smashing-looking colt with a pedigree smeared with Derby-winning DNA. His win last time out in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct was in a race that has supplied four of the last 20 Derby winners. What is more, jockey John Velazquez picked Verrazano over Orb – a decision more indicative, however, of the Pletcher-Velazquez connection than anything else.</p><p>With so many ticks in so many boxes, one could understand if Verrazano<br />was being discussed in the same hallowed whispers reserved for potential mega-champs. But he's not. This is primarily due to his victory over Normandy Invasion in the Wood Memorial that was heavier on slog than superlatives. Verrazano should have dismissed the Wood field with disdain. He didn't. Afterwards, one couldn't help but feel cheated of a more authoritative display. There is also the question of experience. Throughout Verrazano's four-race career, he has avoided the hustle-and-bustle and mud splattering kick-back of a tightly packed field. He might take to it like a cat to napping – one would rather not wait until the big race to find out.</p><h2>Orb</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Shug McGaughey</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Joel Rosario</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 16</p><p><strong>Florida Derby:</strong> </p><p><em></em></p><p>John Velazquez's reject is Joel Rosario's gain. And Rosario is a jockey on fire right now. Trainer Shug McGaughey's colt has shown fine improvement since his maiden win at Aqueduct last November. Since then, he's added an allowance win and a rallying victory in the Grade II Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park to his gold-medal haul. Then came Orb's scene-stealing performance in the Florida Derby, a race that has proven a springboard to Derby success to no less than five horses in the last 20 years.</p><p>Sitting in midfield, Orb took the lead a furlong from home before stretching clear of Itsmyluckyday, the horse who had defeated Shanghai Bobby the time prior. A horse hardened at the grindstone of tough graded stakes action, Orb possesses many of the qualities necessary to win at Churchill – tactical speed and unflinching stamina perhaps being his most valuable. If one were searching for an Achilles heel, it would be his temperament. He's a nervous, free-sweating sort. It hasn't proven a barrier to success thus far – it might do during the cauldron of the big race preliminaries. He's shown an improved disposition with each run, however. And a bullet workout Monday—four furlongs in 47.89sec—shows that he's in fine nick. So much so, Orb's now looks likely to go off favorite Saturday.</p><h2>Revolutionary</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Calvin Borel</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 3</p><p><strong>Louisiana Derby:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>In Revolutionary, trainer Todd Pletcher has a worthy understudy to Verrazano. And like Orb, Revolutionary has been showing improved form all spring to suggest that, come Churchill Downs on Saturday, he'll be a potent force. He broke his maiden in December, after which he overcame a troubled trip in the Grade III Withers Stakes at Aqueduct in February. That day, he showed an Astaire-like fleet of foot that is satisfying to see in a potential Derby candidate. At Fair Grounds at the tail-end of March, he set out his Kentucky stall with a hard-fought win in the Grade II Louisiana Derby.</p><p>The last Derby winner to hail from the Louisiana showpiece was Grindstone, who needed every inch of the trip to prevail at Churchill in 1996. Revolutionary's win at Fair Grounds in 2013 showed similar stamina-laden attributes: after being headed a furlong from home, Revolutionary clawed back to overhaul Mylute on the wire. It was a gutsy win – guts by the bucket load is what is needed come Saturday. The form of the race is suspect, however. A neck defeat of Mylute leaves one wondering as opposed to won over: will Revolutionary improve enough to follow in Grindstone's rose petal strewn hoof-prints? A few eyebrows were raised when he only jogged Tuesday morning, but he's a light framed individual who needs only to be kept ticking over. One huge plus: his post position. Three-time Derby winning Jockey Calvin Borel has got his favored spot down by the rail in three.</p><h2>Goldencents</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Doug O'Neill</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Kevin Krigger</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Santa Anita Derby:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>The similarities between Goldencents and last year's Derby champ, I'll Have Another, are there in stark relief: Same trainer in Doug O'Neill, the same Derby prep victory in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby.</p><p>Goldencent's win at Santa Anita dispelled in one minute and 48 seconds the doubts hovering over him following his defeat in the San Felipe the time prior. That day, he was snared in a speed duel up front with Flashback, only to weaken close home, a spent force. Back at the Californian track a month later and the result was vastly different.</p><p>Ridden more conservatively, Goldencents prevailed in convincing fashion against his San Felipe nemesis, Flashback. But the form of the race – of the west coast form in general –&nbsp;leaves one questioning whether Goldencents has shown enough to gift O'Neill a double-whammy of Derby victories. As is usually the case, the best three-year-old form leading into the Derby has been the preserve of the east-coasters. But Goldencents' winning time at Santa Anita was good, and in a well-worn racing maxim: he can only beat what's put before him. He's settled in well at Churchill this week and the O'Neill camp are bullish on his chances.</p><h2>Overanalyze</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey</strong>: Rafael Bejarano</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 9</p><p><strong>Arkansas Derby:</strong> <br /><em></em></p><p>Another leading contender and another horse whose head hangs over the<br />webbings at the Todd Pletcher barn. Overanalyze's berth at Churchill<br />is due largely to a fine win in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park<br />last time out. That day, he angled wide around a large field before<br />being sent to the lead a furlong from home. Once there, he was<br />extended to romp clear by a visually impressive four and a quarter<br />lengths.</p><p>Given the paucity of top-notch competition that day, Overanalyze<br />needed to win in convincing fashion to achieve two things: to be taken<br />seriously as a Derby contender and to dispel the specter of his<br />lifeless performance in the Gotham Stakes the time prior. He did just<br />that. As an added plus, his works leading into the race have been<br />electric. But compared to his stable mates who have exhibited<br />stronger, more consistent, form, one has to exercise just a little<br />more imagination to see him claim gold on Saturday.</p><h2>Java's War</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Kenny McPeek</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Julien Leparoux</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 19</p><p><strong>Blue Grass Stakes:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>Up until the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland earlier this month, Java's<br />War had shown enough to suggest that he was a capable enough sort -<br />but a capable enough sort who lacked what was necessary to triumph at<br />Churchill. Three stake-race defeats were capped with a second place<br />finish in the Tampa Bay Derby to Verrazano. Trainer Kenny McPeek then sent Java's War to Keeneland.</p><p>In the Blue Grass, Java's War stumbled out of the gates, relegating<br />himself to the rear of the field for much of the way. There he<br />remained, the class dunce, until brought wide and set for home at the<br />top of the stretch. He soared, and nailed Palace Malice on the wire in<br />taking fashion. He didn't beat much that day – Palace Malice was<br />coming off a seventh place finish in the Louisiana Derby. It was the<br />manner of Java's War's victory, however, that suggests he's improved<br />considerably since the Tampa Bay Derby when Verrazano beat him by a<br />comfortable three lengths. Young horses in the spring are capable of<br />remarkable physical and mental maturation within a brief window of<br />time. It's quite possible that Java's War has matured enough give<br />Verrazano a much sterner test on Saturday. His wide draw over in 19 is<br /> a concern – it's a problem, but not an insurmountable one.</p><h2>Normandy Invasion</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Chad Brown</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Javier Castellano</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 5</p><p>Another of Verrazano's vanquished foes, Normandy Invasion, was the horse that gave Pletcher's star colt a tough time of it in the Wood Memorial. Prior to that race, Chad Brown's runner had shown only reasonable form in a couple of Grade Twos: the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds and the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct, neither of which suggested that Normandy Invasion was going to make Verrazano roll up his sleeves.</p><p>Like Java's War, one gets the impression that Normandy Invasion is on the up. Unlike Java's War, we haven't been privy to another racecourse appearance to be able to gauge by what degree he has improved. If he wins on Saturday, he joins Giacomo and Mine That Bird as horses that succeeded at Churchill after last-time-out defeats.</p><p><strong>Win:</strong> Orb</p><p><strong>Bigger priced outsider:</strong> Java's War</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408234988|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fb08b15f107276a2db956613d20bd02cef8c332f -->",

        "headline":"Sheikh Mohammed: the ruler with real horsepower",
        "body":"<p>A couple of years before he succeeded his brother as ruler of Dubai in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum\" title=\"\">Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum</a>, never a man plagued by self-doubt, developed an idea to have some of his own poetry written on the sea of the Persian Gulf. The poetry would be in the form of man-made islands, constructed by thousands of the indentured migrant workers who form the bulk of Dubai's population, and on which Premier League footballers and the like might be encouraged to buy ocean-front real estate. It was imagined that the lines, written in Arabic in concrete and sand, would be large enough to be read from space.</p><p>In devising such a plan, you imagine that most world-class self-mythologisers might have been content with a single line of verse. It gives you a measure of Sheikh Mohammed's exaggerated sense of Xanadu that he decided on a whole stanza. \"<a href=\"http://shamelabboush.hubpages.com/hub/The-Ninth-Wonder-of-the-World\" title=\"\">Take wisdom from the wise</a>,\" the script would run. \"It takes a man of vision to write on water/ Not everyone who rides a horse is a jockey/ Great men rise to greater challenges.\"</p><p>In the end, despite property on the planned islands being sold out in advance, this was one of the few wild schemes that was never realised in Dubai's decade of outrageous construction. Other ocean-and-desert-defying projects were made – the Palm Resort of frond peninsulas, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)\" title=\"\">the World,</a> a mini globe of islands out at sea – not to mention the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, and mile upon mile of gravity-mocking condos, hotels and office blocks. In that time, the joke has gone that only three words have been required to make overnight building miracles a steel and glass reality: \"Sheikh Mohammed says…\"</p><p>This development programme was just one aspect of the diminutive 63-year-old's singular drive toward world domination. At the same time as he was impressing the soaring power of the Maktoum bloodline on the Gulf skyline, he was taking an autocrat's obsession with hereditary principles to extremes in the world of thoroughbred racing, pursued with trademark determination on five continents. Every man needs a hobby. Sheikh Mohammed's has involved the creation of the largest and most expensive stable of fast horses in human history.</p><p>In his own mind, the twin aspects of his brand, joint expression of his familial riches and power, have been intertwined. In his vision, Dubai, a place that now features the world's most opulent racecourse, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/jan/28/dubai-meydan-open-carnival-meeting\" title=\"\">Meydan</a>, built at a cost of $1.25bn in two years, has itself been sold as the ultimate winners' enclosure for newly globalised wealth.</p><p>Sooner or later, though, every myth-making dictator is met with a dose of reality. For Sheikh Mohammed, this came first with Dubai's post-credit crunch bust, which saw a collapse in property prices, a great many unfinished ego developments and the humiliating need for an up to $20bn bailout from \"Uncle Abu Dhabi\" in 2010, a debt still to be repaid. At the time, an authorised biography of the sheikh was due; the rumour goes that his refusal to countenance an epilogue detailing the lessons of his emirate's recession meant that the book never happened.</p><p>And if the property slump marked the outer limit of his civic ambition, then the events of the last two weeks at the headquarters of his racing operation, Godolphin, in Newmarket, have been a defining moment in his private obsession, another line in the sand.</p><p>The random dope testing of horses under control of his joint head trainer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/25/mahmood-al-zarooni-godolphin-doping-scandal\" title=\"\">Mahmood al-Zarooni</a>, which identified the widescale use of banned anabolic steroids, most notably in the sample of the top-rated two-year-old filly in Europe, Certify, has been a personal humiliation for Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>It was a measure of his shame at this exposure that he took the highly unusual step of including his apologetic statement about the events that led to al-Zarooni's ban from British racing for eight years on his official website, which generally is a spotless expression of his distinctive personality cult: poet, statesman, sportsman, visionary. In the statement, he once again explicitly linked his vision for Godolphin with his vision for Dubai: \"I was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables has violated [the] ethical standards and the rules of British racing. I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. I built my country based on the same solid principles.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>The determined conviction behind that dubious latter assertion – Sheikh Mohammed's formidably stubborn personality has helped him to prevail as a sometime champion in gruelling horse endurance races over 10 or more hours – seems to have been derived in his own mind from twin formative influences. The first was that of his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, the shrewd initiator of modern Dubai, who saw that the comparatively limited oil wealth that drove development would quickly dry up and that the future had to be made from tourism and commerce. Rashid was, as he frequently said, only one generation removed from the camel-driving roots of his family and he inculcated his sons with those values: they grew up in a compound with no electricity or running water and were encouraged to be hardened horsemen and hunters.</p><p>The contrasting pillar of Sheikh Mohammed's wisdom was gained at what his website grandly terms \"the Bell School of Languages at Cambridge University\", actually just an international language college, at which he gained his still slightly awkward grasp of English. It is claimed that his gift for literature arose in his years in the university town, but any reader of his poetry might guess that he spent much more of his time at Newmarket up the road; he saw his first 2,000 Guineas race in 1967 and was immediately hooked.</p><p>In the years since, he has not so much sought to reconcile these influences as to pursue both avidly. At home, he is his father's son. He has 23 \"acknowledged\" children, mostly with his \"senior wife\", Sheikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma al Maktoum, who lives in Jameel Palace and is never pictured in public. Despite the supreme decadence of his gold-plated, air-conditioned ambition for Dubai, built by armies of wretchedly paid workers from the Indian subcontinent, he likes to project himself as a simple soul: \"I need little from my world. My prayer mat and water bottle are in my car wherever I go, together with my work documents and my vision.\"</p><p>He is haphazardly generous – the lifestyles of all United Arab Emiratis are richly subsidised; they pay no taxes and are awarded a share of the principality's wealth. Despite this, he argues with more complacent branches of the family for the virtues of meritocracy, education and hard work. His development plan was largely one of divide and rule; desert land was parcelled up for cousins and acolytes, with the implicit instruction to \"do something to make Sheikh Mohammed proud\". Predictable insanity ensued.</p><p>The other half of his life, his summers at the Godolphin operation he runs with his brother Hamdan in Newmarket and at the comparable facility in Lexington, Kentucky, or at the Darley stud with its outposts in Australia, Japan and Ireland, is on different terms. He spends most of it with his \"racing wife\", Princess Haya, Oxford-educated daughter of the King of Jordan, with whom he has two young children, and who, as an Olympic show-jumper, shares his love of horses.</p><p>That love runs deep. Racing broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.broughscott.com/consultancy.asp\" title=\"\">Brough Scott</a>, a long-time acquaintance who helped the sheikh establish the <em>Racing Post</em>, believes he has been a fundamentally good thing for racing and hopes the current scandal will at least lead to established international standards of anti-doping legislation. Scott suggests the embarrassment was all the greater for Sheikh Mohammed since his trainer, al-Zarooni, was very much promoted as his protege. Even so, \"the benefits of his involvement in British racing outweigh any negatives enormously\", Scott suggests. \"They have supported racing in a huge way, in terms of its employment, its economy.\"</p><p>Thousands of residents of Lexington, Kentucky, whose mortgages have indirectly been paid, and children educated through the sheikh's largesse, would no doubt concur. Despite some suggestions that the scandal might tempt Sheikh Mohammed to retreat from the UK, off-the-record insiders suggest the opposite will be the case. He is nothing if not persistent. Anyone who believes otherwise might try the endurance test of his poetry, in which the race is always hard, as those verses that might have been written in the sea went on to suggest: \"At times even the wise and experienced&nbsp;are tormented with bewilderment, fear and delusions/ Determined we moved along unwaveringly buoyant, riding the earth's saddle and steering its reins.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407943406|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d925f9d30d14253c8c649257e21815da4f69097d -->",

        "headline":"Horse-doping scandal rocks racing as trainer admits 'catastrophic error'",
        "body":"<p>Mahmood al-Zarooni, the trainer at the centre of a horse-doping scandal involving a favourite for one of Britain's most prestigious races, is \"co-operating fully\" with  investigators, the British Horseracing Authority said on Tuesday, after 11 horses trained by him tested positive for anabolic steroids.</p><p>The horses, trained by Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks just outside Newmarket, Suffolk, have been banned from competition after testing positive for anabolic steroids during an inspection of the stable by BHA investigators on 9 April. They include Certify, an unbeaten three-year-old filly, who would have been a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas, one of Britain's five Classics, on 5 May but will now be forced to miss the race. Formal charges against Zarooni are due to be made Wednesday.</p><p>Leading bookmakers including Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill have agreed to refund bets placed on Certify prior to her ban from competition.</p><p>Zarooni, 37, trains about 150 horses at Moulton Paddocks, all of which are owned by Godolphin, part of the bloodstock operation of Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. The sheikh, whose passion for racing dates back to visits to Newmarket while studying at Cambridge in the 1960s, has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Godolphin since its foundation in 1994, and seen its colours carried to success in dozens of significant races.</p><p>Zarooni, who joined Godolphin as one of its two principal trainers in March 2010, has sent out the winners of two British Classics. Blue Bunting, a 16-1 chance, took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May 2011, while Encke, another outsider at 25-1, won the St Leger at Doncaster in September 2012. He also trained Monterosso to win the Dubai World Cup, the most valuable event in the sport with a first prize of $6m (£4m), in March 2012.</p><p>Zarooni is all but certain to be banned from racing for several years when he appears before the BHA's disciplinary committee, probably within the next two weeks. The authority is keen to resolve the case quickly to remove uncertainty from betting markets, and Zarooni has admitted the administration of performance-enhancing drugs, saying it was a \"catastrophic error\" on his part.</p><p>While punishment may be swift for Zarooni, however, the sense of astonishment, and even betrayal, that his actions have caused will persist in racing for many months to come. Positive tests for anabolic steroids after a horse has run in a race are all but unknown, although Howard Johnson, a leading National Hunt trainer, was banned from the sport in 2010 after evidence that steroids had been used in his stable emerged in paperwork found in his office.</p><p>Steroids are still viewed as a constant and significant threat to racing's integrity, however, because the effects of their use, such as an increase in lean muscle mass, can persist after the substance has left the horse's system. In a sport in which results can be decided by a nose – about 1cm – the unfair advantage that a horse might gain could be worth many thousands of pounds.</p><p>\"It is, without doubt, a performance-enhancing drug,\" said James Given, a vet who runs a racing yard in Yorkshire. \"It's not just active while the drug is in the body, and certainly many of these drugs will persist in the body for several months, but it's the effect on the muscle development beyond its natural capacity.\"</p><p>In Newmarket, the centre of British Flat racing since King Charles II instituted regular race meetings in the 1660s, the anger at Zarooni's actions runs deep in the tight-knit racing community.</p><p>\"It's just hideously disappointing,\" one resident of the town with close ties to a racing stable said on Tuesday. \"We've just finished defending the Grand National, and now we've got to defend ourselves against this.</p><p>\"It's bad for the sport, it's bad for the horses and bad for those who play by the rules. It's cheating, but it's also sickening from the horse welfare perspective. We know what these things do to humans, and it's just not right, full stop.\"</p><p>Zarooni's sole entry in a race in Britain on Tuesday was declared a non-runner a few hours before the race, but he has two horses entered to race at Wolverhampton  and six possible runners – including a filly called Controversy – on Friday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407723807|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f6c516dd09c2d100e10e9a23bc552680f7afcda6 -->",

The development includes a new royal box, balconies along the length of the stand's rear allowing them to look down on the paddock area and the site will be approached by a sweeping walkway that crosses over the route which runners take to the track. Both measures are intended to greatly increase the number of spectators who can assess the animals before each race",

Americain was 11th and Dunaden 14th.</p><p>Americain was ridden by Australian jockey Damien Oliver, who has been implicated in a scandal involving large bets the veteran rider placed on a rival horse in a race two years ago.</p><p>Green Moon paid $20.80 (£13) to win and the trifecta for the leading three horses $51,177 (£32,007) on the Victoria state betting agency.</p><p>Fiorente was the third Cup runner-up for leading Sydney trainer Gai Waterhouse, who is still yet to win Australia's biggest race. She previously trained Te Akau Nick (1993) and Nothin' Leica Dane (1995) to runner-up placings.</p><p>Irish galloper Jakkalberry was a further 1-1/4 lengths away in third.</p><p>Prebble said Green Moon, handled by local trainer Robert Hickmott, got a \"severe check\" about 250 metres from the start which put him on the fence.</p><p>\"But he's a quality horse, and I put it to him on the straightening,\" said Prebble. \"I was very confident they weren't going to pick him up he ran all the way through to the wire.\"</p><p>Two weeks ago, Green Moon started as favourite in the Cox Plate, Australia's richest weight-for-age race, but finished seventh, accounting for his generous odds on Tuesday.</p><p>Williams is a former business partner of one of Australia's richest men, Kerry Packer, and once owned Melbourne's Crown Casino. Now a property developer, Williams has been in poor health in recent years and was not at Flemington on Tuesday to watch the race.</p><p>\"He puts a lot into racing and he's a very good supporter of mine,\" Prebble said of Williams.</p><p>\"He's never here. He's going to be at home enjoying it. It's lovely.\"</p><p>Williams's son Nick was ecstatic after accepting the trophy from Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles and Camilla were among the crowd of more than 100,000 at Flemington in inner western Melbourne.</p><p>\"We put a lot of money in and a heck of a lot of effort so to get this result today is terrific,\" Nick Williams said. \"God bless everyone who wrote him off.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398887710|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c595513f1d0e6aedb5f62d96d638953dd8c62c0c -->",

        "headline":"Ascot crowds cheer on Frankel as world's best ever horse exits to make £100m at stud",
        "body":"<p>It was still dark when Sir Henry Cecil peered nervously out of the window on Saturday morning. When you've been in the game as long as he has, you develop a sense of what to expect, even before your eyes have time to adjust. There had been rain, but just a few spots, nothing to derail a day that he had been building up to for five decades – 43 years to be exact – of nurturing exceptional racehorses.</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, on damp, sludgy ground at Ascot (technically: \"soft, heavy in places\"), the 69-year-old Cecil watched the final race of Frankel, the once-in-a-lifetime thoroughbred he trains. There was excruciating tension – for Cecil, for the 32,000 sell-out crowd, for millions at home and in betting shops – but as usual Frankel was the coolest head on the course and streaked home to win by two lengths.</p><p>It is a mark of Frankel's dominance of Flat (as opposed to jump) racing that his greatest challenge was always going to be meteorological. Since his maiden run at Newmarket in August 2010, the four-year-old was unbeaten in 13 races coming into Ascot's Qipco Champion Stakes, and commonly thought to be unbeatable. The only question was how he would cope running a mile and a quarter through sodden turf, but no one was too surprised that his devastating finishing explosion – when each stride swallows 22ft and he tops 40mph – was gloriously unaffected.</p><p>Before the race, the horse – deep mahogany with a star on its forehead and four white socks – was expected to be challenged by the French gelding Cirrus Des Aigles, known to like the heavy stuff. But, after a poor start, he won almost without breaking sweat. As they entered the winner's enclosure, Frankel's jockey, Tom Queally, punched the air and roared with delight.</p><p>Their prize was £737,230, a share of the richest purse in British horseracing. This added to the £2,261,072 Frankel had already brought home for his owner Khalid Abdullah, a Saudi Arabian prince. Even these figures are mere oats and carrots compared with the riches that the colt will soon be earning for Prince Khalid in retirement, as the world's most desirable stallion. The exact stud fee has not been set yet but experts suggest it could be exorbitant. He would be expected to cover between 140 and 200 mares each year, leading to a valuation of £100m. Not bad, considering there is no guarantee that any offspring will inherit Frankel's obscene acceleration.</p><p>But the appeal of Frankel has never been about money. The reason Ascot was so rammed, the grandstands full with sharp suits and extravagant plumages on an overcast afternoon, was the chance to watch history. To say you had watched a horse who will now be mentioned in the same breath as Mill Reef and Dancing Brave. One spectator, Kelsey Padjen, had painted her nails in turquoise with a pink sash, to match Frankel's colours. The Queen came to see her horse Carlton House in an earlier race, but no doubt had half an eye on the main event.</p><p>\"Frankel's the most extraordinary horse I've seen,\" said the broadcaster Clare Balding, whose father had trained the great Mill Reef. \"What makes him so special is the efficiency of his stride, his power. But more than that, it's what he does inside you – how he wins races. He's so exciting, he makes the other horses look ordinary. He's what I call 'a jaw-dropper' – you watch him and your mouth falls open.\"</p><p>At the winning post yesterday, there was extra goodwill for Cecil, one of the most popular figures in British racing. In the mid-2000s, his career looked stuck in a downward spiral, as he struggled to cope with the death of his twin brother, the break-up of his second marriage and his heavy drinking. Then in 2006, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He defeated that, but he is undergoing chemotherapy for another cancer, this time in his stomach. He looked frail in a three-piece suit and brown trilby yesterday on Saturday, but he is adamant that he has no plans to retire along with Frankel.</p><p>Last week, Cecil said: \"There will be a tear in my eye after his final race, because I don't expect to ever see another like him. But I can't quit, never. I have a family to support and feel I have a few more years left in me.\"</p><p>Even the bookies entered into the spirit yesterday. In a natty pinstripe blazer, Big Jim, from Betting With Big Jim, attempted to lure punters by saying that he would pay out as if Frankel was not in the race – that is, it was a foregone conclusion who would win, so this would at least keep it interesting. \"Better rates than you'd get at RBS,\" he promised. \"More guaranteed than RBS, too!\"</p><p>\"Every sport needs heroes, and that's what Frankel is,\" said Big Jim. \"He's not been great for the bookies, to be honest, but he's brilliant to watch. We're going to miss him.\"</p><p>In fact, Frankel has been so much better than his rivals that neither punters nor bookies have profited much from his success. After all, where's the gamble if you know who is going to win? He has been odds-on in all his races, apart from his debut: if you had staked £1 on each of his 13 victories, you would have been just £5.78 richer. For the Qipco Champion Stakes his odds were a miserly 2-11. For the casual flutterer, the winnings would not even cover the petrol to the betting shop.</p><p>There was another farewell yesterday as the BBC ended its association with Flat racing and Ascot, a relationship that goes back 61 years. For the next four years at least, all the major meetings – including the Grand National, the Derby, Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham Festival – will be screened on Channel 4. It would have been a small consolation for the corporation that the BBC era ended at the same time as the career of the greatest Flat racehorse of our times.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398107649|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|39642d8c43c321594c74267494a2d0a50c99813d -->",

        "body":"<p>The number of racehorses destroyed in the UK's abattoirs has more than doubled over the last year, triggering calls from animal rights groups for the racing industry to do more to help thoroughbreds once their racing careers are over.</p><p>The rise comes as charities warn that the recession is having an effect on the welfare of all types of horses and ponies, with many owners struggling to pay for the upkeep of their animals.</p><p>Yesterday's Epsom Derby, attended by an estimated 200,000 racegoers, proved the continuing popularity of horse racing. But critics say not enough money generated by the industry is being allocated for the welfare of thoroughbreds after their racing careers have finished.</p><p>A report by the British Horseracing Authority says that in 2011 the number of thoroughbreds reported dead to the horse passport issuing authority rose by 29%, from 1,994 in 2010 to 2,574.</p><p>The report, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:cRPrHTqmxg0J:www.britishhorseracing.com/resources/equine-science-and-welfare/new_recession.pdf+Effect+of+the+recession+on+the+welfare+of+British+thoroughbred+horses+2011+update&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi22Xc2xi-Xoz7vLKKahf51I89VeCNUn_H5-do2q9XmO9BkI8sKSb2gqFAVHY7GSgJYFvNNzwNSpJNPgkIFzNa3tIjPF2qOMTy8t_0czgAs3JRE12zKnlTyqx3eLx4NTiXanjlO&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ6TMDSd4BIkWRn9_mgOAJSNieBXw\" title=\"\">The Effect of the recession on the welfare of British Thoroughbred Horses</a>, notes: \"Of these, 1,127 horses either in training, breeding or out of training were reported as killed in abattoirs, from 499 horses in 2010, an increase of 126%.\"</p><p>Dene Stansall, horse racing consultant at Animal Aid, a charity that campaigns against horse racing, described the report's figures as disturbing. \"They [the horse racing authority] have not got to grips with the problem,\" he said. \"For years more horses have been bred than have been needed.\"</p><p>But Professor Tim Morris, director of equine science and welfare at the authority, said the figures should be seen in the context of the 1 million horses on the UK's equine database.  \"While a 126% increase may sound a lot, in absolute terms it's not a big number,\" Morris said, pointing out that the industry was heavily regulated so that the welfare of its animals was often to a higher standard than that afforded other types of horses and ponies.</p><p>\"To solve this problem we've got to stop breeding so many, and then we won't have to put so many down,\" said Carrie Humble, an independent equine welfare consultant. \"But I would rather see these overproduced horses dead than suffering.\"</p><p>Morris said the industry had taken steps to reduce the number of horses entering racing to ensure there was not an oversupply of thoroughbreds during the economic downturn.</p><p>The authority report notes: \"From 2008 to 2011 there has been an overall reduction of 38% in foals registered (falls of 45% in Ireland and 24% in Great Britain).\"</p><p>But Stansall questioned whether the trend would continue downwards: \"Whilst the supply has gone down, as soon as the economy picks up it will rise again.\" Stansall said that, as many racehorses were owned by syndicates, it made it difficult to determine who should take responsibility for the horse's future welfare after it had finished racing.</p><p>\"If you've got a racehorse you have to commit to that animal,\" he said, pointing out it often took a couple of years to calm the horse down so that it could be ridden by non-jockeys.</p><p>The disposal of horses in UK abattoirs is part of a wider European trend. The number of horses slaughtered at DAFF (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) abattoirs in Ireland rose from 3,220 in 2009 to 7,296 in 2010.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391056104|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c4eb7a4b1cb5f0a85443676266fd6865f64bd1d6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Campaigners are calling for a betting boycott of next weekend's Grand National, as latest figures reveal the death toll on Britain's racecourses.</p><p>Animal Aid has launched a Sanctuary Not Cruelty campaign, appealing to people to send money they might have put on the race to a horse sanctuary instead.</p><p>At least 23 horses died as a result of injuries on racecourses in March alone, with five animals dying in the first two days of the Cheltenham festival.</p><p>The death last week of Fox Hunt, a winner at Royal Ascot, caused an outcry <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/31/dubai-world-cup-deaths-gold-cup\" title=\"\">at the Dubai Gold Cup</a>. The race was stopped after Fox Hunt broke a leg and collapsed during the running but was then re-scheduled for later in the day, when a further two horses were fatally injured.</p><p>There was huge controversy at last year's Grand National, when two horses died as a result of falls and Jason Maguire, the rider of the winning horse, Ballabriggs, received a five-day suspension for using his whip with excessive frequency.</p><p>Animal Aid spokesperson Fiona Pereira said: \"We are asking the public to remember how they felt about the 2011 race and to donate their usual 'flutter' to our two specially selected sanctuaries, both of which require funding to rescue horses in need – including ex-racehorses.</p><p>\"As well as individuals, we hope that company sweepstakes will support our initiative. Helping racehorses in their retirement is particularly important. It's one of horse racing's darkest secrets that many thoroughbreds face neglect or are slaughtered for meat when their racing careers are over or they are deemed financially unviable.\"</p><p>There have been changes to two fences at Aintree, near Liverpool, ahead of Saturday's race. From a field of 40 horses, only 19 finished the race in 2011. Twenty horses have died as a result of competing in the Grand National since 2000.</p><p>Television and radio commentators were criticised at the time for ignoring the falls as the race continued, with one BBC commentator only referring to the fatalities by calling the body of a dead horse \"an obstacle\".</p><p>This year television companies have also been targeted in the Animal Aid campaign, which calls on commentators to properly report on, and investigate, any deaths during this year's Grand National.</p><p>\"They seem to think they have to be sensitive for the viewer, but people do need to know what's going on on that course,\" said Dene Stansall, the grandson of an Aintree bookie who now keeps the country's only record of racehorse deaths for Animal Aid.</p><p>\"Racing is not unlike being in the army for horses,\" said Stansall. \"They're fed, kept fit and looked after, some even love it, but there is an ever-present risk.</p><p>\"That is a risk of dying. Unfortunately horses aren't given a choice.\"</p><p>Dr Mark Kennedy, senior lecturer in animal welfare at Anglia Ruskin University, says risk in horse racing has to be tackled by the industry. He said the five deaths at Cheltenham were a reminder of the high risk horses are exposed to in steeplechasing and hurdling.</p><p>\"In large meetings with more than 500 starts, such as the Cheltenham and Grand National meetings, we can expect two to three horses to die over the course of the meetings. These are not freak accidents; they are the predictable outcome of running horses at this level of risk.</p><p>\"I sincerely believe the vast majority of those involved in racing genuinely and deeply care about their horses and hate to see them injured or killed,\" he said. \"I do not suggest that I, or anyone else, have any right to demand a ban on jump racing. But I do believe we should clearly assess, acknowledge and discuss the risk horses are exposed to. If the risk is unacceptably high, we have to consider whether it is right to expose horses to risk of this magnitude.\"</p><p>Julian Thick, the managing director of Aintree, said: \"Aintree is racing's shop window. It's a national treasure, a national institution and very much in our national psyche.</p><p>\"We're very open about the risk, there is a risk in all sports and we never stand still on safety. This year we have put together a package of changes which will be very good for the race. This year is the 165th running. Last year we had a record 8.8 million people watching and 153,000 through the racecourse over the Grand National weekend.</p><p>\"They come to see a sport which is exciting and unpredictable.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388432130|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6275c491b479a1232b34a812f0587d4ad450101b -->",
