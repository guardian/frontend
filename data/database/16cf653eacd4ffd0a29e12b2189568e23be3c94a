I told them I had 10 and they said: 'We are going to kill you, do you think your grandchildren will miss you?'</p><p>\"I was consumed by fear. It was sheer hell and all I can remember is praying.\"</p><p>She was ordered to open a second safe but was unable to perform the combination.</p><p>As a result, the burglars tied her hands behind her back and made her lie in her bath where a water-drenched towel was wrapped around her face a number of times to simulate drowning.</p><p>Jansen continued: \"Then they tied me to the towel rail with cable they had ripped from a nearby radio. They cut off my trousers and T-shirt with scissors.</p><p>\"I was trembling because I thought they were going to rape me and I just kept praying.</p><p>\"I was semi-conscious but eventually I realised they were gone and I had to bite myself out of the wires to get free.\"</p><p>She managed to raise the alarm but police were unable to locate the men – who are believed to have escaped on foot – following a search of the area.</p><p>Surrey police have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward.</p><p>Detective Inspector Jake Nuttall, who is leading the investigation, said: \"This was an appalling, unprovoked attack on a defenceless, elderly woman in her own home and Surrey police is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice.</p><p>\"The victim sustained injuries to her wrists, arms and shoulders during the attack but fortunately she is expected to make a full recovery. She has understandably been left deeply upset by this horrendous ordeal.</p><p>\"This type of senseless violence will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in St George's Hill late on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday morning to call police as a matter of urgency.\"</p><p>Anyone who witnessed the burglary or has any information should call Surrey police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394290213|2013-09-30T11:53:20Z|3b4a227dfc67d06192d1fead4efb2b94b4917fab -->",

She was forced to open a safe before the men, dressed in black clothes and balaclavas, stole jewellery and personal items worth a reported £150,000.</p><p>Jansen, 73, said she attempted to press a panic button installed in her bedroom, prompting the burglars to boil a kettle and pour scalding water over her arm as punishment. She said she was also gagged, waterboarded and tied to a radiator during an assault that left her with multiple injuries.</p><p>She <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184641/Waterboarded-gang-robbers-7m-home-Masked-intruders-torture-grandmother-73-hours-make-open-safe.html\" title=\"\">told the Daily Mail</a>: \"I was consumed by fear.

She has understandably been left deeply upset by this horrendous ordeal.</p><p>\"This type of senseless violence will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in St George's Hill late on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday morning to call police as a matter of urgency.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394382947|2013-09-30T11:53:21Z|a6a2edf01c54f7257d649846ad6ad4999e657f24 -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p></p><p>Murders involving knives have fallen by 35% from 71 to 46 as part of an overall 4% decline in the crime rate, according to police recorded crime figures for England and Wales published today.</p><p>The largest falls recorded by the police include a 12% drop in car crime, a 10% fall in fraud and forgery and 5% falls in gun crime and criminal damage.</p><p>The police figures, however, record a 3% rise in domestic burglaries to 67,000 during the second quarter of 2009. This is the third rise in the last four quarters, apparently confirming fears that the economic recession is putting upward pressure on some forms of property crime. Robberies increased by 100 incidents to 19,600, snatches and other personal theft rose by 5% and bicycle thefts were up 22%.</p><p>A study by the chief inspector of constabulary published at the same time as the quarterly crime figures shows that as many as 5,000 violent crime incidents, out of 421,000 recorded each year by the police as personal violence, may have been wrongly classified by the police as \"no crimes\". The study, which was ordered by the home secretary to investigate an apparent 22% statistical spike in the most serious offences earlier this year, revealed that there have been more than 320 changes and clarifications in the crime counting rules since 2005.</p><p>Overall, the figures for April to June 2009 show a total of 1,168,300 offences recorded by the police – a fall of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2008.</p><p>The latest results from the British Crime Survey, which is based on the personal experience of crime of 40,000 people, show a similar picture, with overall crime remaining stable in the year to June 2009, including a 4% fall in household crime and no change in the level of personal crime.</p><p>The BCS also shows that the proportion of people who have high levels of concern about antisocial behaviour in their neighbourhood remains constant at about 16%, although there are some falls in individual worries such as teenagers hanging around the streets. For the first time, 50% of people feel that councils and police are dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour in their area – up from 45% a year ago.</p><p>The 35% fall in knife murders represents a decline from 71 fatal stabbings between April and June 2008 to 46 between April and June this year. However, attempted murders with a knife rose by seven from 69 to 76 during the same period.</p><p>The Home Office minister David Hanson said the continuing falls in recorded crime showed that the risk of becoming a victim remained historically low. He acknowledged the \"upward pressure\" on burglary, robbery and some theft, saying it had been met by a £20m package of anti-crime measures to \"nip it in the bud\".</p><p>The \"no crime\" disclosure follows an investigation by the chief inspector of constabulary which found that 35% of a sample of 479 \"no crime\" decisions by police forces were wrongly classified and that victims did not get the service they deserved. The finding, based on a small sample, has triggered a more thorough investigation next year.</p><p>The chief inspector, Denis O'Connor, said that investigators had to \"get underneath\" individual \"no crime\" decisions to find out why they had happened, but suggested it partly reflected the complex development of the law on assault during its 150-year history. The investigation found that in more than 60% of cases the decision to dismiss the allegation was correct and gave the example of a man who had claimed to have been assaulted in the high street but who was later found to have been injured by falling after leaving the pub.</p><p>The shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, said the disclosure would further undermine confidence in the crime figures: \"People are never going to believe in our police and criminal justice system unless they can be absolutely certain that they are being given a true picture of what's really happening.\"</p><p>He said the increase in burglary rates in the newly published crime figures was worrying \"since it is the unemployed who were most likely to be the victims, making life even tougher for them at the moment. But the rise in attempted murder with a knife is particularly alarming and just goes to emphasise how much still needs to be done to combat the culture of violence that exists in many urban areas.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/354610763|2013-09-30T11:53:21Z|14c0a67ab69d7a9a2664201e1417423ec8aec918 -->",

        "headline":"Police crime detection rates fall to new low",
        "body":"The police detection rate for all recorded crimes has fallen to an all time low of only 24%, according to Home Office figures published today. <P>While the annual police recorded crime figures show that the clear-up rate for burglary has fallen to the lowest ever level of only 12%, the statistics also show a worrying four point decline in detection rates for violent offences in the past year.  <P>Overall, the crime figures show that the volume of recorded offences fell by 2.5% in the year to March 2001 to 5.2m offences, with the sharpest falls taking place in the burglary and car crime figures. These gains, however, were offset by a rise in violent crime for the third year in a row, but the rate of increase at 4.3% is slowing down when compared with the alarming 16% rise in the year 1999-00.  <P>The Home Office said the fall in police detection rates from 34% in 1989 to only 24% in the last financial year was partly explained by the exclusion from the statistics of secondary clear-ups, such as criminals admitting to other offences during prison visits by the police.  <P>Officials admitted there did appear to be an underlying decline in the clear-up rate, particularly of violent crime where it had fallen from 59% to 55% in the last year alone.  <P>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said there had been gains in reducing burglaries   (down 8%) and car crime (down 9%) but the continued increase in violent crime, particularly the 13% rise in robbery - mainly muggings rather than bank raids - in the past year caused concern.  <P>\"There are no quick wins on crime - it is a long term investment,\" he said. \"We have had real success with burglary and car crime but this was hard earned. These are significant and continued falls and mean we are now on track to meet our demanding national targets for reduction of both burglary and vehicle crime.  <P>\"One area of concern is the continued increase in robbery, which rose by 13%. However, the rate of rise is slowing significantly and is now half of the 26% increase for the previous 12 months. Part of this is due to a rise in mobile phone theft, which in some urban areas accounts for up to 40% of all robberies.\"  <P>The Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, last night said the figures showing violent crime still rising, sharp regional variations and so few crimes being cleared up showed there was no room for complacency.  <P>\"It is appalling that three out of four crimes go undetected. There must be a step change improvement in clearing up crime. Nothing is more likely to foster insecurity and fear of crime than so few crimes resulting in someone being brought to account for their actions. Increasing the certainty that offenders will be caught is a much greater de terrent than simply increasing the severity of sentences.\"  <P>The data breaks the crime figures down to basic command unit level in the police so that sharp variations in the performance of every police division can spotted.  <P>The figures confirm that in terms of violent crime, particularly robbery, Lambeth in south London has the worst record in England and Wales with a 38% year on year increase in offences and a robbery rate of 17 per 1,000 population. It is followed by Hackney and Manchester, both with 11 per 1,000. The worst burglary hotspots are Nottingham with 53 per 1,000 households, Manchester (50 per 1,000), Middlesbrough (50 per 1,000), Hull (47 per 1,000) and Salford (44 per 1,000).  <P>Backed by the findings of British Crime Survey, which measures people's experience of crime, the recorded figures suggest crime is going down in Britain fuelled by a booming economy, falling unemployment and increasingly successful crime reduction strategy.  <P>The detailed recorded crime figures confirm the overall detection rate for all recorded crime has now fallen to 24%. The detection rate for violent crime, which is much higher than that for burglary and car crime, fell by four points in the last year alone, the culprit being found in just 55% of cases.  <P>While the killer is still being caught in 90% of murder cases, the clear up rate for robbery has fallen to only 18%, just ahead of the 12% detection rate for burglaries.  <P>The crime figures also show an 11% rise in the number of   homicides, from 765 to 850, with most of the increase accounted for by the deaths of 58 Chinese migrants in a container lorry at Dover.  <P>They also show a further sharp reduction in the number of people arrested for possession of drugs, mainly cannabis, which have fallen from 112,000 arrests in 1998-99 to 92,700 in 2000-01.  <P>Home Office statisticians believe this is due to a decline in the use of stop and search rather than a change in national policy on charging minor drug offenders.<!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/4224254|2013-09-30T11:53:21Z|40a41acbcfb6e6a4d406ff0c2f174f0cc969a224 -->",

        "body":"Police were yesterday investigating the shooting of a woman in a busy Manchester street during an apparently bungled robbery. <P>Janet Scott, 41, was hit in the leg as she and her husband, David, 62, were standing by a jewellers' shop in Manchester city centre at 12pm.  <P>It is thought a gun dropped from a man's jacket and went off accidentally. The man then ran away down the street.  <P>Mrs Scott was taken to hospital where she was said to be in a stable condition last night.  <P>A Greater Manchester police officer described it as a bizarre incident, which was very unusual for Manchester where gun crime was on the decrease.  <P>The shooting came as the Home Office released figures showing that crime cost &#163;36.2bn last year in England and Wales, with just over half - &#163;18.3bn - put down to the \"physical and emotional impact\" on victims.  <P>The statistics also revealed that the NHS spent &#163;2.4bn of its &#163;63bn budget dealing with injured victims in 2003/04.  <P>Another &#163;4.3bn went in lost output, and just over &#163;7bn was spent by the criminal justice system.  <P>Murder was the most expensive crime, with each homicide costing &#163;1.5m. Sexual offences cost &#163;31,400 each, serious woundings &#163;21,400 and robberies &#163;7,300. Burglary was found to cost the victim and society &#163;3,300.   <P>The Home Office also published statistics estimating that 14.7m crimes were committed against children and adults in England and Wales in 2003/04.  <P>That was two-and-a-half times the total number of crimes recorded for the same period, and three million more than estimates in the latest British Crime Survey.  <P>Alcohol was once again revealed to be a significant factor in criminal behaviour. Half of all violent attackers had been drinking, compared with 40% in 1996. The proportion of violent attacks committed by a stranger under the influence of alcohol was 62%, compared with 55% in 1996.  <P>Both sets of statistics exclude crimes committed against companies and the public sector.  <P>Separate research, also published yesterday, showed confidence in the criminal justice system was low.  <P>A survey found that 76% were not confident that the system was effective in dealing with young people accused of crime, 68% did not believe it met the needs of victims, while 65% said it was not effective in reducing crime. Asked whether they thought cases were dealt with promptly and effectively, 62% said no, while 59% said offenders were not brought to justice.  <P>But 77% said the system respected the rights of people accused of crime, and 75% felt that court sentences were too lenient.<!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/5228883|2013-09-30T11:53:21Z|17c2870ade2544611e90f7b630f4c2189ccd6a37 -->",
