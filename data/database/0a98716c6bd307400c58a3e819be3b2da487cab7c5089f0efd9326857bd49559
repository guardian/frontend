(Is he the buy of the summer so far?) Only three Arsenal players remain from yesterday’s hammering of Benfica and they are Chambers, Ramsey and Monreal. Debuchy will take the right-back slot and Chambers will play in the centre of defence. As for AS Monaco, the big news is that <strike> Real Madrid’s </strike> Radamel Falcao is a starter after recovering from the knee-ouch that kept him out of the wonderful World Cup. Those teams in full then are as follows:<br /><strong>Arsenal: </strong>Szczesny, Debuchy, Chambers, Koscielny, Monreal, Arteta, Ramsey, Wilshere, Cazorla, Sanchez, Giroud. <strong>Subs: </strong>Oxlade-Chamberlain, Flamini, Coquelin, Zelalem, Akpom, Bellerín, Hayden, Martinez, Miquel.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Monaco:</strong> Subasic, Dirar, Carvalho, Raggi, Elderon, Bakayoko, Kondogbia, Ferreira-Carrasco, Moutinho, Ocampos, Falcao. <strong>Subs: </strong>Fabinho, Kurzawa, Abdennour, Berbatov, Germain, Isimat-Mirin, Martial, Toulalan, Bahamboula, Caillard.</p> <p><strong>The man in the middle hoping for a stress free day:</strong> Martin Atkinson (En-ger-land!) </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-03T15:52:15.609+01:00\">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53de23f6e4b0a2344ae6ef61\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-03T15:20:07.623+01:00\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good afternoon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Summertime and the living is easy.</strong> Fish are jumping. The cotton is high. At precisely 1:47 in the AM the people who live below you are blasting music and talking loudly out their back garden and you have to scream and curse at them like a madman just to get them to keep it down. The next morning the sun beats down harder than a jail fight and you wake up in a hot, sticky mess. The shut-eye you managed to nab in between the music and talking and sing-along to Hey Jude is not enough. (On a side note, Hey Jude is the second worst Beatles song – think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJhcGepfG04\">we all know what the worst is</a>.) You go outside to the park for relief but the sun follows you and the wind, an ever present force in spring, autumn an winter, has taken the summer off. You go the pool for relief but there are too many brats and too many people swimming in expensive sunglasses. (Sunglasses! Who swims in sunglasses?) Ah yes, we all love summer and what it brings, not least the <strike> absolutely meaningless games that falsely inflate fans’ hopes and have no bearing whatsoever on the the season to come </strike> friendlies. Speaking of which, today we are serving Arsenal versus Monaco. Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! Team news is on its way. Huzzah! Huzzah!
