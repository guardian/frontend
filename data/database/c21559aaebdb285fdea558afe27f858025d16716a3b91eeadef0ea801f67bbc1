</video><h2><strong>The winner</strong><br /></h2><p>Thanks to Wednesday/Thursday previews totalling just over £1m, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155968/kick-ass-2\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass 2</a> lands at the top of the UK box-office chart with takings of £2.48m. It's the fifth chart-topper of 2013 for the distributor Universal, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150107/miserables\" title=\"\">Les Misérables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/133030/oblivion\" title=\"\">Oblivion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155252\" title=\"\">Fast &amp; Furious 6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/155771/despicable-me-2\" title=\"\">Despicable Me 2</a>.</p><p></p><p>While Universal and the production companies – Matthew Vaughn's Marv and Brad Pitt's Plan B – will be happy with the chart placing, closer consideration of the data yields less for them to celebrate. The original Kick-Ass debuted with £3.88m, including extensive previews of £2.05m, on its way to an £11.77m total. While you wouldn't always expect a sequel to match the total box-office of the original, you would certainly anticipate a relatively strong opening, since the film should inherit an engaged and motivated audience from its predecessor. Kick-Ass achieved a final total 6.4 times its three-day (Friday-to-Sunday) opening of £1.83m. It's a rare sequel that manages a multiple at that level.</p><h2><strong>The real winner</strong></h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-415028884\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/14/130814Planes-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/14/130814Planes_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/14/130814Planes_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/8/14/130814Planes/130814Planes.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/8/14/130814Planes-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />Ignoring previews, the real winner at the weekend is the Disney animation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156154/planes\" title=\"\">Planes</a>, with £1.74m. That's by no means among the top debuts for animations this year – well behind Despicable Me 2, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151435/croods\" title=\"\">The Croods</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150381/wreck-it-ralph\" title=\"\">Wreck-It Ralph</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/155588/monsters-university\" title=\"\">Monsters University</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155263/epic\" title=\"\">Epic</a> – but perfectly fine for a little-heralded family pic that's arriving as a bonus offering at the fag end of the summer movie season.</p><p>In this year's animation league table, Monsters University (£26.3m) is now just behind The Croods (£26.4m) and ahead of Wreck-It Ralph (£23.8m). Of course, all those titles are trailing far behind Despicable Me 2, which, with £42.7m, is the biggest UK box-office hit of 2013 so far. Monsters University opened with a lacklustre £3.46m, and has already achieved 7.6 times its debut. Among wide releases, that's likely to be one of the biggest multiples-of-debut for the year.</p><h2><strong>The action hit</strong></h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-415205420\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/16/130816Cutdown2Guns-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/8/16/130816Cutdown2Guns-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/16/130816Cutdown2Guns_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/16/130816Cutdown2Guns_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/8/16/130816Cutdown2Guns_vpx.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />With a solid £1.42m, the action thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156151/2-guns\" title=\"\">2 Guns</a> manages a respectable third place, trading on the appeal of Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington in a zingy, spritely alternative to the summer's bloated CGI blockbusters. Wahlberg's last film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150235/broken-city\" title=\"\">Broken City</a>, debuted with a disappointing £499,000 back in March, its political-corruption storyline failing to connect with broader audiences. A more apt Wahlberg comparison is the heist flick <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145687/contrabrand\" title=\"\">Contraband</a>, from 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormákur, which kicked off with £684,000 back in March 2012. That film lacked a co-star of equivalent weight to Washington, whose last actioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146043/safe-house\" title=\"\">Safe House</a>, began its run in February 2012 with £2.14m. Awards-bait <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149497/flight\" title=\"\">Flight</a> followed this February with a debut of £1.40m.</p><h2><strong>The scrum</strong></h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-414638866\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/8/TGFS130809AlphaPapa-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/8/8/TGFS130809AlphaPapa-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/8/TGFS130809AlphaPapa_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/8/8/TGFS130809AlphaPapa/TGFS130809AlphaPapa.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/8/TGFS130809AlphaPapa_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />Although not quite as clustered as the previous frame – which saw 11 films exceed £900,000 and none above £2.2m – the weekend again witnessed one of the least polarised box-office charts of recent years. The top title, Kick-Ass 2, grossed just 3.2 times the film in 10th place. Throughout July, despite no chart topper exceeding £5m, we witnessed multiples of the 10th-placed film as follows: x81; x45; x38; x60. Those numbers are much more typical of the kind of polarity experienced at the UK box-office – the exception being awards season, when the top film is more likely to gross around 10 times the 10th-placed film.</p><p>At the weekend, seven films achieved sums in the £750,000 to £1m range, meaning that Disney's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156526/lone-ranger\" title=\"\">The Lone Ranger</a> finds itself out of the top 10 with £754,000, not so very far behind fifth-placed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156145/the-conjuring\" title=\"\">The Conjuring</a> (£973,000) in cash terms. Cinema bookers will have a tough time accommodating all these releases that are faring averagely well, a challenge that becomes trickier with the arrival this week of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156639/mortal-instruments\" title=\"\">The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156629/elysium\" title=\"\">Elysium</a>. Expect more titles than ever to be scrunched into shared screens and reduced showtimes.</p><h2><strong>The special event</strong></h2><p>Not included in the weekend's figures for two very good reasons – live events are not tracked, and it occurred on a weekday – is <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/david-bowie-is-happening-now-a-live-nationwide-cinema-event/\" title=\"\">David Bowie is Happening Now</a>, beamed live last week from London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. So-called alternative content is a flourishing sector in cinemas, especially for opera, ballet, theatre and classical music, and this summer we've seen big numbers for Helen Mirren in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/19/audience-queen-helen-mirren-national-theatre-live\" title=\"\">National Theatre's The Audience</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/17/kenneth-branagh-live-q-and-a\" title=\"\">Kenneth Branagh in the Manchester International Festival's Macbeth</a> and Dutch violinist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/09/pass-notes-andre-rieu\" title=\"\">André Rieu</a>. But live relays of a museum exhibition are a relatively novel phenomenon.</p><p>Last Tuesday evening's Bowie event grossed £260,600 from 217 screens, says distributor Picturehouse, with sellouts in 42 venues. Encore screenings at 27 venues contributed a further £30,700, for a combined total of £291,300. The big four circuit chains – Odeon, Cineworld, Vue and Showcase – all participated, as did Picturehouse and independents. The result will inspire the big UK museums and galleries to explore the potential for their blockbuster shows, creating a live event capable of drawing a national cinema audience. David Bowie Is Happening Now was directed by Hamish Hamilton, who directed the live TV coverage for the Olympics' opening and closing ceremonies, and included live testimony from the exhibition's curators and other experts.</p><h2><strong>The future</strong></h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-415411314\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace_vpx.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace/130820LoveLace.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/8/20/130820LoveLace-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />With no film opening above £2.5m, overall the market is 15% down on the previous weekend and 22% down on the equivalent frame from 2012, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a> expanded into English cinemas and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a> landed in second place.</p><p>Cinema owners will be hoping for better from this week's new crop of films, which include the young adult fiction adaptation The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, Neill Blomkamp's Matt Damon vehicle Elysium, the hit US comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/aug/15/were-the-millers-trailer-jennifer-aniston-video\" title=\"\">We're The Millers</a>, Jurassic Park 3D, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156157/lovelace\" title=\"\">Lovelace</a>, starring Amanda Seyfried as the porn actress Linda Lovelace.

Click here to view video</a></p><p>I thought that by the time there was a sequel to <em>Kick-Ass</em>, the distasteful 2010 ersatz British version of an American superhero movie, I'd be sitting in my slippers before the glowing embers of a wintry fire reading PG&nbsp;Wodehouse. But I'm still here, just, and it's arrived with another tale of teenage New Yorkers in masks and elaborately designed leotards doing battle with monstrous villains. Chloë Grace Moretz's purple-haired Hit Girl is now 15, as violent and foul-mouthed as ever, and she's training a fellow high school pupil to take over as Kick-Ass and take on the demented Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the former Red Mist who's donned his late mother's bondage gear to become Motherfucker.</p><p>As befits its source in a graphic novel, the violence is graphic as heads and arms are severed and dogs and sharks let loose on crotches. An especially dubious scene has Motherfucker suffer temporary impotence as he's about to initiate the gang rape of a high school avenger called Night Bitch. Hit Girl, the sensitive heroine, can apparently say anything: \"Game's on, cocksuckers!\" for instance. But the film-makers recoil from having her speak the truly obscene climactic lines after she kills off the red-leather bikini-clad villainess Mother Russia by stabbing her all over with shards of glass. They're printed on the screen in a comic-strip balloon. Now that's what passes for good taste in a movie that resembles <em>Bugsy Malone</em> with real weapons.</p>","headline":"Kick-Ass 2 – review","trailText":"<p>Graphic violence and foul language remain the calling cards for this superhero sequel, writes <strong>Philip French</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/8/15/1376578491080/2013-KICK-ASS-2-005.jpg","wordcount":"244","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"415113621","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7956419","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Philip French","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-08-18T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1951405","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-08T12:06:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/18/kick-ass-2-philip-french","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2013/aug/18/kick-ass-2-philip-french","tags":[{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/jimcarrey","webTitle":"Jim Carrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jimcarrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/jimcarrey","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/philipfrench","webTitle":"Philip French","rcsId":"GNL110437","r2ContributorId":"16284","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/philip_french_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philipfrench","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/philipfrench","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"film/kick-ass","webTitle":"Kick-Ass","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kick-ass","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/kick-ass","references":[]},{"id":"film/kick-ass-2","webTitle":"Kick-Ass 2","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kick-ass-2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/kick-ass-2","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-415215123","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/8/15/1376578491080/2013-KICK-ASS-2-005.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","photographer":"Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES","altText":"2013, KICK-ASS 2","height":"84","credit":"Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","caption":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass 2: 'as violent and foul-mouthed as ever'.

screen, the creation of graphic novelist Mark Millar. It was a brilliant and brazen black-comic fantasy about a shy teen trying to make it as an actual crime fighter. Goldman and Vaughn ignited a new spirit of punk rock in the world of masks and capes. They challenged the placid superhero supergroups, and for my money revived the authentic teen romance and teen pathos of comic-book escapism. Now an enjoyable, though less daring and more conventional sequel has reunited the two young stars of that bizarre and&nbsp;bizarrely thrilling escapade: Dave&nbsp;Lizewski, Kick-Ass himself (Aaron&nbsp;Taylor-Johnson) is painfully readjusting to civilian existence in high school, and the newly orphaned Mindy, or Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz)&nbsp;is trying to maintain her superhero vocation while dealing with&nbsp;adolescence.</p><p>Meanwhile, obnoxious rich kid and wannabe superhero Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), formerly known as Red Mist, has decided that his real destiny is to be a supervillain, and after rummaging through his late mother's more recherché outfits, puts together a leathery costume, calls himself the Motherfucker, and leaves the Freudian associations unexamined. His utter evilness is clinched when he reveals himself to be on Twitter, with more than 1,000 followers.</p><p>This second Kick-Ass is now directed by Jeff Wadlow (who made the mixed martial-arts drama Never Back Down), with Vaughn and Goldman credited as producers; it delivers less in the way of boot-buttock contact. The showdown of superheroes v supervillains is less interesting, and it is disappointing that Kick-Ass agrees to take second-fiddle status to a new homemade hero, Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), whose role is underwritten and amounts to hardly more than an extended cameo. When the C-bomb was dropped in the first movie, it was a delicious and insolent provocation, designed to trigger moral panic and high sub-collar temperatures in pundits everywhere. Now it sounds a bit lame.</p><p>But there's one really good thing about this film, and that is Chloë Moretz's Hit-Girl. She shows herself to be still the most stylish superhero around. Body-doubled or not, Moretz's martial-arts scenes look terrifically good, and she is coolly assured in every scene she is in, pinching the camera's attention without effort from Taylor-Johnson, although he, too, is likable and relaxed. For me, Hit-Girl kicks the ass of the superhero world's overdog males. She gets gold; Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man is silver and Christian Bale's Dark Knight is bronze, with Henry Cavill's Man of Steel not medalling.</p><p>Hit-Girl's high-school storyline is the most interesting thing in the film. If only the whole thing could have been about Mindy and her new dilemma. As she enters high school at the age of 15, Hit-Girl finds that despite her warrior skills and physical strength growing gloriously in training with every passing day, she is under pressure to abandon everything and be a normal, simpering teenager interested only in clothes and boys. That was what she promised her dad, and what she now has to promise her new guardian, Marcus (Morris Chestnut). So she submits, in classic teen-movie style, to being a geeky makeover \"project\" for a manipulative clique of mean-girl queen bees, led by the chilling Brooke (Claudia Lee). When&nbsp;she was 11, Hit-Girl could take on everyone, but now teenagerdom and social norms have made her weak and pathetic, while secretly boiling with frustration. It makes for a sharp and entertaining social satire. And the scene where Mindy is taken on a date by some smirking jock left a residue of unease with me. I realised, hours after the film ended, what it had reminded me of: Gretchen Mol's innocent and trusting young woman in The Notorious Bettie Page (2005) getting asked in the street to get in a car to go on a \"date\" with a guy she'd never met before.</p><p>Kick-Ass 2 has some of the original's&nbsp;chutzpah: Iain Glen has a simmering cameo as an imprisoned gangster, and fans of magician and actor Andy Nyman will savour his appearance as a bad guy insidiously named the Tumor. The Motherfucker keeps cheekily saying that he is the \"first supervillain\", thus mightily dissing all those supervillains who have come before him in their own fictional worlds, although he strikes a false note in claiming: \"My superpower is that I am rich as shit,\" when that has long been a very commonplace thing to say about Bruce Wayne.</p><p>It's a moderate follow-up to the first exhilarating adventure. If there is to be another episode, it must surely be a Wolverine-style solo outing for Chloë Moretz's Hit-Girl. She is the real star.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/10/chloe-motetz-kick-ass-2\">• Can't get enough of Hit-Girl?

The action comedy – about a dorky teen who re-models himself as the titular crime-fighter – tackled the blockbusting phoniness of most comic book adaptations head on. There was gore, there was death, there were swearwords. There was a starring role for a Chloë Grace Moretz's Hit Girl, an 11-year old assassin with a taste for blood and a knack for profanity. Honour and justice were bustled into the background.  The pomposity of the classic superhero story was given a beating. Put bluntly, Hit Girl would have no problem squaring up to the Wolverine, the Man of Steel and the Avengers and calling them the c-word. </p><p>Kick-Ass 2 – handed to writer/director Jeff Wadlow by Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman – is significantly less confident and less brazen. It's a have-a-go affair that tries out the same blend of red-blooded action and salty-blue humour, but serves mainly to bolster the bravery of the original. </p><p>It's four years since Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Hit Girl defeated drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). Hit Girl is taking time out to try being a normal teenager. Kick-Ass has hooked up with Justice Forever, an amateur heroics society led by reformed gangster Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Meanwhile D'Amico's orphaned son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is acting out – he's splashing cash on recruiting a gang of supervillains to takedown Kick-Ass. His superpower is money. His costume is his mum's bondage gear. His alias? The Motherfucker. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-415119477'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/8/13/1376392068440/Aaron-Taylor-Johnson-and--010.jpg' alt='Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloë Grace Moretz as Kick-Ass and Hit Girl in Kick-Ass 2. Photograph: Universal</figcaption></figure><p> The setup sounds as delightfully silly as Goldman and Vaughn's original, but Wadlow's script lacks the pair's confidence in following its funniest ideas through. Hit Girl attempts to befriend her high school's queen bee and suffers her first experience of back-stabbing that's wholly figurative. But this intriguing fish out of water element - Easy A v Kill Bill! - is allowed to wander into melancholic life lessons about the nature of difference and the triumph in being yourself. Self-doubt has run riot in the Batman, Superman and X-men franchises of late. You'd expect more from a tween trained by her daddy to take bullets to the chest before home-time. </p><p>The tone fits a lot of the cast as awkwardly as a homemade costume, but Jim Carrey as vigilante good guy Colonel Stars and Stripes wears it well. He's a snarl-lipped born again Christian with a dog called Eisenhower and a cudgel painted with the American flag. Carrey's experienced in wobbling along the line between comedy and melancholy. Ironically - given his condemnation of this same film's violence in June this year - he's believably beefy in the fight scenes too. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-415119476'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/24/1372077101063/Jim-Carrey-in-Kick-ass-2-010.jpg' alt='Jim Carrey in Kick-ass 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes in Kick-Ass 2. Photograph: Universal</figcaption></figure><p> And Carrey might have had a point. Kick-Ass 2's violence is no more brutal than the original's, but by attempting to lock the action into the drama of real-life, Wadlow inadvertently adds a layer of grit that makes the carnage less comic and more distasteful. \"This is not a comic book\", says Kick-Ass. \"Real people are going to die tonight\". But if it's real, it's horrific. There's a difference between a self-deluding egotist like The Motherfucker being violently offensive (\"He's little and he kills – we'll call him Tumour\") and Hit Girl - mid-battle - attempting the same thing (\"I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass and cut your hands off\"). </p><p>From the earnest discussions on self-belief to the glorified bloody fight scenes, the real world hits a little too heavy in Wadlow's spirited, but misguided sequel. And the film hits back in turn. After the screening, a promotional poster for the film hangs outside in the foyer. \"Kick-Ass 2 … Jim Carrey is Colonel Stars and Stripes\", reads the banner. \"Aaron Johnson is Kick-Ass\" \"Christopher Mintz-Plasse is ____________\", with The Motherfucker's name blacked out for decency's sake. Out of the cinema, the joke's inappropriate. The tone's too rough to be funny. Kick-Ass 2 suffers from being a little too real.</p>","headline":"Kick-Ass 2 – first look review","trailText":"<p>Hit Girl and Kick-Ass are back, Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman are not.

She was the child actor who, aged just 11, not only played an ultraviolent pre-teen killer called Hit-Girl in 2010's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135252/kick-ass\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass</a>, but sent shockwaves rippling through the moralistic media with her casual deployment of the word \"cunt\". It's difficult to imagine most 11-year-olds uttering the word and living till teatime, let alone having to deal with an onslaught of public scrutiny; the Daily Mail, typically, claimed the film had a \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1262948/Kick-Ass-Dont-fooled-hype--This-crime-cinema-twisted-cynical-revels-abuse-childhood.html\" title=\"\">perniciously sexualised</a> view of children\", while this paper simply suggested she had brought the word's \"noble history\" to a close.</p><p>\"Really? That's so funny!\" says Moretz. \"I mean, cunt is a funny word. It's a strong word, sure, but more so in America. In England it's just like any other curse word. Anyway, I said it in one take; it wasn't like I was going to go around saying it all over, you know? There's no cursing in my household, but I knew what it meant to make a movie.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The furore has given Moretz, who has starred in no less than 30 films since she was eight, the ammo to take on that other C-word: controversy. There's just as much surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155968/kick-ass-2\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass 2</a>: in June, her new co-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jimcarrey\" title=\"\">Jim Carrey</a> vocally withdrew his support from the sequel due to its \"level of violence\", a bizarre move, considering that his character, Colonel Stars And Stripes, allows his dog to chew off the nads of an enemy, and that, presumably, he'd not said his lines with earmuffs on.&nbsp;</p><p>Moretz, however, accompanied by neither overzealous publicist nor parent, is ready for the question. \"I'm not allowed to talk about that,\" she says firmly, with a beautifully neutral smile and only the merest hint of an eye roll, although she does reject the argument that societal violence can be blamed on cinematic villains. \"Like the guy who shot up that movie theatre because of Batman? It's a cop out. But you know... that's Batman. There's been a bunch of different Batman actors. Kick-Ass hasn't got such a long history, so they blame the actors because we're the ones who brought it to life. I think Hit-Girl is the victim. She doesn't know if she's a vigilante or a villain. She never had a childhood.\" &nbsp;</p><p>Chloë's own childhood has been jaw-droppingly busy. Onscreen since the age of six, she's clocked up an impressive range of disturbed supporting roles: a vampire in <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Let Me In</a>, a werewolf in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146520/dark-shadows\" title=\"\">Dark Shadows</a>, and an unforgettable turn as the scheming heiress who gave Alec Baldwin a run for his money in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/30-rock\" title=\"\">30 Rock</a>. In the three years since&nbsp;she swore her way to international notoriety in Kick-Ass, she's worked with some of Hollywood's finest, including Scorsese and Burton, and starred alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\" title=\"\">Johnny Depp</a> in last year's Dark Shadows. \"Oh my God, I was such an idiot,\" she says. \"He's the coolest guy and he just sort of swaggers in and I didn't know what to say, so I was like, 'I love your necklaces!' and then immediately, inwardly, I was like, 'I am such an idiot, why did I say that?'\"</p><p>You'd imagine such \"I carried a watermelon\" moments are few and far between for the Georgia-born Moretz, whose self-possession would be genuinely intimidating if she weren't quite so charming. Her Kick-Ass co-star, Nicolas Cage, called her \"marvellously charismatic\", and she has a luminosity reminiscent of a young <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jodie-foster\" title=\"\">Jodie Foster</a>. Like Foster, Moretz is currently filming a role (in The Equalizer opposite Denzel Washington) that could be considered a classic coming-of-age turn for the prodigious child actress: the teenage prostitute. It's either the next logical step or a depressingly familiar Hollywood move, depending on your point of view. The sudden sexualisation of Moretz on film has the potential to upset a few people.</p><p>\"When you do a lot of kid movies, that can be a problem. You were a little sister type, and then all of a sudden you're a prostitute, and people don't like it,\" she muses. \"Unless, like Jodie Foster, that's how you start off. And I'm similar because the first time anyone really saw me was in Kick-Ass, killing people. So I don't think I'll have that kind of trouble. I guess maybe we veer towards darker roles because we want to stretch ourselves. I'm a well-rounded girl from a normal family; I'm not a psychopath. So it's fun to be those characters that have all these dark undertones, because it's just acting. Otherwise I'm just playing myself, and I do that every day.\"</p><h2>'I do want to push the boundaries, try stupid trends and all that experimental stuff that teenagers do. But I don't want to mess up'</h2><p>While she will not accept Hit-Girl as a role model, Moretz clearly understands that she herself might be, and rises to the challenge.  Any interview with a successful teenage actor comes with a sense of foreboding for their subsequent public decline, but there's not a whiff of it on Moretz, who is as erudite and eloquent as she is breathlessly teenage (\"I'm reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/aug/07/review-school-for-good-evil-soman-chainani\" title=\"\">The School For Good And Evil</a>. It's about witches. Don't you just love witches?\"). She's certain there will be no driving backwards drunk down a motorway, no belligerent Twitter gibberish, no sticky-fingered antics under the influence of pharmaceuticals. \"I've never even been to a club,\" she says, unimpressed by the idea. \"I do want to push the boundaries, try stupid trends and all that experimental stuff that teenagers do. But I don't want to mess up.\" Her career is something she takes very seriously, and she has stringent plans: \"I love <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman\" title=\"\">Natalie Portman</a>. Her whole career from the start till now has been so brilliant and so well-paced. She's always been in control. I think she's perfect in the press.\"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given her maturity, Moretz says she rarely gets patronised by her co-workers, who in fact tend to regard her as a useful confidante. \"I work with a lot of older actors and they all seem to want to talk to me about their marital problems,\" she says. \"And I'm always like, 'Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry!' I mean, my mom and dad got divorced; I've been through a lot at a young age so I'm good at conversing at length about it. It's definitely weird, but I don't find it inappropriate. It's just funny to be discussing it when I haven't ever been in a relationship.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Moretz is wary of growing up too soon, and it's a relief that she turns up for our interview not in an Erdem dress but in a T-shirt inscribed with the words \"Boys\" in glitter. Like most teens, she fancies a gap year in south-east Asia and she's prolific on <a href=\"http://instagram.com/cmoretz/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>: \"God, I know. I kinda just forget I have, like, 500,000 followers! I post all my personal photos but I think they're just for my friends. I'm terrible.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Moretz is currently home-educated, but she was able to relate to the school scenes in Kick-Ass 2, when the seemingly unflappable Hit-Girl is finally shaken by the cliques and mean-girl bullying. She is also fresh from filming a new version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81489/carrie\" title=\"\">Carrie</a>, the notorious Stephen King novel about teenage angst taken to the ultimate bloody extreme. \"Well, I have some experience in that area; I was bullied by my teachers,\" she says, still indignant. \"Can you believe that? This math teacher gave me an F because she said I smiled too much. And I'm great at math! I think they just found it weird that I wanted to act, you know?\"</p><p>We talk a little about stardom, image and fashion. Moretz has become a style icon, loved as much by her young fans for her look as for her films, and she recently graced the covers of Teen Vogue, In Style, W and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2314911/Chloe-Moretz-insists-wont-ruin-career-drink-drugs-gets-punky-photoshoot.html\" title=\"\">Nylon</a>. But it's been clear from the moment we met that this has always been about film, never fame. \"Breakfast At Tiffany's was the moment when I really realised why I wanted to be an actor,\" she recalls. \"I saw what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/20/audrey-hepburn-breakfast-at-tiffanys\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn</a> does on screen, how when you watch her face she makes you happy, she makes you want to be something.\" And is that what she wants? \"I want to be someone's escape,\" she says. \"And it's silly because it is just a movie, but that's what movies need to be. Instead of getting drunk or doing drugs you can go see a movie for an hour and a half and escape and be someone else and live a different life, if only for a little while.\"</p><p><em>Kick-Ass 2 is out in the UK on Wed 14 Aug</em></p>","headline":"Kick-Ass 2 star Chloë Moretz on Carrie, controversy and other C-words","trailText":"<p>She's a film veteran at 16 and has worked with auteurs like Martin Scorsese and Tim Burton.

He discusses the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/aug/02/kick-ass-film-recap-nicolas-cage\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass films</a>, adapted from the comics he authored, with childlike glee. Next week the sequel is released, and this time there are whole armies of costumed cohorts, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1093951/\" title=\"\">Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a>'s eponymous DIY vigilante leading the charge against <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2395586/\" title=\"\">Christopher Mintz-Plasse</a>'s vengeful Red Mist, now reborn as The Motherfucker. It's a big bundle of fun, and with its $28m budget (low compared with its costlier cousins), Millar hopes it will enjoy even greater success than its predecessor, which made $96m in cinemas.</p><p>He brings up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/24/jim-carrey-violence-kick-ass-2-sandy-hook\" title=\"\">Jim Carrey</a> early. The actor plays Colonel Stars and Stripes, a gun-toting patriot amassing a team of superheroes, but recently U-turned on the film, tweeting that he was not ashamed of it but, in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, was withdrawing support due to its \"level of violence\".</p><p>\"You should never give actors Twitter,\" laughs Millar, who says the argument that cinema causes gun crime is \"preposterous\". Kick-Ass 2's violence is indeed brutal, and a sizeable chunk of it is dished out by Carrey himself. His about-turn was sudden; perhaps Carrey did not want to seem hypocritical after months of anti-gun lobbying. \"I think that's exactly what happened. I think he got boxed into a corner,\" says Millar. \"The image that was online prior to this was a photo of him pointing a gun, laughing, with headlines like 'Jim Carrey slams gun violence.' So I think he felt, well, checkmate, and he had to bail on some level.\"</p><p>Last weekend Millar tweeted a doctored photo of Carrey from the film, his gun replaced with flowers. He's enjoying the heat Carrey has generated. \"I went 'Yes!' when I heard it,\" he says, \"because I knew we were gonna get amazing publicity. Universal estimates we get $30m worth of advertising out of it, because it was on Good Morning America and all that stuff. So I think he's weirdly done us a favour. It worked out great.\"</p><p>Millar's profile is also high. Born in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire (he still lives in Glasgow) in 1969, he began on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_%28comics%29\" title=\"\">Britain's 2000AD</a> aged 20, moved to DC Comics, then in 2000 was headhunted by Marvel, where he reinvigorated many of its titles. In 2004 he began creating characters for his own Millarworld company – Kick Ass and Wanted have spawned highly profitable films, and there are more adaptations on the way.</p><p>He's particularly adept at genre subversion. \"I started writing comics for me instead of what I thought an audience was going to like or what a publisher wanted,\" he says of his first hit for DC, The Authority, in 2000. \"My idea was to do a superhero book that was the complete opposite of any superhero book I'd ever seen. It's the philosophy I've applied to everything since, to break new ground instead of 'Green Goblin busts out of prison and Spider Man fights him'. So I wanted to have the two lead superheroes as a gay couple, I wanted them to adopt a baby, I wanted to have a drug-addict superhero, just mix it up a little and throw real life in there.\"</p><p>DC put him on the naughty step after he photocopied an image of the gay superheroes kissing and sent it to the Sunday Times, which ran a story that got picked up internationally. \"I think DC went apeshit because they're owned by Warner Bros and are always terrified of getting fired, and they had a guy who looked like Superman kissing a guy who looked like Batman and I think they just panicked and they wanted me out as soon as possible. And that just goaded me into doing it more. I found myself doing gay sex scenes, or things I knew would piss them off. It was a marriage made in hell, me and DC, because they're so corporate and I enjoy just having a bit of fun with it all.\"</p><p>He was soon poached by Marvel, where he was an immediate success. He revamped The Avengers: much of that work inspired the company's recent cinematic output. It was Millar who made the previously white Nick Fury black, his artist Bryan Hitch drawing him specifically as Samuel L Jackson. The alien shapeshifters in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Joss Whedon's Avengers</a> film, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitauri\" title=\"\">Chituari</a>, came from Millar's comics too – via David Icke. \"It's funny because the Hollywood guys don't know this and I love that,\" he laughs. \"I didn't tell them. I'm a huge David Icke fan and I took the Chitauri from there. I love the fact that it's in a $1.6bn grossing movie and it's straight from David Icke!\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/31/kick-ass-review-film\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass</a>, first published in 2008, was Millar's postmodern spin on Spider-Man, a superhero without superpowers, suffering real consequences. When Matthew Vaughn, who directed the first film (and has produced both) touted the screenplay around, studios either turned it down or suggested changes, such as decreasing the violence and raising the age of the 11-year-old Hit Girl to 25. Vaughn declined and raised the money privately. Still, both films are more feel-good than the comics, with softer edges. For the screen, Kick-Ass 2's downbeat ending has been excised in favour of triumph, and despite Millar previously having said they would make the cut, two of The Motherfucker's grimmest moments are absent. A dog's head being sliced off and placed on top of a fresh human corpse's is gone, as is a gang rape.</p><p>\"Comics and films cross over so much, but there are a couple of things that can feel too much, especially if you've been hit by a relentless barrage of it,\" he says. \"So they had to slightly dilute that stuff, which I agreed with. I'm in all of those meetings and I totally get why that has to happen.\" In terms of the glummer ending, which was shot before being ditched, he says \"there was just a feeling that in 2013 you want to leave a cinema feeling good\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-415120225'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/9/1376023935727/Mark-Millar-010.jpg' alt='Mark Millar' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mark Millar. Photograph: Murdo Macleod</figcaption></figure><p>The grisly cuts are sensible changes, but one suspects diplomacy at play here: in Millar's perfect world, wouldn't the horror remain? \"I think comics are 10 years ahead of everything else,\" he says. \"What you see in films that seems controversial isn't controversial in comics, generally. The comics audience is the most sophisticated audience. People who read tend to be smarter than people who don't read, and the comic book audience is so savvy and smart and switched on. I feel very at home with comic people.\"</p><p>Last September, Fox brought him on board as a creative consultant to oversee its X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, which it bought in the 90s when Marvel was in bad financial straits. Meanwhile, Millar plans to have 20 comic franchises of his own by 2020: \"I'm on number nine. My plan over the next seven years is to get the other 11 done. Stan Lee proved you can create whole universes from your bedroom, and I see that as the challenge.\"</p><p>It's progressing well. Wanted 2 is in the works; Joe Carnahan is adapting Millar's Nemesis; and next month Vaughn is directing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Secret-Service-Mark-Millar/dp/1781165831\" title=\"\">The Secret Service</a>, Millar's book about a London rioter who trains to be a Bond-esque agent. Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L Jackson are starring. Millar has Hollywood eating out of his hand, and in June he was honoured by the Queen for services to literature and drama. The man responsible for The Motherfucker is now an MBE.</p><p>\"That just shows you how fucked we are as a country!\" he laughs. \"When the first Kick-Ass came out I expected a furore about a little girl saying 'cunt', and the violence, and everybody was like, 'What a charming film, I really enjoyed it.' I thought, 'What?! Is this how far we've sunk as a nation?'\" Many would agree. He'd love that.</p>","headline":"Kick-Ass 2: Mark Millar's superhero powers","trailText":"<p>Not only has he managed to bring his comic-book creations to the big screen, the Scottish writer has also won over Hollywood in the process</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"10","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/8/1375972823016/2013-KICK-ASS-2-003.jpg","wordcount":"1345","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"414631178","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7929794","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Alex Godfrey","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-08-09T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1948236","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-11T17:09:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/08/mark-miller-kick-ass","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2013/aug/08/mark-miller-kick-ass","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/superhero-movies","webTitle":"Superhero movies","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/superhero-movies","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/superhero-movies","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alex-godfrey","webTitle":"Alex Godfrey","r2ContributorId":"45534","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-godfrey","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/alex-godfrey","references":[]},{"id":"books/comics","webTitle":"Comics and graphic novels","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/comics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/comics","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"film/kick-ass","webTitle":"Kick-Ass","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kick-ass","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/kick-ass","references":[]},{"id":"film/kick-ass-2","webTitle":"Kick-Ass 2","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kick-ass-2","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/kick-ass-2","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-415120223","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/8/1375972820341/2013-KICK-ASS-2-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","photographer":"Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES","altText":"2013, KICK-ASS 2","height":"54","credit":"Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","caption":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace Moretz in Mark Millar's Kick-Ass 2.

He wrote: \"I did Kick-Ass 2 a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence. My apologies to others involve[d] with the film. I am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart.\"</p><p>Scottish comic-book writer and Kick-Ass 2 executive producer Mark Millar, whose original work forms the basis of the sequel, today <a href=\"http://forums.millarworld.tv/index.php?/topic/103196-jim-carrey-condemns-kick-ass-2-violence/\" title=\"\">responded on his own blog</a>, pointing out that Carrey, who plays a character named Colonel Stars and Stripes, knew exactly what he was letting himself in for.</p><p>\"[I'm] baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture wasn't in the screenplay 18 months ago,\" he wrote. \"Yes, the body count is very high, but a movie called Kick-Ass 2 really has to do what it says on the tin. A sequel to the picture that gave us Hit Girl was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much …</p><p>\"Like Jim, I'm horrified by real-life violence (even though I'm Scottish), but Kick-Ass 2 isn't a documentary. No actors were harmed in the making of this production! This is fiction and like Tarantino and Peckinpah, Scorsese and Eastwood, John Boorman, Oliver Stone and Chan-wook Park, Kick-Ass avoids the usual bloodless bodycount of most big summer pictures and focuses instead of the CONSEQUENCES of violence … Our job as storytellers is to entertain and our toolbox can't be sabotaged by curtailing the use of guns in an action movie.\"</p><p>Kick-Ass 2, which stars Aaron Johnson-Taylor in the title role and sees the return of Chloë Grace Moretz as teen vigilante Hit Girl, is the sequel to 2010's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135252/kick-ass\" title=\"\">Kick-Ass</a>, itself a target for conservative condemnation over violence and the then 12-year-old Moretz's startlingly potty-mouthed turn. Carrey is the most high-profile addition to the cast for the sequel, but his comments are likely to boost rather than damage the film at the box office, just as the furore around Moretz's use of the C-word did little to damage interest in the original movie.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411465861'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2013/6/24/1372071317219/Taking-aim---Jim-Carrey-a-010.jpg' alt='Taking aim … Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes in Kick-Ass 2.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Taking aim … Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes in Kick-Ass 2.
