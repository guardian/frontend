on the Greek Macedonia border on March 17, 2016 in Idomeni, Greece. Many of the thousands of migrants stranded at the border camp are saying they are awaiting the outcome of the EU summit currently being held in Brussels. The decision by Macedonia to close its border to migrants last week has left thousands of people stranded at the Greek transit camp. The closure, following the lead taken by neighbouring countries, has effectively sealed the so-called western Balkan route, the main migration route that has been used by hundreds of thousands of migrants to reach countries in western Europe such as Germany. Humanitarian workers have described the conditions at the camp as desperate, which has been made much worse by recent spells of heavy rain.
