        "body":"<p><strong>Hello, Mr Bennett, sir. Tony feels insufficiently reverential. What do people call you? </strong></p><p>Tony.</p><p><strong>How was China? <a href=\"#1\">(1)</a></strong></p><p>Oh, I loved it. It was so different, so educational. In Singapore, for instance, as the plane lands they say, \"If you're coming into this country with any drugs, the penalty is death.\"</p><p><strong>That's a pretty stern warning.</strong></p><p>Well, I think it [legalising of drugs] should be done everywhere. It eliminates the underworld.</p><p><strong>If they had been legal in the 70s, would that have affected your experiences with drugs? <a href=\"#2\">(2)</a></strong></p><p>As a young boy I did a lot of foolish things. I made a lot of mistakes. And you live and learn. I'm very content now. I'm just being a normal human being.</p><p><strong>It's been 50 years since you won your first Grammy, for </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZzEXhlhfg\" title=\"\"><strong>I Left My Heart in San Francisco</strong></a><strong>. Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles were there at the ceremony …</strong></p><p>That was one of the first times the Grammys were on - since then I've received 17 Grammys. I love it because it's the only time the music world has a convention, and you meet everyone that you know and love.</p><p><strong>You must have mixed with them all.</strong></p><p>I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles and I still can't believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another, they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable.</p><p><strong>Did any of them do anything in your home that you've had to keep secret?</strong></p><p>No. But once Dean Martin was in his home, having this mad party, and he was trying to study his lines for a television show so he called up the police and said: \"I'm Dean Martin's neighbour and there's too much noise coming from his house. Have the police come and slow down the party.\" And the police came and broke the party up and he got rid of everybody in the house.</p><p><strong>Someone once wrote: \"Sinatra was hip, but Tony was cool.\"</strong></p><p>I never heard that. I thought he was pretty cool. He was 10 years older than I was and he was my idol and when he announced that I was his favourite singer, it made all of his fans come and check me out. I've been sold out ever since.</p><p><strong>Were you nervous when you first met him?</strong></p><p>Yeah. I respected him so much. I respected Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Those were my heroes, and they were 10 years older than I was. To this day I can't believe I got to meet Ella personally, Nat Cole was a great friend, and Sinatra endorsed me throughout his whole life.</p><p><strong>In terms of the development of 20th-century music: Sinatra or Presley?</strong></p><p>You can't compare them. Presley is country music, white music. Jazz is black music – it was invented by the blacks in New Orleans. And I'm really a jazz singer. I was impressed with Elvis – he was the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person, too. But the music doesn't impress me.</p><p><strong>How does Amy Winehouse <a href=\"#3\">(3)</a> compare to the Ellas and Lena Hornes and Billie Holidays?</strong></p><p>You can't compare, but she was an authentic jazz singer, which is tremendous because jazz has been underrated. There's still so much bigotry.</p><p><strong>You were once invited to go and sing in Harlem with Billie Holiday, but didn't go ... </strong>It was one night when she asked me to come up and sing with her and I was with a group of people at a table and they looked at me as if to say: \"Don't go up to Harlem, it's not safe there.\" And it was very bigoted. I regret it to this day that I didn't go.</p><p><strong>Is it true you were so moved by Charlie Parker the first time you saw him play live, you threw up?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I regurgitated. It was so phenomenal, so emphatic … It was more music than I ever heard anyone play at one time. I just couldn't believe how great it was.</p><p><strong>Do you think subsequent generations might have had that response to Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain?</strong></p><p>It's a different thing. You have to understand, Charlie Parker, that music lasts forever. It's like Louis Armstrong – some of the records he made with different orchestras, the orchestras sound old-fashioned but Louis sounds like today, right now. Classical trumpet players in symphonic orchestras would listen to him and say, \"How did he do that?\" and try to learn how to play like him.</p><p><strong>Who else has had that effect?</strong></p><p>As an entertainer, I think Jimmy Durante <strong> <a href=\"#4\">(4)</a></strong>. He was better than anybody. He tried to make people feel good. I like that. I could have retired 20 years ago, but I didn't because I like to make people feel good.</p><p><strong>For a fun night out, Judy Garland or Lady Gaga?</strong></p><p>Both of them are good. Lady Gaga is the Picasso of the entertainment world. She's very intelligent.</p><p>You're known as a natty dresser. But do you ever pop out in jeans and an old cardie?</p><p>I was honoured last year as the Best Dressed Man in Britain <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5)</a></strong>. It was quite a compliment. I have relaxed clothes, but people don't see me in them. <a href=\"https://tonybennett.com/benedetto_arts.php\" title=\"\">I'm a painter</a>, I have a studio and it can be messy so I wear a smock.</p><p><strong>If you went out for a pint of milk in that smock probably nobody would recognise you.</strong></p><p>I wouldn't do that. People who do that are ridiculous. My mum taught me as a child, even though we were very poor, she said: \"Put on a nice clean white shirt and nice black pants and you'll be OK.\"</p><p><strong>Which would be more painful to give up: singing or painting?</strong></p><p>Both of them. If something happened with me physically, I would still love to spend the rest of my life painting. I've never worked a day in my life. People don't believe that but it's true. I love what I'm doing because I'm doing the two things I love. I never felt in my whole life like, \"I don't feel like doing that today.\" I wake up and I can't wait to paint and I can't wait to learn something about music.</p><p><strong>How many presidents have  you met?</strong></p><p>I think about 13. No, 10. I didn't sing for Nixon, I was in Europe at the time and had to pass on the invitation.</p><p><strong>Who was the most impressive?</strong></p><p>President Clinton. You could walk up to him with your hands in your pocket and say, \"Hi, Bill.\"You don't say \"Mr President\", you don't bow. He's a regular person.</p><p><strong>You once described your experience in the second world war as \"a front seat in hell\". </strong></p><p>It's legalised murder. I'm anti-war.. Life is more beautiful than that. Guys who create wars should get their hands slapped.</p><p><strong>Did you have a difficult childhood?</strong></p><p>Yeah, we grew up during the Depression. My mother worked a penny a dress to put food on the table for her three children because my father died when I was very young. It was very tough.</p><p><strong>How do you keep up with your wife, by the way? I've read that she's variously 33 and 40 years younger than you …</strong> <strong><a href=\"#6\">(6)</a></strong></p><p>We get along beautifully. We started schools all over America, we now have 17 where we support the performing arts <strong><a href=\"#7\">(7)</a></strong>. She's a magnificent person and I love everything about her.</p><p><strong>She must keep you young.</strong></p><p>She can't!

        "headline":"The Shadow King – review",
        "body":"<p>To take one of Shakespeare's most tormented tragedies and indigenise it is an ambitious project: King Lear has, during various historical periods, been thought so dark as to be considered unperformable; a tale of greed, corruption, deception, violence and death. Could it be transposed to an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory and remain both watchable and true in its telling?<br /> <br />For the most part, the answer is yes. For their reworking of this tale, co-creators Tom E. Lewis and Michael Kantor have worked with the cast to rewrite the script in a mixture of Indigenous languages and creoles which transport us to the remote communities. Coupled with the use of song, the poetry of the Shakespearean text is retained, yet effectively transformed. <br /> <br />The audience is also transported through video imagery and design. The costumes are heavily influenced by the remote communities – on seeing Lear (played by Lewis) in his cowboy shirt and \"deadly\" white suit, and the colourful tropical prints of his daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia I was reminded of many characters I know in the NT. At a particularly brutal moment of the story, characters enter wearing army camouflage – a possible reference to the beginnings of the NT Intervention, which left many remote community members feeling violated when Army rolled in to take control.<br /> <br />The centrepiece of the set, an imposing mining truck, serves wonderfully as an additional character in the play. Not only does it create a barrier between Lear and his two eldest daughters once they have his wealth – not unlike the family divisions caused by mining and land ownership in so many communities – but its bright lights, when fixed on the audience, are blinding; creating moments  of viewer discomfort to great dramatic effect. That a piece of machinery designed for generating wealth and manipulating land is the focal point for human destruction echoes the show's overall message. To quote Kantor in the programme: \"We cannot own the land; the land owns us\".<br /> <br />This idea is explored in a beautifully choreographed scene. After descending into madness and being cast adrift in the wilderness, Lear is reminded by Cordelia that he belongs to the land. As the red dust swirls and Lear dances and sings, the audience journey with him as he becomes healthy and whole again. Juxtaposed with destructive wealth generation and evil plotting, and Lear's other daughters and Edmund, this scene has great resonance.<br /> <br />The cast is full of seasoned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander performers. To a dark script they bring humour, depth and irony. Frances Djulibing as a female Gloucester adds warmth and soul to her character that nicely counteracts Lewis' reactive and flighty Lear. Jimi Bani's Edmund switches from comic relief to megalomaniacal manipulator in mere seconds. The stand-out is Kamahi Djordon King, whose delightful portrayal of the Fool – at times the absolute wisest person on stage – is cheeky, vexing and wonderfully camp. It is therefore fitting that the Fool gets the final say; sending the audience off with much to ponder.<br /> <br />There are a few issues. The textual decision to use pregnancy as the focus for death for one of the characters jarred. Perhaps because it is earlier implied that the character was previously sexually violated, the decision seems to add to that earlier moment unnecessarily and disturbingly.<br /> <br />The Shadow King is a challenging piece of work. It takes the audience on a journey to remote parts of this country, exploring some key issues facing Indigenous communities at centre stage. The use of a Shakespearean classic to tell an Indigenous tale of family destruction, greed, corruption and deception works strikingly well and makes the tale more accessible to a broader audience.<br /> <br />If viewers are not familiar with King Lear, this production still offers much in its story, its construction and its characterisation for people to walk away satisfied and reflective. But more than anything, this is a production that tells us how greed corrupts and healing is achievable by remembering where you're from. <br /><a href=\"http://www.melbournefestival.com.au/program/genre/theatre/the-shadow-king.html\"><br />• The Shadow King plays at Malthouse, Melbourne until October 27.</a> It will then tour to Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420205347|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|6bb3ffe6a4e48f75d922ff784959e1a4ce853b6f -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>When did you discover you were funny?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Still waiting.</p><p></p><p><strong>What was your big breakthrough?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>My first paid gig, 26 years ago, at the Royal Oak in Islington, London. I got £25 and was delighted.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you suffer for your art?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Yes. Before a gig there's nervousness, tension, dread. Comedians generally don't live that long: there's a lot of travel, a lot of Ginsters sandwiches. It's a bit like being a long-distance lorry driver, but with more stress at the end of the journey.</p><p></p><p><strong>You're an \"alternative\" comedian. What does this actually mean?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I believe the phrase was invented by the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzFRr8IVqJw\" title=\"\">comedian Tony Allen</a> and has vanished a bit now. It came out of the new-wave punk-rock scene, and the fact that there were clubs being set up in pub back rooms. The difference lay in the ownership of jokes: alternative comedians wrote their own, and fights would break out if another comic tried to steal one; while mainstream comedians shared material.</p><p><strong>What's the biggest threat to comedy today?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Itself: it might just pop like a bubble. And TV, maybe. A promoter told me recently that people used to go out to their local comedy club without caring who was on, but now they might only go to see someone they've seen on TV. But I think people will always love being in an audience: there's something magical about being in a room with a group of people, all laughing at the same thing.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the biggest myth about being a comedian?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>That you're a repository for jokes. All taxi drivers say: \"Oh, you're a comedian, are you? Here's one for you.\" It's a bit like saying to someone: \"Oh, you're a boxer, are you? Let me punch you.\" Off-duty, I try to be as unfunny as I can.</p><p></p><p><strong>What work of art would you most like to own?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I really wouldn't want to own a work of art, or anything else of beauty or value. I have three children under 10. Nothing in our house is safe from crayons.</p><p><strong>Do you do comedy for the money or the love?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I'm not sure any more. I drifted into it because I loved it and I still do, but after a while – say 10 years – it's how you earn a living. The wind changes and you're stuck like that. It's still more for the love than the money, but I need the money – I've got crayons to buy.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>A reviewer once said my \"rudimentary guitar-playing does not redeem shoddy lyrics\". I was flattered by the bit about the guitar – I only started playing since I lost the use of my left hand due to nerve damage, and I can't really play a chord. But I disagreed with \"shoddy lyrics\". I was so angry I wrote a reply, but never bothered sending it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is there anything about your career you regret?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I wish it had gone better.</p><p></p><h2>CV</h2><p><strong>Born: </strong>Middlesex, 1967</p><p><strong>Career: </strong>Has performed regularly as a stand-up and on TV and radio since joining Footlights at Cambridge University. Best known for creating such comic characters as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrf-PRYPxr8\" title=\"\">Alan Parker: Urban Warrior</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vvE5zwmuOU\" title=\"\">The League Against Tedium</a>. His latest show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY3pJSecitg\" title=\"\">Fylm</a> is at the Phoenix, Exeter, tomorrow, then touring (<a href=\"http://simonmunnery.com\" title=\"\">simonmunnery.com</a>).</p><p><strong>Low point:</strong> \"A gig at a college in Preston. The only laugh I got was when I fell off the stage, hit my shin on a table, and lay on the floor bleeding.\"</p><p><strong>High point:</strong> \"That same gig – I realised there was no need for jokes.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420033487|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|f1b79d8b73a2b97e3a5ac5ec0c39d84ea9ee0d2c -->",

        "body":"<p>What happens when control of war falls into &ldquo;private hands&rdquo;? Two Iraqi women, Marou Awanis and Geneva Jalal, were shot dead in their car on Tuesday 9 October 2007 as they were travelling through the streets of Baghdad on their way home from church. Awanis was driving; in the back were two young passengers who, from what we can tell, were students. The people who shot Awanis and Jalal were contractors for Unity Resources Group, an Australian company working in Iraq.</p> <p>The two contractors say they signalled to the car to stop, from a distance. Awanis did not stop &ndash; perhaps she did not understand what was happening. Forty bullets hit the car, 19 of which entered her body. Both women were killed but the passengers in the back survived.</p> <p>The women&rsquo;s deaths were reported in Australia, presumably because the shooters were Australian, but this is the sort of thing that happens in Iraq on a regular basis. An <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/ar/library/asset/MDE14/001/2008/ar/3f78611b-f1e9-11dc-adcd-cdafd0ab0dfe/mde140012008eng.pdf\">Amnesty International report</a> that mentions the shooting also discusses the issue of privatisation in official war zones. It might give you a sense of why we at version 1.0 &ndash; the company with which I am a performer &ndash; thought this was a really important story to tell.</p> <p>The story of Awanis and Jalal is the point of departure for The Vehicle Failed to Stop, our new work. We strive to make theatre that is as political as it is personal &ndash; we want people to be active participants in the democratic process. We are very true to our source material and, as verbatim theatre makers, we see our responsibility as being to preserve and protect the facts of a story through our text, in an involving and imaginative way.</p> <p>Our sources have included transcripts of congressional hearings, articles by reputable investigative journalists, documentaries, images, statistics, public documents, personal stories and facts that we have uncovered ourselves. This kind of factual material provides the textual basis of our work: we aim to shine the light in dark corners and ask difficult questions in a public arena.</p> <p>It seems incredible that a provision put into place in the early days of the US-led occupation of Iraq means that private &ldquo;security contractors&rdquo; have almost complete immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law. The deaths of Awanis and Jalal were investigated by the Iraqi interior ministry but punitive action was not taken, because the company &ldquo;admitted to and apologised&rdquo; for what had taken place.</p> <p>Our key responsibility is to develop a process and a product that asks the hard questions &ndash; most significantly whether democracy has become a commodity for export; if privatisation has now transgressed into the public policy arena; and what that means.</p> <p>We want to examine the issue of modern-day mercenaries. The concept of some people profiting from the misfortune of others, with immunity and impunity. And the profound lack of accountability that has been seen in the Iraq war and its aftermath.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.carriageworks.com.au/?page=Event&amp;event=The-Vehicle-Failed-to-Stop\">The Vehicle Failed to Stop is at Carriageworks, Sydney, until 26 October.

        "body":"<p>There’s a bit of back story to the <a href=\"http://www.annaschwartzgallery.com/works/exhibitions?artist=135&amp;year=&amp;exhibition=419&amp;current=1&amp;c=s\">exhibition You Promised Me, and You Said a Lie to Me</a> at Anna Schwartz Gallery, Sydney. It’s curated by <a href=\"http://curatorsintl.org/collaborators/alexie_glass_kantor\">Alexie Glass-Kantor</a>, one of Australia’s most well regarded curators, newly appointed as executive director of Sydney’s <a href=\"http://www.artspace.org.au/\">Artspace</a> after a successful seven-year tenure at the helm of Melbourne’s Gertrude Contemporary.</p> <p>Glass-Kantor has an impressive CV and a long list of curatorial projects to her credit, the latest of which was her co-directorship with the Art Gallery of NSW’s Natasha Bullock of <a href=\"http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2012/visual_arts/adelaide_biennial_parallel_collisions?event=2012-parallel-collisions\">Parallel Collisions</a>, the 2012 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, and <a href=\"http://www.gertrude.org.au/exhibitions/gallery-11/past-14/city-within-the-city.phps\">City Within the City</a>, a show of Korean contemporary art as her swansong at Gertrude. It’s unlikely Glass-Kantor would have known that her return to Sydney would be heralded by a show with Schwartz, a commercial space with a penchant for high-concept exhibitions, but perhaps as a mission statement You Promised Me … is an indication of things to come.</p> <p>Featuring six international artists and one Australian, <a href=\"http://www.annaschwartzgallery.com/works/exhibitions?artist=135&amp;year=&amp;work=13754&amp;exhibition=419&amp;page=1&amp;text=1&amp;future=1&amp;c=s\">the idea of You Promised Me …</a> is to put into dialogue work by artists whose practices “address instances of agency, resistance and vulnerability in the face of interpersonal and political authority”. This translates into as work that is, on first glance, decidedly ambiguous. Walking around the space it’s striking how much the individual pieces conform to the familiar styles and riffs of contemporary art but come together in a cohesive way – unlike, say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2013/sep/26/primavera-2013-review-mca\">the recent Primavera show</a> that was similarly staged in a single room but looked like a hodgepodge of random stuff.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-45c52a28-1535-4995-b04e-06e3592e3012\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381834065822/You-Promised-Me-You-Said--008.jpg\" alt=\"You Promised Me, You Said A Lie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Heman Chong: Cover (Versions). Photograph: the artist and Anna Schwartz Gallery</figcaption> </figure> <p>Quite how that happens is a little difficult to unpick at first. The room is dominated by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.skny.com/artists/laurent-grasso/images/\">Laurent Gasso’s</a>&nbsp;huge sculpture that bears in neon the words “visibility is a trap”. It’s the first and last work you see in the show – you literally have to walk around it – and it simply means that what you see isn’t necessarily what is meant. Ming Wong’s video&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzcx2Vi-V3A\">Persona Performa (Actress’ Entrance)</a>&nbsp;sits next to it, a ghostly video collage of model’s bodies and faces moving toward the camera, which in turn sits next to Jane and Louise Wilson’s long line of images False Positives and False Negatives (2012), photographs of the artists’ faces painted with a kind of camouflage that confuses surveillance cameras.</p> <p>The images are overlaid with frames from security footage of the Mossad assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai in 2010. Sitting in front of these images, on a concrete pillar, is a bronze replica of a camera that belonged to Vladimir Shevchenko, a Soviet filmmaker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCcutzXzYg\">who recorded images of Chernobyl</a>. His camera became so irradiated it had to be buried – the Wilson’s bronze version is a tribute to the denial of seeing.</p> <p>In Heman Chong’s Cover (Versions) the artist uses the rectangular format of the paperback, creating a series of paintings that look like a vast array of book covers, complete with title and author’s name overlaid on an abstract, patterned background. They bring to mind the stylish reissue book covers commonly used by publishers, and Chong’s facsimiles are convincing.</p> <p>But there’s a bigger project behind this work and the random textless paintings inserted into the sequence are the clue: this is more about an idea of abstraction and what it means for painting as an object. We may well regard a book as being something substantial – the weighty tomes of philosophy and literature found within – but could we say the same for a purely abstract painting devoid of text? In this case, you can’t really tell a book by its cover because it's a painting.</p> <p>Haegue Yang’s large installation Strange Fruit – a forest of silver stands adorned with lights and plastic plants – remains utterly unapproachable, even with a portentous explanation of its meaning in the catalogue. The siting of Susan Jacob’s delicate Ded Reckoning next to Yang’s work does neither any favours, while Jesse Jones’s video Predicament of Man (2010), similarly makes little rational sense, even with an explanation of its process. It does however have a undeniable presence – a long pan over the Australian desert with images flashing in the edit like a throwback to Eduardo Paolozzi collages, and a soundtrack with an eerie fragment of music repeating over a three-minute loop.</p> <p>Although Grasso’s Visibility is a Trap towers over the exhibition, it is Jones’s work that I find most compelling – which is perhaps an insight into Glass-Kantor’s success as a curator. As much as we might want contemporary art to “mean” something, and do so deliberately, it’s also an aesthetic experience that connects to an irrational, emotional state; that goes beyond language to the experience of seeing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420008741|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|0ae45a0097a837b4d470c77190c57783c963868a -->",

        "headline":"Super Fun Night: Rebel Wilson, but not as you know her",
        "body":"<p>Overseas reaction to Rebel Wilson&rsquo;s new sitcom Super Fun Night was mild to say the least. When the premiere episode aired on the US network ABC, critics met it with such <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/articles/super-fun-night,103488/\">bold proclamations</a> as: &ldquo;[It] isn&rsquo;t a particularly terrific episode of television, but it more or less tells a coherent story,&rdquo; which is basically what a big shrug looks like in syntax.</p> <p>Unfortunately, based on last night&rsquo;s local debut, the response seems accurate. The show, which follows the misadventures of Wilson&rsquo;s loserly lawyer Kimmie Boubier (obviously pronounced &ldquo;boobie-yay&rdquo;) and her equally awkward friends, Helen-Alice and Marika, is American network comedy at its most predictable: goofy flashbacks, lazy sight gags, and a grating wacky tone that&rsquo;s all YouTube viral video &ndash; or one of those annoying beer ads that&rsquo;s based on a YouTube viral video.</p> <p>The episode&rsquo;s blandness was perhaps even more disappointing for Australian viewers so familiar with Wilson&rsquo;s eccentric potential. Super Fun Night shows barely little sign of the unique (and often awesomely inappropriate) sensibility that made Wilson such a likeable TV star at home through bit parts on the sketch show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Mq4J4OpaA\">The Wedge</a>, those hilariously bumbling Telstra ads that ran during Australian, and, perhaps most memorably, the oddball SBS musical Bogan Pride, where she played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc7r4HFhzb4\">young schoolgirl Jennie Cragg</a>, who enters a dance comp to win prize money for her mum&rsquo;s stomach-stapling operation.</p> <p>Obviously, the world of big money US network TV is very different from SBS&rsquo;s general schedule of A-League highlights, samurai films and Euro erotica, and it&rsquo;s no doubt most to blame for the show&rsquo;s muted personality. In <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/can-rebel-wilson-create-a-sitcom-outcast.html\">her recent New York Magazine cover story</a>, Wilson herself bemoaned the &ldquo;notes thing&rdquo; prevalent in American TV, with jokes and creative decisions being regularly overruled by network suits, even despite having bigtime producer and cult late night host Conan O&rsquo;Brien in her corner.</p> <p>&ldquo;I like to be edgy, and ABC says, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t do this or that on network TV, and I say, &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;&rdquo; Wilson revealed in the feature. &ldquo;Everyone gives me notes: Conan gives notes. Warner Bros gives notes. In Australia, nobody gives notes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Note that, America: We are noteless! Still, despite the overseers&rsquo; constrictive gaze, there were promising glimpses of Wilson&rsquo;s little creative wins throughout the episode, most notably in delightfully blue throwaway gags like when she oddly mentioned the weight of her boobs (&ldquo;23 pounds&rdquo;... you guys work out the metric conversion), and her deadpan response when friend Marika asked her what she meant by &ldquo;that&rdquo; when singing Meatloaf&rsquo;s I Would Do Anything For Love, But I Won&rsquo;t Do That (&ldquo;Butt stuff.&rdquo;)</p> <p>Similarly, despite the potential tedium of another TV show set in a law firm &ndash; this might actually be an anecdotal touch from Wilson, who completed a law degree at the University of NSW while tentatively pursuing an acting career &ndash; the setting provides what&rsquo;s probably the show&rsquo;s biggest comedy catalyst: Kimmie&rsquo;s ongoing feud with office nemesis, Kendall Quinn (played by fellow Aussie, Kate Jenkinson). Jenkinson offers an appropriately hammy take on the unapologetically bitchy Kendall, and her warbly, R&amp;B-lite recital of True Colors was probably the episode&rsquo;s giggly highlight.</p> <p>More importantly, though, Kendall&rsquo;s presence instantly sets up Kimmie as a classic comedic underdog without the constant need for laboured flashbacks to childhood humiliation. With more of their rabid repartee, Wilson should be able to craft Kimmie into the kinda feisty lovable loser that viewers can get behind, like a less-dignified Liz Lemon or a Spanx-clad George Costanza. Let&rsquo;s just hope those network notes stop, so she can get some more arse jokes in there, too. The arse jokes are important.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078618|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|1e0ffda79ed783b00ef648fe04003963d73f1be5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Paul McCartney, musical icon and so-called “embarrassing uncle” of the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/13/paul-mccartney-new-liverpool-nancy\">is out with a new album today</a>, <del>lifelessly</del>&nbsp;aptly&nbsp;titled New. Though the hackneyed title might be a sign of Macca’s age, after 45 albums and 35 No 1 hits, we’ll give him a pass for being out of ideas. McCartney's musical career spans more than 50 years, and in honor of his latest release, we're looking back at some of his most memorable moments.</p> <h2>1969: Paul is dead</h2> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ah2qJKT31r6wv19o1_500.gif\" data-alt=\"Paul McCartney gif\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ah2qJKT31r6wv19o1_500.gif&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;276&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> <p>In 1969, just a year before the Beatles split, American college students published articles claiming that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. In just a few weeks, clue-hunting Beatles fans created an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead\">international phenomenon</a>&nbsp;around Paul’s supposed death. One frequently cited clue is that John Lennon says &quot;I buried Paul&quot; at the end of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeZcI4u0ZQg\">Strawberry Fields</a>. In a disappointing climax to the whole charade, McCartney revealed the words were actually &quot;cranberry sauce&quot;. Blame the LSD.</p> <h2>The 1970s: simply Paul</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-272d80cc-99b9-4746-909a-90ed4b5be713\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381856173981/847be518-469a-42f4-9c58-d3a8cfcd4787-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul mcCartney\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A young McCartney, mullet and everything. Photograph: /Getty images</figcaption> </figure> <p>After 1970, Paul wasted no time. He released a solo album, put out an LP with his wife, and formed a new band, Wings. Much of his music from his post-Beatles life received rave reviews. And&nbsp;though that trend didn’t last forever (we won’t even discuss <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9BZDpni56Y\">Wonderful Christmas Time</a>) ,some of these hits belong right up there with his Beatles work. Here are a few of our favorites:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/S7D65IomNYY\">Band on the Run</a>, Wings,&nbsp;Band on the Run (1973)</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8V1nFCP058&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Jet</a>, Wings, Band on the Run (1973)</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_kkp9S9a3w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Silly Love Songs</a>, Wings, Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976)</li> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/cm2YyVZBL8U\">Maybe I’m Amazed</a>, Paul McCartney,&nbsp;McCartney (1970)</li> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/e7aGAIWe3uE\">Live and Let Die</a>, Wings, 1973</li> </ul> <h2>The 1980s: a meeting of two kings</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLEhh_XpJ-0\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLEhh_XpJ-0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>In 1983, the two kings of pop recorded this jam, featured on McCartney's fifth solo album,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipes_of_Peace\">Pipes of Peace</a>.&nbsp;To no one's surprise, the song quickly became worldwide No 1 hit. To everyone's surprise however, they made this weird video to accompany it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The duo play &quot;Mac and Jack&quot;, a pair of traveling con-men who sell a &quot;miracle potion&quot;. A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe\">Boston Globe</a>&nbsp;critic stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling, adding &quot;it's even harder to believe that the two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_King\">Chess King</a>&nbsp;employees”. If you've never seen it, put on headphones and be amazed.&nbsp;</p> <p>As if this whole thing wasn't awkward enough already, in 1984 Michael Jackson out-bid Paul for the Northern Song Catalogue, aka the rights to all the Beatles songs.&nbsp;</p> <h2>The 1990s: going veg</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cf655cdb-a64c-499e-8c9e-93254985ccea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381860289866/2357e477-e7d6-47d1-be58-aacc085e2c01-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Linda and paul \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Paul and Linda on their wedding day in 1969. Photograph: Rex Features</figcaption> </figure> <p>Throughout their 30-year marriage, Paul and Linda McCartney produced some stellar work (their daughter Stella, for example) and some not-so-stellar work (Off the Ground).</p> <p>But their legacy as a couple is probably their work on animal rights. Together, they were outspoken vegetarians and animal rights campaigners. Linda even started her own vegetarian food company, <a href=\"http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/\">Linda McCartney Foods</a>.</p> <p>The now infamous quote “if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegetarian” has been attributed to both of them. Paul has also narrated Glass Walls, a <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/tv/videos/celebrities-vegetarianism/86975251001.aspx\">documentary</a> about the meat industry.</p> <h2>The 2000s: being 64</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fc839e23-a364-4f9e-b77b-023722b79850\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381858293159/c59db225-616c-40d1-ae47-62d3f8d4de6e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul McCartney trying to stay young with girlfriend\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Paul McCartney: young, relevant. Photograph: /Splashnewsonline</figcaption> </figure> <p>The early part of the 21st century wasn't great for Paul. Linda died in 1998. He finally turned 64, married, re-married and started to do typical old-rocker-dude things like producing mediocre&nbsp;albums and touring a whole lot.&nbsp;</p> <h2>2013: New</h2> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mccartney new\"> <iframe width=\"368\" height=\"276\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pE_1V0phMW8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>It’s too early to tell how New will do on the charts, but Rolling Stone has given it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/new-20131015\">four stars&nbsp;</a>and our <a href=\"https://flexible.gutools.co.uk/admin/content/\">Alex Petridis</a> named it album of the week – a significant improvement from &quot;damp squib&quot;, which is how&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukejennings\">Luke Jennings</a>&nbsp;described McCartney's ballet production. Macca isn't likely to slow down anytime soon, so if New isn't for you, just wait for the next album.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420048356|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|4255c91ffc7953b80c3f90bf66f0c0c9c176aba2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Professional funnywoman and writer Julieanne Smolinski has endured some dark situations in the name of culture news.</p> <p>Most notably, she was a member of the press corps on Rihanna's 777 tour, which was later recognized as the modern pop-music equivalent of Lord of the Flies. <a href=\"http://popdust.com/2012/11/19/rihanna-air-naked-in-the-aisles/\">A tale from Smolinksi's time on the road</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The wonderful, fantastic flight crew attempted to normalize our blood sugar by bringing us some odd, microwaved hoagie type things, but it was to no avail. The plane took on a weird smell, like hot processed cheese and fear. Finally, an Australian journalist named Tim stripped totally naked and ran up and down the aisles. In London, someone apparently passed out in customs around 5 or 6am, and following a bizarrely long bus ride from the airport, we swayed blearily in line for hotel rooms, sleepless since Paris or longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last year, she busted open a scandal at the New York Times crossword puzzle when the paper equated the word &quot;illin&quot; with &quot;wack&quot;. She and Times puzzle editor Will Shortz <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5874539/new-york-times-crossword-puzzlemaster-schooled-on-definition-of-illin\">then&nbsp;engaged in the decade's most heated-lexicographic&nbsp;email battle</a>&nbsp;to determine the proper use of the word. The row&nbsp;was settled, in Smolinski's favor,&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/405890/january-12-2012/mike-d-s-hip-hop-semantics\">Beastie Boys' Mike D on The Colbert Report</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In between these lexicographic duels and loads of writing projects, Smolinski doles out a daily dose of funny on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boobsradley\">@BoobsRadley</a>.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BoobsRadley/statuses/286282377808998400\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;Their, their.&quot; - how to comfort an idiot.</p>— Julieanne Smolinski (@BoobsRadley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoobsRadley/statuses/286282377808998400\">January 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>These days, she's working on a book, and writing for an American version of the British show Sirens, which will air in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What was your first screen name?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It was &quot;MmeMulder,&quot; which is very embarrassing to me now. I'm a feminist, so when David Duchovny and I marry in France, I plan to keep my name.</p> <h2><strong>What was your worst day ever?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It's hard to pick a worst day. They're like my children. I think the best ones are just so over-the-top bad that they stop being days and become stories. Recently, I was having a nightmare day when a guy I'd written off texted and asked me to drinks. It was one of those, &quot;Maybe he does like me!&quot; things, where you shampoo <em>and</em> condition your hair and swan around your house getting ready, like a fat American Leslie Caron.</p> <p>It turned out he just wanted to tell me he was seeing someone, although he had to sort of yelled it, because we were seated right next to the lounge singers, who had just enthusiastically burst into All of Me, which until that moment was one of my favorite songs. I waved down the waitress and tried my iciest, &quot;Madam, the check please&quot; and she was like, &quot;Uhhhh, there's a two drink per person minimum.&quot; I ended up paying for, like, four martinis and $8 in parking. It was so horrible it was great.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What is your favorite smell?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I'd like to say it's the chestnut vendors in autumn at the Jardin du Luxembourg, but if I'm being honest? Probably anything from Victoria's Secret's cruelly discontinued line of tropical body splashes.</p> <h2><strong>Who would you invite to your ideal dinner party?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I am desperately awkward and clumsy around people I'd like to impress. Factor in the utensils, alcohol and cooking elements involved in hosting a dinner party, and you have a real Hindenburg situation on your hands. I can see the Page Six headline, like, 'Idiot Spills Hot Chicken Grease on Nicole Holofcener, Horribly Mutilates Cameron Crowe.' No thank you. Next question please.</p> <h2><strong>What cocktail are you most like and why?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>The fourth. I believe I'm best enjoyed after the first two or three.</p> <h2><strong>What are three items you will always find in your refrigerator?</strong></h2> <p>Water, multiple mustards, wilting pricy produce purchased with the purest intentions.</p> <h2><strong>What were you doing at midnight last night?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Working. I try to time my busiest hours to when other people are sleeping or having meaningful sex with one another.</p> <h2><strong>What did your last text message you received say?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>&quot;Please do!&quot;</p> <h2><strong>What is a word you say a lot?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I would like to say it's not a swear, but I live in Los Angeles and often drive a vehicle.</p> <h2><strong>Who was your first crush?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Definitely not Dudley Moore in that Christmas movie where he plays a sad elf!&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What was your worst injury ever?</strong></h2> <p>Puberty.</p> <h2><strong>What is the last song you listened to?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>T Rex's Mambo Sun. I wish there were a funnier answer, but on the other hand, it feels good to end on a sincere note.&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419952615|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|77f82be9856796d8b812c15a312e6b112e9b4919 -->",

        "body":"<p>Some traditions just don&rsquo;t get the respect they deserve. For the past couple of decades, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/15/flume-aka-harley-streten-dominates-aria-award-nominations\">the announcement of the Aria nominations</a> were greeted by people pretending to celebrate Australian music.&nbsp;Mainstream radio stations would swiftly add some nominated songs to their playlists and insist they&rsquo;d singlehandedly discovered them. Magazines would do features on how we should either Meet the New Breed (young new acts got nominations) or Hail the Old Guard (mainly established acts).&nbsp;People would have arguments about the representation of women in Australian rock, discuss whether Triple J used to be better (spoiler: like everything else in Australian music, it did) and, most of all, rant about how Aria was obviously out of touch.</p> <p>These days, however, the Arias no longer provoke quite such reaction. The ceremony is no longer a key event on the Channel 10 schedule &ndash; this year it will be screened on digital station GO! On December 1 &ndash; and record companies no longer spend the sort of advertising dollars that make magazines keen to invent stories about the renaissance of Australian music. Commercial radio, meanwhile, seems perfectly content to assume that new local talent is developed entirely by The Voice.</p> <p>This month we had the Air awards &ndash; or, to give them their full name, the Carlton Dry Independent Music awards &ndash; the alternative Arias where the argument about what constitutes &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in a world where a good advertising sync is more valuable than a major record label deal grows ever more heated.&nbsp;</p> <p>The big winner was Flume, nom de rock of Sydney bedroom electronica producer Harley Streten, who won three of his five nominations. That was hardly a shock: Flume scored four places in this year&rsquo;s Hottest 100 on Triple J and his self-titled album topped the Aria charts and has already gone platinum.</p> <p>Equally unsurprising is that Flume is the most nominated artist in this year&rsquo;s Aria awards. He&rsquo;s up for eight categories, including album of the year, best male artist and breakthrough artist: Release. If you&rsquo;re betting on a win, Flume for album of the year seems like a reasonable wager &ndash; although it's likely he'll take male artist and breakthrough as well.</p> <p>Close behind are Perth collective Tame Impala, in the running for album of the year with Lonerism &ndash; which I'd argue they certainly deserve &ndash; as well as best group. Despite their many nominations, they&rsquo;re probably dark horses in just about every category.</p> <p>Fellow Perthians Birds of Tokyo pretty much have best rock album sewn up for March Fires and are also in the running for best group and album of the year. They&rsquo;re tied with the most nominated &ldquo;heritage act&rdquo;: Aria hall of famer Nick Cave has taken six nods for last year&rsquo;s Bad Seeds album Push the Sky Away, which is also up for album of the year, and will almost certainly win in the frustratingly difficult-to-define adult contemporary abum category.</p> <p>The field is far more open in best female artist without a clean-sweeping Delta, Missy or Kylie to take out the field. Sarah Blasko seems like a solid bet though, although Missy Higgins has also been nominated in the category. It's probably not Samantha Jade's year but then neither is 2014 likely to be, since that&rsquo;s when Lorde&rsquo;s going to take out every category there is &ndash; assuming, of course, that she gets the honorary Australian title that we assign to New Zealanders when they break big internationally. Isn't that right, Kimbra? Wouldn't you say, Ladyhawke?</p> <p>Other safe-ish bets are Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson for best country album, Guy Sebastian for best pop album, the Cat Empire for best blues and roots and Bliss n Eso for best urban &ndash; in genre categories, name recognition is as important as the quality of work.</p> <p>How does the 2013 Aria list compare with previous years? A couple of heavily nominated newcomers are set to dominate their categories, a few recognisable names who should have won big last year (good luck with the best rock album nomination, Rubens), and some familiar names you&rsquo;ve missed for a while (David Bridie, congrats on the best original soundtrack nod).</p> <p>Plus, of course, some weird omissions worth arguing over, like the comparative lack of nominations for the Drones this year despite I See Seaweed being amazing. And a reminder that the last year&rsquo;s seen some amazingly Australian good music. So: much like every other year, really.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419971087|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|104931bb2c03b4a068b1358b9fd08e4856a5a197 -->",

        "headline":"Want to get Daft Punk's Get Lucky? Give the vinyl a few more spins on the turntable",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about trying to make sense of the <a href=\"http://hiddentracks.org/its-not-actually-a-disco-album-per-se-daft-punk-notes-from-a-small-backlash-2013\">early reaction to Daft Punk's Random Access Memories</a> when it became available to stream on iTunes a week ahead of release. After three weeks of living with Get Lucky, the consensus among about two-thirds of the first people who heard it was that, well, it could have done with a few more Get Luckys. What seemed striking was that they didn't seem to consider that some songs might require a bit of application from the listener. And yet, I would say that at least half of my 100 favourite albums revealed their charms gradually, over repeated listens. I bought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pentangle\">Pentangle</a>'s Sweet Child when I was 17. It sat in my collection for about eight years, receiving only the occasional play, before I suddenly realised that this might be one of my favourite records of all time. It seemed to me that streaming Random Access Memories free and ahead of its official release might have backfired. By making it just another option on an endless try-before-you-buy taster menu, Columbia Records might have done the album a disservice.</p><p>How could this anticlimax have been circumvented? One suggestion I made was releasing the vinyl version one or two weeks ahead of a digital. It prompted a shitstorm of responses, mainly from people who assumed that I think vinyl is superior, and that the people who buy their music on vinyl are superior human beings.  They're not, but on the whole they are different. If you're wedded to a format that sets you back approximately £20 an album, it stands to reason that you'll work harder to justify the purchase. Two weeks of online chatter from people gradually realising that there was actually room in their lives for Wall-E's post-Studio 54 comedown opus would have created far more anticipation than the few hundred people who impulsively tweeted their first impressions on hearing what came out of their laptop speakers.</p><p>As it turned out, enough people heard something in Get Lucky to persuade them that Random Access Memories might be enjoyed most on vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/uk-vinyl-sales-daft-punk-david-bowie\">Figures released by the music industry organisation BPI</a> revealed a 100% increase in vinyl sales across 2013 so far, with the Daft Punk album topping the list. In the general scheme of things, vinyl is still very much a minority format. A 100% spike in sales only barely nudges total sales past the 500,000 mark. But if you're an artist who happens to do well in vinyl sales – albums by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Boards of Canada were among the 10 best-selling vinyl releases in 2013 – your relatively few sales will almost certainly eclipse several years of Spotify spoils. The upswing in vinyl sales is sometimes put down to the idea that music sounds warmer on vinyl or to the notion that holding a record sleeve and placing its contents on a turntable offers a more well-rounded aesthetic experience than a CD. To be honest, I'm not sure about \"warmth\". But sometimes – if playing, say, an original seven-inch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8782KIj_rKw\">Let's Hang on by the Four Seasons</a> on a 60s Sanyo portable record player, and hearing how a 45 year-old speaker can barely contain the music's volume – it seems to make it all the more exciting. On the other hand, listening to a CD of John Renbourn singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9fiaeKGrts\" title=\"\">I Know My Babe</a> by hooking up a set of Harman Kardon speakers to my computer provides a hushed, foetal intimacy that's no less lovely.</p><p>Perhaps arguing for the warmth of vinyl is simply a matter of trying to justify a pleasure that's sometimes hard to articulate. Everything but the Girl musician and sometime Buzzin' Fly label boss <a href=\"http://www.buzzinfly.com/comments/miles-showell-july-2012.html\" title=\"\">Ben Watt interviewed Abbey Road mastering engineer Miles Showell</a> to get an empirical measure of the merits of vinyl and digital formats. Showell contended that vinyl's superior fidelity was only discernible \"if the record was (i) cut well at the mastering stage, (ii) processed and pressed well at the factory, which is the really hard part, (iii) then kept clean and stored in ideal conditions and (iv), finally, played on a decent turntable with a very well-engineered tone arm fitted with a good and correctly aligned cartridge that, in turn, has a clean and undamaged stylus, all of which needs to feed a high quality RIAA vinyl disc pre-amplifier\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCBJ8BVy49w&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Reading on mobile?

Neither, I would venture, have most people who prefer to listen to music on vinyl. So what do I prefer? I enjoy going to a record shop when I am not altogether sure what I'm after. I prefer hearing and falling hard for something blasting out of the shop speakers that, on closer listening, turns out to be by an artist I didn't think I liked that much. Last month, in the west London outpost of Rough Trade, that happened to me with the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/15/arctic-monkeys-live-roundhouse\" title=\"\">Arctic Monkeys</a> album. I prefer the anticipation of  judging how it sounds in my kitchen. If it's a record I haven't listened to before I bought it – as happened with music by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/02/new-music-lloyd-cole-period-piece\" title=\"\">Lloyd Cole </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/parquet-courts-light-up-review\" title=\"\">Parquet Courts</a> on the same visit to Rough Trade – I like that we'll have to make an effort to get along. I can't just dismiss it and go on to the next thing. More than anything, I think that's what these new BPI figures tell us. The resurgence of vinyl is the closest music consumption has come to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/04/slow-food-carlo-petrini\" title=\"\">slow food movement</a>. My misgivings about Spotify aren't entirely predicated on the pittance of money that trickles down to music makers. If it was, I would stop buying second-hand records because their creators wouldn't make a penny from my purchase. Spotify merely formalises on a global scale the decline in how much people are prepared to pay for music.</p><p>We don't like it when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\" title=\"\">artists such as David Byrne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a> talk about the royalties generated by Spotify. It's somehow unbecoming of our favourite artists to discuss money. But, obvious as that may seem, payment is intrinsic to our concept of worth. And that has ramifications for the listener as well as the artist. It stands to reason that you'll work harder to get value out of something for which you paid an appreciable amount of money. That Marc Jacobs coat you paid £300 for? You might try and shed half a stone to fit back into it. But that raincoat from TK Maxx, well, the incentive isn't as great. The growth of vinyl and the rise of streaming are driven by the same forces. Both provide something that the other, by its very nature, simply can't. The pleasure you get from an experience is often proportionate to how much time and effort you expend. The carrier bag on the bus home. The expectation. The way it looks and feels. Even the way it smells. And that's before you even place it on the turntable. As New Radicals put it: \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22717276\" title=\"\">Can't forget/ You only get what you give</a>.\" It's a shame that song never came out on vinyl.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241396|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|c0f3a2e93c63d32986c0b773a53b6ae05fa7239f -->",

The Bristol-born artist is <a href=\"http://www.banksy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">currently \"in residence\" in New York</a>, and not a day passes without a story about his exploits in the Big Apple. The latest is that Banksy has carved a statue of Ronald McDonald, mascot of the renowned fast food chain, and is moving it from one McDonald's to another in the New York area together with a – living – boy giving the corporate clown a shoeshine.</p><p>Look, it's a bit pointless mocking American capitalism, Banksy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/us-shutdown-imf-christine-lagarde-appeals-stability\" title=\"\">Congress has already done that for you</a>. How the world laughed when Republican extremists brought the \"world's most powerful nation\" to the brink of debt default. How it shrugged when this lunatic crisis was resolved at the last minute. What's America going to do next to make itself a living joke?</p><p>By comparison, Banksy's stunts are light entertainment for complacent liberals and Leftists. Being a bit of both, I can totally get behind his tilt at McDonald's. I am pretty sure it stands for everything that is wrong with the world. I can't quite remember the details but yeah, McDonald's, it's got to be bad. Go for it.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419901931\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/14/131014banksysells-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/14/131014banksysells/131014banksysells.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>This <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/englishmaninnewyork.html\" title=\"\">Englishman in New York</a> is clearly generating impressive interest and a lot of headlines.

Vandalise that ...</p><p>Yet all this reporting of Banksy's art and its fate reveals the massive intellectual lacunae in our current understanding of art. On the one hand, Banksy is a street artist, having a laugh defying the authorities. On the other hand, his works are now regarded as financially valuable so when they get defaced it is seen as an attack on some kind of cultural monument. It's just street art! Lighten up! It does not need to survive and people who pay big money for it are silly.</p><p>To his credit, Mr Banksy seems to know that. Hence the cheap art sale to those lucky tourists. They could sell the works at a huge profit, and have the blowout of a lifetime at McDonald's.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419832428\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals/131013BanksyAnimals.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420247469|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|f8eff1d289cdb708ab73714b9b00804df3569b34 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dear Mister Cranston,</p><p>I've just finished a marathon of watching 'BREAKING BAD' – from episode one of the First Season – to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing. I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant! Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen – ever.</p><p>I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really. But this work of yours is spectacular – absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers... every department – casting etc... managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is awesome.</p><p>From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.</p><p>If you ever get a chance to – would you pass on my admiration to everyone – Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada – everyone – everyone gave master classes of performance... The list is endless.</p><p>Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence. You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen. That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.</p><p>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Tony Hopkins</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad: full coverage<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/23/anthony-hopkins-composing-music\">Anthony Hopkins interviewed last year</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223164|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|a472629371913f6fdb57c12fdaab9f6f56df5370 -->",

        "headline":"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt – review",
        "body":"<p>It is dangerous to write openings as compelling as Donna Tartt's. In <em>The Secret History</em>, the one-page prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it. <em>The Little Friend</em> starts with the death of a child who, by page 15, is found hanging by a&nbsp;piece of rope from a tree branch, his red hair \"the only thing about him that&nbsp;was the right colour any more\". And now, in <em>The Goldfinch</em>, Tartt has a 50‑page two-part opening. In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is&nbsp;holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can't understand; he&nbsp;is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes. Before any of this is explained, the story moves back 14&nbsp;years to the day Theo's mother dies, when he is on the cusp of adolescence. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, as a consequence of an exploding bomb – mother and son are in separate rooms when the bomb blast occurs, and the descriptions of Theo regaining consciousness in the wreckage, and trying to find his way out of the ripped-apart museum before returning home, expecting to find his mother there, are&nbsp;written in astonishingly gripping prose. This is, of course, where the danger comes in: if, at the end of the kind of set piece to which the word \"climactic\" should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren't you setting your readers up for disappointment?</p><p>Astonishingly, the answer is no. The novel changes gear and, for a while, is primarily involved with showing us, affectingly, the dislocation of Theo's life – a dislocation both emotional and physical. His mother dead, his father long absent, he finds himself living with the Barbours, the family of a&nbsp;school friend; this is understood by everyone to be a short-term option, and the cold spectre of unknown and unloving grandparents who will eventually become Theo's guardians hovers over the novel for a time until his father reappears, with his girlfriend Xandra, and takes Theo off to live with him in Las Vegas. There will be more twists and turns in this tale of a&nbsp;motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a&nbsp;vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions it isn't&nbsp;easy to work out. If there's any one novel this strand of the story calls to mind, it's<em> Great Expectations</em> – there's even a character called Pippa, perhaps a playful melding of Pip and Estella. Pippa, near Theo in age, was also in the&nbsp;museum when the bomb exploded, and is the only person who Theo feels can understand his heart.</p><p>But there is a second strand to the novel, this one with echoes of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Young Theo Decker enters a museum with his mother; he&nbsp;leaves with a painting. The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/f/fabritiu/carel/goldfinc.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Goldfinch</em> by Carel Fabritius</a>, a&nbsp;student of Rembrandt's, who died at&nbsp;the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed; <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. \"Anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,\" Theo's mother says to him, minutes before her death – an idea that runs deep in the veins of&nbsp;the novel. Picking up the painting from the debris and walking out of the museum with it isn't exactly theft, not if theft involves the conscious decision to steal. Theo is acting in a state of mental distress, on the instructions of&nbsp;a dying man who tells him to take the painting. This man, it so happens, is guardian to Pippa – at this point, she&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing more to Theo than an arresting-looking girl, all too briefly glimpsed, though, later, their lives will collide and separate, repeatedly.</p><p>But once Theo reads in the newspaper that the painting is believed to have been destroyed in the explosion, he chooses to keep quiet about his possession of it – and from here on, he&nbsp;is culpable. As the years go on, both Theo's attachment to the painting (a&nbsp;thing of beauty, but also a physical connection to one of the last conversations he had with his mother) and his guilt over his continued possession of such a priceless work of art grows. So, too, does his fear of being imprisoned for stealing the object. It should come as no surprise, in a novel that opens with crime scene tapes and exploding museums, that the story of Theo and the painting is a story of betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing and shoot-outs. Raymond Chandler is no less a&nbsp;presence here than Dickens and Dostoyevsky. To say any more about the events of the novel would be to deprive a reader of the great joy of being swept up by the plot. If anyone has lost their love of storytelling, <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> should most certainly return it to them.</p><p>The novel isn't, of course, all action and suspense. Some of its most memorable moments occur in stillness. Take Theo's first experience of the desert skies of Las&nbsp;Vegas, after a life spent amid the light pollution of New York. Until now, he has only known the constellations as \"childhood patterns that had twinkled me to sleep from the glow-in‑the-dark planetarium stars on my bedroom ceiling back in New York. Now, transfigured – cold and glorious like deities with their disguises flung off – it was as if they'd flown through the roof and into the sky to assume their true, celestial homes.\" It is a&nbsp;glorious piece of prose, but placed within a novel about a boy who has lost his true home – which is, wherever his mother might be – it becomes heart-piercing, too. Tartt may already have displayed her great gift for plot in her debut, but the emotional register of <em>The Goldfinch</em> is of a different order from either of her previous works.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to think that all the emotions are centred around loss. At the heart of the novel is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evocation of boyhood friendship – that of Theo and Boris, the&nbsp;Ukrainian outsider he meets on his first day of&nbsp;school in Las Vegas. Boris is an unforgettable creation – a thieving, drinking, drug-taking teenager who lights up each page he is on, even as he&nbsp;leads Theo into a world of excess. Their relationship works so well on the&nbsp;page in part because it has been prefigured by Theo's friendship, in New&nbsp;York, with a boy called Tom Cable – a friendship with a \"wild, manic quality, something unhinged and hectic and a little perilous about it\". Tartt doesn't present Theo as&nbsp;someone who comes unmoored from his own character by the death of his mother, but, more convincingly, as a&nbsp;boy whose&nbsp;flaws become more deeply inscribed in him as a consequence of&nbsp;loss. Then again, it&nbsp;is not entirely right to think of Theo's friendship with Boris&nbsp;as a flaw – the love between the boys is both simple and complicated, in the way of the best friendships. And&nbsp;when Boris re-enters Theo's life in adulthood it is impossible not to hope he is there as a friend, even while fearing the opposite.</p><p>Plot and character and fine prose can&nbsp;take you far – but a novel this good makes you want to go even further. The last few pages of the novel take all&nbsp;the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and hold them up to the light. Not for Tartt the kind of clever riffs, halfway between standup comedy and op-ed columns, which are too commonly found in contemporary fiction. Instead, when plot comes to an end, she leads us to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place just beyond it – a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;meaning, or, as she refers to it, \"a&nbsp;rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love.\"</p><p>• Kamila Shamsie's most recent book is Burnt Shadows (Bloomsbury)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419620378|2013-10-17T13:09:56Z|5a10584fe9a1886c53edf9467965068392273bd5 -->",
