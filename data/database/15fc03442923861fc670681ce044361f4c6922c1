        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya\">Surabaya</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/antananarivo\">Antantanarivo</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quelimane\">Quelimane</a> – exotic places with names evoking mystique and a sense of adventure. How about <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/\">Kakadu</a> – or Gaagudju as it was known before white settlement?</p> <p>It’s a name which conjures images of wilderness where time is oblivious to the protocols of place names or designations such as World Heritage Site. It is, nonetheless, a domain sensitive to the effects of too much love or too little respect. The nearby monolith, Uluru has also been classified a globally significant site where ancient culture now amazes and provokes visitors from around the world.</p> <p>This new four-part series (<strong>ABC1, Sundays 7.30pm</strong>), narrated by Tom E Lewis and superbly photographed by Luke Petersen and Nick Robinson, offers an intensely personal view of the area through the activities of people entrusted with maintaining its integrity while simultaneously providing access to its wonders.</p> <p>The first thing to become obvious as the exploration unfolds, is that those who manage and protect the land are superbly attuned to the physical and the spiritual concerns of the work. This is stewardship of a natural resource upheld with unswerving belief and sensitivity for the balance between careful exploitation and preservation for the future.</p> <p>“Our land is our life, we have to protect it forever” says one savvy ranger. “Money doesn’t mean anything to me” says Jeffery Lee, a traditional owner. &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”</p> <p>Fair enough. Tourists, while generating income, are essentially the most vulnerable and least necessary element in a complex eco-structure involving insects, microscopic creatures, plants, animals, reptiles, birds and aquatic animals such as the formidable saltwater crocodiles which have survived the searing heat and flooding rains of the region for millions of years.</p> <p>World Heritage listing of Kakadu, which is one third the size of Tasmania and half the size of Switzerland, began in 1981 and was formally completed in 1992.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f498b12-8245-46a7-9a98-1f6fd23f0190\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381034430611/9adc0f26-ce3f-4949-b2a0-c982c0a7e08c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jeff Lee Kakadu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jeffrey Lee: &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”&nbsp;Photograph: /ABC</figcaption> </figure> <p>About 500 people live within its borders but upwards of 250,000 visitors come to the region annually and their safety is a key thread through the series - seen through the work of wildlife officers charged with ensuring crystal clear escarpment rivers and murky billabongs aren’t reservoirs of disasters for the unwary or outright foolish that are arrogant enough to turn a blind eye to the bleeding obvious. They occasionally end up&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the bleeding obvious.</p> <p>Traditional owners such as Jeffery Lee can see beyond these clear and present dangers to the long-term peril of permitting insensitive and greedy operators to ruin the place. How uranium mines can be condoned inside Kakadu is as much a cause for bewilderment as the natural wonders which constitute the real wealth of the park.</p> <p>Viewers join cheerful botanists, environmental scientists, anthropolgists and rangers – not your standard Steve Irwin model – and naturalists such as Anne O’Dea and Ian Morris as they patrol.</p> <p>Fire is one of the elements that defines Kakadu. It can serve man and, equally, place him in grave jeopardy – as illustrated during an encounter with Steve Anderson, Jabiru’s fire officer and his band of “Angels”.</p> <p>They tackle a potentially lethal&nbsp;blaze – probably started by an unextinguished campfire – threatening their community. The stewards of Kakadu also have to deal with man-made disasters such as the devastation created by the misguided introduction of cane toads into Queensland in 1935. As a consequence no king brown snakes or giant spotted goannas, previously prolific, can be seen in 200 X 100 km park. Other species at risk, like the Northern Quoll, are being trained to avoid the toads and their toxic venom.</p> <p>It’s a salutary example of the balance of Nature being upset. Humans can at least be steered into compliance or obedience, and recreational anglers coming to fish for Barramundi or crabs find the law is enforced rigorously – a little too decently you might think after a confrontation between rangers Garry Lindner, his offsider, Andrew Wellings, and a boofheaded poacher.</p> <p>There are moments when the series veers into the style of reality documentary where actuality is accentuated and over-dramatised but by and large, the overwhelming reality of the place defines an eminently watchable series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419167641|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|dcdf731fab828e6d4db67330bab8d57da2595ac8 -->",

        "headline":"Michael J Fox: 'Nobody pities me and that's great. I couldn't stand it'",
        "body":"<p>When Michael J Fox walks into the reception of his office in New York, he arrives like a bantam-weight boxer ready for a fight. It is not so much the way he moves, although that is partly why he gives that impression, his weight shifting restlessly from foot to foot. \"I feel like I'm dangling from a coat hanger, with my toes scraping and kicking at the ground,\" he writes in his excellent autobiography, Lucky Man, describing the effects of Parkinson's disease, which for more than two decades now has racked his body.</p><p>What really gives him the appearance of a readying boxer is the look in his eyes. Whenever Fox meets someone for the first time, he slips on this look as instinctively as others shuck on a jacket when they leave the house. It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;proud and confrontational look, honed from 20 years of dealing with people's initial reaction to him, stricken at what has happened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/aug/31/the-10-best-time-travellers\" title=\"\">Marty McFly</a>, who once moved with such grace on a skateboard.</p><p>\"Hi, thanks so much for coming,\" he murmurs, his right arm swinging out to grab my hand. We are exactly the same height – 5ft 4in (1.63 metres) – and he looks me straight in the eye for a few seconds before leading me into his office, which is decorated with Emmy awards, classic guitars (Johnny B Goode!) and photos of him and his wife Tracy Pollan and their four children.</p><p>\"Is the chair OK? Right, so …\" he says, sitting on the sofa and looking up,&nbsp;ready.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107805'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904961767/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the comedy Spin City, which he left in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue.</figcaption></figure><p>The reason Fox has agreed to endure this journalist's reaction to him is because he is promoting his new sitcom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/28/michael-j-fox-parkinsons-disease-sitcom\" title=\"\">The Michael J Fox Show</a>. It is his first since he left the highly lauded Spin City in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue. Although Fox is best known internationally for his films – Back to the Future, Teen Wolf, Doc Hollywood – he&nbsp;has always been TV gold in America. He was launched to fame on the hugely successful 1980s sitcom Family Ties as Alex P Keaton, the Republican son of hippie parents. Since leaving Spin City, Fox has appeared in several TV shows to great acclaim, including his friend Denis Leary's show Rescue Me (for which he won an Emmy), The Good Wife, Boston Legal, Scrubs and, most amusingly, as himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm, in which Larry David accuses him of exaggerating his Parkinson's symptoms to annoy him (\"I thought I was the sickest guy on this block but you're the new champ,\" Fox replies.) American networks vied fiercely for Fox's new show and it is difficult to walk for more than two blocks in New York without seeing a giant advert for the 22-episode series. It is an extraordinary achievement for a&nbsp;52-year-old man who was told when he was 30 that he would be lucky if he could still work when he was 40. He takes special pride in having defied the doctors' prognosis, just as he would once defy school sports coaches who would look at his slight build and pick him last for a team: \"If you pick me last, I will do everything I can to make you look like a fool,\" he says.</p><p>The show tells the story of Mike&nbsp;Henry, a news anchor who retired five years previously because of Parkinson's and has now decided to return to work. It is an avowedly traditional sitcom and, judging from the pilot, it hasn't quite figured out how to let Fox display the sparkiness and bite in which he always excelled as a comic actor. But for those of us who grew up watching Fox, it is a&nbsp;joy to see him working again, and it is a sentiment he echoes.</p><p>\"Denis [Leary] told me after I did Curb that I should get back to work, and I&nbsp;wanted to, to create a world and entertain people. There is also a satisfaction in knowing that maybe you're doing something bigger, but that's not for me to ponder. However, if&nbsp;the show does cure humanity's ills, that's cool,\" he says drily.</p><p>But Fox clearly set out to make some points about Parkinson's through the show (as well as being the star, he is the executive producer.) It is repeatedly emphasised that, while the public sees&nbsp;his character Mike purely as a man with Parkinson's, applauding whenever he enters a room, Mike's family does not. They make no allowances for him, grabbing food from under his nose that he is too slow to eat, and that is just what he wants.</p><p>\"A lot of times, people who are in a health situation become the observed patient and other people project their own feelings on to them: 'No, you're too tired to go there,' 'No, you don't want that.' But I don't want to make my&nbsp;life more complicated by accepting other people's projections of me, or making my own projections about how they should deal with me,\" he says, reaching for a water bottle, which he wrestles with studied practice towards his mouth.</p><p>His children have never known him without Parkinson's: his son was born in 1989, two years before his diagnosis, his twin daughters were born in 1995 and his youngest daughter was born in 2001. \"So for them, it's just part of the household. If you asked my kids to describe me, they'd go through a whole list of words before even thinking about Parkinson's. And honestly, I&nbsp;don't think about it that much either. I talk about it because it's there, but it's not my totality,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107806'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380905081768/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>With his wife, actor Tracy Pollan, last month. Photograph: Jeff Vespa/WireImage</figcaption></figure><p>The pilot also stresses that Mike and his wife have a&nbsp;very happy physical relationship, showing them scampering into the bedroom and frequently touching one another. Was this a point Fox wanted to&nbsp;make clear to the public?</p><p>\"Yeah, it's important. When people ask me about my relationship with my wife, I say that it all depends who's the agent of motion at that time. But other than that it's all good,\" he replies, and although his face can't quite make the smile, the grin is in his voice.</p><p>Fox is still as boyishly handsome as he was when he appeared in Back to the Future at the age of 24, and the voice is the same one that once begged Doc Brown to return him to 1985. Born and raised in Canada in a military family where money wasn't plentiful, Fox started acting in his teens, partly for fun and partly for the cash. He has not needed the money in a long time, and he writes in his book about how much luckier he has been than most early-onset Parkinson's patients, who suffer crippling financial problems when they are forced out of work.</p><p>The&nbsp;first 20 minutes or so when we sit&nbsp;down are when he is at his most unsteady, and twitches and cramps roll&nbsp;through his body like water rolling over a rocky riverbed. After he was diagnosed with Parkinson's, he hid his&nbsp;illness from the public for years and he still sometimes tries to incorporate his tremors into seemingly deliberate gestures: an arm in sudden spasm will be forced upwards as though he simply meant to smooth his hair. Yet he never loses his strand of thought, and even if he struggles to find a word occasionally, he always gets it in the end.</p><p>His mental alertness is so vivid that I&nbsp;soon don't notice the physical shifts, which eventually calm from waves to&nbsp;small ripples anyway. He is also extremely funny and, as Fox says himself, the best way to overturn pity is to find the humour. When I ask him whether the secret to his and his wife's happy 25-year marriage is love or friendship, he replies without missing a beat: \"Regular animal sacrifices.\" When I later tell him that he looks in great shape, he replies with an audible wink: \"I move around a lot, you know.\"</p><p>Although Fox insists, \"I never set out to be heroic\", he knows that he is,&nbsp;nonetheless, the public face of Parkinson's. In the past, some people with the condition have criticised him&nbsp;for appearing on talkshows after taking his medication, thereby not showing the true effects of the illness. At the other extreme, radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh displayed the ignorance and cruelty for which he is so handsomely paid when he mocked Fox in 2006 for \"exaggerating the effects of the disease\" when he appeared in a political advert unmedicated. Does he feel conflicted about how best to present the disease to the public?</p><p>\"No, not at all. I take the medication for myself so I can transact, not for anyone else. But I am aware that it is empowering for people to see what I&nbsp;do and, for the most part, people in the Parkinson's community are just really happy that Parkinson's is getting mentioned, and not in a pitying way,\" he replies.</p><p>Fox has an absolute horror of being pitied and that is almost certainly another factor in his return to work.</p><p>\"Because of all the things I've done, nobody pities me, and that's great. I&nbsp;couldn't stand it,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107807'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904795095/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='200' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>As Marty McFly in the 1985 film Back to the Future. Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>Some people might have wanted a bit of pity if they were diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 30 with a young family, I say. He shakes his head sharply: \"Pity is just another form of abuse.\"</p><p>This determination to control the reaction to his illness also lies behind his well-known optimism. As the title to his autobiography makes clear, he considers getting Parkinson's \"a gift\", albeit \"one that keeps on taking\", and he has been an unflappable advocate in&nbsp;finding a cure. His eponymous foundation has raised more than $350m to fund research into Parkinson's and despite facing hurdles that would fell many – the Bush administration's opposition to stem cell research, for example – he has continued with determined equanimity. It took a few years to find this optimism and when he was first diagnosed he used to \"punch and pummel\" his arm when it started twitching. But these days, he is full of epigrams about looking on the bright side and some of his phrases feel as worn down as an ocean-tossed pebble, smoothed through years of repetition to reporters, his family, himself: \"You get what you get and you don't get upset\", \"It is what it is.\" He knows that some people might doubt the veracity of his attitude: \"But all my happy talk and rah-rah cheering, that's as real as someone else's anger. I chose not to choose anger,\" he says.</p><p>It was really his wife who helped him to make that choice. Fox and Pollan met when she played his girlfriend on Family Ties and he was helplessly smitten when she told him off one day for being rude. They got married in 1988.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tracy, I don't doubt that. People picture Tracy as this paragon of stoicism, this long-suffering wife, and that's all bullshit. This is my situation and she deals with it, and I never feel like, 'I'm sorry you have to put up with this' – it's nothing like that. When I told her about the Parkinson's I said to her, 'Are you in for this?' and she said, 'I'm in for it.' And that was it. It was still a struggle but that was a really great moment. She is so funny and she puts up with my happy idiot persona.\" Also, he adds with a look of delight, \"She is so HOT! Sometimes I look at her and I&nbsp;just can't believe it!\"</p><p>Fox has the tendency of those who have been through therapy to look at his past and see patterns and answers. As a celebrity, he grew used to the staring, the whispering, the sense of a&nbsp;loss of a control. When, in the late 80s, his drinking was getting out of hand (\"I&nbsp;come from a Canadian background: you drink to the point of saturation\"), he employed the same tools to dry up that he would later use to cope with Parkinson's: \"Accepting your powerlessness with grace.\"</p><p>So fame and alcoholism helped prepare him for Parkinson's?</p><p>\"Exactly. It was perfect.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107808'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904631733/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the 1985 film Teen Wolf. Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>When Fox was first diagnosed with Parkinson's, after noticing his little finger twitching during the filming of Doc Hollywood, he was at a tricky point in his career. Family Ties and the Back to the Future franchise had ended and he, along with many other 80s teen idols, was realising that audiences were not so sure if they wanted to see him play a grownup. He grabbed any role he could, appearing in the underrated The Hard Way and the more successful but less smart Doc Hollywood. When he was diagnosed he decided to appear only in things he actually liked, starting with a return to TV in Spin City and doing the voiceover in Stuart Little. Would he have been able to step back if he hadn't become ill?</p><p>\"I don't think so – there was too much ego going on. I also don't think I&nbsp;could have curtailed my drinking without [the diagnosis], and maybe my wife and I would have drifted apart because of that. I don't know.\" This is why he believes getting Parkinson's was a gift. But while he no longer resents getting the disease, he definitely wants to find the cure.</p><p>Fox has spoken in the past with moving certainty about the likelihood of a cure being found imminently and how he plans to \"dance at my children's weddings\". Does he still think about&nbsp;it?</p><p>\"Finding a cure? I don't view that as&nbsp;something that will happen in my lifetime,\" he says.</p><p>I'm astonished at this crack in the optimism. Really?</p><p>He looks, for the first time, a little sad: \"That's – that's not my purpose, to find a cure for myself, and that's not noble of me, that's just the way it goes. But I know somebody will one day figure it out,\" he says, and he takes another drink of water.</p><p>Fox's office is on the ground floor of the Upper East Side apartment building where he lives with his family. It is&nbsp;a rarefied, leafy neighbourhood, peppered with museums and private schools, just two blocks from where his wife lived as a child, and he clearly loves being a part of her world, which is so far from the one in which he grew up. When he talks about his wife's childhood, I mention that I, too, grew up a few blocks away.</p><p>\"What school did you go to?\" he immediately asks, like the New York dad he is.</p><p>I mention a nearby school and his eyes pop happily: \"That's where my girls went!\" I try to return to asking questions about him, but he's not having any of it: \"So you're one of those girls! Now I get it. Wow!\" he grins and looks at me in an almost paternal way. He proceeds to reel off the names of teachers I'd long forgotten: \"Did you have her? She was quite imperious and frightening.\"</p><p>At the end of our time together, I ask him for something that I have never before asked of an interviewee: a photo. He cheerfully agrees and slings an arm over my shoulders as I fumble with my phone. Afterwards he forces his arms around my body, cradling me with fatherly care. Back outside I&nbsp;look down at my phone. In each of the pictures, his face is&nbsp;slightly blurred due to the tremors. But his gaze never wavers and his eyes stare straight back at the viewer, hard and clear and bright.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419099563|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|8ce1d2d2250e58b601dc81b6ef3882f923ab1f07 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ayub Khan-Din began his career as an actor, starring in the 1987 film <em>Sammy and Rosie Get Laid</em>, and making small screen appearances in soaps such as <em>Coronation Street </em>during the 1990s. Born in Salford, his experience of growing up in a British-Pakistani family inspired his first stage play, <em>East Is East</em>, which was nominated for a Laurence Olivier award in 1998. The following year saw the release of the critically acclaimed film adaptation, with a sequel, <em>West is West,</em> in 2010.  His latest adaptation brings ER Braithwaite's novel, <em>To Sir, With Love</em>, to the stage and is touring the UK.</p><h2><strong>Qawwali Flamenco by Faiz Ali Faiz, Duquende, Miguel Poveda and Chicuelo</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096167'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883894394/Faiz-Ali-Faiz.-001.jpg' alt='Faiz Ali Faiz.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Faiz Ali Faiz. Photograph: Stephanie Paschal/Rex</figcaption></figure><p>I love the passion in flamenco and qawwali music. There are many similarities between the two. I've seen both [genres] played live individually, but never on the same stage. I listen to music all the time, especially when I am working.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/fiction.features2\">Family Matters by Rohinton Mistry</a></strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096168'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883924919/Rohinton-Mistry.-001.jpg' alt='Rohinton Mistry.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rohinton Mistry. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I love this book because it gives you a real taste of life within the Parsi community of Mumbai. I lived for about five months in Mumbai and the book is written about the period which I was there, so it brings back lots of memories. I love Indian writers because they all have such a strong influence on the areas of India that they come from and for me, as a writer, it's almost like a shorthand to be able to revisit those places. Rohinton Mistry writes fantastic dialogue as well, so you really get a sense of the personalities on the page.</p><h2><strong>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096169'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380885111581/The-Metropolitan-Museum-o-001.jpg' alt='The Metropolitan Museum of Art.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Photograph: Brooks Walker</figcaption></figure><p>I had a musical on Broadway in which I had to take over the lead part because, after the second performance, my leading actor fell down some steps, damaged his arm and couldn't go on. Either the show folded and lost over a million dollars or I took over. I ended up taking over for the whole run, so I was in New York for three or four months. I went to the Metropolitan Museum, which I thought was absolutely amazing. You could spend weeks going around the exhibits there. They've got this whole Egyptian temple (the Temple of Dendur) that they managed to save when the Aswan Dam was built, which I thought might be dull but they've done it so well.</p><h2><strong>Granada, Spain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096170'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883955970/The-Alhambra-in-Granada-S-001.jpg' alt='The Alhambra in Granada, Spain.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Photograph: Miguel Angel Molina/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>This is my local city. It's a stunning place to visit – I'd recommend it to anybody. They have the Alhambra, within which there's another palace where they have open-air concerts right through the year. We went to see a Spanish guitarist play there. Below the Alhambra there's the old Moorish town, a place called Albayzín, which is a maze of streets like you'd find in a North African souk.</p><h2><strong>Pippin at the Music Box Theatre, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096171'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884186784/The-cast-of-Broadways-Pip-001.jpg' alt='The cast of Broadway's Pippin.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cast of Broadway's Pippin. Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Pippin is an old musical which was on in the 1970s, but they've just redone it. The producer who worked on my musical (Bunty Berman Presents) produced this one as well. They've updated it and Cirque du Soleil play a major part in it. We took our kids along and it just blew their minds. I was never liked musicals at drama school, and when I told my friends I'd written one which was going on Broadway they laughed their heads off.</p><h2><strong>Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life, Tate Britain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096172'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884069042/The-Fever-Van-1935-by-LS--001.jpg' alt='The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry.' width='220' height='178' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry. Photograph: Walker Art Gallery/Tate</figcaption></figure><p>I grew up in Salford, [home of the] original gallery where most of the paintings were kept. It was a big old Victorian gallery with peeling paint. As young as 11 or 12, I used to go there and spend hours looking at the paintings, so it was great to see them in this exhibition, with a new appreciation of his work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419005195|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|15577eed63701ac195866a17334dae2f348eed6c -->",

        "headline":"All My Sons – review",
        "body":"<p>It hadn't occurred to me that there might be any issues attached to this Royal Exchange co-production with the black-led theatre company <a href=\"http://www.talawa.com/\" title=\"\">Talawa </a> of American playwright Arthur Miller's 1947 play. Then I read the correspondence on <a href=\"http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/event.aspx?id=717\" title=\"\">the Exchange's website</a>. People wondered whether the play would have to be directorially adjusted to accommodate a non-white cast. As far as I could see, Michael Buffong (who directed the award-winning production of Lorraine Hansberry's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/14/raisin-in-the-sun-hansberry\" title=\"\"><em>A Raisin in the Sun</em></a> for the Exchange in 2010) has made no changes to the text, nor were any necessary: skin colour is not Miller's theme; ideological orientation is.</p><p>A small businessman discovers that, to be fully human, he must look beyond the narrow limits of making money for his immediate family. In Miller's work, there is such a thing as society and we are all answerable to it. (I wonder: how many of the supposedly arts-loving Conservative party thronging the city visited the theatre during their conference visit?)When Don Warrington's Joe is finally forced to acknowledge that the strangers destroyed by his self-protective self-interest are \"all my sons\", the production reaches an intensity that fuses his statement into a declaration that is both emotionally wrenching and rationally convincing. Warrington is tremendous in this last act. So are Doña Croll, his ghost-haunted wife, and Chiké Okonkwo, his upright but blinkered surviving son. Each shatters the accretions of lies that have carapaced their characters with devastating precision.</p><p>On press night, the first two acts were less assured. Ellen Carins's set looks good, with its clapboard porch, garden benches and fallen apple tree (symbolically hinting at the lies that thread the play). But the dappled green lawn of the yard seemed too big for the actors, who fidgeted about trying to hit a collective rhythm. In a cast of 10, eight were making a first appearance at this demanding theatre in the round. It felt as if, as a company, they hadn't yet quite mastered the space. Hence, three stars on our new rating system. Given the quality of individual performances, though, I would expect that, by the time this review is published, it will be four (or more?).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983312|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|21fd04ac1aaf882df6d8fcceb670a02ae723de1d -->",

It’s 1997 and New York’s Manhattan Island has been converted into a maximum-security stockade surrounded by a 50ft “containment wall”. When Air Force One crash-lands and the president is captured by prisoners, special forces soldier-turned-bank-robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to get him out. Russell’s dry-witted, one-eyed antihero is the role of a lifetime, while the film’s look – high-tech police state outside, semi-destroyed cityscape inside – was partly created by a young James Cameron, then a special-effects artist, and proved hugely influential.",

Other homegrown highlights include Cath Staincliffe poking around Manchester's criminal underbelly, meanwhile, among the visiting names there is Neil Gaiman on his pirates-and-dinosaurs kids' adventure, and other highlights are ballet dancer-turned-writer Carlos Acosta, and Lionel Shriver who authors this year's Manchester Sermon.</p><p><strong><em>Various venues, Mon to 20 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>AB</em></p><h2>Yam Yam!, London</h2><p>Mixing food with theatre isn't for everyone, and those who tut at the unwrapping of a humbug probably won't have much fun here. But the combination makes perfect sense when trying to engage with audiences beyond the stage door and this festival uses creative imagination to do just that. There is a history of fried chicken to peruse, as well as cooking workshops that take in cuisine from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Plus, Jan Blake presents his stories about Mali, which should make for a delicious literary treat.</p><p><strong><em>The Albany, SE8, Sun to 16 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>FlipSide festival, Snape</h2><p>Rural Suffolk may not be the most obvious location for a festival of Brazilian literature, but that makes this weekend event all the more intriguing and appealing. Born out of a small Brazilian literary gathering called FLIP, this intimate festival presents Adriana Calcanhotto in concert tonight, preluded by Will Self in conversation with Bernardo Carvalho. British novelist Ian McEwan also talks with Milton Hatoum about his love of Brazil, his work and his inspirations.</p><p><strong><em>Snape Maltings, Sat &amp; Sun</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>Out &amp; about</h2><p><a href=\"http://powderhamfoodfestival.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Powderham food festival</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Devon foodies are joined by TVs Incredible Spice Men, Tony Singh and Cyrus Todiwala, who can tell their bhunas from their bhajis.</p><p><em>Powderham Castle, Saturday</em></p><p><a href=\"http://london.vegfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Veg Fest UK</strong></a><strong>, London, Saturday &amp; Sunday</strong></p><p>London leg of the huge herbivore gathering which features food (duh) plus comedy sets from Dave Spikey and the excellent Andrew O'Neill.</p><p><em>Olympia, W14</em></p><p><a href=\"http://cupararts.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cupar arts festival</strong></a><strong>, Saturday to 17 Oct</strong></p><p>Annual arts shindig in the Scottish market town; including art inspired by porridge oats.

        "body":"<p>Over-exposure has been a hot topic in pop discourse of late. Anyone holding Haim's current media ubiquity against them, though, might do well to contemplate the stranglehold on tittle-tattle and moral outrage exercised by one singer from Tennessee. She is currently embroiled in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\">ugly exchange with Sinéad O'Connor</a> over her raunchy image. Those easily shocked by calculation in pop should look away now.</p><p>Last spring, Miley Cyrus dropped a song called We Can't Stop. In tandem with its <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/miley-cyrus/we-cant-stop-music-video/1923501/\" title=\"\">ribald video</a>, it did unspeakable things to the memory of Hannah Montana, the tween star once played by Cyrus. A party anthem, this album's lead single endorses ecstasy (\"dancing with Molly\") and twerking, essentially the 21st-century US urban version of \"slack\" Jamaican dancehall moves. If the song sounds like a Rihanna number, <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1566461/miley-cyrus-we-cant-stop-originally-intended-for-rihanna\" title=\"\">that's because it nearly was</a>. When Cyrus twerked at MTV's Video Music awards back in August, <a href=\"http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125139/Miley-Cyrus-Raunchy-VMAs-Performance-Helps-Star-Gain-213104-Twitter-Followers-And-Sell-90000-Downloads\" title=\"\">her social media profile increased 112%</a>, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine. Then there was the video for Wrecking Ball, a power-ballad turbo-charged by the fact that Cyrus is starkers for much of the video, sometimes licking a mallet.</p><p>To coincide with the release of <em>Bangerz</em>, her fourth album, MTV US screened a documentary, <em>Miley Cyrus: The Movement</em>, that purported to show how <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/articles/mtv-miley-cyrus-the-movement-documentary/\" title=\"\">this brouhaha has been gleefully choreographed by a stage brat-turned-wild child</a>, one with a gimlet eye on the big time, whose last album – 2010's <em>Can't Be Tamed</em> – pretty much flopped. When it's not an almighty attention-seeking device, <em>Bangerz</em> is an album about very public heartbreak. In an announcement that chimed fortuitously with the build-up to <em>Bangerz</em>'s release, it was recently confirmed that Cyrus's four-year relationship with actor Liam Hemsworth is no more.</p><p>Against big odds, this craven album actually begins with the calm musical resolution of Adore You, a bid for the listener's sympathy, and one of its least showy and most successful cuts. Here are unhurried beats, a few chords and Cyrus's languorous vocal, \"ah\"-ing and \"hey\"-ing into a song about power imbalance in love.</p><p>As the title suggests, another heartbreak track, FU, is less resolved, but just as interesting. Here, Cyrus liberates her inner Christina Aguilera in the company of rapper French Montana, blending old-time jazzy balladry, I Put a Spell on You, romantic righteousness and dubstep sub-bass. Including recent US No 1 Wrecking Ball, the heartbreak section of <em>Bangerz</em> mostly repays your attention. More intriguing genre experiments follow – not least My Darlin', essentially a pimped-up version of Ben E King's Stand By Me.</p><p>But for all the mash-ups, <em>Bangerz</em> feels stitched together in the dark, and the attention-seeking begins to grate. Setting aside the sexual content of Cyrus's recent oeuvre, the crux of the internet chat has been her new fetish for R&amp;B and southern hip-hop. This really is not the first time a Southern white singer has appropriated poses first developed in African-American contexts (Elvis, Justin Timblerlake), or, indeed, the first time a former teen pop starlet has turned to R&amp;B for a raunchy style reboot (Aguilera, Britney Spears). Pharrell Williams, who mentored Cyrus through the project, is sympathetic (\"Why is she twerking?… She's a product of America,\" he says), but others feel uncomfortable with the <a href=\"http://www.waywordradio.org/ghetto_pass/\" title=\"\">\"ghetto pass\"</a> Cyrus has issued herself, like so much fake ID.</p><p>It might be a different story if many of the hip-hop- and R&amp;B-inspired cuts were better. SMS (Bangerz) is a bad rip-off of Salt-N-Pepa's Push It, with a phoned-in Britney guest spot. Love Money Party, meanwhile, finds Cyrus rapping a series of non-sequitur buzzwords, gibberish loosely connected by a bit of production, driven by the inescapable purpose of <em>Bangerz</em>: a desire to wind people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418843838|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ff9b832b68b1114a94add370d9a15bd0013e4cc1 -->",

        "headline":"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding – review",
        "body":"<p>It's always a jolt to remember that the first two Bridget Jones books, published way back in the 90s, predated texting, tweeting, Facebook and internet dating: the constant stream of personal updates pinging between our devices in 2013. Her diary-style abbreviations, number-crunching obsessiveness over trivia and jokey combination of self-exposure and self-deprecation have had such an influence on the tone of social media that we all sound like Bridget now.</p><p>So it's no surprise that Helen Fielding was tempted to let Bridget loose on what looks like her natural terrain. Think what opportunities modern technology offers for embarrassment: the erroneously forwarded email, the ill-advised drunken text, the disastrous internet date. What's surprising, and cheering, is that rather than freeze-framing her as the eternal thirtysomething, Fielding has allowed Bridget to age in real time, making her 51 (and in need of glasses to operate her smartphone).</p><p>More shockingly, instead of the dissatisfied divorcee one might have expected, Bridget is now a tragic widow. Mark Darcy has died a typically noble death, leaving her with two small children, Billy and Mabel. These days, as well as counting calories and alcohol units, she's also totting up nits on the comb and bags of grated cheese scoffed&nbsp;from the fridge while making the kids' supper.</p><p>Having had children late, and been bereaved, she's once again out of step with her friends, just as she was with the \"smug marrieds\" of her 30s. Now Jude is on the internet dating not-so-merry go round, Tom is obsessed with boutique hotel bargains on Laterooms.com, and glamorous Talitha is refusing to countenance that 60 might be middle-aged. Time has turned Daniel Cleaver from bad boy into sad case, unable to talk to a woman without inquiring after the colour of her \"panties\" and only good for a spot of inept babysitting.</p><p>And Bridget, after five years' mourning, is looking to get back into the dating game. But will the old rules still apply? \"Everything has changed since you were single,\" says Talitha. \"There was no texting. There were no emails. People spoke on telephones. Plus, young women are more sexually aggressive now, and men are naturally more lazy. You have to, at the very least, … encourage.\"</p><p>After launching herself on Twitter as @JoneseyBJ (\"Cannot figure out how to put up photo. Is just empty egg-shaped graphic. Is fine! Can be photo of self before was conceived\") and waiting for the followers to flood in, she hooks a \"toyboy\", 29-year-old Roxster, whose \"ripped\" body makes her the envy of her drooping middle-aged friends. Cue many comic tweets and texts, and a surprising number of fart and vomit jokes. There's the familiar agonising, with why-hasn't-he-called replaced by why-hasn't-he-texted, but mostly Roxster is funny, sexy and adoring enough to fulfil any woman's wishes.</p><p>Which is part of the problem: Bridget has been given such a tragic backstory, and the very grown-up burden of young fatherless children, that there's less traction to be had from dating niggles; and with so much darkness there already, Fielding seems unwilling to write any more in. There's a new sentimentality, even slushiness, to her old subjects of love, sex and loneliness; the familiar jaunty tone is reserved for playground politics and the chaos and cuteness of bringing up children.</p><p>But while the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years, in countless slummy-mummy columns and books by Allison Pearson or Gill Hornby (all influenced, of course, by Fielding herself). There's a beautifully judged scene where Bridget is pierced with ridiculous overwhelming love for her children, even as they poo and puke in the grip of illness, but mostly the crushed rice cakes, lost car keys and melon balls for the sports day picnic have been done to death.</p><p>Also, where Bridget in her 30s was an everywoman figure, here she's a very yummy mummy indeed. Darcy has left her financially secure, with no need to work on anything but her improbable screenplay, an updating of Hedda Gabler set in Queen's Park. It's up to Roxster, part of the impoverished younger generation, to introduce her to the delights of the night bus. It's odd how posh contemporary comic writing about motherhood tends to be, and Mad About the Boy is no exception. As Bridget floats fragrantly around her son's school concert at a stately home, or wells up at the choir service, all the while having heart-thumping encounters with a masterful teacher, the book starts to seem less like a satire on modern life and more like a good old Jilly Cooper.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194762|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|8d5db938cfaba4ca69f2a4926b47edb309160b8c -->",

        "body":"<p>Drawing, believes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\" title=\"\">Andrew Marr</a>, is much too important to be left to artists. Everyone should do it. The simple act of setting pencil to paper can change your life, maybe even help save it.</p><p>\"After my stroke,\" he says, sitting in his modest but stylishly done-up suburban house in London, \"I was lying in bed and just drawing pictures of the covers and the end of the bed: in a sense, nothing. But it starts you thinking, 'Oh yes, my mind's still there, I'm still engaging in the same way that I was.' I might not have the same skill because I can't move my arm properly, but the desire to do it is still there.\"</p><p>The morning is so pallid that the only colour seems to come from his collection of rollicking abstract paintings by <a href=\"http://www.alancristea.com/artist-Gillian-Ayres)\" title=\"\">Gillian Ayres</a>. Marr is nursing his left hand as he explains how his illness, and <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-21/andrew-marr-i-was-completely-delusional-about-how-ill-i-was\" title=\"\">slow recovery</a> this year, affects his ability to make pictures.</p><p>\"I can draw again all right, but because I still can't use this hand very well and it's not strong, holding the bit of paper or the notebook in one hand and drawing with the other is something I can't do. So I'll be drawing and the notebook will slip off my knees and I have to pick it up again. Sharpening pencils takes for ever. I drop things all the time, so I sit on a bench surrounded by pencils I've dropped, bits of rubber. It's a messier and slower business, but I can do it – which is great.\"</p><p>Then, in a bold thought that says a lot about him, he muses that having a stroke has actually made him a better artist. We talk about late Picasso, <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-death-of-actaeon\" title=\"\">late Titian</a> and late Cézanne, how they all got greater in old age; how his friend David Hockney says painting is <a href=\"http://www.redtedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/david-hockney-arrival-of-spring-2011.jpg\" title=\"\">an old man's game</a>. He's not old – he's 54 – but just as age made his heroes paint more wildly, his temporary loss of function has forced him to be more daring.</p><p>\"I think that, since the stroke, I've loosened up a bit because, to be honest, putting one line on a bit of paper takes me a little bit more effort than it did, so you don't want to waste the effort. And my big problem as a drawer has always been to be finickity, too dibbity-dabbity as they used to say.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419104516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902354721/Andrew-Marr-at-home-in-Lo-001.jpg' alt='Andrew Marr at home in London' width='200' height='271' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Andrew Marr at home in London Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Marr calls himself a \"drawer\", not an artist. In fact, the whole point of his new work, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, is that he is no artist – even though every illustration in it is drawn, painted or sketched on an iPad by him. Once, he argues, drawing was the basis of fine art. Today, it's barely taught by art schools, but that's a liberation for the rest of us: we can draw without having to judge the results as art.</p><p>Why should we spend our free time doing that instead of eating crisps and watching TV? Because, Marr believes, drawing – or any kind of skilled manual effort – frees you from the exhausting emptiness of modern life. He's amused when I say the book has \"moral fervour\". But it does. He tells me how western society with its obsessive consumerism and endless distractions totally misunderstands the nature of happiness. A truly happy life, he thinks, does not come from vacant chilling out: \"It's not going and lying on a fucking beach, you know? It's not just lolling about. I think it comes from making things and being connected to the rest of the world.\"</p><p>He cites the American political philosopher Matthew Crawford who now works as a motorcycle mechanic and whose book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/case-working-hands-michael-crawford\" title=\"\">The Case for Working With Your Hands</a> argues that to be whole people, we have to make things. Yet Marr's belief that drawing is a life-enhancing discipline (he jokes about \"the zen of drawing\") would equally have delighted the Victorian socialist art critics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/24/art\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/in-praise-of-william-morris\" title=\"\">William Morris</a>, who shared his belief that modern society has lost touch with what matters.</p><p>\"When you are doing something that you've got some inclination or talent towards, but which is not easy, and you're therefore completely concentrating on making something – that is, I think, when most people are happiest.\" For a farmer in touch with nature or a drawer sketching a tree, \"there's a dignity and a purpose to life, which you don't get from working in a call centre or being on television.\"</p><p>He laughs. Marr is not being vain in publishing his drawings: he makes no grand claims for them even though he has drawn seriously all his life and even considered going to art school, instead of Cambridge. \"I still wonder if I might have been better off going to art college,\" he says.</p><p>In terms of happiness? \"Yes.\"</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, by Andrew Marr, is published by Quadrille</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096149|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|187a759cdf92bf1c8701e7398649b8b271dc19fc -->",

        "body":"<p>Peter Jackson's fantasy trilogy The Hobbit has so far cost more than half a billion dollars, making it one of the most expensive back to back film shoots of all time.</p><p>Jackson's film series is currently budgeted at 676 million New Zealand dollars, which is $561m or £349m, <a href=\"mailto:http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peter-jacksons-hobbit-trilogy-has-643506\">according to a financial report filed in Wellington on Friday</a>. The figure, which provides a rare insight into the cost of Hollywood blockbusters, is more than twice the level of Jackson's previous trilogy The Lord of the Rings, based on JRR Tolkien's later tale of Middle Earth.</p><p>Costs for the three films have rocketed due to Jackson's decision to shoot in 3D and at 48 frames per second for additional image clarity. The final figure, once reshoots on the two remaining films are taken into account, is likely to be even higher. There may also have been extra costs incurred when Jackson chose to release three movies rather than the original two.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419227639'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2009/9/24/1253809758821/Hobbiton-001.jpg' alt='Hobbiton' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A $560 million trip to Hobbiton Photograph: Pierre Vinet/AP</figcaption></figure><p> Nevertheless, studios Warner Bros and MGM will most likely consider their money to have been well spent. The first film in the trilogy alone, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, has so far taken more than $1bn at the global box office despite lukewarm reviews in comparison to Jackson's previous films set in Middle Earth. More controversial could be the $98m which the New Zealand tax payer has contributed to the film series through a series of incentives brokered by Jackson in 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/27/the-hobbit-deal-new-zealand \">after strike threats led him to threaten to film in eastern Europe or Australia</a>. </p><p>The budgetary documents, filed online by New Zealand's Companies Office, suggest The Hobbit is one of the most expensive operations in which two or more films have been shot at once, though it is likely to have been beaten by the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films in terms of overall cost. By way of comparison, the back to back shoot for that series' At World's End and Dead Man's Chest has been estimated at between $450m and $525m. The Star Wars prequels cost $343m, according to Box Office Mojo, while Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is estimated at close to $500m.</p><p>The Hobbit is the tale of a hairy footed homunculus named Bilbo Baggins who sets out with 13 dwarves and a wizard, Gandalf, to wrest a priceless treasure from a sly old dragon. The next instalment in the trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug, is due out in December, with the final chapter, There and Back Again, set for December 2014.</p><h2>More on The Hobbit</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/01/hobbit-desolation-of-smaug-new-trailer\">Watch the trailer for The Desolation of Smaug</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/09/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-review\">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Peter Bradshaw's review</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419225433|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|2d079322fef27a6366559b916e7be62131ecd82c -->",

        "body":"<p>Wildlife photography today is an essential for television, vital for the travel industry and one of the best ways  to educate people about nature. But it took two Yorkshire brothers ready to go to almost hilarious extremes of deprivation and danger in the early days of photography to popularise it for the Victorians in the way that David Attenborough and others have done for modern screens.</p><p>Richard and Cherry Kearton, working in the 1890s, were possibly the world's first professional wildlife photographers. Starting at home in the village of Thwaite in north Yorkshire with a cheap box camera, they managed to capture some of the finest early pictures of birds in their nests, insects, and mammals. But having no telephoto lenses or fast film, they had to lug around massive plate glass cameras and devise ever more bizarre ways to get close to their shy quarries.</p><p>Nothing was too difficult to film for the brothers, one of whose film cameras has now been bought for £4,000 by the <a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Media Museum</a> in Bradford. In 1898, Richard Kearton, who had fallen out of a tree while collecting birds' eggs as a child and had one leg six inches shorter than the other, had a brainwave. He asked his butcher to buy an ox, skin it and send the hide to a London taxidermist, Rowland Ward of Piccadilly. The hollow bovine was a triumph. The brothers would carry it around, plant it in fields, ponds or anywhere close to birds' nests and then crawl inside its belly with the camera lens poking through a hole in its head.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419204926'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/10/2/1380718568909/Richard-and-Cherry-Kearto-009.jpg' alt='Richard and Cherry Kearton taking a photograph of a birds nest, 1900.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cherry and Richard Kearton at work. Photograph: Royal Photographic Society/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But the ox had several near-fatal drawbacks. Not only did the brothers have to endure excruciating back pain as they waited up to eight hours at a time to get a single picture, but in breezy weather it had a tendency to blow over – to the surprise of the birds they were filming. \"Once out of sheer agony I dropped from the bottom [of the cow]. Upon seeing me [the bird] sprang almost vertically in the air and, dropping among the grass, stared with outstretched neck in blank amazement,\" Richard Kearton recalled.</p><p>So successful was the false ox that the brothers experimented with ever more ambitious hides. They converted a sheep into a pneumatic camera, but it kept getting attacked by sheepdogs. They built a giant boulder and even a limestone wall, constructed moveable trees and disguised themselves as a rubbish dump in pursuit of their birds. To get pictures of a nesting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua\" title=\"\">skua</a> in the Orkneys, Richard Kearton dug a hole and covered himself with peat for days at a time. To film birds' nests the brothers would take their cameras and tripods 40ft into trees.</p><p>\"I have learned some of the sweetest secrets of the sod by transfiguring myself into a graminivorous [grass-feeding] animal, rock or innoxious object,\" said Richard.</p><p>The Keartons were regularly attacked by seabirds, slept in trees and on water and thought nothing of dangling on a rope 600ft above rocks to film birds nesting. Today, some of the methods they used would be questioned. They smeared honey on flowers and tree trunks to attract insects and would fire a revolver to disturb adult birds in order to locate nests before they descended from the clifftop with camera and tripod.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419204927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/10/2/1380718368318/Pioneer-wildlife-photogra-008.jpg' alt='Pioneer wildlife photographers Richard and Cherry Kearton' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The author with famous chimpanzee Toto as pictured in Photographing Wild Life Across the World, by Cherry Kearton</figcaption></figure><p>Cherry Kearton became the Attenborough of his age, moving into wildlife documentaries, working with US President Roosevelt and travelling on safari to east Africa, Borneo and elsewhere. He took some of the first film of the first world war, at Ypres, and went on to found a film company. He died on the steps of the BBC having just broadcast a film he had made about his pet ape, Toto.</p><p>His camera will feature in exhibitions of the war and wildlife photography, said a spokesman for the museum.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418851379|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|b9ec5efddf0780aa9eb46d05403c814e87fe508e -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Devon.    <br />      <br /><strong>The lineup</strong>: Rosie Lowe (vocals).  </p><p><strong>The background</strong>: The photo accompanying this column of today's new artist, with her jacket half on, covering her left side – unless it's some bizarre new avant-fashion statement comprising only half a jacket – makes us think of the famous front cover of Patti Smith's <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/PattiSmithHorses.jpg\">Horses</a>. Which is interesting because the artist in question, London-based singer-songwriter Rosie Lowe – who comes originally from Devon – doesn't operate in the area of rock, or punk, or poetic rock-punk, or whatever it was that Smith did, even if she does have some of her angular androgyny. No, she makes a slow, stealthily affecting kind of soul with intimations of stylised depravity, like Jessie Ware fronting the Weeknd during a lost weekend. And she's got some front, or at least that image above seems designed to telegraph that this music, for all the smoothness of the vocals, the jazzy languor and sultry immaculacy, is more of an affront than it seems. </p><p>Her debut EP, the Right Thing, is a collaboration with producers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/02/new-band-of-the-day-kwes0\">Kwes</a> and Dave Okumu of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/09/new-band-the-invisible\">the Invisible</a>, both capable of creating a ruffled sumptuousness, shiny surfaces with bumps and kinks. Her cameo appearance on Night Slugs alum Lil Silva's recent deep house anthem No Doubt didn't really offer any idea of her worth or her own work. The multi-instrumentalist  who sort of but not quite evinces a childhood exposed to the voices of Ella Fitzgerald and Bjork, who knows a thing or two about loops, pitch-shifting and distortion, and who is backed by an all-female band onstage, is a sonic adventurer in the guise of a stylish androgen. </p><p>The four songs on her EP, by the way, are all fabulous – it really is an EP of the year. Think a more machinic Mvula, or an xx-rated Sade. The title track is our kind of spacious, lightly-enhanced heartbreak R&amp;B, with beats – gentle detonations, really – reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5rx_Ne86eA\">first-album Drake</a>. 10k Balloons is almost folkish, with a superbly clear vocal backed by soft guitar strums and assorted echoes of silence. Games, from its title in, suggests high-life drama with a hint of sleaze (\"Won't you save me from these guilty games?\"), and if that doesn't get you, the killer chord changes will. Finally, there's Me and Your Ghost, a skewed synth hymn of spectral power with glitchy interference and atonal interruptions, like Rose Royce's Wishing on a Star refixed by Kid 606.
