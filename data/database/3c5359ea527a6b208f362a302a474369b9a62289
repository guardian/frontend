        "headline":"Breastfeeding for six months can delay breast cancer onset by a decade",
        "body":"<p>Breastfeeding is so protective against breast cancer that it can delay the onset of the disease by 10 years – but only among women who do so for over six months and do not smoke, new research has found.</p><p>The authors of a Spanish study of 504 female breast cancer patients aged 19 to 91, published in the Journal of Clinical Nursing, say that cases of the disease could be cut dramatically if many more women breastfed.</p><p>\"Breastfeeding for periods of over six months not only provides children with numerous health benefits, but also protects the mother from serious diseases such as breast cancer,\" says the research, led by Emilio González-Jiminéz of the University of Granada.</p><p>Non-smoking women who breastfed their baby for at least six months were diagnosed on average at the age of 68.4, more than a decade later than both non-smokers who had not breastfed or done so for less then three months who were diagnosed on average at 58 years, and non-smokers who had breastfed for between three and six months (57 years). Breastfeeding reduces a woman's risk of breast cancer by 4.3% for each year she does so, the authors say.</p><p>But female smokers who breastfed received no benefit in terms of when they were diagnosed with the disease, regardless of how long they fed their child naturally, the study&nbsp;found.</p><p>\"Based on these findings, the incidence of this disease could be reduced from 6.3% to 2.7% if women breastfed their children for more than six months,\" the authors say. A move away from breastfeeding is a crucial factor behind an increase in breast cancer cases, they add.</p><p>The findings confirm the results of other studies. Both breastfeeding and pregnancy are thought to help protect women against breast cancer by reducing oestregen levels.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415035324|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|24ebf25001d3ab8ea5c29ae6e2b5976f7a6f375d -->",

        "headline":"Should I breastfeed my baby to make him or her smarter?",
        "body":"<p>How can you make a population smarter? Last week, <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1720224\" title=\"\">research in the American journal</a> <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-07/tjnj-bda072513.php\" title=\"\">JAMA Pediatrics</a> showed that mothers' milk increases a child's intelligence. The study, from Boston Children's Hospital, found that breastfeeding for six months to a year was associated with better receptive language skills at three years and higher verbal and non-verbal intelligence scores at seven. A year of breastfeeding as a baby gave a seven-year-old 4.2 more IQ points – 0.35 of a point for each month it received its mother's milk.</p><p>While the evidence that breastfeeding reduces ear infections and gastroenteritis in infants has been strong for ages, it hasn't convinced women in the UK. Figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/22/breastfeeding-figures-fall-nhs-cuts\" title=\"\">released this month show a dip in the number of mothers who continue to feed after six to eight weeks</a> – already less than half. There is also considerable variation, with deprived areas recording rates as low as 20%.</p><p>The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months – advice followed by an estimated 2% of mothers. So, is this why the UK is slipping down the global educational league tables? And&nbsp;should you breastfeed to boost&nbsp;your child's IQ?</p><h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2><p>The debate about breastfeeding boosting intelligence has been raging for decades. There are many other factors that influence intelligence test scores, such as socioeconomic status, birthweight, birth order, parental education, the amount of stimulation the child gets, and the intelligence of a baby's mother. <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7575/945\" title=\"\">According to a paper in the BMJ</a>, there is a \"known association of maternal intelligence with both the initiation and duration of&nbsp;breastfeeding\".</p><p>Some research projects have been better than others at allowing for these factors. But researchers have also measured feeding differently – some defining it by asking if women have <em>ever</em> breastfed (eg for a couple of minutes) versus never breastfed. Most of these studies have found no significant increase in IQ. Others have asked more carefully about the exclusivity and length of feeding. At least one, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18458209\" title=\"\">a randomised controlled trial by the department of paediatrics at McGill University in Montreal that promoted breastfeeding</a>, did find an increase in the IQ of exclusively breastfed babies.</p><p>The Boston study has allowed for maternal intelligence, family income and measured breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. It is still unlikely to be the last word. Breastfeeding is not easy for everyone, but it can't be so difficult that less than half of us can do it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414242101|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|38284b4949f42b615d214cf0c486c4502c4c1ce9 -->",

        "body":"<p>It wasn't an ad the website had expected to see posted: a 29-year-old nurse offering to breastfeed a baby, for €100 a day. But they checked her out and the ad was legitimate: the woman, obviously the mother of a young baby herself, had identified a gap in the market for male <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/06/french-woman-breastfeed-service-gay-couples\" title=\"\">gay couples who have fathered children by adoption or via a surrogate</a>, and are looking for a healthier alternative to bottlefeeding.</p><p>So far, so 2013; and so too is the reaction. First, the health issues: you can't do that, shout the doubters, just as they did a few weeks ago when actor<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/jul/04/alicia-silverstone-breastmilk-donors\" title=\"\"> Alicia Silverstone suggested an altruistic milk bank</a> to bring together mothers with abundant milk, and mothers finding feeding difficult. Second, the yuck factor: isn't it just beyond tasteful (no pun intended) for a woman to put her nipple into another woman's baby's mouth?</p><p>Well, there's nothing new about women feeding other women's babies. It's called wet nursing, although with a name like that you can see why it needs a makeover; and it's basically as old as time. Through history, mothers who were unable to breastfeed or who chose not to do it (typically wealthy/high status women) would outsource it to other new mothers. Nature gave us two breasts apiece, after all, so we're clearly equipped to feed at least two babies and most births are to singletons.</p><p>So really, what's not to like? In my long breastfeeding career (I fed four babies to the age of three, a total of 13 years in all) I often donated to a milk bank (breastmilk is molten gold for premature babies, and the mothers aren't always able to feed). I also milk-shared for a friend's baby when he was having open-heart surgery and my friend was finding feeding difficult. And I once \"swapped\" babies with my best friend, which was interesting. Her son's latch felt very different to my daughter's; in some ways it felt a bit like taking a new lover, since breastfeeding is such an intimate activity; but the babies certainly didn't seem to mind. From their point of view, another woman's milk-filled breast, though definitely different from the one they were used to, is a lot less strange than a bottle would be. And certainly sucking from another mother's nipple wouldn't be as odd to a breastfed child as sucking from a plastic teat, which involves a very different oral technique (that's what \"nipple confusion\" is all about).</p><p>I suspect my breastfeeding experiences sound a bit odd to some people, though I'm certainly not the only long-term breastfeeder in the world and across history I'm pretty bog-standard. What's different in our culture is that most women breastfeed one or two babies for just a few months each, rather than a handful of babies through toddlerhood; which in my view is a shame, because long-term breastfeeding can be a wonderful thing and I'm sure more mothers and their babies could benefit from it. And a culture where long-term breastfeeding is normal is a culture that's confident about and comfortable with breastfeeding, whereas our culture is sadly neither of these things.</p><p>Feeding someone else's baby sounds no big deal to me, and if we hadn't made breastfeeding such an oddity, I doubt we'd be balking at one Parisan mother's imaginative and generous-spirited idea.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414527609|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|5876cf2cf23a5874cc5c5fcc968d3762d3711638 -->",

        "body":"<p>Breastfeeding is so protective against breast cancer that it can delay the onset of the disease by 10 years – but only among women who do so for over six months and do not smoke, new research has found.</p><p>The authors of a Spanish study of 504 female breast cancer patients aged 19 to 91, published in the Journal of Clinical Nursing, say that cases of the disease could be cut dramatically if many more women breastfed.</p><p>\"Breastfeeding for periods of over six months not only provides children with numerous health benefits, but also protects the mother from serious diseases such as breast cancer,\" says the research, led by Emilio González-Jiminéz of the University of Granada.</p><p>Non-smoking women who breastfed their baby for at least six months were diagnosed on average at the age of 68.4, more than a decade later than both non-smokers who had not breastfed or done so for less then three months who were diagnosed on average at 58 years, and non-smokers who had breastfed for between three and six months (57 years). Breastfeeding reduces a woman's risk of breast cancer by 4.3% for each year she does so, the authors say.</p><p>But female smokers who breastfed received no benefit in terms of when they were diagnosed with the disease, regardless of how long they fed their child naturally, the study&nbsp;found.</p><p>\"Based on these findings, the incidence of this disease could be reduced from 6.3% to 2.7% if women breastfed their children for more than six months,\" the authors say. A move away from breastfeeding is a crucial factor behind an increase in breast cancer cases, they add.</p><p>The findings confirm the results of other studies. Both breastfeeding and pregnancy are thought to help protect women against breast cancer by reducing oestregen levels.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415035324|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|24ebf25001d3ab8ea5c29ae6e2b5976f7a6f375d -->",
