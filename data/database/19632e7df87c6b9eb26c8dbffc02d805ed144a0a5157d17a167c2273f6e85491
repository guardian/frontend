We would ask all drivers to exercise extreme caution whilst driving tonight,&quot; the force tweeted.</p> <p>About 4,000 customers in Northern Ireland were without electricity on Friday morning after trees fell across power lines and electricity poles were broken. Emergency crews and engineers were assessing the damage and carrying out repairs.</p> <p>The storm was forecast to spread east across the whole of the UK throughout the morning, with the worst-affected areas expected to be northern England and northern parts of Wales, the Met Office said.</p> <p>Police and fire services across the country reported road closures because of uprooted trees.</p> <p>The Met Office recorded a gust of 109mph in Aberdaron, west Wales, early on Friday morning – with general wind speeds of between 60mph and 80mph expected in the UK.</p> <p>Dublin airport tweeted that it had had to divert six planes because of strong winds.</p> <p>The Irish Meteorological Service issued its highest weather warning, urging people to protect themselves from strong winds, heavy rain and very high seas arriving in the west and south of the country. The rest of the country was on &quot;amber alert&quot;, with the public told to be prepared for disruption.</p> <p>The UK Environment Agency warned of more significant disruption across southern England, saying: &quot;It is possible that heavy rain may worsen the current flooding situation in some areas with rivers responding quickly to rain falling on already saturated ground.&quot;</p> <p>The rain will exacerbate ongoing river flooding across the Somerset levels, river Severn, river Thames and river Ouse in Cambridgeshire and rivers across Essex, as well as along the Medway and the Kentish Stour around Ashford and Canterbury.</p> <p>There are 52 flood warnings and 157 flood alerts in place, but the EA said the number of alerts may increase as rivers respond to the further band of rainfall.</p> <p>More than 43,000 people were left without power following Monday night&apos;s storm and around 1,200 properties were flooded in England.</p> <p>Friday&apos;s storm was expected to cause fresh travel problems for airlines, train operators and bus companies as well as for drivers returning to work or home following the Christmas break.</p> <p>Network Rail advised that routes would need to be checked, tracks cleared of any fallen trees and any damage repaired before train services could start.</p> <p>Southeastern said it was unlikely to run any metro or mainline train services until at least midday, while Network Rail said services in Kent and East Anglia would be delayed.</p> <p>Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said: &quot;Passengers have had a tough week of travelling and unfortunately that is likely to continue for at least another day.</p> <p>&quot;Thousands of railway workers have worked tirelessly over the holiday period to try and repair the significant damage caused by Monday&apos;s storm and will be called on again over the next 24 hours.</p> <p>&quot;As ever, safety comes first, as we ensure routes are safe for passenger services, leading to a delayed start-up in some regions.&quot;</p> <p>Gatwick airport said it had &quot;additional teams of engineers, electrical staff and volunteers at the airport to minimise the risk of disruption from potential further flooding&quot;.</p> <p>Flights at Gatwick were affected on Christmas Eve after a power cut at the north terminal.</p>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2018511","internalRevision":"339","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Authorities warn of difficult

While the winds and rain are forecast to ease as the week progresses, people in Dorset, Oxfordshire, south Wiltshire, Hampshire and along the Thames were warned to remain prepared for more flooding in the coming days, with rain falling on already saturated ground.</p> <p>There was already flooding in parts of the Somerset Levels and rivers remained high, the agency said. It also warned of big waves and high tides on Dorset&apos;s south-west coast at Chesil beach and Chiswell, and urged people to stay away from coastal roads and paths.</p> <p>Coastlines in the south and Wales were particularly badly affected by the latest band of storms, with waves above 8 metres recorded at Land&apos;s End in Cornwall, while students in Aberystwyth on the mid-Wales coast were <a href=\"http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/important-info/notices/\" title=\"\">evacuated from seafront accommodation</a> and advised to stay away until further notice. High waves all but destroyed a historic seafront wind shelter.</p> <p>Leigh-Anne Bullough, a geography student moved from her house, described the conditions as &quot;pretty scary&quot;. The storms had seemingly eroded the ground under the wind shelter, she said: &quot;Now the whole floor of the shelter has collapsed and it&apos;s starting to fall in. If it gets any worse I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be there in the morning.&quot;</p> <p>In a post-Christmas update to parliament on the combined impact of more than a fortnight of storms, Paterson said seven people had died in England as a result of the weather, with 1,700 properties flooded in England and 140 in Wales. In all, 750,000 people were without power at some point, with 90% reconnected within hours. While he praised the overall response to the floods and power cuts, Paterson said some organisations had done better than others.</p> <p>He said: &quot;We will undertake a full assessment over the coming weeks, but initial reports have identified a number of positive aspects, as well as areas where lessons need to be learned. While the majority of local councils and utility companies responded effectively, the response of a few left room for improvement.</p> <p>&quot;All received early warning from the Met Office and the Environment Agency that severe weather was on the way. There are lessons to be learned about how customers are supported and informed during power cuts. We welcome the additional compensation some operators have announced and acknowledge the response of some companies could have been better.&quot;</p> <p>Paterson said &quot;more is being spent than ever before&quot; on flood protection, which would reduce the flood risk to 300,000 additional households. But responding to his statement, Eagle said the environment department&apos;s own figures showed spending on flood protection had fallen by £100m since 2010, again raising Paterson&apos;s record of questioning the impact and extent of climate change. She said: &quot;Can the secretary of state reassure the house that his failure to protect flood defence expenditure over other potential cuts has nothing to do with his own personal scepticism about climate science?&quot;</p> <p>Eagle also questioned the efficacy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/27/david-cameron-heckled-flood-yalding-kent\" title=\"\">visits such as David Cameron&apos;s to Yalding in Kent on 27 December</a>, where flooded householders told him they felt abandoned. She said: &quot;Those affected by these floods don&apos;t need stunts, and they don&apos;t need the buck passing that we heard from the environment secretary when he put the blame on staff absent over Christmas.&quot;</p> <p>A row also broke out over Cameron&apos;s claim the government will be responsible for record ever spending on flood defences. On Sunday, the prime minister said cash going towards flood defences would be &quot;more than the previous four year period.&quot;</p> <p>However, official figures show that government spending on flood defences will actually have dropped from £2.36bn in 2007-2011 to £2.32bn in 2011-2015. Asked about the discrepancy, officials admitted that the prime minister&apos;s claim of record spending includes another £148m of funding which is expected to come from the private sector.</p> <p>&quot;We&apos;re currently spending over £2.3 billion on tackling the risk of flooding and coastal erosion. Together with contributions from other partners, this is more money than ever before,&quot; a spokesman for the department of the environment, food and rural affairs said.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth criticised the prime minister&apos;s &quot;far from water-tight calculations&quot;, saying his claims do not stand up to scrutiny.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8521661","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021910","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>Environment secretary Owen Paterson accused of 'buck passing', while vast waves and strong winds batter coast</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Flood warnings continue as Britain is hit by more storms","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Walker, Matthew Weaver and Rowena Mason","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389034035301/Aberystwyth-wind-shelter--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yjef","wordcount":"798","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389034035301/Aberystwyth-wind-shelter--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56989629e4b0062d20370c36","newspaperPageNumber":"4","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-09T18:51:00+00:00","standfirst":"Environment secretary Owen Paterson accused of 'buck passing', while vast waves and strong winds batter coast","linkText":"Flood warnings continue as Britain is hit by more storms","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-15T06:48:13.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426421565"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/06/flood-warnings-continue-rain-storms","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/jan/06/flood-warnings-continue-rain-storms","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426459310","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389034040491/Aberystwyth-wind-shelter--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Barcroft Media","picdarUrn":"GD*40599359","suppliersReference":"127018","altText":"Aberystwyth wind shelter hit by waves","caption":"A seafront wind shelter in Aberystwyth is battered by waves.

The opposition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jan/06/uk-weather-live-wind-and-waves-prompt-more-flood-warnings#block-52cac581e4b053cde70d0166\">and Friends of the Earth</a>, said this was not the case. Public service unions accused the government of putting public safety at risk from budget cuts to agencies dealing with the impact of the flooding. Unison said staff cuts at the Environment Agency would &quot;seriously affect&quot; the agency&apos;s ability to cope with future disasters. The Public and Commercial Services union said eight coastguard stations were due to close, or were earmarked for closure, because of the cuts.</p> <p>• <strong>Sir David King, the government&apos;s special envoy on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>, said Britain needed to spend much more on flood defences.</strong> &quot;The important thing to get across is the simple notion that storms and severe weather conditions that we might have expected to occur once in 100 years, say, in the past may now be happening more frequently,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p> <p>• <strong>Paterson criticised some energy companies for not restoring power quickly enough to homes affected by the flooding since 23 December, and some councils for their inadequate response.</strong> “While the majority of local councils and utility companies responded effectively, the response of a few left room for improvement,” the minister said.</p> <p>• <strong>He challenged Labour to match government capital expenditure plans of £3.2bn up to 2021.</strong></p> <p><strong>• His Labour shadow, Maria Eagle, accused David Cameron of taking part in a “stunt” when he visited the flooded village of Yalding in Kent on 27 December.</strong> And she suggested that what she characterised as Paterson’s failure to protect flood defences might be linked to his scepticism about climate change.</p> <p>•<strong> Ulster MP Ian Paisley Jr – son of the former Northern Irish first minister – condemned people in Belfast who stole sandbags and sold them to &quot;vulnerable pensioners&quot;.</strong></p> <p><strong>• Seven people died due to the weather between 23 December and today. Flood defences protected 1m properties, Paterson said.</strong> Approximately 1,700 properties were flooded in England, and 140 in Wales. Around 750,000 properties were left without power, but for 90% that was restored within a day. The Thames Barrier, which protects London, was raised nine times in the last five days.</p> <p>• <strong>The<a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/\"> Environment Agency</a> is urging communities in Dorset, Oxfordshire, south Wiltshire, Hampshire and along the river Thames to remain prepared for more flooding today and the remainder of the week.</strong> The agency currently has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jan/06/uk-weather-live-wind-and-waves-prompt-more-flood-warnings#block-52cac6fee4b09f9df01d255f\">three severe flood warnings</a> (“danger to life”), all of them in the south-west, with 108 of the less serious flood warnings (“flooding is expected – immediate action required”), mostly in the Midlands, south-east and south-west.</p> <p>• <strong>A high tide bringing waves several metres high and strewn with debris forced the evacuation of Aberystwyth seafront.</strong> Police helped the local council take residents to safety, and urged storm watchers to stay away from the prom.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cadf5de4b09f9df01d258a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T16:53:02.221Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The parliamentary statement and debate have finished.

There are currently a further 108 flood warnings in almost every region in England and Wales.</p> <p>•<strong> A high tide bringing waves several metres high and strewn with debris, forced the evacuation of Aberystwyth seafront.</strong> Police helped the local council take residents to safety, and urged storm watchers to stay away from the prom.</p> <p>• <strong>Public service unions have accused the government of putting public safety at risk from budget cuts to agencies dealing with the impact of the flooding.</strong> Unison said staff cuts at the Environment Agency will &quot;seriously affect&quot; the agency&apos;s ability to cope with future disasters. The Public and Commercial Services union said eight coast guard stations were due to close, or were earmarked for closure, because of the cuts.</p> <p>• <strong>Environment secretary Owen Paterson is to make a statement at 3.30pm to the House of Commons about the impact of the floods.</strong> He chaired another meeting of the government&apos;s emergency committee today.</p> <p>• <strong>Sir David King, the government&apos;s special envoy on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>, says Britain needs to spend much more on flood defences. </strong>&quot;The important thing to get across is the simple notion that storms and severe weather conditions that we might have expected to occur once in 100 years, say, in the past may now be happening more frequently,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T17:20:48.878Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52caaafce4b09f9df01d2536\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T13:12:15.234Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The steps of the<a href=\"http://www.ifordbaptistchurch.co.uk\"> baptist church</a> was the prime flood-watch spot for residents of <a href=\"http://www.sinesparks.co.uk/iford_bridge.aspx\">Iford Bridge Home Park</a> in Dorset, writes <strong>Steven Morris</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 90 residents who were evacuated from this riverside spot – picturesque at most times of the year – took it in turns to look over the floodwater and sigh at the damage caused to their homes.</p> <p>“It&apos;s a crying shame,” said resident and park manager Ken Ayres, who has lived here for 10 years and never known it so bad. “People are sad, angry, frustrated. Some of them don&apos;t have insurance and they haven&apos;t got a clue what they&apos;re going to do next.”</p> <p>The Environment Agency (EA) issued a severe flood warning for the estate after high tides forced water from Christchurch Harbour up the swollen River Stour. The tidal water met the river water at Iford Bridge and all 65 homes on the park were flooded. So deep and fast-flowing was the water that the EA said there was a <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/34681.aspx?area=111FWFSTOL819&amp;page=1&amp;type=Region&amp;term=Southwest\">“significant risk to life.” </a></p> <p>Ayres said the last time the flooding here was so severe was back in the late seventies when water almost covered the roofs of some homes. But this Christmas period has been a miserable one for residents here.</p> <p>They were first woken up in the early hours of Christmas morning and evacuated. They returned to their sodden homes two days later and began to clean up only to be told again to get out at the end of last week. Since then they have been watching and waiting.</p> <p>Some have been staying with friends and relatives, others have been put up by Bournemouth borough council in local hotels. Four have camped in the baptist church, sleeping on air-beds, to keep an eye on the estate.</p> <p>As of lunchtime Monday, the EA&apos;s severe warning remained in force. Twenty two homes still had water in them. Five, according to Ayres, were likely to be condemned. “And the problem is that the insurance companies won&apos;t want to know after this. Two out of the five condemned places don&apos;t have insurance so they&apos;ve lost everything.”</p> <p>Measures have been taken here in recent years to try to alleviate the flood risk including building a bund – a flood wall – and planting willows along the banks. “But when it&apos;s as bad as this nothing helps,” said Ayres. “We have to accept this is a floodplain, after all.”</p> <p>Councillor <a href=\"http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/CouncilDemocracy/Councillors/Councillors/CouncillorLawrenceWilliams.aspx\">Lawrence Williams</a> said residents had been co-operative when they were told they had to leave for the second time. “We could have enforced the evacuation but we didn&apos;t need to - everyone left,” he said.</p> <p>Williams was on the church steps with residents on Sunday as the waters receded and it looked as if they would be able to get back to their homes. But the high tide and the torrential rain upstream once again conspired to keep them out. “We&apos;ve become experts in tide levels,” he said. The good news is that the tides are decreasing, the bad news that more heavy rain is expected before the wet spell ends.</p> <p>But Williams remained optimistic. “With a bit of luck people will be able to get back tomorrow [Tuesday],” he said. And begin the slow process of mopping up, drying out and putting their lives back together.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T13:28:41.547Z\">at 1.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52caa338e4b09f9df01d2521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T12:39:34.739Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another union has highlighted the impact of government cuts to flood defences and emergency services. </p> <p> The<a href=\"http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/storms-show-need-to-retain-coastguard-knowledge\"> Public and Commercial Services union said three Coastguard stations have already close</a>d and five others - Swansea, Liverpool, Walton on the Naze, Brixham and Portland - are earmarked for closure.</p> <p>The union is warning that lives could be lost as resources were already thinly stretched before the bad weather set in.</p> <p>PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: &quot;The response to the storms shows just how invaluable the local knowledge and expertise of Coastguard staff are to our coastal communities. &quot;Ministers must put an immediate halt to their station closure plans that we continue to believe will put lives at risk.&quot;</p> <p>Earlier Unison said government cuts were putting public safety at risk. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52caa16ce4b09f9df01d251f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-06T12:32:24.576Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/52a028a8e4b0acc591790cd5\">GuardianWitness</a> users continue to track the impact of the storms.

The transport network has been hit again, with roads closed and trains delayed or cancelled in many areas. <br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/\">First Great Western</a></strong> warned passengers there was a risk to services in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset.</p> <p>• In Oxford a 47-year-old man died when his mobility scooter fell from a flooded path into a river. <br />Thames Valley Police were called to Osney Lock near the city centre at 6.30pm on Saturday after receiving a report that the man had fallen into the river. Searches were carried out in south Devon over the weekend for missing 18-year-old university student Harry Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the weather - with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him. Two people have already died in the storms. A 27-year-old man from Surrey was found on Porthleven Sands beach in Cornwall after he was swept out to sea on New Year&apos;s Eve night and a woman died after being rescued from the sea in Croyde Bay, north Devon.</p> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/05/uk-prepare-extreme-weather-floods\">Sir David King</a></strong>, the government&apos;s special envoy on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>, says Britain needs to spend much more on flood defences. &quot;The important thing to get across is the simple notion that storms and severe weather conditions that we might have expected to occur once in 100 years, say, in the past may now be happening more frequently,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>

Some of them don&apos;t have insurance and they haven&apos;t got a clue what they are going to do next.&quot;</p> <p>On Monday it was Dorset&apos;s turn to feel the full force of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/06/flood-warnings-continue-rain-storms\" title=\"\">deluge that has battered the UK for more than a fortnight</a>. The Environment Agency issued three severe flood warnings for the county – meaning there is a danger to life – while the Met Office published a weather warning for high winds, crashing waves, thunder and hail.</p> <p>In Weymouth and Portland, residents, drivers and pedestrians were advised to stay away from beaches and causeways that were being overtopped by towering waves and bombarded by shingle. A section of promenade near Christchurch collapsed after being battered for days, while St Mary&apos;s, a historic church at Charminster, was inundated.</p> <p>Firefighters had to help pump out homes, and rescued one elderly motorist who had been trapped in his car near Blandford Forum by floating him to safety using an inflatable sled.</p> <p>But it was at Iford Bridge that the cost could be most clearly seen. The problem here was that high tides forced water from Christchurch harbour up the river Stour, which has been swollen by torrential rain since before Christmas. &quot;It&apos;s as if the two blocks of water meet here and have nowhere to go,&quot; said Ayres. So the water poured into Iford Bridge Home Park, a riverside estate of modest homes – many of them owned by retirees who moved there for the peace and the picturesque views. All 90 residents were forced to move out.</p> <p>Ayres reckons five of the homes will have to be condemned. &quot;And the problem is that the insurance companies won&apos;t want to know after this,&quot; he says. &quot;Two out of the five condemned places don&apos;t have insurance, so they&apos;ve lost everything.&quot;</p> <p>This is not a place that has flooded badly in recent years. The last time there was a severe inundation was back in the late 70s, when the waters lapped up close to the roofs. Measures have been taken to try to alleviate the flood risk including building a bund – a flood wall – and planting willows along the banks. &quot;But when it&apos;s as bad as this, nothing helps,&quot; said Ayres. &quot;We have to accept this is a flood plain, after all.&quot;</p> <p>Lawrence Williams, a councillor, said residents had been co-operative when they were told they had to leave. &quot;We could have enforced the evacuation but we didn&apos;t need to: everyone left,&quot; he said. Williams was nursing a cup of coffee on the Baptist church steps as high tide came and went on Monday afternoon. Over the next few days the tides are easing off, but residents have been told they will have to stay away until at least Wednesday.</p> <p>Some have sought refuge with friends and relatives; others have been put up by Bournemouth borough council in local hotels; four are camping in the Baptist church, sleeping on air beds, to keep an eye on the estate.</p> <p>Another resident, who called herself Christmas Carol (because she was born in the festive period), said it was frightening when she was told she had to leave. &quot;You don&apos;t know what to think, do you?&quot; she said</p> <p>She was desperate to return to her small bungalow to begin cleaning up. &quot;Life&apos;s on hold at the moment. I&apos;m already fed up with thinking about tide times and water levels. I don&apos;t really understand it all and I&apos;m not sure anyone else really does. I want to get back home and get on with my life.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8522301","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021968","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Environment Agency issues three severe flood warnings for county as deluge swamps flood plains at Iford Bridge","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Retirees forced to abandon homes as Dorset feels full force of Britain's floods","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Steven Morris","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/6/1389040755868/Swans-in-floodwater-from--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yjgj","wordcount":"666","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/6/1389040755868/Swans-in-floodwater-from--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56a1df04e4b0a5f019fc0d52","newspaperPageNumber":"4","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-09T20:46:01Z","standfirst":"Environment Agency issues three severe flood warnings for county as deluge swamps flood plains at Iford Bridge","linkText":"Retirees forced to abandon homes as Dorset feels full force of Britain's floods","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-22T07:50:00.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426428220"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/dorset-severe-flood-warnings-britain","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/06/dorset-severe-flood-warnings-britain","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426429505","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2014/1/6/1389040763728/Swans-in-floodwater-from--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*40541141","suppliersReference":"WEATHER_Flood_115599.JPG","altText":"Swans in floodwater from the river Stour at Iford Bridge Home Park near Bournemouth","caption":"Swans in floodwater from the Stour at Iford Bridge Home Park near Bournemouth, where all 90 residents were forced to move out.

The short answer – if you take into account inflation – is no: there will have been a cut in real terms. Furthermore, a real-terms comparison between what was spent on flood defences in the last year of Labour&apos;s budget – £646m in 2010-11 – and the last year of the coalition&apos;s current spending plans – £546m in 2015-16 – shows a 15% drop.</p> <p>But Cameron&apos;s claim can be made true – just – with the following argument. First, ignore inflation. Even then, total government spending on flood defences in the current four-year spending period – £2.134bn – <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/blog/camerons-claims-flood-defences-dont-stack\" title=\"\">falls short of that in the previous spending period by £102m</a>. But the government claims a new partnership funding scheme – largely taken from local authority budgets – will deliver £148m by 2015. So, assuming the partnership money materialises, Cameron can claim that 2% more – £46m – will be spent.</p> <p>But there are two important caveats. First, the early years of the 2006-10 period – including low-spending years before the devastating flooding of 2007 – led ministers to ramp up funding. Second, climate change is driving up the risk of flooding far faster than any increase in spending on defences – whichever way you do the accounts.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8522153","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021945","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>The prime minister says his government will have spent more between 2011 and 2015 than Labour from 2006-10</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Does David Cameron's claim on flood defence spending hold water?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Damian Carrington","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389037259996/David-Cameron-talks-with--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yjfn","wordcount":"237","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389037259996/David-Cameron-talks-with--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"569827c7e4b0062d2036c33c","newspaperPageNumber":"4","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-09T19:41:00+00:00","standfirst":"The prime minister says his government will have spent more between 2011 and 2015 than Labour from 2006-10","linkText":"Does David Cameron's claim on flood defence spending hold water?","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-14T22:57:15.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426425530"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/david-cameron-claim-flood-spending","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/06/david-cameron-claim-flood-spending","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-428984858","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2014/1/6/1389037265197/David-Cameron-talks-with--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*40455716","suppliersReference":"LON003","altText":"David Cameron talks with a resident in flood affected home in Yalding","caption":"David Cameron talking with a victim of the recent floods in Yalding.

Forecasters are warning that coastal areas could see more flooding as the heavy rain and gusts of wind continue to batter Britain.</p> <p>In Aberystwyth, people in seafront properties were again evacuated to a rest centre at a local school. Across the UK dozens of flood warnings, including one severe, remain in place.</p> <p>The highest level of warning, indicating danger to life and property, was issued by the Environment Agency (EA) for the Lower Stour in Dorset.</p> <p>Western and southern areas are bearing the brunt of the latest severe weather, with large waves hitting coastlines throughout Devon, Cornwall and Wales.</p> <p>The EA issued one severe flood warning for Iford Bridge Home Park near Christchurch, Dorset.</p> <p>There are also 105 flood warnings – where flooding is expected – across almost every region in England and Wales, and 219 flood alerts in force.</p> <p>The Met Office issued a &quot;be aware&quot; yellow warning for wind as gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) are expected on the west and south-west coast of Britain and the east coast of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It said bands of heavy showers would continue to move eastwards across parts of the UK accompanied by squalls, along with hail and thunder.</p> <p>Up to a centimetre (0.4 inches) of rain could occur in less than an hour with, locally, up to 2.5cm of rain through Monday and perhaps as much as 3.8cm on high ground.</p> <p>&quot;The public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding leading to difficult driving conditions, with hail providing an additional hazard,&quot; a Met Office spokesman said.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has largely escaped any serious flooding or damage. Police announced plans to hand out sandbags in a number of towns close to the County Down coast, which they believe could be vulnerable to the high tides, wind and rain.</p> <p>The EA has estimated that about 220 properties have been flooded so far but more than 205,000 properties have been protected as miles of coastline have been battered.</p> <p>Communities in Dorset and Oxfordshire should remain prepared for significant flooding in the lower reaches of the Thames, the Stour, Dorest, and the Frome, the EA said.</p> <p>Continuing flooding is expected on the Somerset Levels and rivers, including the Severn, remain very high after recent rainfall.</p> <p>The transport network has also been hit, with roads closed and trains delayed or cancelled in many areas.</p> <p>First Great Western warned passengers that there was a risk to services in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset.</p> <p>The Thames Barrier was in operation on Sunday night to protect people and property along the river. Three people have already died in the storms.</p> <p>In Oxford, a 47-year-old man died when his mobility scooter fell from a flooded path into a river.</p> <p>A 27-year-old man from Surrey was found on Porthleven Sands beach in Cornwall after he was swept out to sea on New Year&apos;s Eve night. A woman died after being rescued from the sea in Croyde Bay, north Devon.</p> <p>Searches are continuing in south Devon for missing 18-year-old university student Harry Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the weather – with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him.</p> <p>Officials around the UK have pleaded with people to keep away as dozens put their lives at risk by going to coastal areas to watch as the storm brought 12-metre waves crashing on to land.</p> <p>A man and child were almost swept away by a huge wave at Mullion Cove in Cornwall as they peered over the sea wall to watch the raging sea. Elsewhere in Cornwall vehicles driving on a coastal road were swamped and almost washed away by a tidal surge.</p> <p>Police pulled a man from the sea who had been drinking at Towan Beach, Newquay, after he ignored warnings about the storms.</p> <p>In Aberystwyth, a man was rescued by lifeboat after he became trapped when photographing waves from a harbour jetty.</p> <p>On Sunday, a homeowner was rescued after 13 days stranded in her flooded property.</p> <p>Anne-Marie Simpson had been cut off since a river near her house at North Curry on the Somerset Levels burst its banks when storms swept Britain on 23 December .</p> <p>She moved upstairs, stockpiled dry food and decided to wait it out until the water level receded but after the situation worsened, members of the Burnham Area Rescue Boat (BARB) rescued her and her dog, Elvis.</p> <p>Jonathan Day, flood risk manager at the EA, warned that the risk of flooding would continue this week.</p> <p>He said: &quot;Although high tides are now falling, there remains a risk of coastal flooding, especially on the south and west coasts.</p> <p>&quot;In addition, wet conditions have left the ground saturated in many areas, increasing the risk of river and surface water flooding.</p> <p>&quot;We would urge people to be prepared by checking their flood risk, signing up to free flood warnings and keeping an eye on the latest flood updates via the EA website and Twitter.</p> <p>&quot;Environment Agency teams remain out on the ground across the country and will continue to work around the clock to protect communities at risk.&quot;</p> <p>On Sunday, David Cameron pledged that lessons would be learned from the flooding and insisted that the EA has been given the funding to protect frontline services.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, is chairing a meeting of the government&apos;s Cobra emergencies committee to discuss the latest situation. He will make a Commons statement at 3.30pm on Monday.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8520158","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021632","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Western and southern areas bear brunt of latest severe weather with large waves hitting Devon, Cornish and Welsh coastlines","allowUgc":"false","headline":"UK storms bring more flood warnings and transport disruptions","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/6/1389011732939/Stormy-weather-in-Swansea-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yj47","wordcount":"968","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/6/1389011732939/Stormy-weather-in-Swansea-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56991242e4b0344549dbf66f","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-09T12:36:07Z","standfirst":"Western and southern areas bear brunt of latest severe weather with large waves hitting Devon, Cornish and Welsh coastlines","linkText":"UK storms bring more flood warnings and transport disruptions","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-15T15:40:12.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426384987"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/06/uk-storms-flood-warnings-transport-disruptions","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/jan/06/uk-storms-flood-warnings-transport-disruptions","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426385824","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/6/1389011737715/Stormy-weather-in-Swansea-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*40593337","suppliersReference":"3479167a","altText":"Stormy weather in Swansea","caption":"Stormy weather in Caswell Bay, Swansea.

Photograph: Steven Morris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Environment Agency (EA) issued a severe flood warning for the estate after high tides forced water from Christchurch harbour up the swollen River Stour. The tidal water met the river water at Iford Bridge and all 65 homes on the park were flooded. So deep and fast-flowing was the water that the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/34681.aspx?area=111FWFSTOL819&amp;page=1&amp;typ e=\" region&amp;term=\"Southwest&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">EA said there was a significant risk to life</a>. Ayres said the last time the flooding here was so severe was back in the late 1970s, when water almost covered the roofs of some homes. But this Christmas period has been a miserable one for residents here.</p> <p>They were first woken up in the early hours of Christmas morning and evacuated. They returned to their sodden homes two days later and began to clean up only to be told again to get out at the end of last week. Since then they have been watching and waiting.</p> <p>Some have been staying with friends and relatives, others have been put up by Bournemouth borough council in local hotels. Four have camped in the baptist church, sleeping on airbeds, to keep an eye on the estate.</p> <p>As of lunchtime on Monday, the EA&apos;s severe warning remained in force. Twenty-two homes still had water in them. Five, according to Ayres, were likely to be condemned. &quot;And the problem is that the insurance companies won&apos;t want to know after this. Two out of the five condemned places don&apos;t have insurance so they&apos;ve lost everything.&quot;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-426390664\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/6/1389014718025/Iford-Bridge-Home-Park-011.jpg\" alt=\"Iford Bridge Home Park\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iford Bridge Home Park.

A teenager remains missing in Devon.</p> <p>Strong winds, persistent rain and tidal surges are predicted for the UK for at least another two days, mostly in the south and Wales, as emergency services attempt to cope with the trail of devastation already caused by the severe weather.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings of ice and rain, predicting river and surface flooding as well as travel disruption, mainly in south Wales, the south-west and south-east of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Up to 40mm of rain could fall on higher ground.</p> <p>Coastal areas – particularly in southern England – are most vulnerable on Monday because of unusually high tides and the arrival of a strong Atlantic storm. The Thames barrier will remain closed to protect land near the river.</p> <p>Inland rainfall is expected to put pressure on rivers, endangering nearby communities including those along the river Medway in Kent, the Severn estuary in Gloucestershire and the Thames in Oxford.</p> <p>King raised the possibility that the storms are linked to climate change and said &quot;priority should be given to much more funding to create a better situation so we can face up to flooding in a proper manner on the British Isles.</p> <p>&quot;The important thing to get across is the simple notion that storms and severe weather conditions that we might have expected to occur once in 100 years, say, in the past may now be happening more frequently,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p> <p>&quot;And the reason is – as predicted by scientists – that the climate is changing and as the climate changes we can anticipate quite a radical change in weather conditions.&quot;</p> <p>King said a report he wrote in 2004 predicted that a sea-level rise, increased storm surges and increased intensity of rainfall would penetrate further inland, affecting cities and causing billions of pounds a year of economic damage. The Environment Agency estimated then that for every pound invested in flood defences the country would save about £7 or £8 in flood damage, he added. But a boost in funding for defences did not survive the recession.</p> <p>&quot;If we really want to manage this problem, and I&apos;m sure that all of us do, we will have to do two things,&quot; he said. &quot;One, get back to the higher investment level in flood defences and, two, push hard on the rest of the world in terms of mitigating the impacts of climate change and of course this is a big target for getting an international agreement.&quot;</p> <p>Thousands of people have lost power and about 200 have seen their homes flooded over the past few weeks, putting David Cameron under pressure over cuts to the Environment Agency&apos;s budget.</p> <p>On Sunday the prime minister insisted the UK would see record levels of spending on flood defences &quot;guaranteed right out into 2020 so [the Environment Agency] can really plan for the future&quot;.</p> <p>However, Labour accused Owen Paterson, the Conservative environment secretary of ignoring the increased risk of flooding because he is sceptical about climate change science.</p> <p>Maria Eagle, the shadow environment secretary, said Paterson had questions to answer about why he was allowing cuts at the Environment Agency that could affect Britain&apos;s ability to deal with severe weather incidents.</p> <p>Paterson chaired another meeting of the government&apos;s emergency committee &quot;to ensure everything is being done on the ground to prepare for bad weather ahead&quot;.</p> <p>Matt Dobson, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the rain &quot;simply has nowhere to go&quot; because weeks of severe weather had left the ground waterlogged and rivers rising over their banks.</p> <p>&quot;It&apos;s very unusual to have so many powerful storms come in one after the other in such a short space of time; we haven&apos;t seen anything like this since about 1991,&quot; he said.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8518497","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-06T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021387","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Sir David King says government needs to increase spending on flood defences, as storms continue to cause disruption","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Flood-hit UK must prepare for more extreme weather, says climate adviser","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason and Sam Jones","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388952160508/Newtownards-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ytm5","wordcount":"769","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388952160508/Newtownards-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"569791e1e4b04134557abbf1","newspaperPageNumber":"1","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-08T20:04:04+00:00","standfirst":"Sir David King says government needs to increase spending on flood defences, as storms continue to cause disruption","linkText":"Flood-hit UK must prepare for more extreme weather, says climate adviser","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-14T12:18:48.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426334121"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/05/uk-prepare-extreme-weather-floods","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jan/05/uk-prepare-extreme-weather-floods","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426334410","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388952166261/Newtownards-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","picdarUrn":"GD*40580443","suppliersReference":"XBFT102","altText":"Newtownards","caption":"Strong winds and high tides batter the coastal road close to Newtownards, Northern Ireland.

Photograph: Peter Morrison/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Britain remains in the grip of the worst run of winter storms for two decades, with 70 flood warnings in place throughout England and Wales and a further 217 areas on flood alert.</p> <p>The storms and floods have so far claimed three lives, including that of a man who is thought to have drowned in Oxford after his mobility scooter fell into a river on Saturday night.</p> <p>The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings of ice and rain, predicting river and surface flooding as well as travel disruption, mainly in south Wales and the south-west and south-east of England. Up to 40mm of rain could fall on higher ground.</p> <p>Coastal areas – particularly in southern England – are most vulnerable because of unusually high tides and the arrival of a strong Atlantic storm. The Thames barrier will remain closed to protect land near the river. Inland rainfall will put pressure on rivers, endangering nearby communities including those along the river Medway in Kent, the river Severn estuary in Gloucestershire and the river Thames in Oxford and Osney, where the latest death occurred.</p> <p>Thames Valley police were called to Osney Lock at 6.30pm on Saturday after receiving a report that a man apparently driving his mobility scooter along a flooded footpath had fallen into the river. The 47-year-old man, from the Oxford area, was pulled from the lock but died at the scene. His death follows those of a 27-year-old man from Surrey, who was found on Porthleven Sands beach in Cornwall after he was swept out to sea on New Year&apos;s Eve night, and a woman who died after being rescued from the sea in Croyde Bay, north Devon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, dozens of volunteers in south Devon have resumed their search for missing 18-year-old student Harry Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the weather.</p> <p>The strong winds, persistent rain and tidal waves are predicted to batter the UK for at least another two days, as emergency services attempt to cope with the trail of devastation already created by the severe weather. Matt Dobson, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the rain &quot;simply has nowhere to go&quot; because weeks of severe weather had left the ground waterlogged and rivers rising over their banks.</p> <p>&quot;It&apos;s very unusual to have so many powerful storms come in one after the other in such a short space of time; we haven&apos;t seen anything like this since about 1991,&quot; he said. &quot;The nasty weather of the last few days is going to continue across the UK, with the combination of high tides and a powerful storm putting coastal areas particularly at risk. Any rain will mean more flooding as the ground is saturated and swollen rivers are coming up against strong waves.&quot;</p> <p>More than 200 homes have been flooded from Cornwall to Scotland, with miles of coastline affected and roads and fields across the country left under water. Officials around the country have pleaded with people to keep away from coastal areas, where waves up to 12m (40ft) high have lashed the land.</p> <p>A man and child were almost swept away by a huge wave at Mullion Cove in Cornwall as they peered over the sea wall to watch the raging sea. Elsewhere in Cornwall, vehicles driving on a coastal road were swamped and almost washed away by a tidal surge.</p> <p>In Aberystwyth, a man was rescued by lifeboat after he ignored police warnings and became trapped when photographing waves from a harbour jetty. Aberystwyth University has deferred the start of the examination period by one week and is advising students not to travel to the coastal town until the middle of next week. The strong tides are said to be the worst to batter the Welsh coast in 15 years, while the coastal surge of recent days has also tested more than 1,850 miles of flood defences in England.</p> <p>Trains have suffered disruption with services in west Wales and from Newport and Bristol to the south coast affected by the weather. There were also delays at the Port of Dover because of force-five winds.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland coastal roads in Co. Down have been submerged with water and temporarily closed as more high winds and heavy rain batter the province.</p> <p>The Portaferry Road on the Ards Peninsula has been shut off because of deep water flooding. And the main road between the coastal towns of Rostrevor and Warrenpoint were also closed on Sunday after huge waves caused flooding.</p> <p>Across Co Down thousands of sandbags were distributed to fortifiy homes near the Irish Sea coast.</p> <p>David Cameron has pledged that lessons will be learned from the flooding but insisted that the Environment Agency (EA) has been given the funding to protect frontline services. The government&apos;s flood-control strategy has been criticised after it emerged that an estimated 1,700 jobs are to be axed at the agency, with 550 staff from the floods team to go.</p> <p>When questioned about the EA&apos;s ability to fund flood defences on the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister replied: &quot;We&apos;re spending £2.3bn in this four-year period on flood defences which is more than the previous four-year period. We have also enabled them to access other sources of money – partnership funding – so I think we&apos;re going to see record levels of spending on flood defences and we have guaranteed that right out into 2020 so they can really plan for the future.&quot;</p> <p>On Sunday, Owen Paterson, the Conservative environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/05/environment-secretary-blind-flood-risks-labour\" title=\"\">was accused </a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/05/environment-secretary-blind-flood-risks-labour\" title=\"\">by Labour of ignoring the increased risk of flooding because he is sceptical about climate change science. </a>Maria Eagle, the shadow environment secretary, said Paterson had &quot;real questions to answer&quot; about why he was allowing cuts at the EA that could affect Britain&apos;s ability to deal with severe weather incidents.</p> <p>Eagle told Sky News&apos;s Murnaghan programme: &quot;The question is whether Owen Paterson&apos;s climate change scepticism – and remember he said that Britain would benefit from climate change – has blinded him to the concerns of increasing risk of flooding, and therefore he hasn&apos;t protected budgets.&quot;</p> <p>Paterson, a strong opponent of onshore wind farms, does not deny that climate change is happening but has made several controversial remarks on the subject. This year he suggested there could be benefits for Britain from climate change, and has previously said he is sceptical about some of the measures taken to counteract its effects. &quot;People get very emotional about this subject and I think we should just accept that the climate has been changing for centuries,&quot; he said at the Conservative party conference in October.</p> <p>&quot;I think the relief of this latest report is that it shows a really quite modest increase, half of which has already happened. They are talking one to two and a half degrees.&quot; Shortly after taking the post of environment secretary in September 2012, he told the Farmers&apos; Guardian: &quot;It is perfectly obvious climate change is there, and there is a human contribution, but I want to be sure the measures we are taking to ameliorate the problem don&apos;t create other problems. So that&apos;s why I am sceptical.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8517284","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021244","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Met Office warns of ice and rain as Labour accuses environment secretary of being 'blinded to the risks' of climate change","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Weather: UK's worst winter storms for two decades set to continue","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Sam Jones, Rowena Mason, Henry McDonald and agencies","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388941585818/Strong-winds-and-high-tid-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ytgz","wordcount":"1186","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388941585818/Strong-winds-and-high-tid-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5699089de4b0ecd109f218af","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-08T11:02:35+00:00","standfirst":"Met Office warns of ice and rain as Labour accuses environment secretary of being 'blinded to the risks' of climate change","linkText":"Weather: UK's worst winter storms for two decades set to continue","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-15T14:57:17.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426305415"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/05/uk-winter-storms-worst-two-decades","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/jan/05/uk-winter-storms-worst-two-decades","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426322182","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/5/1388941590813/Strong-winds-and-high-tid-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","picdarUrn":"GD*40580443","suppliersReference":"XBFT102","altText":"Strong winds and high tides batter the coastal road close to Newtownards, Northern Ireland","caption":"Strong winds and high tides batter the coastal road close to Newtownards, Northern Ireland.

risk of flooding despite an improvement in conditions.</p> <p>The agency said there were four severe flood warnings in place, three on the river Severn and one on the Lower Stour at Iford in Kent. There were a further 97 flood warnings and 244 flood alerts in place. The agency has removed 175 warnings or alerts in the past 24 hours.</p> <p>The Met Office has issued yellow warnings of rain in the south of England and snow in the north of England and southern parts of Scotland. Up to 3cm of rain could fall in just six hours, and there are more warnings of flooding and travel disruption.</p> <p>Residents in Chiswell and Portland in Weymouth, Dorset, were evacuated ahead of high tide on Friday night, while around 100 people living in Aberystwyth, Dyfed, were advised to move to higher ground, with many taking shelter in rest centres.</p> <p>The ferocious weather has left widespread damage. In Aberystwyth debris was strewn across the promenade, rail lines in north Wales were left buckled by the power of the sea and a road collapsed in Amroth, Pembrokeshire.</p> <p>Police continued the search for Henry Martin, 18, who has not been seen since he left his home in Membland, Newton Ferrers, near Plymouth, Devon, to take pictures of the weather on Thursday. Air, sea and land searches were undertaken. Martin had recently started a course in film and TV production at Greenwich University in London but was back home visiting his family for Christmas.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Port of Dover said ships in the Channel were facing gale force five winds, which were leading to some delays. A spokesman said: &quot;Due to adverse weather conditions the terminal is experiencing slight delays to shipping movements. Passengers are advised to contact their shipping operator for further information.&quot;</p> <p>The Met Office is forecasting some respite on Saturday from some of the wettest and windiest weather in decades which, as well as widespread flooding, has caused power cuts and travel disruption.</p> <p>In Scotland, &quot;be aware&quot; weather warnings have been issued for the Strathclyde, Tayside, Fife, south-west Scotland, Lothian &amp; Borders and central regions. The warning also covers Northern Ireland and parts of the north of England. Existing yellow warnings for wind and rain across much of the country remained in place.</p> <p>Another depression due to blow in from the Atlantic on Sunday could bring winds of up to 50mph rather than the gusts of up to 75mph that struck the UK on Friday.</p> <p>Helen Chivers, head of news at the Met Office, said that &quot;might be the last really big storm for a little while&quot;. Some unsettled weather would follow but was more likely to be of the sunshine and showers variety than the hatch-battening events that forced yet more mopping up after a combination of high spring tides, high winds and low pressure.</p> <p>A check on wind speeds suggests December provided the stormiest end to the year since 1969 and one of the windiest months since January 1993. In Scotland, it was the wettest month in records dating back to 1910.</p> <p>Appeals to the public not to walk on coastal paths and promenades and near flood water failed to deter storm-watchers in some parts of the country. A man was seen swimming in the flooded river Nith between Dumfries and Kingholm Quay, and Carmarthenshire council called in the police to move on sightseers at Burry Port, south-west Wales.</p> <p>The coastal town, which sits on a tidal estuary, was lashed by huge waves and winds of more than 70mph during the morning high tide. &quot;What they cannot know is what is in these waves. The sea takes up a lot of rock, rubble and stones and throws them violently about,&quot; a council spokesman said. &quot;Stones weighing up to one hundredweight were being flung into the car park and people were literally putting their lives at risk by being there.&quot;</p> <p>As towns and villages across the country were inundated by sea and river flooding, a pregnant woman in Cardigan was among people rescued from homes by firefighters. In Pwllheli, north Wales, the lifeboat crew helped the fire and rescue service move five people from a flooded caravan park.</p> <p>In Aberystwyth Millie Farmer, 19, a second-year undergraduate at the town&apos;s university, said the main beach had been destroyed and residents evacuated from seafront properties. She said she had watched six-foot waves crash on to the shore from the third floor of the university library which is built on a hill above the town.</p> <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t exactly expect weather like this when I chose to come Aberystwyth but it&apos;s certainly an interesting place to be a geography student,&quot; said Farmer, from Shepreth, Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>Sandbags are being handed out again to thousands of residents in east Belfast as the city prepares for a fresh round of flooding. Emergency measures have been put in place as the Met Office predicts more heavy rain and strong winds to batter eastern parts of Northern Ireland on Sunday and Monday.</p> <p>In Scotland, the A75 in Dumfriesshire was closed for several hours after a lorry overturned in strong winds, and the A78 between Largs and Skelmorlie was closed by flooding. The Skye, Tay and Forth road bridges were barred to high-sided vehicles and speed restrictions put in place for other traffic.</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is under pressure over job losses in roles connected to floods at the Environment Agency for England and Wales. He insisted &quot;frontline services&quot; would be protected, but Paul Leinster, chief executive of the agency, has admitted some roles in flood risk management are likely to go as part of 1,500 job losses.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8515610","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2021080","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Flood

Leinster told the magazine: &quot;Flood risk maintenance will be [further] impacted. All of our work on mapping and modelling and new developments in things like flood warning will also have to be resized. And we&apos;re looking at a proportionate reduction in the number of people in flood risk management.&quot;</p> <p>The GMB union has called on the government to stop the overall job cuts programme at the agency, which it estimates to be about 1,700.</p> <p>The GMB national officer Justin Bowden said: &quot;Since November the UK has been battered by storms and these staff are working flat out to protect citizens across the nation.</p> <p>&quot;The public need to know that job losses on this scale will impact specifically directly on flood risk management, on flood defence operations teams managing flood defences and carrying out river maintenance to enables flows to be conveyed away, enhancing the river&apos;s ecology and supporting fish stocks.</p> <p>&quot;These teams also provide wider incident response – containing river pollution, aerating watercourses to prevent fish deaths from low oxygen levels. So cutting flood risk funds will have a detrimental affect on the health of all rivers.&quot;</p> <p>The pressure on staffing levels is the result of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/jun/26/spending-review-2013-environment-flood\" title=\"\">10% cut to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the June spending review</a>, which followed a severe cut in 2010.

Extra tropical cyclones, as they are known, are created by cold polar air meeting hot tropical air, spinning up powerful storms. “There is always a large temperature contrast between these two air masses between October and March, which produces a constant conveyor belt of storms,” says Milan Simic, managing director of AIR Worldwide, a risk modelling company.</p> <p>But this year the warm air mass sitting over the North Atlantic appears to be extra warm. “Back in the summer warm air from the Sahara moved over the Atlantic Ocean and prevented the formation of North Atlantic hurricanes,” explains Simic.</p> <p>And that lingering warmth may be partly responsible for the weather patterns we are seeing now. On both sides of the North Atlantic the weather conditions are reflecting the clash between warm and cold air, producing a string of storms for the UK, the <a

A woman dragged out by the waves at a North Devon beach. A drunken man pulled alive from the early morning surf at Aberystwyth, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/02/drunken-swimmer-rescue-operation-fined\" title=\"\">threatened with a fine</a> for his foolhardy behaviour. Tragically, we forget that the sea we experience in summer – with its associations of relaxation – can turn to a deadly environment. Today, as further storms break over Britain&apos;s western and southern shores, the authorities are warning us not even to approach the sea – as if by mere sight of it, we might be endangered. Such a fear speaks to a deep sense of disconnection, but also a connection, too.</p> <p>In fact, our first reaction to the water is atavistic, instinctual; we know that it takes and gives. In David Copperfield (as Nick Groom reports in his new book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/31/seasons-nick-groom-review\" title=\"\">The Seasons</a>), Mr Peggotty says of Mr Barkis: &quot;He&apos;s going out with the tide. People can&apos;t die, along the coast … except when the tide&apos;s pretty nigh out. They can&apos;t be born, unless it&apos;s pretty nigh in – not properly born, till flood.&quot; The sea is both life and death, a recreation of the life cycle itself, with each turn of the tide, like the blood pumping in your arteries and veins.</p> <p>Most of us resort to the sea for restoration. But why should it be a restful element; surely it is quite the opposite? That which gives us life – the food we eat, the air we breathe – also represents death. It&apos;s why fishermen and sailors <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/magazine/a-speck-in-the-sea.html?hp&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\" title=\"\">never bothered to learn to swim</a>, reasoning that it would only prolong their agony in the water. Anyone who works at sea experiences that conflicted relationship. It is almost a mythic one. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/24/books.guardianreview\" title=\"\">The People of the Sea</a>, David Thomson records Celtic tales of <a href=\"http://www.orkneyjar.com/folklore/selkiefolk/\" title=\"\">selkies</a>, or spirit seals, and is told that &quot;anyone that&apos;s born of the water is not able to sleep. &apos;Tis like as if the movement of the water was always with them in their head … For them that has the tides of the sea running through them from the day they are born until the day they die there is no such thing as sleep the way we know it.&quot;</p> <p>The north Scottish coasts of which Thomson writes are not of a human scale, unlike the southern shores from which I swim every day. They are barbaric and brutal. There is no balm to their waters, only injury. Their lighthouses <a href=\"http://lighthousemuseum.org.uk/\" title=\"\">admit as much</a>, many built by the renowned Stevenson family: &quot;Battered by storms, ravaged by waves, built by Stevenson.&quot;</p> <p>Thomas, father of Robert Louis, was fascinated by his appointed adversary, the sea: the force that determined what he built. Stevenson seemed to see the waves&apos; power as bordering on the supernatural - &quot;proof of the existence of something far greater than straightforward science&quot;, as his son wrote. He measured them, assessed their height and length and volume, using a wave pole and dynamometer, and asked lighthouse keepers to record wind speed, height of spray and water pressure.</p> <p>He even sought to weigh waves in an attempt to encompass them, and published his findings in the journal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. But Thomas Stevenson&apos;s studies of waves were only descriptive, as Rosalind Williams, a contemporary historian of science, <a href=\"http://rosalindwilliams.com/2012/01/the-triumph-of-human-empire/\" title=\"\">writes</a>. &quot;He was not able to reduce their tumult to a scientific understanding robust enough to make predictions.&quot; Quite simply, the sea was beyond Stevenson, and beyond science, infused with infinite power.</p> <p>Obsessed by swimming in the sea as I am, I&apos;ve often been reminded of its fatal force. Under the skeletal remains of Brighton&apos;s West Pier one dark November afternoon, I was picked up and tossed head over heels. In that instant, I thought, how banal, to die within sight of a dual carriageway and a burger van. In West Bay, Dorset, I came close to another disaster, which ended with my face scrunched in the gravel.</p> <p>Today, the spring tides are running high even along my southern beach. I know this place very well. Indeed, I swim here in the dark in winter. But such confidence is illusory, of course, if not an arrogant assumption. And today, as the brown surging waves thwack against the wall, far higher than I&apos;ve ever seen it and beyond any measuring device devised by Stevenson, even I will think twice about diving in.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 5 January 2014. It originally stated: &quot;It&apos;s why fishermen and sailors never bother to swim.&quot; This has been corrected to: &quot;It&apos;s why fishermen and sailors never bothered to learn to swim.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8511590","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2020749","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p><strong>Philip Hoare:</strong> The storms are blowing over the UK, and the ocean reveals itself to be not a source of relaxation, but a ferocious, barbaric element</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"The sea sweeps us away with its beauty – and then its violent force","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Philip Hoare","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/3/1388752783968/UK-storms-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3yhpf","wordcount":"775","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/3/1388752783968/UK-storms-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5685c0a1e4b0741a0d9c1a06","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-06T13:30:00+00:00","standfirst":"The storms are blowing.

So far eight people in St Vincent and five in St Lucia have died, water and electricity are down and thousands of properties have been damaged. The clean-up bill is <a href=\"http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/st_lucia_news/1092441.html#axzz2oxgnxpnm\" title=\"\">expected to be in the millions</a>.</p> <p>The crisis cut short the holiday of the prime minister of St Vincent, Ralph Gonsalves, who happened to be in storm-hit London, after a trip to see the pope in Rome. Gonsalves – whose cousin was killed in a landslide during the rains – said it was &quot;a disaster of a proportion the likes of which we have not seen in living memory&quot;. The secretary general of the Organisation of American States, José Miguel Insulza, also noted the &quot;unreasonable nature&quot; of the rains, and said &quot;the flooding raises once again the impact of climate change in the Caribbean region&quot;.</p> <p>Many years ago, during a rainy spell in Britain, a South African colleague at my office grumbled that Britain didn&apos;t have a climate – it only had <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n/climate/climate_weather.html\" title=\"\">weather</a>. I chuckled at the time, but it seems that this now goes well beyond the UK. Unmoored from what usually happens during a given season, we are increasingly vulnerable to the brutal force of extreme weather events at short notice.</p> <p>The Caribbean&apos;s climate does involve a rainy period – it is part of the hurricane season, which starts around June and usually lasts until around mid to late November. The 2013 hurricane season was the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/11/25/2013-atlantic-hurricane-season-wrap-up-least-active-in-30-years/\" title=\"\">quietest in 30 years</a>, with only two storms, and they did not even reach an intensity of category three or above. With regards to these recent rains, public opinion appears to agree with Gonsalves: these downpours were unprecedented.</p> <p>There is no doubt that something is amiss in the tropics, and has been for some time. For instance, in 2011 in the north-east region of Colombia, the rain almost never stopped, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/10/heavy-rains-flooding-colombia\" title=\"\">floods devastated the country</a>, with hundreds of thousands of homes damaged and millions of people left suffering. And Trinidad and Tobago, too, has been experiencing severe and often unexpected flooding in the past few years, due to heavy rains.</p> <p>The Caribbean is on the <a href=\"http://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/stories/2013/12/2013_12_16_ips_climate_change.html\" title=\"\">receiving end of the effects of climate change</a> – it has to adapt and respond to the consequences, even though it has contributed little to the problem. Like other island nations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/poorer-countries-climate-change-case\" title=\"\">rising sea levels</a> are a particular threat. A recent report by the Inter-American Development Bank claims that the tourism industry could lose some $900m a year (£550m) by 2050, and that flat, non-volcanic islands like <a href=\"http://www.tribune242.com/news/2013/nov/16/900m-risk-rising-sea-levels/\" title=\"\">the Bahamas are considered especially vulnerable</a>.</p> <p>There is also the risk that more people on the islands will choose to live abroad – if they are not evacuated first. But erosion is not something from a computer model – it&apos;s happening now. For instance, Varadero, Cuba – where more than a million tourists descend every year – has lost between 40,000 and 50,000 cubic metres of shoreline (430,000 to 537,500 sq ft), and a <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=1371569&amp;CategoryId=14510\" title=\"\">recent report</a> says around 84% of the island&apos;s beaches are threatened.</p> <p>For the Caribbean, unpredictable weather and eroding beaches could harm the vital tourism trade. In addition, the islands have a range of environmental issues to tackle, from mining in Jamaica to deforestation in Haiti. There is a rich ecosystem across the region – forests and biodiversity above water, and precious coral reefs and aquatic life below – that is increasingly under threat. The islands are trying to cope, earmarking scarce funds to deal with these challenges, set against a backdrop of economic struggle and often poor infrastructure. But moves have long been under way in places such as Belize, Dominica, and Costa Rica to encourage eco-tourism. The <a href=\"http://caribbeanclimate.bz/\" title=\"\">Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre</a> was set up in 2005, which involves most of the Caricom members (18 of the English-speaking states of the Caribbean, as well as Haiti and Suriname), and most islands have scientists monitoring changes in climate patterns, and taskforces to attempt to deal with the consequences.</p> <p>Whatever you think about climate change, the onset of erratic and extreme weather erodes any pretence of certainty. Modern life, as recent events in Britain have shown, has no time for floods, storms, downed power lines, delayed trains or flights – but this is our future. So in this sense, small islands, whose tribulations are often are ignored, are really the canaries in the coal mine.</p> <p>This Christmas the impact of climate change reached across the Atlantic: developed and developing worlds were brought together in a misery of rising flood waters. We ignore what is happening to the places on the frontline of this changing climate at our peril.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8502692","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2019696","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>Carrie Gibson:</strong> Storms have taken lives in the Caribbean, and caused chaos in the UK – climate change is eroding certainties across the globe","allowUgc":"false","headline":"We ignore the disastrous storms in the Caribbean at our peril","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Carrie Gibson","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/31/1388501657201/Colombia-floods-2011-003.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ygdf","wordcount":"825","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/31/1388501657201/Colombia-floods-2011-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5685c790e4b0741a0d9c213f","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-03T15:32:06+00:00","standfirst":"Storms have taken lives in the Caribbean, and caused chaos in the UK – climate change is eroding certainties across the globe","linkText":"We ignore the disastrous storms in the Caribbean at our peril | Carrie Gibson","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-01T00:32:34.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"426015612"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/31/storms-caribbean-uk-climate-change","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/31/storms-caribbean-uk-climate-change","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-426019133","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/31/1388501663742/Colombia-floods-2011-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*22314846","suppliersReference":"COLOMBIA-RAINS-FLOODS","altText":"Colombia floods 2011","caption":"Flood-hit Colombia in 2011, when the rain almost never stopped.
