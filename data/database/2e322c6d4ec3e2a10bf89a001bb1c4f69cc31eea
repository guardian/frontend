        "headline":"Homeland; Was it Something I Said? – TV review",
        "body":"<p>Ah yes, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/homeland\" title=\"\"><strong>Homeland</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). Last series went out with a bang remember? Boom! Up went CIA HQ, 219 dead, and Brody took off. Now, two months later, someone – Quinn, I think – is already making another bomb. A car bomb, I'm guessing, by the way he sticks it magnetically to his fridge.</p><p>Carrie, meanwhile, is up in front of a Senate select committee, getting a proper grilling (love Tracy Letts as the scary chairman). Plus she's off the lithium and now self-medicating, on running and tequila and casual sex. He's got to be working for someone hasn't he, this dude she meets in the grocery store, hanging around the booze aisle (has he been sent tequila … oh dear). Plus 7-Eleven, 9/11, there could be a pattern there.</p><p>Saul's girlfriend is back from Mumbai, though not as his girlfriend. It's complicated. And he's now head of the CIA. No David Estes then, he was one of the 219. I'll miss Estes. Saul tells his new sidekick, Dar Adal, that he won't throw Carrie under a bus, though later he seems to do just that. I don't know, who can you trust around here? Not this sinister Adal character that's for sure. He's like a hawk sitting on Saul's shoulder, constantly whispering in his ear: \"Kill, kill, take 'em, take 'em all, throw Carrie under a bus.\" (It's not a real bus by the way, just a metaphorical one. But it's a bloody great double-decker metaphorical Boris bus when it does turn up and Saul throws her right under it). Adal looks like he's from Star Trek, or possibly The Canterbury Tales.</p><p>Dana's got a new boyfriend too – they're in the same therapy group, and sending naked selfies to each other. Kids today! Also dangerous, I'd say, given that Dana's daddy is the most wanted man in the world right now. Imagine if the Daily Mail got hold of them – her father hates America, AND is that a spot of cellulite right there? Or maybe gelignite? Anyway, I like Dana, she's one of the most credible characters in Homeland, relatively wise and sane – yeah I know she slit her wrists in the bath, but she was under a lot of pressure at the time.</p><p>Anyway, it's time for the CIA to claw back some credibility, and for this episode to pick up pace a little (these changes in tempo, and from the domestic to the world stage, are what Homeland has been so good at before, especially in series one). Six key targets, enemies of America, have been identified in Yemen, Gaza, Venezuela, places where bad guys hang out.</p><p>The message come in from Quinn in Caracas: \"Tin Man is down\", code name for one of their targets. But there's collateral damage too, in the form of a small boy. Uh-oh, we know from Homeland in the past that killing&nbsp;small boys goes down really badly and leads to major, major shit. You wait. No time to worry about that&nbsp;now though: quick, get the rest, take 'em, take 'em all – Glinda, Scarecrow, Toto (nooo!), Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion … Jesus, they're taking out the whole of Oz. Except for Brody, because no one knows where he is. Who's he, the Wicked Enemy of the West? And is that what Carrie's counsel meant when she said the select committee was beginning to feel like a witch hunt?</p><p>Last time out, Homeland went off the rails. It had the same great characters and performances as before, and looked at the world as something more complex than them 'n' us, good v evil. But it lacked the tautness and direction and plausibility of the first series, it tripped over itself, lost the plot. It's hard to say yet whether it's back on track. But this opener is certainly intriguing. It builds not just in pace but in intensity and excitement too. Hell, I'm in.</p><p>Here he is! Estes – David Harewood – in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/programme-information/was-it-something-i-said-2\" title=\"\"><strong>Was it Something I Said?</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). That's quite a fall, from being head of the CIA to reading out quotes on a Channel 4 gameshow. Basically it's that Radio 4 show Quote Unquote on the telly, with David Mitchell asking the questions. And the questions being \"who said this?\" and \"how does this quote go?\"</p><p>Not the most imaginative format then, but of course it's not really about the game, it's about which panelist can be funniest. And the answer to that is Richard Ayoade. Certainly he's much funnier than his teammate Jimmy Carr; they don't seem to like each other very much either, which is quite jolly. No women about obviously, it being a panel show.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096751|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fc8cafceeab5d1d5093ad8a81edc14d7f9cb43b2 -->",

Top billing tonight goes to Jamie \"Jabba\" Caven, playing David to 10-times Grand Prix Goliath Phil Taylor, who'll be hoping to wrest the title back from 2012 winner Michael van Gerwen. Elsewhere, double Grand Prix winner James Wade takes on German Darts Masters holder Steve Beaton, and 2005 Citywest champ Colin Lloyd is up against Blackpool's Ronnie Baxter. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2><strong>Malala: Shot For Going To School – Panorama</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>Mishal Husain interviews Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who, one year ago this week, was shot in the head by fundamentalists who objected to her, and others of her gender, going to school. While nobody has been convicted of Yousafzai's attempted murder, her would-be assassin has received justice, of a sort: he turned Yousafzai into a superstar advocate, and the global spotlight on to the education of women in both Pakistan and the wider Islamic world. <em>Andrew&nbsp;Mueller</em></p><h2><strong>The Midwives</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>Staff at Birmingham Women's Hospital are stretched to the limit, working 13-hour shifts and slotting in labouring women for care any way they can. Watching the process of giving birth is nothing new, but there are some moments that can stop even the most cynical viewer in their tracks. It's chills-down-the-spine time as a midwife chats calmly while a paediatrician gets a&nbsp;newborn breathing; a team&nbsp;of 16 delivers triplets, and a mum discharges herself mid-induction. All reminders of the enormity of the midwives' jobs. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><h2><strong>999: What's Your Emergency?</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>The first series of this fly-on-the-wall documentary was set in Blackpool and followed a range of local emergency services; this new one tracks ambulance staff working all over the country. It looks as if it'll be just as bleak as the original, though: in tonight's episode, teams attend to a man who has been stabbed in Southend, come to the rescue of an 18-year-old who has had too much to drink on a night out in central London, and find a student who has swallowed bleach and overdosed on antidepressants. <em>Rachel Aroesti</em></p><h2>A Very British Murder With Lucy Worsley<br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Worsley concludes her cultural survey of murder, alighting on the Edwardian era and the so-called golden age of detective fiction, when writers such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L Sayers dominated the whodunnit genre. Worsley has a lot of fun with the topic, sketching in the reasons why mystery fiction was so popular even though it was at odds with reality, and she brings her story to a close with the rise of cinematic detective dramas and a new, edgier fiction epitomised by Graham Greene. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2>Bear Grylls: Escape From Hell<br />9pm, Discovery</h2><p>Bear Grylls \"is supported by an expert safety team\", a Jackass-style caption reads at the start of this programme. Not surprising: in this crazily thrilling new series, the man with a name like an Appalachian barbecue franchise re-creates moments from real-life (and scarcely believable) survival stories, via his customary tactics of hacking, wading and grabbing anything that scuttles and dangling it down his throat. This week, we learn how archaeologists in the Guatemalan jungle survived both a beating by bandits and croc-infested rapids. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><h2><strong>Sex Box</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>The hype machine has been in full swing for weeks, and the centrepiece of Channel 4's Campaign For Real Sex season is here. A couple have sex in an opaque box in front of a live studio audience, after which they will emerge and talk about it to Mariella Frostrup and a trio of experts in the fields of sex, relationships and psychotherapy. Channel 4 says it's a way of reclaiming sex from porn, so prepare either to wear your Cap Of Outrage, or fly the Flag Of Free Expression. <em>Bim Adewunmi</em></p><h2>Hollyoaks Later<br />10pm, E4</h2><p>The mildly entertaining spin-off returns, promising a week of the kind of business that's far too hot for teatime telly. 'Oaks stalwart Tony reunites with his brother and an old mate for a trip to Spain, where they get involved with a suspicious package. So far, so topical. But the highlight of their trip has to be the appearance of Danny Dyer – a man who was practically invented for a role in Hollyoaks Later – doing what he does best: being terribly hard in a warm climate. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418998980|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|dc2c68338318cf921cae80e00eeb8e2dbd92e756 -->",

        "headline":"Will Arnett's guide to positive thinking",
        "body":"<p><strong>Will Arnett has had his share of ups and downs. As an actor he's had shows pulled out from beneath his feet and, as Gob Bluth, he came up with the idea of Mr Bananagrabber. But now, with the surprise resurrection of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arrested-development\" title=\"\"><strong>Arrested Development</strong></a><strong> and a well-adjusted lead role in new sitcom </strong><a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/featured/the-millers\" title=\"\"><strong>The Millers</strong></a><strong>, he's in a pretty good place. So it seemed like an ideal time to tap the man for some blue-sky dreaming. </strong></p><h2>1 LOOSEN THAT STIFF UPPER LIP</h2><p>I can relate to your British sensibility. It comes from a very real place. It's a societal idea of weathering wars and hardship yet still marching forward even in the most difficult times. But my advice would be: you got through all that! It's time to live a little and enjoy it! And you know what? Here's the other thing: you guys spend a lot of time hungover. And that's hard. So maybe don't drink so much?</p><h2>2 YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT</h2><p>The last time I was in the UK, the food was actually so much better than when I was over there as a kid. That said, when I was a kid it was awful. Today it feels like British tastes are leading the charge in many areas, but you still eat too many sweets. How about you eat fewer sweets? You guys spend so much time on a sugar high, and then you crash. It's like the hangover thing. You people just have too many crashes, you're on a constant rollercoaster.</p><h2>3 WATCH TV AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE…</h2><p>This really is a golden age of television and I think that one thing you could do to become happier is embrace how much television you watch. Too many people try to downplay it. Those people should be shamed at every turn. If more people watch more TV,  then we'll get even more good TV. So on your digital recording device, you really have to record as much TV as you possibly can.</p><h2>4 …AND DON'T GO AND MAKE A CUP OF TEA DURING THE COMMERCIALS</h2><p>Embrace TV advertising; they're artists as well, these people who make commercials and the people who star in them. They are allowing you to sit in your own home, in your most comfortable sweatpants, and be entertained. Instead of rejecting the fine products that bring you these shows, you should enjoy them. Whether it be a soft drink, a crisps manufacturer, a favourite lager or simply just a delicious Curly Wurly.</p><h2>5 MANAGE YOUR CAREER EXPECTATIONS</h2><p>The key to happiness in your career is to set the bar at a reasonable height. Give yourself low thresholds to reach and be constantly delighted with the slightest victory. Then once you start notching a few victories, you'll get the taste of it. That way you can turn yourself into a warrior.</p><h2>6 LEARN TO MANAGE DOMINEERING PERSONALITIES</h2><p>In The Millers, my character Nathan Miller is a normal guy who got divorced but made the conscious decision to move forward with his life. He's a pretty relatable guy; I don't think he's as untethered from the world as some of the other characters I've played. But then his parents also split up, and Nathan's mother moves into his apartment, and she's a very controlling personality. And that's very daunting, especially if it's your mother. I think sometimes you have to take an eastern, zen approach with people who are domineering like that. Maybe the best way is just to forgive them every day for what they do. Every morning, say: \"I know that's how they are, I'm not going to change them, I forgive them.\" And you might make it easier on yourself. Because fighting it is very difficult.</p><h2>7 BE WARY OF THOSE WHO TELL YOU THAT LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE</h2><p>I always reject that. I always say, any place that tells you laughter is the best medicine, I really hope that it's not my local hospital. Because that operating room would be pure madness if it was just people telling jokes while you had to get your gall bladder removed. I'm really a proponent of medicine being the best medicine.</p><h2>8 ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD</h2><p>We experience all the highs and delights of being constantly informed, but we're too concerned with the future rather than enjoying the moment. Maybe if we just lobotomised our digital connectivity a little bit we might experience some actual joy. Before the internet, we did so many amazing and creative things. In fact, we created the internet.</p><h2>9 DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY</h2><p>I'm 43 years old. I don't look a day over 42. And if I've learned anything at this stage in my life, it's that you have to have fun. The ability to laugh every day is truly the tonic for this life. When you are on your deathbed, looking back at the stupid fucking things that you worried about, that gave you such anxiety and were actually so pointless … if you could just enjoy yourself and have a good time, I think you would pass quietly with a smile. Unless, of course, you are murdered in your sleep.</p><p><strong><em>The Millers starts on Comedy Central on 14 Oct</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418854557|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|877687fc307386ebbb082ae271e7295c9bc5ba8a -->",

        "headline":"Downton Abbey recap: season four, episode three",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Downton Abbey series four. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/29/downton-abbey-recap-season-four-episode-two\">Viv Groskop's episode two blogpost</a></p><p>Oh, Uncle Julian. How could you? Not Anna. \"This episode contains violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting.\" Heavens above. Well, we were half-prepared for that warning, as there was no preview episode available this week, and the last time that happened Sybil bled to death. And as with the Sybil episode, we didn't really get any action until the last seven minutes.</p><p>As soon as Mini-Den's hip flask appeared, it became obvious. \"He's not going to rape her, is he?\" I asked, like an idiot dupe. And so, of course, it transpired. I am still not sure what to think. \"Nobody else must ever know,\" Anna begged, \"You promise me?\" Trust has been ruptured on many, many levels, both in the house and with the audience. A comb is not going to be of much help here, Mrs Hughes. Nor is a new dress.</p><p>I'm torn between two extremes. One part of me thinks that this plot direction could be just the thing to revive a series which seems baggy and flagging after only three episodes. Could Anna be pregnant? What other liberties will Mini-Den take in the house now that Anna hasn't grassed him up? And what will Bates do when he eventually finds out, as eventually he must? That's if their relationship lasts at all. </p><p>Another part of me feels irritated and betrayed. Anna is a favourite character. There was something gratuitous about throwing this turn of events into the mix, especially when this episode also sowed the seeds of a thousand other subplots involving random new characters. The problem here, as so often in Downton Abbey, is that our emotional investment is so thinly spread across so many characters, shifting viewpoints and mini-scenes with barely one line of dialogue. So when something truly gripping happens, you're just left feeling numb.</p><p>(Note regarding Mini-Den: I will refer to this character, played by Nigel Harman, as Mini-Den for now, the character he used to play in EastEnders. Mostly because his character name has been poorly established so far. He is Mr Green. But he is called Mr Gillingham downstairs in tribute to the name of the aristo he is serving. Get me with my knowledge.)</p><p>Before Anna was attacked, our attention was being splattered all over the place like the jam in a jar opened by Jimmy. Rose was cosying up to a very greasy type. Edith was failing to interest anyone in the imminent German. (Until - hurrah! - he turned out to be a bit of a whiz at poker.) Mary went horse-riding and had a conversation about the Inland Revenue.     </p><p>I half-relished some of the \"something bad's going to happen!\" clangers dropped and looks exchanged throughout this episode. Cora: \"A house party can be so flat if there's no special moment.\" Lord Grantham: \"I want to go out with a bang.\" Edith: \"I should be careful if I were you.\" But by the end of it all, that all felt rather nasty and voyeuristic, when something so genuinely horrible really was about to happen. The horror in Downton is usually fairly pantomime. This felt possibly too real, too desperate. I can't quite forgive it. As Carson put it, \"What a topsy turvy world we've come to.\"</p><h2>Random subplot alert<br /></h2><p>Well, it was all subplot until the last seven minutes. And we had to put up with lines like this from people whose presence was not explained: \"Do you know Isabella Moncrieff? She's blown up like a balloon.\" I do realise that this stuff was designed to show how frustrating it is to be Tom Branson among all these aristos, but unfortunately it felt as tiring to us as it did to him. I did love the fact that Alfred's culinary ambitions returned in this episode. They have surfaced before. But he is going to have to learn to cook something other than bechamel sauce if he is going to get anywhere. And, please, do we have to have a re-run of the doomed love affair between Edna \"duplicitous housemaid\" Braithwaite and Tom \"I'll never be a real aristo\" Branson? It seems we do.</p><h2>Golden Eyebrow Award of the week<br /></h2><p>Almost too many candidates to mention this week. \"How are the squabs doing? What about the syllabubs? Oh my God, the vegetables!\" Mrs Patmore looked as if she were about to have a heart attack. Which she then proceeded to have. Except, no, it was just an anxiety attack. According to Dr Death, anyway.</p><p>Lord Grantham's \"What does one say to a singer?\" was a close eyebrow contender. As was this line from Dame Maggie: \"If I were to search for logic, I would not look for it in the English upper class.\" </p><p>The defender of the eyebrow title fought back bravely: \"An Australian singer, eating with her Ladyship?\" Carson's eyebrow action as ever seemed to indicate a shock so extreme that he would almost choke. Which is no doubt what he thinks would happen to anyone from upstairs forced to sit near an Australian.</p><p>But there could only be one winner tonight. \"You want me to be a footman? I'm having my career backwards.\" Oh the humiliation of having to wear gloves! Mr Molesley wins the Golden Eyebrow. Although I concede that it is partly a sympathy vote.</p><h2>Surprise character development<br /></h2><p>It's getting very difficult to know what we should make of Lady Mary. And I say this with the deepest of sympathy for Michelle Dockery, who is a fabulous actor. \"I loved him. But he changed me. If I were as tough as I was when I met him, maybe I'd be happier now.\" And now the sight of the gramophone has indisposed her. The script for Lady Mary's mourning has been tricky: it's as if she's been told to play out her grief as a waxwork. Now even she is longing for her former self. As are we all. Please, someone, give Mary a direction soon.</p><h2>\"Sorry, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue?\"<br /></h2><p>• \"I'm afraid Tom's small talk is very small indeed.\" \"Not everyone can be Oscar Wilde.\" \"Well, that's a relief.\" Lord Grantham and the dowager countess discussing Tom Branson. Lovely. If Dame Maggie were paid by the word, she'd get next to nothing. </p><p>• \"Oh you know Mary, she's always quite opaque.\" The understatement of the century from Isobel Crawley.</p><p>• \"I have made quite a study of claret.\" What the Australian singer is trying to say is that she likes a drink.</p><h2>Next week<br /></h2><p>Rose meets the jazz man. There's more tension between Anna and Bates. Lady Mary's suitor is back with a vengeance. (Sorry this is brief but I still can't breathe after what happened to Anna. UNCLE JULIAN, HOW COULD YOU?)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419057341|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|05583233871df3be2f07d0c7ba8741fd4de07e6b -->",

        "headline":"Homeland recap: season three, episode one – Tin Man is Down",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the third series of Homeland at UK broadcast pace. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode one – and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/homeland-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Catch up with Rebecca Nicholson's previous episode blogposts</a></p><p>PREVIOUSLY ON HOMELAND! To start the recap by recapping the recap: Brody's on the lam, Carrie isn't, most of the CIA and government were killed in a bomb blast that was probably Abu Nazir's revenge for Brody deciding not to be a terrorist any more, and Saul's in charge of the CIA. It's good to have you back, you big daft beast.</p><p>Two months have passed since the bomb wiped out various government and CIA bigwigs and Brody disappeared (in my mind, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/23/breaking-bad-episode-15-granite-slate\" title=\"\">to a hut in New Hampshire stocked with Mr Magorium DVDs</a>). Quinn has been passing the time by making bombs with his top off and sticking them to the fridge, so his refusal to take out Brody last time hasn't led to any sort of demotion from the world of black ops. And Carrie has been hauled up in front of a Senate committee – a closed one, so as to protect agents still active in the field.</p><p>Homeland has often highlighted the less savoury aspects of the CIA – remember the mosque shooting in season one – so it's little wonder that it's on the ropes in this opening episode. Here, the government initially acts as a useful double for viewers, keeping us updated on what's been happening and damning the agency for its cover-ups and negligence. I enjoyed the panel's disbelief that Carrie was so spectacularly fired, then reinstated, echoing what many viewers and readers of this blog felt at the time.</p><p>Carrie isn't very well under interrogation by the committee, childishly blurting out that she doesn't think Brody did it, against the advice of her lawyer and Saul, as well as committing perjury, though this, by contrast, was sticking to their plan. It's no surprise that she's off her meds, but it is a sign of her desperation (or instability) that she's turning to alternative remedies instead. They don't seem to be doing much good, if the state of her notebook is anything to go by, and her father, in particular, is worried. He should be: she's back in the booze aisle and shagging strange men on the stairs, as if the past two seasons didn't happen at all.</p><p>Though Brody doesn't appear, the Brody family are also dealing with the fallout of their \"terrorist\" father. Their house is under surveillance, Jessica's hair has grown dramatically with all the stress, Chris is finally allowed to speak, and Dana has been in a psychiatric unit having tried to kill herself. \"Shit's for real,\" as her comedy hospital boyfriend puts it. She then does what any TV teen in need of a contemporary storyline does, and sexts him a topless picture.</p><p>Saul is struggling with being the big boss. His wife Mira is back at home, though in a separate bedroom, which gives him another chance to assess his life. Mandy Patinkin is so wonderful in these quiet, emotional scenes, and it proves the show doesn't need the big explosions to bolster its dramatic weight. His right hand man is now Dar Adal, which is another shock – he's the sinister boss of black ops, so if they're putting him near the top, that bomb must have truly decimated the leadership. His presence comes in handy with the episode's big set-piece, however: six assassinations (though Saul wobbles over this: \"We're not assassins, we're spies\") across three continents, within a 20-minute window, to take out the brains behind the CIA attack.</p><p>Quinn fails to hit his target initially, as there's a child in the car, but then, in a twist you could see coming from a sniper's sight away, he shot the kid by accident anyway. Oops! Quinn has got feelings, as he showed when he decided not to shoot Brody, so expect that action to have consequences. Saul's pleased that the operation is ostensibly a success – there's a clear hardening of his personality over the course of the episode. But it isn't enough for Senator Lockhart, who goes all conspiracy theorist and suggests that it's convenient timing for the CIA. Saul pulls it back by publicly selling Carrie down the river: following the planted article in the paper, he admits that she's bipolar, she concealed it from him, that she had sex with Brody. I don't like this new, tough Saul one bit.</p><p>The final few minutes aside, this was a surprisingly restrained return, and in many ways, it reset the clock. It left me feeling like I'd seen the old Homeland, rather than the cartoonish season two. Good and bad are collapsing as definitions and the Brody/Carrie love story isn't at the forefront (yet, but hopefully Brody being on the run will keep it that way). I'm cautiously hopeful that this is going to be a quality season.</p><h2>Notes and observations</h2><p>• When Carrie storms into the restaurant to confront Saul and Dar Adal, their attempt to calm her is comical: \"Sit down, have some tiramisu.\" Yeah, that'll do it.</p><p>• What does all the Wizard of Oz code mean? Is it pointing at a symbolic man behind the curtain? Who is it?</p><p>• There's either a new mole at the CIA, or the old mole didn't get blown up, because somebody leaked the Carrie story to the press. Dar Adal says it wasn't him, but he's certainly shady enough to have done it.</p><p>• I wonder if any of the NSA news will make it into the show: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/27/nsa-tv-film-homeland-revelations\" title=\"\">as this blogpost points out, it has covered the Fisa court </a>before, and the appearance of Venezuela may be a sign of Snowden/Assange style storylines to come.</p><p>• It looks as if we have a new villain: Majid Javadi, an Iranian terrorist mastermind responsible for several attacks over the years.</p><p>• I rolled my eyes, Dana style, at the sexting. She has already had one teen-angst storyline with the I Know What You Did Last Summer plot, and now this? No thanks.</p><h2>Exposition of the week</h2><p>\"You mean for someone who got in a bathtub and slit her wrists?\" Jess subtly explains why Dana's been in rehab.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418878952|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9f4df7851cf2cc5bc04f461aa830e21f8327739f -->",

Some I have already entirely forgotten (him off Hollyoaks, golf man, WAG, actor chap, dragon). I think it's time to start sending some people home.</p> <p>In other news, Brucie has flu and won’t be joining us this evening, so it’s a double dose of Claudia this weekend. Hope Bruce gets well soon, am sure Clauds will do a splendid job.</p> <p>I’ll be here from 6.20pm for OVER TWO HOURS of dance/glitter/fake tan action. That's FIFTEEN dances, which makes it quite a hefty liveblog with no ad breaks, so bring snacks and booze, and feel free to help me out by being hilarious/wise/insightful in the comment box.

        "headline":"Homeland: Destructive, dynamic, distinctive – Carrie and Brody are back on screen",
        "body":"<p>When <em>Homeland</em> season three kicks off on Channel 4 on 6 October viewers can expect a storyline with a fresh theme. Alex Gansa, the creator and executive producer of the show, and his writers have been busy with a new emphasis.</p><p>The show will now foreground &quot;the cost of being an intelligence officer&quot;, he told the <em>New York Times</em>, and this is because of his interest in the addictive quality of this kind of pressurised work: &quot;The adrenaline, the quarry, the chase – it's powerful stuff.&quot;</p><p>There is another addictive career path that might help to explain his empathy. Writing for television, especially for a big show like <em>Homeland</em>, is a compulsive business and it attracts risk-takers, the sort of people who like to feel exposed. The work may not be as dangerous or important as protecting the state from terrorism, but writers working for the US cable network Showtime take it nearly as seriously.</p><p>When Gansa took his team to a two-hour meeting with CIA officers at their base in Langley, Virginia, earlier in the history of the series, he made the comparison himself. He had wanted, he said, &quot;a frank and free exchange about the entertainment business and the intelligence business that revealed a lot of parallels&quot;. The similarities were evident. &quot;We both build sets. We both&nbsp;play roles. And we both brainstorm, about operations on their side and storylines on ours.&quot;</p><p>While renowned playwrights such as Tom Stoppard, who adapted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/09/parades-end-ford-madox-ford\" title=\"\">Ford Maddox Ford's <em>Parade's End </em>for the BBC</a>, are increasingly drawn to the quality of television drama series, those writers who are hired to spin out a fiction and build up a long-running success arguably have a much harder job. They are in harness together for months, attempting to deliver high ratings for shows that may originally have been based on a single striking &quot;high concept&quot;. In the case of <em>Homeland</em> it was pretty basic: a war hero, Nicholas Brody, who might or might not have been turned by Islamists.</p><p>So far, indications are good for season three. American critics have generally given it a thumbs-up, and audience interest has not waned either, following the disappointment with season two. The ratings were up 26% from the previous season's opener. Executives at Channel 4, where <em>Homeland</em> drew in an average of 3.4 million viewers last time, will be hoping for a similar scale of increase.</p><p>Speaking to the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> one of the show's British stars, Damian Lewis, said he had been amazed by the way the writers relish writing themselves into dead end – and then escaping in one bound at the last minute.</p><p>Kiefer Sutherland, one of the first actors to benefit from a high-end drama series when he played Jack Bauer in <em>24</em>, agreed. In his experience, he told Lewis, this was the way these writers preferred to work. They thrive, he said, on tight deadlines.</p><p>Yet the late Henry Bromell, one of the key writers on <em>Homeland</em>, also spoke of the importance of research. And for him the drama was quite close to home, since his father had worked for the CIA. Bromell, the show's &quot;eminence grise&quot;, was &quot;amazing&quot; in the story room, Gansa said. &quot;He was a fountain of ideas, he'd cut right to the heart of what a story was, and he could take the top of your head off with a line of dialogue.&quot;</p><p>Jon Hamm, who plays Don Draper in <em>Mad Men</em>, has talked of a more leisurely approach to plotting on his acclaimed show. Although he discusses the shape of the story with the writer, Matthew Weiner, he feels he is part of a hidden plan. When he questions whether Draper would really do something, Weiner tells him to wait for a couple of episodes, when all will become clear.</p><p>But it is not only the actors who want to know where they are with a character. If a series is to work over several seasons its audience must be convinced they are watching a consistent personality develop. <em>Homeland</em>, which has a typically male-dominated writers' room, realised at episode four that it needed a woman to write Carrie, played by Clare Danes, since she was the lead role. They brought in Meredith Stiehm.</p><p>&quot;She's really incredible. Her voice is so distinctive and so honest and funny,&quot; Danes has said. &quot;She has a very wry sensibility that's so in keeping with who Carrie is. But she also is very warm and feeling, and all of that translates into all her work. I owe an enormous amount to Meredith.&quot;</p><p>The <em>Homeland</em> team all agree that Carrie's &quot;craziness gives her edge&quot; (she is bipolar) and that it functions almost &quot;as a superpower&quot; in the story. Her lack of stability is going to be central to season three, it seems, while the show as a whole will be &quot;more emotional&quot;, according to producer Bert Salke. It will also depend heavily on the development of the characters of Saul Berensen, played by former Broadway singing star Mandy Patinkin, and of Peter Quinn, the sinister operative played by British actor Rupert Friend. As before, viewers will wonder whom they can trust, but the writers know they must not stretch the fibres of their fictional creations too far.</p><p>Avoiding television cliches is also important. The British writer on the show, Alexander Carey, has spoken about enjoying the speed with which they can bring fresh ideas to bear. &quot;If we have a good idea, we just get on with it. We don't delay it,&quot; he said.</p><p>For Gansa, this speed is the show's secret ingredient. Rather than using endless plot twists, the writers electrify their audience by getting to the predicted outcomes more quickly than other shows would. &quot;Things happen before the audience expects, so they are surprised,&quot; he said.</p><p>With a plot that reflects grim events in the real world, the writers have to be reactive. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-homeland-season-3-20130929,0,2346538.story?page=3\" title=\"\">A piece in the <em>LA Times</em></a><em> </em>pointed out that the Boston Marathon bombing and the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school were both influential. The changing current affairs scene was a factor from the beginning, according to Gansa. &quot;When we finished the pilot, the question [was] very simple: Is he [Brody] or isn't he a terrorist? As we began to understand what sort of stories we could tell, it became much more complicated than that,&quot; he has&nbsp;said.</p><p>Some complexity is essential, but the writers are aware they must be careful. The well-reviewed American intelligence drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/rubicon\" title=\"\"><em>Rubicon</em></a>, starring Miranda Richardson, is thought to have lost audience numbers, and with them a second series, due to its labyrinthine plotting.</p><p>Credible characterisation emerges as the key to longevity. Shows such as <em>Mad Men</em>, or Lena Dunham's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/21/girls-box-set-lena-dunham\" title=\"\">HBO hit <em>Girls</em></a>, or a long-running British sitcom such as <em>Dad's Army</em>, have each proved that a fully imagined cast of characters allows storylines to grow organically.</p><p>From what Gansa has revealed of the writing process, there is a strong possibility that the characters of Carrie and Brody are now running his show not him. The magnetic appeal of their relationship, he says, &quot;is not something we planned on&quot;. Neither Gansa nor his producer envisioned the destructive dynamic that would spring up between the two. &quot;But eventually the story took on a life of its own.&quot;</p><p>The final influence on <em>Homeland</em> writers is the viewer. In reaction to criticisms meted out, the writers have intentionally slowed down the pace. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/29/homeland-showrunner-we-knew-we-had-to-plot-a-new-course.html\" title=\"\">Gansa told the Daily Beast</a> that there will be more room for his characters to breathe this time around and fewer frantic narrative twists.</p><p>&quot;I think it's fair to say that we wanted to start off slower,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we were smarting a bit at the criticism. We knew we had to plot a new course for the show.&quot;</p><p></p><p><em>Additional research by Charlotte Latimer</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419145603|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|bc14e6e623c72a5038b1b43fb1beb6fc51a3a340 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Clear Spot: The Trebus Project</strong> (<a href=\"http://resonancefm.com/archives/15206\" title=\"\">Resonance FM</a>)</p><p><strong>Book of the Week: Beowulf</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03byzzf\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p><p><strong>Keeping it Real</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03brkdv\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p><p>David Clegg has worked with people with dementia for a long time, and he talks to them a lot – or rather, they talk to him. He lets them tell their stories, no matter how jumbled or fragmented or strangely worded. And he records them, takes notes. Carefully, he pieces together narratives – a series of snapshots – from their damaged memories. Sometimes, the words a patient speaks to him are the last they ever speak.</p><p>Clegg has turned these records into a piece of work called <a href=\"http://www.trebusprojects.org/\" title=\"\">the Trebus Project</a>. It has its own website and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Trebus-Project-Ltd/150281061708809\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a> and, last week, Resonance FM gave some of the Trebus stories an airing on <a href=\"http://resonancefm.com/archives/15206\" title=\"\"><strong>Clear Spot</strong></a>. Clegg had turned the words of some of the dementia sufferers into short speeches, voiced by actors such as Russell Tovey, Linda Robson and Charlie Higson. He's done this before, for the Radio 4 series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01120sf\" title=\"\"><em>Ancient Mysteries</em></a>, in 2011, but Resonance's show was longer.</p><p>Actually, I'm not sure that it wasn't too long. It's not that it wasn't interesting, or moving, or wonderful (it was all of those things), but each tale required you to listen hard, in order to try to piece together what the speaker wanted you to understand. Some stories were easy, some had force behind them – Michael's tale, of a violent childhood, was a small film in itself. Most were like little mysteries, with clues dropped here and there, though they lacked a neat denouement, a final reveal at the end. They just… stopped.</p><p>The first half an hour comprised reasonably coherent tales, of being an actor – \"everyone met everyone at a party!\" – widowed by the war; of hiding homosexuality from a stern papa. The second half hour, devoted to those who were further along the dementia scale, was more abstract. One poor lady kept repeating an anxious mantra of getting up and going to Sainsbury's; a man wrestled unsuccessfully with language: \"It's so funny, so much… stuff… and he got the thing, you know\". He reminded me of my young daughter, who chats and chats in words that are individually quite comprehensible; but unless you know her context – that she's talking about a film, or a story that her dad told her about his childhood, or she's describing what happened on the way to the park – her tales make no sense at all, and she hasn't the language to develop them. The listener who wasn't with her can tell that they're significant, but is unable to work out what's happened. A translator is needed. But with dementia sufferers, there is often no one close to them who's still alive to translate.</p><p>The final speaker was, for me, the most moving: an intelligent man who knew that dementia was coming but slipped in and out of comprehension: \"You get a flash of the horror of the situation, rushes of acuity… Time passes differently here.\" Without full memories, we drift on washes of emotion, living life in confusion between dreams and what is actually happening.</p><p>The voices on Trebus were lovely; lovely, too, to hear Seamus Heaney reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/seamus-heaney-beowulf-anglo-saxon\" title=\"\">his translation</a> of <em>Beowulf</em>. This was divided into easy-to-digest 15-minute offerings in Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03byzzf\" title=\"\"><strong>Book of the Week </strong></a>slot. If I'm honest, the story lost me occasionally – all those swords and shields and epic quests – but Heaney's voice was so wonderful I couldn't switch off.</p><p>And for some light relief, may I recommend comedy writer Jane Bussman's take on the contemporary obsession with authenticity, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03brkdv\" title=\"\"><strong>Keeping It Real</strong></a>? If you're bothered by what is genuine (hand-crafted, individually made, sung from direct experience) and what is not (supermarket-owned, mass-produced, devised by Simon Cowell in collusion with a major record label), then this is the programme for you. It won't make you feel any better about what one contributor called your \"dopey nostalgia\", but it will certainly make you laugh.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419071194|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0899cfa7c3a08054cdb69ca490a2329c07517dfd -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Her story </strong> </h2><p><em>Annie Mac, DJ, 35</em></p><p></p><p>The first time I came across Sara was on the radio, same as most people. I was 19 and listened to her radio show on Sunday evenings while I was at college in Belfast. I&nbsp;connected with her. She sounded fun, like someone you would want to be friends with.</p><p>Shortly after I got my show on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1\" title=\"\">Radio 1</a>, we paired up for Glastonbury in 2007, circumnavigating the festival live on air together. I looked up to her. She was loads of fun and had a&nbsp;croaky voice and a Winnebago, which was so useful! After that we hung out together at every Glasto. She'd always be there with her husband Ben and we'd all chat absolute shit together till the early hours. She and Ben are like a double act, and so funny. You don't really need to say anything – they just make me and my partner [Toddla T] laugh for hours.</p><p>Sara and I both like to let our hair down and be party animals, but she never loses control. Her organisational skills are top notch: she's always texting, planning, picking you up in a car. She'd call herself a control freak, but I could do with being a bit more like that. I'm pretty haphazard at times. More last minute.</p><p>And as a mum, Sara's someone I&nbsp;really admire. She takes it all in her stride, doesn't fuss, talks to the kids as equals and has a proper laugh. I&nbsp;remember saying to T once: \"If we could be like Sara and Ben as parents, then we'd be doing it right.\" Recently I became a mum, and she's been a really solid advice giver. She and Ben&nbsp;are an inspiration on&nbsp;the parenting front: you don't&nbsp;have to feel like&nbsp;your&nbsp;life's over, and Sara's always been good&nbsp;at getting the  work-life balance perfect.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/annie-mac\" title=\"\"><em>Annie Mac</em></a><em>'s </em>AMP 2013<em> compilation album will be released on Virgin Records on&nbsp;14 October</em></p><h2><strong>Her story</strong> </h2><p><em>Sara Cox, broadcaster, 38</em></p><p></p><p>Annie and I have a relaxed friendship which has evolved over the years. She went from being my favourite friend at work to one of my best mates to hang out with socially. I remember when we took that leap from being party pals to chilling at each other's houses, and now we go for Sunday roasts with our partners and kids. The four of us have a great dynamic, and it's always great banter. Annie's a good role model for young girls: she's super smart, individual, with a professional reputation, playing to huge crowds and not walking into parties thinking she's Billy Big Boots expecting star treatment. It's all about her DJ skills and her music. She's just really cool.</p><p>We both loved being pregnant. When I was the size of Cheshire I'd wear stretchy Lycra pregnancy clothes, but Annie totally rocked it and always looked awesome. She still entertained loads even when she was massive – weeks from her due date, she whipped up an amazing spread for all her mates. She didn't let it faze her at all. She was wearing this big floaty Grecian gown, drifting around on a cloud of serenity. Even when she had her little boy, she was still chilled; she'd lay him down on the table during a barbecue.</p><p>You can judge a girl by her mates, and Annie's got a really awesome set of girlfriends who I get on well with. I've got my bezzies, too, so there's no&nbsp;pressure there. You're not looking to make new friends when you're older, so when someone comes along who you genuinely like, it's a great thing.</p><p>I love Annie to bits. She's a good friend with no baggage. I want her to keep doing what she's doing, and I&nbsp;feel like she's there for me. I think we'll be mates forever.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/29/sara-cox-organic-food\" title=\"\"><em>Sara Cox</em></a><em> presents </em>Sounds of the&nbsp;80s<em> every Saturday night on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-2\" title=\"\"><em>BBC Radio 2</em></a><em> at 10pm</em></p><p></p><p><em>If you'd like to appear in this column, email </em><a href=\"mailto:meandyou@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>meandyou@observer.co.uk</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418832618|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|421303c4b4f69f87cd804cd24a90ba0a71c2aa70 -->",

The general rule is to trade on the titillation but make sure you establish the moral high ground from which to look down upon it all. But if <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/porn-on-the-brain\" title=\"\"><strong>Porn on the Brain</strong></a>'s base camp was the familiar disapproving prurience, it also sought to scale the giddy heights of irrefutable science.</p><p>The film was presented by an effusive bloke called Martin Daubney. \"Hello, my name is Martin,\" he said by way of introduction, \"and I'm a wanker.\" His point was that like the vast majority of his audience he was no stranger to self-pleasure. Unfortunately he also seemed to take a good deal of pleasure in himself, thus opening interpretation to the other meaning of the word.</p><p>Daubney seemed to be impressed that he once edited a lads' magazine and even more impressed that he no longer does. \"I was the editor of <em>Loaded</em> magazine,\" he announced proudly, \"but now I'm a dad.\"</p><p>Good for him. And? Well, at <em>Loaded</em> he had been instrumental in increasing the magazine's nipple count – on such editorial decisions are thriving journalistic careers made – but since fatherhood he had reconsidered his earlier professional triumphs and realised that he had treated women as mere sex objects.</p><p>Even so, he argued, what he had been responsible for was essentially fun and innocent, whereas what's on offer now online is \"just gross\". Cue Daubney sitting in front of a blurred-out computer screen and, like John Motson in a raincoat, grimacing through a running commentary of what he was watching: \"He's ramming it… Oh God, she looks like Ann Widdecombe.\"</p><p>So Daubney had established what we already knew – that it's easy to access nasty porn online. But he wanted to know the real effect of all this depravity. As he accurately put it, there's been \"a lot of hysteria but very little fact\".</p><p>That arrangement, alas, was not about to change. There was an extraordinary interview with a porn-addicted young man who masturbated between seven and 28 times a day, a mish-mash of near-meaningless statistics, anecdotal interviews with experts in the field, and reports of sex crimes committed as a result of watching porn. But empirical evidence of impending social collapse remained in short supply.</p><p>Presumably, given that the consumption of porn has massively increased in recent years, if there was a causal link with sex crimes, there would also have been a massive increase there as well. But no such figures were produced or discussed.</p><p>Instead Daubney, like many before him in search of pseudo-scientific authority, went for the all-purpose money shot of the MRI brain scan. We saw a series of tests in which parts of the brain lit up when the subjects watched pornography. What did this tell us? Nothing other than that, just possibly, people who reported themselves as overstimulated by porn were overstimulated by porn.</p><p>Yet conveniently bypassing an explanation, Daubney concluded: \"This research seems to show that porn can be addictive. If that's the case and we allow our children access to online porn, that's like leaving heroin lying around the house.\"</p><p>Chris Morris in full mock-shock satirical mode couldn't have done a better job of whipping up moral hysteria. It should be obvious that exposure to images of grotesquely abusive sex is not a healthy teenage development model. You don't need a brain scan to make that case. A brain will do.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109114'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/10/3/1380815818009/tv-bulgaria-001.jpg' alt='tv bulgaria' width='460' height='307' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sunny Beach in Bulgaria: British tourists are most definitely welcome.

The bright-eyed Dooley wandered around like a school prefect at an orgy, politely interviewing young men and women who were seven or eight cocktails past losing inhibitions that they never possessed in the first place.</p><p>What Dooley discovered is that when British youth go on eight-hour cheap-booze binges their behaviour is not always the source of national pride. The suggestion was that the Bulgarians were cynically exploiting this cultural vulnerability by deliberately giving the Britons what they wanted. And the local medical services were then running a scam to overcharge those who happened to pass out on the street as a result of having too much of what they wanted.</p><p>All in all, it was hard to care what happened to anyone. They could have all drowned in vodka and vomit and somehow, you felt, we could have survived the news. \"How much do we really know about this new holiday hotspot?\" Dooley asked. The answer now is far more than we ever wanted or needed to know.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109115'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/10/3/1380815586928/Story-of-the-Jews-001.jpg' alt='Story of the Jews' width='220' height='330' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Schama's Story of the Jews has been 'spellbinding'. Photograph: Tim Kirby/BBC</figcaption></figure><p>Strange to think that the word \"documentary\" must do as a description of <em>Porn on the Brain</em>, <em>Booze, Bar Crawls and Bulgaria</em> and Simon Schama's<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0392pzx\" title=\"\"><strong> The Story of the Jews</strong></a>. It's a bit like filing a soggy chip, a Twiglet and a three-starred Michelin feast under the heading \"nourishment\". It doesn't really tell the whole story.</p><p>And what a story it has been. Never one to wallow in genteel understatement, Schama unleashed his whole intellectual and emotional armoury in this spellbinding series that culminated in that most contested of all modern political debates: the state of Israel.</p><p>Zionism – support for the existence of a Jewish state in Palestine – has become the dirtiest of words in anti-imperialist circles. Schama reminded us that hundreds of thousands of Jews were kicked out of their centuries-old homes in the Middle East – seldom a fact that's dwelt on when refugees are mentioned.</p><p>But he also made it clear that Israelis themselves have undermined the Zionist cause and none more so than the settler movement, which has placed a religiously justified, expansionist vision at the heart of Israeli politics.</p><p>I've had almost exactly the same frustrating conversations with West Bank settlers as Schama endured. And what came across as most at odds with the rich, discursive Jewish history that Schama has given us was the settlers' complacent tone of closed certainty. It's somehow not Jewish, and therein lies the hope that it will fail.</p><p>A 1919 letter from Prince Faisal offered Jews \"a most hearty welcome home\". \"This is the document of what might have been,\" Schama said, his voice quavering. \"And, you know, what might still be.\"</p><p>And this was a documentary of what can be when talent is given its head.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418979567|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|af708d13ea66f50cc6f64d9e66a82515bd372325 -->",

        "headline":"Homeland recap: season three, episode one – Tin Man is Down",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the third series of Homeland at UK broadcast pace. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode one – and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/homeland-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Catch up with Rebecca Nicholson's previous episode blogposts</a></p><p>PREVIOUSLY ON HOMELAND! To start the recap by recapping the recap: Brody's on the lam, Carrie isn't, most of the CIA and government were killed in a bomb blast that was probably Abu Nazir's revenge for Brody deciding not to be a terrorist any more, and Saul's in charge of the CIA. It's good to have you back, you big daft beast.</p><p>Two months have passed since the bomb wiped out various government and CIA bigwigs and Brody disappeared (in my mind, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/23/breaking-bad-episode-15-granite-slate\" title=\"\">to a hut in New Hampshire stocked with Mr Magorium DVDs</a>). Quinn has been passing the time by making bombs with his top off and sticking them to the fridge, so his refusal to take out Brody last time hasn't led to any sort of demotion from the world of black ops. And Carrie has been hauled up in front of a Senate committee – a closed one, so as to protect agents still active in the field.</p><p>Homeland has often highlighted the less savoury aspects of the CIA – remember the mosque shooting in season one – so it's little wonder that it's on the ropes in this opening episode. Here, the government initially acts as a useful double for viewers, keeping us updated on what's been happening and damning the agency for its cover-ups and negligence. I enjoyed the panel's disbelief that Carrie was so spectacularly fired, then reinstated, echoing what many viewers and readers of this blog felt at the time.</p><p>Carrie isn't very well under interrogation by the committee, childishly blurting out that she doesn't think Brody did it, against the advice of her lawyer and Saul, as well as committing perjury, though this, by contrast, was sticking to their plan. It's no surprise that she's off her meds, but it is a sign of her desperation (or instability) that she's turning to alternative remedies instead. They don't seem to be doing much good, if the state of her notebook is anything to go by, and her father, in particular, is worried. He should be: she's back in the booze aisle and shagging strange men on the stairs, as if the past two seasons didn't happen at all.</p><p>Though Brody doesn't appear, the Brody family are also dealing with the fallout of their \"terrorist\" father. Their house is under surveillance, Jessica's hair has grown dramatically with all the stress, Chris is finally allowed to speak, and Dana has been in a psychiatric unit having tried to kill herself. \"Shit's for real,\" as her comedy hospital boyfriend puts it. She then does what any TV teen in need of a contemporary storyline does, and sexts him a topless picture.</p><p>Saul is struggling with being the big boss. His wife Mira is back at home, though in a separate bedroom, which gives him another chance to assess his life. Mandy Patinkin is so wonderful in these quiet, emotional scenes, and it proves the show doesn't need the big explosions to bolster its dramatic weight. His right hand man is now Dar Adal, which is another shock – he's the sinister boss of black ops, so if they're putting him near the top, that bomb must have truly decimated the leadership. His presence comes in handy with the episode's big set-piece, however: six assassinations (though Saul wobbles over this: \"We're not assassins, we're spies\") across three continents, within a 20-minute window, to take out the brains behind the CIA attack.</p><p>Quinn fails to hit his target initially, as there's a child in the car, but then, in a twist you could see coming from a sniper's sight away, he shot the kid by accident anyway. Oops! Quinn has got feelings, as he showed when he decided not to shoot Brody, so expect that action to have consequences. Saul's pleased that the operation is ostensibly a success – there's a clear hardening of his personality over the course of the episode. But it isn't enough for Senator Lockhart, who goes all conspiracy theorist and suggests that it's convenient timing for the CIA. Saul pulls it back by publicly selling Carrie down the river: following the planted article in the paper, he admits that she's bipolar, she concealed it from him, that she had sex with Brody. I don't like this new, tough Saul one bit.</p><p>The final few minutes aside, this was a surprisingly restrained return, and in many ways, it reset the clock. It left me feeling like I'd seen the old Homeland, rather than the cartoonish season two. Good and bad are collapsing as definitions and the Brody/Carrie love story isn't at the forefront (yet, but hopefully Brody being on the run will keep it that way). I'm cautiously hopeful that this is going to be a quality season.</p><h2>Notes and observations</h2><p>• When Carrie storms into the restaurant to confront Saul and Dar Adal, their attempt to calm her is comical: \"Sit down, have some tiramisu.\" Yeah, that'll do it.</p><p>• What does all the Wizard of Oz code mean? Is it pointing at a symbolic man behind the curtain? Who is it?</p><p>• There's either a new mole at the CIA, or the old mole didn't get blown up, because somebody leaked the Carrie story to the press. Dar Adal says it wasn't him, but he's certainly shady enough to have done it.</p><p>• I wonder if any of the NSA news will make it into the show: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/27/nsa-tv-film-homeland-revelations\" title=\"\">as this blogpost points out, it has covered the Fisa court </a>before, and the appearance of Venezuela may be a sign of Snowden/Assange style storylines to come.</p><p>• It looks as if we have a new villain: Majid Javadi, an Iranian terrorist mastermind responsible for several attacks over the years.</p><p>• I rolled my eyes, Dana style, at the sexting. She has already had one teen-angst storyline with the I Know What You Did Last Summer plot, and now this? No thanks.</p><h2>Exposition of the week</h2><p>\"You mean for someone who got in a bathtub and slit her wrists?\" Jess subtly explains why Dana's been in rehab.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418878952|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9f4df7851cf2cc5bc04f461aa830e21f8327739f -->",

        "headline":"Downton Abbey recap: season four, episode three",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Downton Abbey series four. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/29/downton-abbey-recap-season-four-episode-two\">Viv Groskop's episode two blogpost</a></p><p>Oh, Uncle Julian. How could you? Not Anna. \"This episode contains violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting.\" Heavens above. Well, we were half-prepared for that warning, as there was no preview episode available this week, and the last time that happened Sybil bled to death. And as with the Sybil episode, we didn't really get any action until the last seven minutes.</p><p>As soon as Mini-Den's hip flask appeared, it became obvious. \"He's not going to rape her, is he?\" I asked, like an idiot dupe. And so, of course, it transpired. I am still not sure what to think. \"Nobody else must ever know,\" Anna begged, \"You promise me?\" Trust has been ruptured on many, many levels, both in the house and with the audience. A comb is not going to be of much help here, Mrs Hughes. Nor is a new dress.</p><p>I'm torn between two extremes. One part of me thinks that this plot direction could be just the thing to revive a series which seems baggy and flagging after only three episodes. Could Anna be pregnant? What other liberties will Mini-Den take in the house now that Anna hasn't grassed him up? And what will Bates do when he eventually finds out, as eventually he must? That's if their relationship lasts at all. </p><p>Another part of me feels irritated and betrayed. Anna is a favourite character. There was something gratuitous about throwing this turn of events into the mix, especially when this episode also sowed the seeds of a thousand other subplots involving random new characters. The problem here, as so often in Downton Abbey, is that our emotional investment is so thinly spread across so many characters, shifting viewpoints and mini-scenes with barely one line of dialogue. So when something truly gripping happens, you're just left feeling numb.</p><p>(Note regarding Mini-Den: I will refer to this character, played by Nigel Harman, as Mini-Den for now, the character he used to play in EastEnders. Mostly because his character name has been poorly established so far. He is Mr Green. But he is called Mr Gillingham downstairs in tribute to the name of the aristo he is serving. Get me with my knowledge.)</p><p>Before Anna was attacked, our attention was being splattered all over the place like the jam in a jar opened by Jimmy. Rose was cosying up to a very greasy type. Edith was failing to interest anyone in the imminent German. (Until - hurrah! - he turned out to be a bit of a whiz at poker.) Mary went horse-riding and had a conversation about the Inland Revenue.     </p><p>I half-relished some of the \"something bad's going to happen!\" clangers dropped and looks exchanged throughout this episode. Cora: \"A house party can be so flat if there's no special moment.\" Lord Grantham: \"I want to go out with a bang.\" Edith: \"I should be careful if I were you.\" But by the end of it all, that all felt rather nasty and voyeuristic, when something so genuinely horrible really was about to happen. The horror in Downton is usually fairly pantomime. This felt possibly too real, too desperate. I can't quite forgive it. As Carson put it, \"What a topsy turvy world we've come to.\"</p><h2>Random subplot alert<br /></h2><p>Well, it was all subplot until the last seven minutes. And we had to put up with lines like this from people whose presence was not explained: \"Do you know Isabella Moncrieff? She's blown up like a balloon.\" I do realise that this stuff was designed to show how frustrating it is to be Tom Branson among all these aristos, but unfortunately it felt as tiring to us as it did to him. I did love the fact that Alfred's culinary ambitions returned in this episode. They have surfaced before. But he is going to have to learn to cook something other than bechamel sauce if he is going to get anywhere. And, please, do we have to have a re-run of the doomed love affair between Edna \"duplicitous housemaid\" Braithwaite and Tom \"I'll never be a real aristo\" Branson? It seems we do.</p><h2>Golden Eyebrow Award of the week<br /></h2><p>Almost too many candidates to mention this week. \"How are the squabs doing? What about the syllabubs? Oh my God, the vegetables!\" Mrs Patmore looked as if she were about to have a heart attack. Which she then proceeded to have. Except, no, it was just an anxiety attack. According to Dr Death, anyway.</p><p>Lord Grantham's \"What does one say to a singer?\" was a close eyebrow contender. As was this line from Dame Maggie: \"If I were to search for logic, I would not look for it in the English upper class.\" </p><p>The defender of the eyebrow title fought back bravely: \"An Australian singer, eating with her Ladyship?\" Carson's eyebrow action as ever seemed to indicate a shock so extreme that he would almost choke. Which is no doubt what he thinks would happen to anyone from upstairs forced to sit near an Australian.</p><p>But there could only be one winner tonight. \"You want me to be a footman? I'm having my career backwards.\" Oh the humiliation of having to wear gloves! Mr Molesley wins the Golden Eyebrow. Although I concede that it is partly a sympathy vote.</p><h2>Surprise character development<br /></h2><p>It's getting very difficult to know what we should make of Lady Mary. And I say this with the deepest of sympathy for Michelle Dockery, who is a fabulous actor. \"I loved him. But he changed me. If I were as tough as I was when I met him, maybe I'd be happier now.\" And now the sight of the gramophone has indisposed her. The script for Lady Mary's mourning has been tricky: it's as if she's been told to play out her grief as a waxwork. Now even she is longing for her former self. As are we all. Please, someone, give Mary a direction soon.</p><h2>\"Sorry, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue?\"<br /></h2><p>• \"I'm afraid Tom's small talk is very small indeed.\" \"Not everyone can be Oscar Wilde.\" \"Well, that's a relief.\" Lord Grantham and the dowager countess discussing Tom Branson. Lovely. If Dame Maggie were paid by the word, she'd get next to nothing. </p><p>• \"Oh you know Mary, she's always quite opaque.\" The understatement of the century from Isobel Crawley.</p><p>• \"I have made quite a study of claret.\" What the Australian singer is trying to say is that she likes a drink.</p><h2>Next week<br /></h2><p>Rose meets the jazz man. There's more tension between Anna and Bates. Lady Mary's suitor is back with a vengeance. (Sorry this is brief but I still can't breathe after what happened to Anna. UNCLE JULIAN, HOW COULD YOU?)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419057341|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|05583233871df3be2f07d0c7ba8741fd4de07e6b -->",

        "headline":"Will Arnett's guide to positive thinking",
        "body":"<p><strong>Will Arnett has had his share of ups and downs. As an actor he's had shows pulled out from beneath his feet and, as Gob Bluth, he came up with the idea of Mr Bananagrabber. But now, with the surprise resurrection of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arrested-development\" title=\"\"><strong>Arrested Development</strong></a><strong> and a well-adjusted lead role in new sitcom </strong><a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/shows/featured/the-millers\" title=\"\"><strong>The Millers</strong></a><strong>, he's in a pretty good place. So it seemed like an ideal time to tap the man for some blue-sky dreaming. </strong></p><h2>1 LOOSEN THAT STIFF UPPER LIP</h2><p>I can relate to your British sensibility. It comes from a very real place. It's a societal idea of weathering wars and hardship yet still marching forward even in the most difficult times. But my advice would be: you got through all that! It's time to live a little and enjoy it! And you know what? Here's the other thing: you guys spend a lot of time hungover. And that's hard. So maybe don't drink so much?</p><h2>2 YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT</h2><p>The last time I was in the UK, the food was actually so much better than when I was over there as a kid. That said, when I was a kid it was awful. Today it feels like British tastes are leading the charge in many areas, but you still eat too many sweets. How about you eat fewer sweets? You guys spend so much time on a sugar high, and then you crash. It's like the hangover thing. You people just have too many crashes, you're on a constant rollercoaster.</p><h2>3 WATCH TV AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE…</h2><p>This really is a golden age of television and I think that one thing you could do to become happier is embrace how much television you watch. Too many people try to downplay it. Those people should be shamed at every turn. If more people watch more TV,  then we'll get even more good TV. So on your digital recording device, you really have to record as much TV as you possibly can.</p><h2>4 …AND DON'T GO AND MAKE A CUP OF TEA DURING THE COMMERCIALS</h2><p>Embrace TV advertising; they're artists as well, these people who make commercials and the people who star in them. They are allowing you to sit in your own home, in your most comfortable sweatpants, and be entertained. Instead of rejecting the fine products that bring you these shows, you should enjoy them. Whether it be a soft drink, a crisps manufacturer, a favourite lager or simply just a delicious Curly Wurly.</p><h2>5 MANAGE YOUR CAREER EXPECTATIONS</h2><p>The key to happiness in your career is to set the bar at a reasonable height. Give yourself low thresholds to reach and be constantly delighted with the slightest victory. Then once you start notching a few victories, you'll get the taste of it. That way you can turn yourself into a warrior.</p><h2>6 LEARN TO MANAGE DOMINEERING PERSONALITIES</h2><p>In The Millers, my character Nathan Miller is a normal guy who got divorced but made the conscious decision to move forward with his life. He's a pretty relatable guy; I don't think he's as untethered from the world as some of the other characters I've played. But then his parents also split up, and Nathan's mother moves into his apartment, and she's a very controlling personality. And that's very daunting, especially if it's your mother. I think sometimes you have to take an eastern, zen approach with people who are domineering like that. Maybe the best way is just to forgive them every day for what they do. Every morning, say: \"I know that's how they are, I'm not going to change them, I forgive them.\" And you might make it easier on yourself. Because fighting it is very difficult.</p><h2>7 BE WARY OF THOSE WHO TELL YOU THAT LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE</h2><p>I always reject that. I always say, any place that tells you laughter is the best medicine, I really hope that it's not my local hospital. Because that operating room would be pure madness if it was just people telling jokes while you had to get your gall bladder removed. I'm really a proponent of medicine being the best medicine.</p><h2>8 ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD</h2><p>We experience all the highs and delights of being constantly informed, but we're too concerned with the future rather than enjoying the moment. Maybe if we just lobotomised our digital connectivity a little bit we might experience some actual joy. Before the internet, we did so many amazing and creative things. In fact, we created the internet.</p><h2>9 DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY</h2><p>I'm 43 years old. I don't look a day over 42. And if I've learned anything at this stage in my life, it's that you have to have fun. The ability to laugh every day is truly the tonic for this life. When you are on your deathbed, looking back at the stupid fucking things that you worried about, that gave you such anxiety and were actually so pointless … if you could just enjoy yourself and have a good time, I think you would pass quietly with a smile. Unless, of course, you are murdered in your sleep.</p><p><strong><em>The Millers starts on Comedy Central on 14 Oct</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418854557|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|877687fc307386ebbb082ae271e7295c9bc5ba8a -->",

        "body":"<p>What makes six apparently sensible people agree to have sex in a box on national television? That is what Dean and Rachel, Matt and John, and Lynette and Des have done, in order to help Channel 4 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/23/sex-box-tv-show-reclaim-sex-pornography\" title=\"\">reclaim sex from pornography</a>, the stated aim of its Campaign for Real Sex Season.</p><p>\"We had just got back from holiday,\" says Dean, 21, a supermarket delivery driver. \"We were shopping in Reading. A guy came up to us and said, 'You look like a happy couple. We're doing this programme based on couples and their sex lives ...' I guess because we were in holiday mode, we gave him the time of day.\" Matt has a similar story: he and John were on holiday in Manchester (to coincide with Pride) when they were approached. \"We said yes there and then,\" says Matt, although many subsequent phone calls, Skype conversations and face-to-face meetings with producers ensued.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/sex-box\" title=\"\">Sex Box</a> seems to promise so much – the theory being that  people will talk more frankly about sex straight after having it – but putting sex into a box hardly fits with the anti-repression mission statement. If sex needs to be out in the open more, what is it doing in a shed in the middle of a television studio, with flashing blue lasers around it to indicate that something <em>exciting</em> is happening within?</p><p>Host Mariella Frostrup calls it \"a unique space\", which makes it sound a bit like a pop-up gallery – here for one 60-minute show only. Perhaps that is why time is on the mind of the participants. Off-camera,  they were told to spend around 30 minutes inside. Dean says he got around the problem of not over-running \"by taking my phone in with me\". It's not everyone's idea of a good time but his first act in the box was to \"set the timer\" on his phone.</p><p>Was there a bed? A rug?  Cushions? Dean says that his  contract prevents him from  describing the box's interior.  All he can say is that \"they tried to make it feel as homely as  possible – like a hotel room\". There were washing facilities, condoms and tissues, an emergency switch, but no  ensuite shower. Matt concurs. \"It was very basic.\"</p><p>For Matt and John, there were other technical hitches. It turns out the box has another door not visible to studio or TV audience. \"The funny thing is, you see us going into the box,\" says John. \"Then, because of union rules, everyone can only work so many hours without a break. So we came straight out the back door and went to our dressing room. We were able to go for a shower and everything, and at least start some foreplay before going back in.\"</p><p>Putting people in a box to have sex, and then asking them to wait until the crew has had its tea, sums up all that is wrong with this show. What did any of the participants think they were going to achieve?</p><p>John and Matt are both chefs,  and John didn't come out until 2007, in his mid-30s, \"because I lived at work\". He felt he had no choice but to be honest with his colleagues. He and Matt live together but, says John, \"Our private life isn't exactly private. You can't really do anything. You can't have anything delivered without them knowing – oh, another parcel for the gay couple upstairs. We were hoping to put a few facts right, that not all gay men wear dresses.\" Matt's reasons are similar. \"We're both gay but we're not really in a gay community as such. We don't have loads of gay friends. We thought just by being part of the conversation , we're doing our bit to show what it's like.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the actual show's post-sex conversations make post-match interviews with football managers seem exciting. (It's a pity they couldn't have got Roy Hodgson on to liven things up.) When Dean is asked the big question – what did he and Rachel do in the box – he seems embarrassed. \"Main thing first, taking the clothes off obviously. Then,\" he tells the panel, \"just a bit of foreplay.\" Rachel nods. \"Then straight into it.\" Into what? \"Into sexual intercourse, obviously,\" says Dean. None of the participants in the final programme is articulate about their box sex. Speaking on the phone, John is more eloquent. He says that his and Matt's experience was \"like when me and Matt did anal for the first time. We hyped it up so much. It was so much better after, when it just happened without being planned and nature took its course.\"</p><p>There is a lesson for everyone there. Pornography can sleep  easy tonight.</p><p><em>Sex Box, Monday 7 October, 10pm, Channel 4</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419078562|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|12d4af5ec97a197133010feb00e466967d8748ad -->",

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Agents of SHIELD on Channel 4 in the UK. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode two</em></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/27/agents-of-shield-recap-season-one-episode-one-pilot\" title=\"\">Click here to read Graeme's episode one blogpost</a></p><p></p><p>They may not have invented the concept, but the Marvel movies have perfected the \"post-credits sting\": addictive choc drops for fans faithful enough to sit through screeds of acknowledgements. These scenes featured surprising cameos and dangled enough common plot threads to sell the idea of a shared Marvel universe, where Tony Stark could <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9cByNCQwXA\" title=\"\">sashay into the world of the Incredible Hulk</a> or the Avengers could silently enjoy some <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYiZeszLosE\" title=\"\">post-New-York-saving shawarma</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since it worked so well on the big screen, it shouldn't be that much of a surprise that the same gimmick has been applied to Agents of SHIELD. And after the ABC network confirmed a post-credits cameo appearance in episode two to sustain the initial hype, the smart money was always going to be on Samuel L Jackson. As eye-patched Nick Fury, he technically heads up the whole SHIELD operation and watching him carpet Agent Phil Coulson for nearly destroying \"the Bus\" – everyone's preferred nickname for SHIELD's airborne mobile command station –&nbsp;was undoubtedly a thrill. Even just hearing Fury exasperatedly refer to science spods Fitz and Simmons felt like it helped establish them as \"real\" characters.</p><p></p><p>This, of course, all happened after the episode proper, which was technically the first field-test for Coulson's hand-picked crew of loners and outcasts: two antisocial yet lethal operatives, two science geeks and now Skye, an embedded hacker unfamiliar with all the barked military jargon, feeling essentially like a spare part. The episode title was 0-8-4 –&nbsp;SHIELD code for \"an object of unidentified origin\" – but this was really a team-building exercise in all senses, an opportunity to flesh out the relationships and dynamics hurriedly established in the pilot. And for the most part, it worked – in that by the end of the episode, the squabbling team had found some common ground. Turns out nothing clears the air like an unexpected rapid depressurisation at 30,000ft.</p><p></p><p>The 0-8-4 in question was a volatile <a href=\"http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/HYDRA\" title=\"\">Hydra</a>, super-laser powered by the <a href=\"http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Tesseract\" title=\"\">Tesseract</a>, the neon-blue cosmic energy MacGuffin previously featured in both Captain America and Avengers Assemble. After retrieving it from a Peruvian temple – an action encounter with local rebels that, deliberately or not, evoked the A-Team in its jeep-flipping, arbitrary-machine-gunning heyday – the team regrouped in the relative safety of the Bus. There, they fraternised with a squad of military police led by Commandant Reyes (Leonor Varela), a lady with some tantalising history with Coulson.</p><p></p><p>Watching these former lovers reconnect over tales of espionage and memorabilia showcased perhaps Agents of SHIELD's greatest asset: Clark Gregg, who imbues Coulson with both stoicism and self-amusement. When the inevitable double-cross came, with Reyes and her lackeys hijacking the Bus in an attempt to secure the 0-8-4 for the motherland, Coulson's faith in his imprisoned team seemed genuine rather than a desperate bluff. These bickering agents of SHIELD are elevated when we see them through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The hero fightback involved the five prickly talents each applying their skillsets – \"Pieces solving a puzzle,\" according to Skye – and the operation even shaded in more backstory for neck-snapping ninja Melinda May. The Bus, however, took a hell of a beating, although it remained structurally sound enough to accomodate some post-0-8-4-saving beers on the boarding ramp. The heartwarming scene of backslapping and bonding was undermined at the death by the texted revelation that Skye might be an infiltrator rather than ally.</p><p></p><p>So that was episode two, which had far less hands-on involvement from Joss Whedon himself, but generally seemed to stay on course in terms of tone, garlanding the necessary exposition with gags and keeping things shuttling along at a decent clip. The trip to Peru managed to imply SHIELD's global bailiwick, even if most of the action was restricted to the more manageable interior of the Bus. Plot-wise, things perhaps still feel a little inconsequential, but there is already an emotional fuse running under the surface – the more time we get to spend hanging out with Coulson, the bigger the emotional wallop when the dark secret of his resurrection is revealed.</p><p></p><h2>Notes and observations</h2><p>• The cute little quadcopters introduced in the pilot look set to be recurring gadgets. Like Marvel, ABC is owned by Disney, which must make it easier to get away with naming these sensor drones after the seven dwarves.</p><p></p><p>• As Skye settled into her new SHIELD digs, a lot of visual emphasis was placed on the hula-skirted dashboard doll she brought from her hacker van. Could it be a memento from Tahiti? I hear it's a magical place.</p><p></p><p>• Simmons snapping a quick selfie of her and Fitz at the Peruvian ziggurat: very 2013.</p><p></p><p>• Did Coulson's old flame Reyes look familiar? Chilean actor Leonor Varela previously starred as a vampire ninja princess in Guillermo del Toro's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91611/blade.ii\" title=\"\">Blade II</a>, yet another property based on Marvel characters. Here she is (SPOILER) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmECv3jv9GM\" title=\"\">turning into dandruff in Blade's arms</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Biff! Bang! Quip-ow!</h2><p>• \"Imagine what she'll do with our resources.\" \"I am. That's exactly what I'm imagining during this frown.\" (Agent Ward smuggles a joke into his sternness.)</p><p></p><p>• \"You took a bullet?\" \"Ish.\" (Coulson downplays his return from the dead.)</p><p></p><p>• \"This is my fault. I should have learned kung-fu.\" (Fitz feels bad about being overpowered by a Peruvian squaddie.)</p><p></p><p>• \"Oh Phil, you're not even aware! Your renewed idealism, your collectibles, your airborne man-cave! Surrounding yourself with young, attractive agents! You're having a midlife crisis!\" (Double-crossing Reyes offers her own recap of the show.)</p><p></p><p>• \"Are you mental? I did explain in great detail what I meant, using the Queen's bloody English!\" (Fitz drops some lines that sound more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/misfits\" title=\"\">Misfits</a> than Marvel.)</p><p></p><h2>The SHIELD book club</h2><p>After guerilla-marketing the Travis McGee series of novels in the pilot, there was another reading recommendation in episode two. Skye catches straight-arrow Agent Ward thumbing a paperback. \"Hunger Games?\" she asks. \"Matterhorn,\" he replies, referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/11/marlantes-matterhorn-book-review\" title=\"\">Karl Marlantes' gruelling 2010 novel</a> about Vietnam told from a GI's point of view.</p><p></p><h2>Comics callbacks</h2><p>In this episode, we learned the callsign for \"the Bus\" was SHIELD 616. With so many comics stories involving alternate dimensions, Marvel eventually had to create a filing system to keep track of their bulging multiverse. <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Earth-616\" title=\"\">Earth-616 is the mainstream Marvel universe, the \"real\" one</a>. Days of Future Past, the apocalyptic X-Men storyline being adapted into a 2014 movie, takes place over in <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Earth-811\" title=\"\">Earth-811</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Meanwhile, in the real world ...</h2><p>The final tally of US ratings for the Agents of SHIELD pilot – factoring in timeshifted viewing and a Thursday night repeat that actually beat the season six premiere of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/27/parks-and-recreation-season-six-london\" title=\"\">Parks and Recreation</a> – topped 22 million viewers. That's good news, right?</p><p></p><p>Not entirely. Those <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Galactus\" title=\"\">Galactus</a>-sized numbers meant the ratings for episode two looked disappointing at first glance, down to <a href=\"http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/02/agents-of-shield-ratings-samuel-l-jackson-makes-cameo/\" title=\"\">8.4 million viewers watching live</a>, a drop of 34%. Still fairly respectable though.</p><p></p><p>Channel 4 will be happy enough –&nbsp;with over 3.1 million viewers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/30/the-it-crowd-channel-4\" title=\"\">Agents of SHIELD was the channel's biggest drama launch of 2013</a>. The first episode also rolled straight into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/27/it-crowd-finale-great-comedy-ayoade-odowd\" title=\"\">the last ever episode of The IT Crowd</a>, another show focused on abrasive backroom staff charged with keeping things running smoothly. (By accident or design, the opening minutes of the IT Crowd were littered with Marvel references too.)</p><p></p><p>If you fancy another ad-hoc Marvel double-bill, Sky Living is screening The Blacklist on Fridays at 9pm from tonight. It's an opportunity to catch up with how oily and evil James Spader can be – useful, since he's playing <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/01/the-avengers-2-james-spader-talks-ultron\" title=\"\">mechanical baddie Ultron</a> in the blockbusting sequel to Avengers Assemble.</p><p></p><p><em>What did you think of Agents of SHIELD episode two?

They appear to be training on a train, as you do.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-05T20:25:18.500+01:00\">at 8.25pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52504acbe4b041f09f138a0e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-05T18:23:34.970+01:00\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Tess is wearing a bin bag, whilst Claudia is wearing a bin bag with vegetables spilling out.

Last weekend all our celeb/pro couplings shook their dancefloor thang for the first time, with results that swung wildly from hilarious to heinous, via an handful of actually pretty decent performances. Some I’m very much looking forward to seeing again tonight (Sophie, Patrick, Rachel, Ben), some not so much (Hairy Dave, Vanessa). Some I have already entirely forgotten (him off Hollyoaks, golf man, WAG, actor chap, dragon). I think it's time to start sending some people home.</p> <p>In other news, Brucie has flu and won’t be joining us this evening, so it’s a double dose of Claudia this weekend. Hope Bruce gets well soon, am sure Clauds will do a splendid job.</p> <p>I’ll be here from 6.20pm for OVER TWO HOURS of dance/glitter/fake tan action. That's FIFTEEN dances, which makes it quite a hefty liveblog with no ad breaks, so bring snacks and booze, and feel free to help me out by being hilarious/wise/insightful in the comment box. See you then!</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-05T17:49:24.783+01:00\">at 5.49pm BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419082715|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fd26f608ff3db2afa1d07108a80db8b798e93270 -->",

        "body":"<p>Premiership footballers Snapchatting threesomes, Kinga in the Big Brother garden with the wine bottle, my friend Victoria who once noshed off a stranger on the Eurostar. We truly live in a glorious, rainbow Gomorrah. Sexy times in the past, though, were a starchy unmentionable that happened in the dark on select Thursdays. So what changed? For the answer, and some tits, let's turn to <strong>Masters Of Sex </strong><em>(Tuesday, 9pm, C4)</em>.</p><p>WHOOAAH, come again? As arresting titles go, this is up there with, say, Reich Plenipotentiary For Total War (shoutout to Goebbels). It sounds like a bottle of internet dick pills. You approach a programme called Masters Of Sex at the same speed you would a paddling pool full of syringes and Boris Johnson, right? Wrong! This is a classy affair. We're talking Michael Sheen classy.</p><p>So I guess Sheen is playing another real-life character? What the … ? How did you … ? Yeah, Dr William H Masters, a 1950s gynaecologist who revolutionised our understanding of female biology. When we meet him, Masters is cock of the walk, swivelling into obstetric stirrups like John Wayne. His mission is to demystify the whole shame-drenched realm of sex. How? By placing live rumpus pumpus under university-lab observation, creating an inventory of what goes in where, at what angle and for how long. He confesses he would like to pick up a Nobel prize for his dong chronicles.</p><p>\"He's the alpha dog of coochie medicine,\" one secretary purrs to another, as if reading the liner notes on a Lil Wayne album. Masters may be at the top of the gynaecological game – if you can call it that; I'm pretty sure you can't – but he's also as uptight as a DVT sock on an elephant. \"On your bottom now. Knees to the chest,\" he directs his wife after a typically unerotic stab at procreation. (It doesn't help that she calls him \"Daddy\", which is pretty heebies.)</p><p>Cold-fish Masters needs help recruiting female volunteers for sexperiments and also not freaking everyone out with his bowtie. Enter Virginia Johnson, a twice-divorced, mother-of-two nightclub singer out to better herself. She's played superbly by Lizzy Caplan, radiating provocative modernity like kryptonite. Johnson careens through social norms like a Ford Mustang through cardboard boxes. We see her kicking a clingy young fuck-buddy out of bed like toast crumbs. Other women confuse sex and love, she ventures later, but sex is great on its own. Masters gives her a job, eyes dilated in professional arousal.</p><p>Spunky Ginny and the boffin of boffing embark on their fishy endeavour, watching strangers hump in sealed examination rooms. Electrode-nippled women stroke themselves to orgasm on gurneys. A huge camera dildo is invented, named Ulysses – \"after the Kirk Douglas movie about a giant Cyclops\". An aghast university provost is encouraged to peer inside a lady. It's funny and strangely quaint. Especially delightful is Betty the prostitute, an oracle of female mystery who sounds like a laryngitic Olive Oyl.</p><p>\"Is this … 'faking it' … common practice amongst prostitutes?\" Masters asks her.</p><p>\"It's a cammen practice amongst anyone with a twot.\"</p><p>As you'd expect, it's all pretty sexy, in an electrodes-on-tits sort of way. Caplan spends significant screentime in the altogether, though, predictably, we never see the sheen of Michael's balls. (Maybe because male genitals resemble a disappointed proboscis monkey, best-case scenario.) Yet while Kleenex hoverers – drawn in from the rain by the neon title – will appreciate the romping, the show slips in its own feminist agenda like an unexpected finger. Michelle Ashford's clever script is deeper than dildo skits and broads shooting from the hip; it's a howl at the double standards of decorous society, and the medical, social and personal cost of shame.</p><p>Ignore that awkward yeast infection of a title; this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. With benefits.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418854379|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3189248a8c2170c0280085112d7d520966916177 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Clear Spot: The Trebus Project</strong> (<a href=\"http://resonancefm.com/archives/15206\" title=\"\">Resonance FM</a>)</p><p><strong>Book of the Week: Beowulf</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03byzzf\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p><p><strong>Keeping it Real</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03brkdv\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p><p>David Clegg has worked with people with dementia for a long time, and he talks to them a lot – or rather, they talk to him. He lets them tell their stories, no matter how jumbled or fragmented or strangely worded. And he records them, takes notes. Carefully, he pieces together narratives – a series of snapshots – from their damaged memories. Sometimes, the words a patient speaks to him are the last they ever speak.</p><p>Clegg has turned these records into a piece of work called <a href=\"http://www.trebusprojects.org/\" title=\"\">the Trebus Project</a>. It has its own website and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Trebus-Project-Ltd/150281061708809\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a> and, last week, Resonance FM gave some of the Trebus stories an airing on <a href=\"http://resonancefm.com/archives/15206\" title=\"\"><strong>Clear Spot</strong></a>. Clegg had turned the words of some of the dementia sufferers into short speeches, voiced by actors such as Russell Tovey, Linda Robson and Charlie Higson. He's done this before, for the Radio 4 series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01120sf\" title=\"\"><em>Ancient Mysteries</em></a>, in 2011, but Resonance's show was longer.</p><p>Actually, I'm not sure that it wasn't too long. It's not that it wasn't interesting, or moving, or wonderful (it was all of those things), but each tale required you to listen hard, in order to try to piece together what the speaker wanted you to understand. Some stories were easy, some had force behind them – Michael's tale, of a violent childhood, was a small film in itself. Most were like little mysteries, with clues dropped here and there, though they lacked a neat denouement, a final reveal at the end. They just… stopped.</p><p>The first half an hour comprised reasonably coherent tales, of being an actor – \"everyone met everyone at a party!\" – widowed by the war; of hiding homosexuality from a stern papa. The second half hour, devoted to those who were further along the dementia scale, was more abstract. One poor lady kept repeating an anxious mantra of getting up and going to Sainsbury's; a man wrestled unsuccessfully with language: \"It's so funny, so much… stuff… and he got the thing, you know\". He reminded me of my young daughter, who chats and chats in words that are individually quite comprehensible; but unless you know her context – that she's talking about a film, or a story that her dad told her about his childhood, or she's describing what happened on the way to the park – her tales make no sense at all, and she hasn't the language to develop them. The listener who wasn't with her can tell that they're significant, but is unable to work out what's happened. A translator is needed. But with dementia sufferers, there is often no one close to them who's still alive to translate.</p><p>The final speaker was, for me, the most moving: an intelligent man who knew that dementia was coming but slipped in and out of comprehension: \"You get a flash of the horror of the situation, rushes of acuity… Time passes differently here.\" Without full memories, we drift on washes of emotion, living life in confusion between dreams and what is actually happening.</p><p>The voices on Trebus were lovely; lovely, too, to hear Seamus Heaney reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/seamus-heaney-beowulf-anglo-saxon\" title=\"\">his translation</a> of <em>Beowulf</em>. This was divided into easy-to-digest 15-minute offerings in Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03byzzf\" title=\"\"><strong>Book of the Week </strong></a>slot. If I'm honest, the story lost me occasionally – all those swords and shields and epic quests – but Heaney's voice was so wonderful I couldn't switch off.</p><p>And for some light relief, may I recommend comedy writer Jane Bussman's take on the contemporary obsession with authenticity, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03brkdv\" title=\"\"><strong>Keeping It Real</strong></a>? If you're bothered by what is genuine (hand-crafted, individually made, sung from direct experience) and what is not (supermarket-owned, mass-produced, devised by Simon Cowell in collusion with a major record label), then this is the programme for you. It won't make you feel any better about what one contributor called your \"dopey nostalgia\", but it will certainly make you laugh.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419071194|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0899cfa7c3a08054cdb69ca490a2329c07517dfd -->",

        "body":"<p>Oh, to be Norwegian. It has been announced that NRK, the country's state broadcaster, will soon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2013/oct/03/norwegian-tv-knitathon-slow-tv\" title=\"\">show a programme about a sweater being knitted</a>. That's it. Norwegian viewers will tune in and watch a sheep being sheared, before seeing its wool being spun and used to knit a sweater. This will happen in real time. Nobody seems to know how long this show will last for. Some say five hours, some say eight. It's enough to make non-Norwegians everywhere insane with jealousy.</p><p>And the fact that this isn't even Norway's first incredibly long TV show about hardly anything just makes it worse. In February there was a 12-hour programme about a log fire being built and maintained. And a 10-hour show following a train journey from Oslo to Bergen. And 18 consecutive hours of salmon spawning. And a five-day broadcast of a cruise ship travelling up the Norwegian coast. It's all part of a movement called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television\" title=\"\">Slow TV</a>, and I desperately want to see it happen over here.</p><p>Competition from digital channels and second screens means that TV is now louder and faster and needier than ever. Watching a major terrestrial channel on a Saturday evening is like being trapped in a burning cell with a crying, attention-seeking lunatic who screams and punches himself in the face whenever he thinks you're about to look away. It's exhausting, and Slow TV seems the perfect antidote. Whether it is being actively watched, or just used as a screensaver for people who want to be comforted by the constant click-clacking of knitting needles in the background as they go about their daily business, I'm convinced that Slow TV has a future here. It already has a past, more or less.</p><p>Back before producers knew better, I once watched an episode of Big Brother where nothing happened. It was live, it was Sunday afternoon and all the housemates were napping in the garden, so nothing happened. Maybe one of them would scratch their nose or roll over, but that was it. It was an hour of sleeping, soundtracked by the distant buzz of planes overhead. And, even though it's obviously massively creepy to say that you enjoy watching people sleep, I could have watched it for much longer. In a very gentle way, it was just as exciting and disruptive as anything else I've seen.</p><p>We should give Slow TV a try. If the knitting show is popular in Norway – and previous Slow TV ratings suggest it will be – just think of all those old country crafts and pursuits that could be televised over here. Fly fishing. Live thatching. A day in a Sussex trug workshop. It would be like <a href=\"http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/how-its-made\" title=\"\">How It's Made</a>, but in real time and without the annoying voiceover. I'd watch that. Imagine if there was a channel where you could have seen the Shard being built, pane by pane, from the foundations up. That would have been brilliant.</p><p>Slow TV could allow Springwatch to actually live up to its premise. Let's do away with all the presenters and editing. Let's just train a camera on a pregnant ewe and not turn it off until she gives birth. Better yet, let's switch the camera on at the moment of conception, so we can see every single second of the pregnancy, too. Imagine how invested we'd all be in the lamb by the time its mother went into labour. We could have a street parade for it the next day and everything.</p><p>Perhaps Slow TV needs to be a red button affair. Remember how great it was during the Olympics, when you could switch from event to event? Wouldn't it be great if the same technology was brought in for a multichannel Slow TV extravaganza? It would be a world of limitless opportunity. You could lose days flitting between the Ant Farm channel, the Hospital Outpatients Waiting Room channel and the Watching a Helium Balloon Slowly Lose Its Buoyancy and Drift to the Floor of an Abandoned Ballroom Over the Course of Two or Three Weeks channel. I genuinely believe that the Norwegians are on to something here. Slow TV cannot reach these shores quickly enough.</p><p>Just don't make me liveblog any of it. That's all I ask.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419054219|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|34d1cf72063e63713c2454b2d0a0732b4c48cdbd -->",
