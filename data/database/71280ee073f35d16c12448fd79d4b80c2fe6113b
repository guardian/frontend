        "body":"<p>A shipment of unlicensed veterinary drugs intended for use on horses, which was seized from a Dubai government jet at Stansted airport in Essex earlier this year, has sparked a major internal inquiry within the operations of Britain's biggest owner of racehorses.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed, the monarch of Dubai and a major international figure in horse racing and breeding, has asked his junior wife, Princess Haya, to conduct an  investigation into the seizure, which came to light following a similar raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket last month, a location owned by the sheikh's Darley Stud.</p><p>Thousands of pounds worth of anaesthetics, anti-inflammatories, sedatives and bute – described as \"potentially toxic and dangerous to horses\" – were seized and destroyed at Stansted on 3 May following the arrival of a plane belonging to the Dubai Royal Air Wing. The airport is 30 miles from Newmarket, a global centre for thoroughbred racing and the UK headquarters of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation, the UK's leading stable.</p><p>A month earlier in April, Godolphin was embroiled in the biggest doping scandal in racing history, when one of Sheikh Mohammed's leading trainers, Mahmood al-Zarooni, administered anabolic steroids to 22 horses and received an eight-year ban from racing. The British Horseracing Authority, in a report on the affair, said he had acted \"autonomously\".</p><p>The BHA was contacted by the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs about the May incident and is confident that the products seized at Stansted \"were not intended for use on thoroughbreds\" and that there is no link with racing. A number of the products are widely available and known to be used for the training and upkeep of endurance horses.</p><p>Keith Chandler, president of the British Equine Veterinary Association, said some of the drugs seized should be \"kept under lock and key in a safe\". He added: \"They really are medicines that should not be on the premises of any horse owner, no matter how experienced.\"</p><p>Since the emergence of both seizures, Princess Haya has sent out a directive to all Sheikh Mohammed's equine operations, including Darley and Godolphin, asking for co-operation in setting up a central auditing system for veterinary products.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418591957|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a40d42f48e63468a6c27d5656f0bd50fd08eed85 -->",
