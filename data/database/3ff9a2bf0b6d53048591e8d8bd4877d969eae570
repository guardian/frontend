        "headline":"Anger swells after NSA phone records court order revelations",
        "body":"<p>The scale of America's surveillance state was laid bare on Thursday as senior politicians revealed that the US counter-terrorism effort had swept up swaths of personal data from the phone calls of millions of citizens for years.</p><p>After the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">revelation by the Guardian</a> of a sweeping secret court order that authorised the FBI to seize all call records from a subsidiary of Verizon, the Obama administration sought to defuse mounting anger over what critics described as the broadest surveillance ruling ever issued.</p><p>A White House spokesman said that laws governing such orders \"are something that have been in place for a number of years now\" and were vital for protecting national security. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the Verizon court order had been in place for seven years. \"People want the homeland kept safe,\" Feinstein said. </p><p>But as the implications of the blanket approval for obtaining phone data reverberated around Washington and beyond, anger grew among other politicians.</p><p>Intelligence committee member Mark Udall, who has previously warned in broad terms about the scale of government snooping, said: \"This sort of widescale surveillance should concern all of us and is the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking.\" Former vice-president Al Gore described the \"secret blanket surveillance\" as \"obscenely outrageous\".</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order\">Verizon order</a> was made under the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) as amended by the Patriot Act of 2001, passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. But one of the authors of the Patriot Act, Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, said he was troubled by the Guardian revelations. He said that he had written to the attorney general, Eric Holder, questioning whether \"US constitutional rights were secure\".</p><p>He said: \"I do not believe the broadly drafted Fisa order is consistent with the requirements of the Patriot Act. Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.\"</p><p>The White House sought to defend what it called \"a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats\". White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Fisa orders were used to \"support important and highly sensitive intelligence collection operations\" on which members of Congress were fully briefed.</p><p>\"The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the intelligence community in both houses of Congress,\" Earnest said.</p><p>He pointed out that the order only relates to the so-called metadata surrounding phone calls rather than the content of the calls themselves. \"The order reprinted overnight does not allow the government to listen in on anyone's telephone calls,\" Earnest said.</p><p>\"The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the name of any subscriber. It relates exclusively to call details, such as a telephone number or the length of a telephone call.\"</p><p>But such metadata can provide authorities with vast knowledge about a caller's identity. Particularly when cross-checked against other public records, the metadata can reveal someone's name, address, driver's licence, credit history, social security number and more. Government analysts would be able to work out whether the relationship between two people was ongoing, occasional or a one-off.</p><p>The disclosure has reignited longstanding debates in the US over the proper extent of the government's domestic spying powers.</p><p>Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate intelligence committee who, along with Udell, has expressed concern about the extent of US government surveillance, warned of \"sweeping, dragnet surveillance\". He said: \"I am barred by Senate rules from commenting on some of the details at this time, However, I believe that when law-abiding Americans call their friends, who they call, when they call, and where they call from is private information.</p><p>\"Collecting this data about every single phone call that every American makes every day would be a massive invasion of Americans' privacy.\"</p><h2>'Beyond Orwellian'</h2><p>Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \"From a civil liberties perspective, the program could hardly be any more alarming. It's a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents.</p><p>\"It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.\"</p><p>Under the Bush administration, officials in security agencies had disclosed to reporters the large-scale collection of call records data by the NSA, but this is the first time significant and top-secret documents have revealed the continuation of the practice under President Obama.</p><p>The order names Verizon Business Services, a division of Verizon Communications. In its first-quarter earnings report, published in April, Verizon Communications listed about 10 million commercial lines out of a total of 121 million customers. The court order, which lasts  for three months from 25 April, does not specify what type of lines are being tracked. It is not clear whether any additional orders exist to cover Verizon's wireless and residential customers, or those of other phone carriers.</p><p>Fisa court orders typically direct the production of records pertaining to a specific, named target suspected of being an agent of a terrorist group or foreign state, or a finite set of individually named targets. The unlimited nature of the records being handed over to the NSA is extremely unusual.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410290240'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/6/1370534175213/6b724a6f-cf5d-4f01-b37f-5fc47b3db6e1-460x276.jpeg' alt='Senators Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman, speak to reporters about the NSA cull of phone records.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Senators Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman, speak to reporters about the NSA cull of phone records. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Feinstein said she believed the order had been in place for some time. She said: \"As far as I know this is the exact three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years. This renewal is carried out by the [foreign intelligence surveillance] court under the business records section of the Patriot Act. Therefore it is lawful. It has been briefed to Congress.\"</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights said in a statement that the secret court order was unprecedented. \"As far as we know this order from the Fisa court is the broadest surveillance order to ever have been issued: it requires no level of suspicion and applies to all Verizon [business services] subscribers anywhere in the US.</p><p>\"The Patriot Act's incredibly broad surveillance provision purportedly authorizes an order of this sort, though its constitutionality is in question and several senators have complained about it.\"</p><p>Russell Tice, a retired National Security Agency intelligence analyst and whistleblower, said: \"What is going on is much larger and more systemic than anything anyone has ever suspected or imagined.\"</p><p>Although an anonymous senior Obama administration official said that \"on its face\" the court order revealed by the Guardian did not authorise the government to listen in on people's phone calls, Tice now believes the NSA has constructed such a capability.</p><p>\"I figured it would probably be about 2015\" before the NSA had \"the computer capacity … to collect all digital communications word for word,\" Tice said. \"But I think I'm wrong. I think they have it right now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410240126|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|cd1e5c0383cdfe771336131f12bcdbfb19a172ca -->",

I don't have time at the moment to address all of the fallout because - to borrow someone else's phrase - I'm Looking Forward to future revelations that are coming (and coming shortly), not Looking Backward to ones that have already come.</p><p>But I do want to make two points. One is about whistleblowers, and the other is about threats of investigations emanating from Washington:</p><p>1) Ever since the Nixon administration broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychoanalyst's office, the tactic of the US government has been to attack and demonize whistleblowers as a means of distracting attention from their own exposed wrongdoing and destroying the credibility of the messenger so that everyone tunes out the message. That attempt will undoubtedly be made here.</p><p>I'll say more about all that shortly, but for now: as these whistleblowing acts becoming increasingly demonized (\"reprehensible\", <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/869-dni-statement-on-activities-authorized-under-section-702-of-fisa\">declared</a> Director of National Intelligence James Clapper yesterday), please just spend a moment considering the options available to someone with access to numerous Top Secret documents. </p><p>They could easily enrich themselves by selling those documents for huge sums of money to foreign intelligence services. They could seek to harm the US government by acting at the direction of a foreign adversary and covertly pass those secrets to them. They could gratuitously expose the identity of covert agents.</p><p>None of the whistleblowers persecuted by the Obama administration as part of its unprecedented attack on whistleblowers has done any of that: not one of them. Nor have those who are responsible for these current disclosures. </p><p>They did not act with any self-interest in mind. The opposite is true: they undertook great personal risk and sacrifice for one overarching reason: to make their fellow citizens aware of what their government is doing in the dark. Their objective is to educate, to democratize, to create accountability for those in power.</p><p>The people who do this are heroes. They are the embodiment of heroism. They do it knowing exactly what is likely to be done to them by the planet's most powerful government, but they do it regardless. They don't benefit in any way from these acts. I don't want to over-simplify: human beings are complex, and usually act with multiple, mixed motives. But read <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/what-we-dont-know-about-spying-on-citizens-scarier-than-what-we-know/276607/\">this outstanding essay</a> on this week's disclosures from The Atlantic's security expert, Bruce Schneier, to understand why these brave acts are so crucial.</p><p>Those who step forward to blow these whistles rarely benefit at all. The ones who benefit are you. You discover what you should know but what is hidden from you: namely, the most consequential acts being taken by those with the greatest power, and how those actions are affecting your life, your country and your world. </p><p>In 2008, <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/0080cc578614b42284_2a0mvyxpz.pdf\">candidate Obama decreed</a> that \"often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out,\" and he hailed whistleblowing as: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled as they have been during the Bush administration.\"</p></blockquote><p>The current incarnation of Obama prosecutes those same whistlelblowers at double the number of all previous presidents combined, and spent the campaign season <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/obama-campaign-brags-about-whistleblower-persecutions\">boasting about it</a>.</p><p>The 2008 version of Obama was right. As the various attacks are inevitably unleashed on the whistleblower(s) here, they deserve the gratitude and - especially - the support of everyone, including media outlets, for the noble acts that they have undertaken for the good of all of us. When it comes to what the Surveillance State is building and doing in the dark, we are much more informed today than we were yesterday, and will be much more informed tomorrow than we are today, thanks to them. </p><p>(2) Like puppets reading from a script, various Washington officials almost immediately began spouting all sorts of threats about \"investigations\" they intend to launch about these disclosures. This has been their playbook for several years now: they want to deter and intimidate anyone and everyone who might shed light on what they're doing with their abusive, manipulative exploitation of the power of law to punish those who bring about transparency. </p><p>That isn't going to work. It's beginning completely to backfire on them. It's precisely because such behavior reveals their true character, their propensity to abuse power, that more and more people are determined to bring about accountability and transparency for what they do.</p><p>They can threaten to investigate all they want. But as this week makes clear, and will continue to make clear, the ones who will actually be investigated are them. </p><p>The way things are supposed to work is that we're supposed to know virtually everything about what they do: that's why they're called <em>public</em> servants. They're supposed to know virtually nothing about what we do: that's why we're called <em>private </em>individuals.</p><p>This dynamic - the hallmark of a healthy and free society - has been radically reversed. Now, they know everything about what we do, and are constantly building systems to know more. Meanwhile, we know less and less about what they do, as they build walls of secrecy behind which they function. That's the imbalance that needs to come to an end. No democracy can be healthy and functional if the most consequential acts of those who wield political power are completely unknown to those to whom they are supposed to be accountable.</p><p>There seems to be this mentality in Washington that as soon as they stamp TOP SECRET on something they've done we're all supposed to quiver and allow them to do whatever they want without transparency or accountability under its banner. These endless investigations and prosecutions and threats are designed to bolster that fear-driven dynamic. But it isn't working. It's doing the opposite. </p><p>The times in American history when political power was constrained was when they went too far and the system backlashed and imposed limits. That's what happened in the mid-1970s when the excesses of J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon became so extreme that the legitimacy of the political system depended upon it imposing restraints on itself. And that's what is happening now as the government continues on its orgies of whistleblower prosecutions, trying to criminalize journalism, and building a massive surveillance apparatus that destroys privacy, all in the dark. The more they overreact to measures of accountability and transparency - the more they so flagrantly abuse their power of secrecy and investigations and prosecutions - the more quickly that backlash will arrive.</p><p>I'm going to go ahead and take the Constitution at its word that we're guaranteed the right of a free press. So, obviously, are other people doing so. And that means that it isn't the people who are being threatened who deserve and will get the investigations, but those issuing the threats who will get that. That's why there's a free press. That's what <em>adversarial</em> journalism means.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410313470|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|b51a74b6b4dca6042fdf0cd6ca259cece9160d67 -->",

        "headline":"NSA surveillance: the US is behaving like China",
        "body":"<p>Even though we know governments do all kinds of things I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/10/obama-pressured-explain-nsa-surveillance\" title=\"\">Prism</a>. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights.</p><p>I lived in the United States for 12 years. This abuse of state power goes totally against my understanding of what it means to be a civilised society, and it will be shocking for me if American citizens allow this to continue. The US has a great tradition of individualism and privacy and has long been a centre for free thinking and creativity as a result.</p><p>In our experience in China, basically there is no privacy at all – that is why China is far behind the world in important respects: even though it has become so rich, it trails behind in terms of passion, imagination and creativity.</p><p>Of course, we live under different kinds of legal conditions – in the west and in developed nations there are other laws that can balance or restrain the use of information if the government has it. That is not the case in China, and individuals are completely naked as a result. Intrusions can completely ruin a person's life, and I don't think that could happen in western nations.</p><p>But still, if we talk about abusive interference in individuals' rights, Prism does the same. It puts individuals in a very vulnerable position. Privacy is a basic human right, one of the very core values. There is no guarantee that China, the US or any other government will not use the information falsely or wrongly. I think especially that a nation like the US, which is technically advanced, should not take advantage of its power. It encourages other nations.</p><p>Before the information age the Chinese government could decide you were a counter-revolutionary just because a neighbour reported something they had overheard. Thousands, even millions of lives were ruined through the misuse of such information.</p><p>Today, through its technical abilities, the state can easily get into anybody's bank account, private mail, conversations, and social media accounts. The internet and social media give us new possibilities of exploring ourselves.</p><p>But we have never exposed ourselves in this way before, and it makes us vulnerable if anyone chooses to use it against us. Any information or communication could put young people under the surveillance of the state. Very often, when oppressive states arrest people, they have that information in their hands. It can be used as a way of controlling you, to tell you: we know exactly what you're thinking or doing. It can drive people to madness.</p><p>When human beings are scared and feel everything is exposed to the government, we will censor ourselves from free thinking. That's dangerous for human development.</p><p>In the Soviet Union before, in China today, and even in the US, officials always think what they do is necessary, and firmly believe they do what is best for the state and the people. But the lesson that people should learn from history is the need to limit state power.</p><p>If a government is elected by the people, and is genuinely working for the people, they should not give in to these temptations.</p><p>During <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14487328\" title=\"\">my detention</a> in China I was watched 24 hours a day. The light was always on. There were two guards on two-hour shifts standing next to me – even watching when I swallowed a pill; I had to open mouth so they could see my throat. You have to take a shower in front of them; they watch you while you brush your teeth, in the name of making sure you're not hurting yourself. They had three surveillance cameras to make sure the guards would not communicate with me.</p><p>But the guards whispered to me. They told stories about themselves. There is always humanity and privacy, even under the most restrictive conditions.</p><p>To limit power is to protect society. It is not only about protecting individuals' rights but making power healthier.</p><p>Civilisation is built on that trust and everyone must fight to defend it, and to protect our vulnerable aspects – our inner feelings, our families. We must not hand over our rights to other people. No state power should be given that kind of trust. Not China. Not the US.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410521321|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|b56053554ce2dc30fec7c1af66a0c66e4d228e3c -->",

But its all-encompassing character has stood the test of time. Section 793 of the law makes it an offence to take, retain or transfer knowledge \"with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\".</p><p>The law does not stipulate whether the information involved would have to be classified, as that word was not in usage at the time the act was passed. More importantly from Snowden's point of view, it says nothing about exemptions for leaks claiming to be in the public interest.</p><p>\"As much as some may want Snowden to be applauded for his actions, as a legal matter his self-stated laudable intentions are irrelevant to his criminal liability. He can only hope that it will play a role in his sentencing,\" argued Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who regularly represents national security whistleblowers.</p><p>\"Having publicly self-admitted his guilt for having illegally leaked classified information, he has eliminated any likely meaningful legal defence. Snowden unfortunately went about his efforts all wrong and missed available opportunities to generate public debate of the NSA programs but still avoid criminal culpability.\"</p><p>Jesselyn Radack, a former justice department whistleblower who is now national security and human rights director at the Government Accountability Project, pointed out that Snowden would also get no benefit from the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act, as it excludes those working for the armed services or intelligence community.</p><p>However, Radack said that the legal and constitutional implications of the Espionage Act had not been properly tested in its application to whistleblowers. \"Snowden could challenge whether the material involved was properly classified, arguing that the Espionage Act is not supposed to be a cover for illegal conduct,\" she said.</p><p>In the most famous attempt to use the act to prosecute a whistleblower, against Daniel Ellsberg, military analyst at the Rand Corporation who leaked documents on the conduct of the Vietnam war, the case was thrown out in 1973 after it emerged that Ellsberg had been illegally wiretapped.</p><p>Shamai Leibowitz, a FBI linguist who pleaded guilty to leaking details of wiretaps of the Israeli embassy in Washington to a blogger, was sentenced in May 2010 to 20 months in prison.<br />In the most similar case to Snowden's, a NSA employee called Thomas Drake was charged in 2010 with 'mishandling documents' for disclosing details of the agency's Trailblazer program – a means of mass collection of data, like the Prism program leaked by Snowden. However, he was able to demonstrate he had not given away classified material, and all ten charges against him were dropped.</p><p>Some Espionage Act prosecutions from press leaks are still under way. Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA employee, is being tried for passing to the New York Times details of a plan to pass flawed nuclear weapon blueprints to the Iranians. He has pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, the court martial of Bradley Manning, the army private charged with the mass release of defence and state department cables to Wikileaks, is under way in Fort Meade, outside Washington.</p><p>Manning's treatment while in solitary confinement, which was described by the UN special rapporteur on torture as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\", may now bolster Snowden's precarious chances of avoiding a US trial altogether by fighting extradition.</p><p>\"In terms of seeking asylum, Snowden would definitely qualify in terms of fear of persecution,\" Radack said. \"Bradley Manning would be exhibit A in that argument.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410562757|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|7897110a2a6b847100bc413e04e691f36af5d924 -->",

Both worked on intelligence contracts, which are estimated to make up almost a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/us/booz-allen-grew-rich-on-government-contracts.html\">quarter of the company's $5.86bn in annual income</a>. This past weekend, Clapper condemned Snowden's leak about US government surveillance, telling <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/speeches-and-interviews/195-speeches-interviews-2013/874-director-james-r-clapper-interview-with-andrea-mitchell\">NBC News's Andrea Mitchell</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"For me, it is literally – not figuratively – literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge, grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities. This is someone who, for whatever reason, has chosen to violate a sacred trust for this country. I think we all feel profoundly offended by that.\"</p></blockquote><p>The following day Snowden replied from a hotel in Hong Kong, in an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\">interview with Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to. There is no public oversight. I realised that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.\"</p></blockquote><p>Booz Allen reacted with anger in a press statement released hours later:</p><blockquote><p>\"News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm.\"</p></blockquote><p>Core values? Let's examine Booz Allen Hamilton's track record.</p><p>In February 2012, the US air force <a href=\"http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2012/02/booz-allen-suspension-a-successful-failure.html\">suspended Booz Allen from seeking government contracts</a> after it discovered that Joselito Meneses, a former deputy chief of information technology for the air force, <a href=\"http://www.federalnewsradio.com/395/2829030/Air-Force-lifts-suspension-on-Booz-Allens-San-Antonio-office\">had given Booz Allen a hard drive with confidential information about a competitor's contracting</a> on the first day that he went to work for the company in San Antonio, Texas. <a href=\"http://www.safgc.hq.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-120416-004.pdf\">US air force legal counsel concluded (pdf)</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"Booz Allen did not uncover indications and signals of broader systemic ethical issues within the firm. These events caused the air force to have serious concerns regarding the responsibility of Booz Allen, specifically, its San Antonio office, including its business integrity and honesty, compliance with government contracting requirements, and the adequacy of its ethics program.\"</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that Booz Allen reacted swiftly to the government investigation of the conflict of interest. In April that year, the <a href=\"http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2012/04/air-force-lifts-booz-allen-suspension-contractor-admits-to-broader-systemic-ethical-deficiencies-add.html\">air force lifted the suspension</a> – but only after Booz Allen had accepted responsibility for the incident and <a href=\"http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20120209/IT04/202090305/Air-Force-suspends-Booz-Allen-office-from-further-contracts\">fired Meneses</a>, as well as agreeing to pay the air force $65,000 and reinforce the firm's ethics policy.</p><p>Not everybody was convinced about the new regime. \"Unethical behavior brought on by the revolving door created problems for Booz Allen, but now the revolving door may have come to the rescue,\" <a href=\"http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2012/04/air-force-lifts-booz-allen-suspension-contractor-admits-to-broader-systemic-ethical-deficiencies-add.html#comment-6a00d8341c68bf53ef0163044e9f2f970d\">wrote Scott Amey of the Project on Government Oversight</a>, noting that Meneses was not the only former air force officer who had subsequently become an executive in Booz Allen's San Antonio office.</p><blockquote><p>\"It couldn't hurt having [former AF people]. Booz is likely exhaling a sigh of relief as it has received billions of dollars in air force contracts over the years.\"</p></blockquote><p>Booz Allen has also <a href=\"http://www.contractormisconduct.org/index.cfm/1,73,222,html?CaseID=1161\">admitted to overbilling</a> the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) \"employees at higher job categories than would have been justified by their experience, inflating their monthly hours and submitting excessive billing at their off-site rate.\" The <a href=\"http://www.contractormisconduct.org/ass/contractors/15/cases/1161/1625/booz-allen-hamilton-nasa-overbilling_pr.pdf\">company repaid the government $325,000 in May 2009 to settle the charges (pdf)</a>. Incidentally, both the Nasa and the air force incidents were brought to light by a company whistleblower who informed the government.</p><p>Nor was this the first time Booz Allen had been caught overbilling. In 2006, the company was one of four consulting firms that settled with the Justice Department for fiddling expenses on an industrial scale. Booz Allen's share of the $15m settlement of a <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/pr2006/001.html\">lawsuit under the False Claims Act was more than $3.3m</a>.</p><p>The incidents described above could be dismissed as aberrations. What is worthy of note, however, is that Ralph Shrader, the chairman, CEO and president of Booz Allen, came to the company in 1974 after working at two telecommunications companies – Western Union, where he was national director of advanced systems planning, and RCA, where he served in the company's government communications system division.</p><p>Today, those names may not ring a bell, but these two companies took part in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MINARET\">secret surveillance program known as Minaret</a> in the 1970s when they agreed to hand over to the National Security Agency (NSA) all incoming and outgoing US telephone calls and telegrams. In an interview with the Financial Times in 1998, Shrader noted that the most relevant background for his new position of chief executive at Booz Allen was his experience working for telecommunications clients and doing classified military work for the US government.</p><p>Minaret and other such snooping programs led to an explosive series of congressional hearings in 1970s named the Senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities, chaired by Frank Church of Idaho in 1975.</p><p>Should the latest revelations of massive government surveillance come before Congress again, it might be worth probing Shrader and his company – rather than shooting the messenger, Edward Snowden.</p><p>Finally, Congress would also do well to investigate Clapper, Booz Allen's other famous former employee, for possible perjury <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/james-clappers-least-untruthful-statement-to-the-senate/2013/06/11/e50677a8-d2d8-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_blog.html\">when he replied: \"No, sir\"</a> to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon in March, when asked:</p><blockquote><p>\"Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\"</p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410655173|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|ab5cded1ce994e5087392eeace17674fb5bca472 -->",

It was that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">disclosures he was making</a>, momentous though they were, would fail to trigger a worldwide debate because the public had already been taught to accept that they have no right to privacy in the digital age.</p><p>Snowden, at least in that regard, can rest easy. The fallout from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\" title=\"\">Guardian's first week of revelations</a> is intense and growing.</p><p>If \"whistleblowing\" is defined as exposing secret government actions so as to inform the public about what they should know, to prompt debate, and to enable reform, then Snowden's actions are the classic case.</p><p>US polling data, by itself, demonstrates how powerfully these revelations have resonated. Despite a <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2013/06/11/the-demonization-machine-cranks-up-again\" title=\"\">sustained demonization campaign</a> against him from official Washington, a <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/13/new-time-poll-support-for-the-leaker-and-his-prosecution/\" title=\"\">Time magazine poll</a> found that 54% of Americans believe Snowden did \"a good thing\", while only 30% disagreed. That approval rating is higher than the one enjoyed by both Congress and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/obama-job-approval-poll-92023.html\" title=\"\">President Obama</a>.</p><p>While a majority nonetheless still believes he should be prosecuted, a plurality of Americans aged 18 to 34, who Time says are \"showing far more support for Snowden's actions\", do not. Other polls on Snowden have similar results, including a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/12/us-usa-security-poll-idUSBRE95B1AF20130612\" title=\"\">Reuters finding</a> that more Americans see him as a \"patriot\" than a \"traitor\".</p><p>On the more important issue – the public's views of the NSA surveillance programs – the findings are even more encouraging from the perspective of reform. A Gallup poll last week found that more Americans disapprove (53%) than approve (37%) of the two NSA spying programs revealed last week by the Guardian.</p><p>As always with polling data, the results are far from conclusive or uniform. But they all unmistakably reveal that there is broad public discomfort with excessive government snooping and that the Snowden-enabled revelations were met with anything but the apathy he feared.</p><p>But, most importantly of all, the stories thus far published by the Guardian are already leading to concrete improvements in accountability and transparency. The ACLU <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/us/aclu-files-suit-over-phone-surveillance-program.html?_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">quickly filed a lawsuit</a> in federal court challenging the legality, including the constitutionality, of the NSA's collection of the phone records of all Americans. The US government must therefore now defend the legality of its previously secret surveillance program in open court.</p><p>These revelations have also had serious repercussions in Congress. The NSA and other national security state officials have been forced to appear several times already for harsh and hostile questioning before various committees.</p><p>To placate growing anger over having been kept in the dark and misled, the spying agency gave a private briefing to rank-and-file members of Congress about programs of which they had previously been unaware. Afterward, Democratic Rep Loretta Sanchez <a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/house/305047-dem-rep-lawmakers-learned-significantly-more-about-surveillance-programs-in-nsa-briefing\" title=\"\">warned that the NSA programs </a>revealed by the Guardian are just \"the tip of the iceberg\". She added: \"I think it's just broader than most people even realize, and I think that's, in one way, what astounded most of us, too.\"</p><p>It is hardly surprising, then, that at least some lawmakers are appreciative rather than scornful of these disclosures. Democratic Sen <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/democratic-sen-tester-snowden-didnt-compromise-national-security\" title=\"\">Jon Tester was quite dismissive</a> of the fear-mongering from national security state officials, telling MSNBC that \"I don't see how [what Snowden did] compromises the security of this country whatsoever\". He added that, despite being a member of the Homeland Security Committee, \"quite frankly, it helps people like me become aware of a situation that I wasn't aware of before\".</p><p>These stories have also already led to proposed legislative reforms. A group of bipartisan senators introduced <a href=\"http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-end-secret-law\" title=\"\">a bill which, in their words</a>, \"would put an end to the 'secret law' governing controversial government surveillance programs\" and \"would require the Attorney General to declassify significant Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) opinions, allowing Americans to know how broad of a legal authority the government is claiming to spy on Americans under the Patriot Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\".</p><p>The disclosures also portend serious difficulties for the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and NSA chief, Keith Alexander. As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/us-tech-nsa-data-clapper\" title=\"\">documented last week</a>, those officials have made claims to Congress – including that they do not collect data on millions of Americans and that they are unable to document the number of Americans who are spied upon – that are flatly contradicted by their own secret documents.</p><p>This led to one senator, Ron Wyden, issuing <a href=\"http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-statement-responding-to-director-clappers-statements-about-collection-on-americans\" title=\"\">a harshly critical statement</a> explaining that the Senate's oversight function \"cannot be done responsibly if senators aren't getting straight answers to direct questions\", and calling for \"public hearings\" to \"address the recent disclosures and the American people have the right to expect straight answers from the intelligence leadership to the questions asked by their representatives\".</p><p>One well-respected-in-Washington national security writer, Slate's centrist Fred Kaplan, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2013/06/fire_dni_james_clapper_he_lied_to_congress_about_nsa_surveillance.single.html\" title=\"\">has called for Clapper</a>'s firing. \"It's hard,\" he wrote, \"to have meaningful oversight when an official in charge of the program lies so blatantly in one of the rare open hearings on the subject.\"</p><p></p><p>The fallout is not confined to the US. It is global. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/11/cnews-us-usa-security-germany-idCABRE95A0T820130611\" title=\"\">Reuters this week reported</a> that \"German outrage over a US Internet spying program has broken out ahead of a visit by Barack Obama, with ministers demanding the president provide a full explanation when he lands in Berlin next week and one official likening the tactics to those of the East German Stasi.\"</p><p>Indeed, Viviane Reding, the EU's justice commissioner, has, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/world/europe/eu-official-pushes-us-to-explain-its-surveillance.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">in the words of the New York Times</a>, \"demanded in unusually sharp terms that the United States reveal what its intelligence is doing with personal information of Europeans gathered under the Prism surveillance program revealed last week\". She is particularly insistent that EU citizens be given some way to find out whether their communications were intercepted by the NSA.</p><p>In the wake of the Guardian's articles, I heard from journalists and even government officials from around the world interested in learning the extent of the NSA's secret spying on the communications of their citizens. These stories have resonated globally, and will continue to do so, because the NSA's spying apparatus is designed to target the shared instruments used by human beings around the world to communicate with one another.</p><p>The purpose of whistleblowing is to expose secret and wrongful acts by those in power in order to enable reform. A key purpose of journalism is to provide an adversarial check on those who wield the greatest power by shining a light on what they do in the dark, and informing the public about those acts. Both purposes have been significantly advanced by the revelations thus far.<em> </em></p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald\" title=\"\"><em>@ggreenwald</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410800202|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|5f587ab6bb2cd38fd6af7bd47c330064e69a3211 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>(updated below - Update II - Update III)</strong></p><p>I haven't been able to write this week here because I've been participating in the debate over the fallout from last week's NSA stories, and because we are very busy working on and writing the next series of stories that will begin appearing very shortly. I did, though, want to note a few points, and particularly highlight what <a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/house/305047-dem-rep-lawmakers-learned-significantly-more-about-surveillance-programs-in-nsa-briefing\">Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez said</a> after Congress on Wednesday was given a classified briefing by NSA officials on the agency's previously secret surveillance activities:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />\"What we learned in <em>there is significantly more than what is out in the media today</em>. . . . I can't speak to what we learned in there, and I don't know if there are other leaks, if there's more information somewhere, if somebody else is going to step up, but I will tell you that I believe <em>it's the tip of the iceberg</em> . . . . I think it's just broader than most people even realize, and I think that's, in one way, <em>what astounded most of us, too</em>.\"</p></blockquote><p>The Congresswoman is absolutely right: what we have reported thus far is merely \"the tip of the iceberg\" of what the NSA is doing in spying on Americans and the world. She's also right that when it comes to NSA spying, \"there is significantly more than what is out in the media today\", and that's exactly what we're working to rectify.</p><p>But just consider what she's saying: as a member of Congress, she had no idea how invasive and vast the NSA's surveillance activities are. Sen. Jon Tester, who is a member of the Homeland Security Committee, said the same thing, <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/democratic-sen-tester-snowden-didnt-compromise-national-security\">telling MSNBC about the disclosures that</a> \"I don't see how that compromises the security of this country whatsoever\" and adding: \"quite frankly, it helps people like me become aware of a situation that I wasn't aware of before because I don't sit on that Intelligence Committee.\" </p><p>How can anyone think that it's remotely healthy in a democracy to have the NSA building a massive spying apparatus about which even members of Congress, including Senators on the Homeland Security Committee, are totally ignorant and find \"astounding\" when they learn of them? How can anyone claim with a straight face that there is robust oversight when even members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are so constrained in their ability to act that they are reduced to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/us/politics/democratic-senators-warn-about-use-of-patriot-act.html\">issuing vague, impotent warnings to the public</a> about what they call radical \"secret law\" enabling domestic spying that would \"stun\" Americans to learn about it, but are barred to disclose what it is they're so alarmed by? Put another way, how can anyone contest the value and justifiability of the stories that we were able to publish as a result of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing: stories that informed the American public - including even the US Congress - about these incredibly consequential programs? What kind of person would think that it would be preferable to remain in the dark - totally ignorant - about them?</p><p>I have a column in the Guardian's newspaper edition tomorrow examining the fallout from these stories. That will be posted here and I won't repeat that now. I will, though, note the following brief items:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> Much of US politics, and most of the pundit reaction to the NSA stories, are summarized by <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/2013/06/6-10-13-4.png\">this one single visual from Pew</a>:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410831270'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/14/1371210729309/pew.png' alt='pew' width='460' height='272' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The most vocal media critics of our NSA reporting, and the most vehement defenders of NSA surveillance, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/glenn-greenwald-nsa-scandal-media-spying-surveillance-leak-2013-6\">have been, by far, Democratic (especially Obama-loyal) pundits</a>. As I've written many times, one of the most significant aspects of the Obama legacy has been the transformation of Democrats from pretend-opponents of the Bush War on Terror and National Security State into their biggest proponents: exactly what <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/03/27/wikileaks/\">the CIA presciently and excitedly predicted</a> in 2008 would happen with Obama's election.</p><p>Some Democrats have tried to distinguish 2006 from 2013 by claiming that the former involved illegal spying while the latter does not. But the claim that current NSA spying is legal is dubious in the extreme: the Obama DOJ has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/clapper-v-amnesty-international_n_2769294.html\">repeatedly thwarted</a> efforts by the ACLU, EFF and others to obtain judicial rulings on their legality and constitutionality by <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/obama-doj-worse-than-bush\">invoking procedural claims of secrecy, immunity and standing</a>. If Democrats are so sure these spying programs are legal, why has the Obama DOJ been so eager to block courts from adjudicating that question? </p><p>More to the point, Democratic critiques of Bush's spying were about more than just legality. I know that because I actively participated in the campaign to amplify those critiques. Indeed, by 2006, most of Bush's spying programs - definitely his bulk collection of phone records - were already being conducted under the supervision and with the blessing of the FISA court. Moreover, leading members of Congress - including Nancy Pelosi - were repeatedly briefed on all aspects of Bush's NSA spying program. So the distinctions Democrats are seeking to draw are mostly illusory. </p><p>To see how that this is so, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=1613914n\">just listen to then-Senator Joe Biden</a> in 2006 attack the NSA for collecting phone records: he does criticize the program for lacking FISA court supervision (which wasn't actually true), but also claims to be alarmed by just how invasive and privacy-destroying that sort of bulk record collection is. He says he \"doesn't think\" that the program passes the Fourth Amendment test: how can Bush's bulk record collection program be unconstitutional while Obama's program is constitutional? But Biden also rejected Bush's defense (exactly the argument Obama is making now) - that \"we're not listening to the phone calls, we're just looking for patterns\" - by saying this:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I don't have to listen to your phone calls to know what you're doing. If I know every single phone call you made, I'm able to determine every single person you talked to. I can get a pattern about your life that is very, very intrusive. . . . If it's true that 200 million Americans' phone calls were monitored - in terms of not listening to what they said, but to whom they spoke and who spoke to them - I don't know, the Congress should investigative this.\"</p></blockquote><p>Is collecting everyone's phone records not \"very intrusive\" when Democrats are doing it? Just listen to that short segment to see how every defense Obama defenders are making now were the ones Bush defenders made back then. Again, leading members of Congress and the FISA court were both briefed on and participants in the Bush telephone record collection program as well, yet Joe Biden and most Democrats found those programs very alarming and \"very intrusive\" back then.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Notwithstanding the partisan-driven Democratic support for these programs, and notwithstanding the <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2013/06/11/the-demonization-machine-cranks-up-again\">sustained demonization campaign</a> aimed at Edward Snowden from official Washington, polling data, though mixed, has thus far been surprisingly encouraging. </p><p>A Time Magazine poll <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/13/new-time-poll-support-for-the-leaker-and-his-prosecution/\">found</a> that 54% of Americans believe Snowden did \"a good thing\", while only 30% disagreed.  That approval rating is higher than the one enjoyed by both Congress and President Obama. While a majority think he should be nonetheless prosecuted, a plurality of young Americans, who overwhelmingly view Snowden favorably, do not even want to see him charged. Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/12/us-usa-security-poll-idUSBRE95B1AF20130612\">found</a> that more Americans see Snowden as a \"patriot\" than a \"traitor\". A Gallup poll this week <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/163043/americans-disapprove-government-surveillance-programs.aspx\">found</a> that more Americans disapprove (53%) than approve (37%) of the two NSA spying programs revealed last week by the Guardian. </p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Thomas Drake, an NSA whistleblower who was unsuccessfully prosecuted by the Obama DOJ, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/snowden-surveillance-subverting-constitution\">writes in the Guardian</a> that as a long-time NSA official, he saw all of the same things at the NSA that Edward Snowden is now warning Americans about. Drake calls Snowden's acts \"an amazingly brave and courageous act of civil disobedience.\" William Binney, the mathematician who resigned after a 30-year career as a senior NSA official in protest of post-9/11 domestic surveillance, <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/6/10/inside_the_nsas_domestic_surveillance_apparatus_whistleblower_william_binney_speaks_out\">said on Democracy Now this week</a> that Snowden's claims about the NSA are absolutely true. </p><p>Meanwhile, Daniel Ellsberg, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america\">writing in the Guardian</a>, wrote that \"there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden's release of NSA material – and that definitely includes the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago.\" He added: \"Snowden did what he did because he recognized the NSA's surveillance programs for what they are: dangerous, unconstitutional activity.\"</p><p>Listen to actual experts and patriots - people who have spent their careers inside the NSA and/or who risked their liberty for the good of the country - and the truth of Snowden's claims and the justifiability of his acts become manifest.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> As we were about to begin publishing these NSA stories, a veteran journalist friend warned me that the tactic used by Democratic partisans would be to cling to and then endlessly harp on any alleged inaccuracy in any one of the stories we publish as a means of distracting attention away from the revelations and discrediting the entire project. That proved quite prescient, as that is exactly what they are attempting to do.</p><p>Thus far we have revealed four independent programs: the bulk collection of telephone records, the Prism program, Obama's implementation of an aggressive foreign and domestic cyber-operations policy, and false claims by NSA officials to Congress. Every one of those articles was vetted by multiple Guardian editors and journalists - not just me. Democratic partisans have raised questions about only one of the stories - the only one that happened to be also published by the Washington Post (and presumably vetted by multiple Post editors and journalists) - in order to claim that an alleged inaccuracy in it means our journalism in general is discredited.</p><p>They are wrong. Our story was not inaccurate. The Washington Post revised parts of its article, but its reporter, Bart Gellman, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-company-officials-internet-surveillance-does-not-indiscriminately-mine-data/2013/06/08/5b3bb234-d07d-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story_1.html\">stands by its core claims</a> (\"From their workstations anywhere in the world, government employees cleared for Prism access may 'task' the system and receive results from an Internet company without further interaction with the company's staff\"). </p><p>The Guardian has not revised any of our articles and, to my knowledge, has no intention to do so. That's because we did not claim that the NSA document alleging direct collection from the servers was true; we reported - accurately - that the NSA document claims that the program allows direct collection from the companies' servers. Before publishing, we went to the internet companies named in the documents and asked about these claims. When they denied it, we purposely presented the story as one of a major discrepancy between what the NSA document claims and what the internet companies claim, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">the headline itself makes indisputably clear</a>:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410831271'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/14/1371215868669/prism.png' alt='prism' width='460' height='154' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The NSA document says exactly what we reported. Just read it and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-surveillance-prism-obama-live?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20full-width-1%20bento-box:Bento%20box:Position2#block-51b36893e4b0cc6424372292\">judge for yourself</a> (Prism is \"collection directly from the servers of these US service providers\"). It's endearingly naive how some people seem to think that because government officials or corporate executives issue carefully crafted denials, this resolves the matter. Read <a href=\"http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/07/the_prism_spin_war_has_begun\">the ACLU's tech expert</a>, Chris Soghoian, explain why the tech companies' denials are far less significant and far more semantic than many are claiming. </p><p>Nor do these denials make any sense. If all the tech companies are doing under Prism is providing what they've always provided to the NSA, but simply doing it by a different technological means, then why would a new program be necessary at all? How can NSA officials claim that a program that does nothing more than change the means for how this data is delivered is vital in stopping terrorist threats? Why does the NSA document hail the program as one that enables new forms of collection? Why would it be \"top secret\" if all this was were just some new way of transmitting court-ordered data? How is Prism any different in any meaningful way from how the relationship between the companies and the NSA has always functioned?</p><p>As a follow-up to our article, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html?pagewanted=all\">reported on extensive secret negotiations</a> between Silicon Valley executives and NSA officials over government access to the companies' data. It's precisely because these arrangements are secret and murky yet incredibly significant that we published our story about these conflicting claims. They ought to be resolved in public, not in secret. The public should know exactly what access the NSA is trying to obtain to the data of these companies, and should know exactly what access these companies are providing. Self-serving, unchecked, lawyer-vetted denials by these companies don't remotely resolve these questions.</p><p>In a Nation post yesterday, Rick Perlstein <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/174783/glenn-greenwalds-epic-botch\">falsely accuses me</a> of not having addressed the questions about the Prism story. I've done at least half-a-dozen television shows in the last week where I was asked about exactly those questions and answered fully with exactly what I've written here (see <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/all-in-/52186575\">this appearance with Chris Hayes</a> as just the latest example); the fact that Perlstein couldn't be bothered to use Google doesn't entitle him to falsely claim I haven't addressed these questions. I have done so repeatedly, and do so here again.</p><p>I know that many Democrats want to cling to the belief that, in Perlstein's words, \"the powers that be will find it very easy to seize on this one error to discredit [my] NSA revelation, even the ones he nailed dead to rights\". Perlstein cleverly writes that \"such distraction campaigns are how power does its dirtiest work\" as he promotes exactly that campaign. </p><p>But that won't happen. The documents and revelations are too powerful. The story isn't me, or Edward Snowden, or the eagerness of Democratic partisans to defend the NSA as a means of defending President Obama, and try as they might, Democrats won't succeed in making the story be any of those things. The story is the worldwide surveillance apparatus the NSA is constructing in the dark and the way that <a href=\"http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/11/18887491-fbi-sharply-increases-use-of-patriot-act-provision-to-collect-us-citizens-records\">has grown under Obama</a>, and that's where my focus is going to remain. </p><p><strong>(5)</strong> NYU Journalism professor Jay Rosen <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2013/06/politics-some-politics-none-two-ways-to-excel-in-political-journalism-neither-dominates/\">examines complaints</a> that my having strong, candidly acknowledged opinions on surveillance policies somehow means that the journalism I do on those issues is suspect. It is very worth reading what he has to say on this topic as it gets to the heart about several core myths about what journalism is.</p><p><strong>(6)</strong> Last week, prior to the revelation of our source's identity, I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/07/whistleblowers-and-leak-investigations\">wrote that</a> \"ever since the Nixon administration broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychoanalyst's office, the tactic of the US government has been to attack and demonize whistleblowers as a means of distracting attention from their own exposed wrongdoing and destroying the credibility of the messenger so that everyone tunes out the message\" and \"that attempt will undoubtedly be made here.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2013/06/11/the-demonization-machine-cranks-up-again\">predictable personality assaults on Snowden</a> have begun in full force from official Washington and their media spokespeople. They are only going to intensify. There is nobody who political officials and their supine media class hate more than those who meaningfully dissent from their institutional orthodoxies and shine light on what they do. The hatred for such individuals is boundless.</p><p>There are two great columns on this dynamic. <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2013/06/11/edward-snowden-and-the-selective-targeting-of-leaks/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2Fblogs%2FJackShafer+(Jack+Shafer\">This one</a> by Reuters' Jack Shafer explores how elite Washington reveres powerful leakers that glorify political officials, but only hate marginalized and powerless leakers who discredit Washington and its institutions. And perhaps <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/14/the-sickening-snowden-backlash.html\">the best column yet on Snowden</a> comes this morning from the Daily Beast's Kirsten Powers: just please take the time to read it all, as it really conveys the political and psychological rot that is driving the attacks on him and on his very carefully vetted disclosures.</p><h2>UPDATE</h2><p>The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/technology/secret-court-ruling-put-tech-companies-in-data-bind.html?hp\">reports today</a> that Yahoo went to court in order to vehemently resist the NSA's directive that they join the Prism program, and joined only when the court compelled it to do so. The company specifically \"argued that the order violated its users' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"</p><p>If, as NSA (and Silicon Valley) defenders claim, Prism is nothing more than a harmless little drop-box mechanism for delivering to the government what these companies were already providing, why would Yahoo possibly be in court so vigorously resisting it and arguing that it violates their users' Fourth Amendment rights? Similarly, how could it possibly be said - as US government officials have - that Prism has been instrumental in stopping terrorist plots if it did not enhance the NSA's collection capabilities? The denials from the internet companies make little sense when compared to what we know about the program. At the very least, there is ample reason to demand more disclosure and transparency about exactly what this is and what data-access arrangements they have agreed to.</p><h2>UPDATE II</h2><p>My column that is appearing in the Guardian newspaper, on the fallout from the NSA stories, is now posted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/14/edward-snowden-worst-fear-not-realised\">here</a>.</p><h2>UPDATE III</h2><p>Underscoring all of these points, please take two minutes to watch this amazing video, courtesy of EFF, in which the 2006 version of Joe Biden aggressively debates the 2013 version of Barack Obama on whether the US government should be engaged in the bulk collection of American's phone records:</p><p>That's the kind of debate we need more of.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410780268|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|ae21b0c61875f00512bd91ba78d25cdc1992ceec -->",

        "body":"<p>Google and Facebook have called for the US authorities to allow them to fully disclose the number of secret requests they receive to hand over users' data.</p><p>The Silicon Valley companies, with rivals including Apple, have been left reeling after the disclosure by the Guardian and Washington Post of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">undercover National Security Agency (NSA) operation Prism</a>, which claimed \"direct\" access to the tech giants' servers.</p><p>In a letter from Google to the US attorney general, Eric Holder, <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/asking-us-government-to-allow-google-to.html\">also published on its corporate blog</a>, the company once again said allegations that the US government had \"unfettered access to our users' data are simply untrue\". But, the letter added, the fact that Google was not allowed to disclose requests made for information under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) \"fuel[s] that speculation\".</p><p>Fisa requests come with gag orders, meaning Google, Facebook and other tech companies cannot say whether they have received them.</p><p>David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in the letter to Holder: \"We therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our transparency report aggregate numbers of national security requests, including Fisa disclosures – in terms of both the number we receive and their scope.</p><p>\"Google's numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made. Google has nothing to hide.\"</p><p>A statement from Facebook's general counsel, Ted Ullyot, followed. He said the company \"would welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests we receive, and how we respond.</p><p>\"We urge the United States government to help make that possible by allowing companies to include information about the size and scope of national security requests we receive, and look forward to publishing a report that includes that information\".</p><p>The letter and statement come days after Google and Facebook <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/google-facebook-prism-surveillance-program\">categorically denied knowingly participating in Prism</a>. Internal NSA documents state that Prism involves \"collection directly from the servers of these US service providers: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple\".</p><p>Drummond and Google co-founder Larry Page said the company provided data to the government \"only in accordance with the law\". They also said that no \"back door\" to Google's information had been set up and that they had never heard of Prism until approached by the Guardian last week.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, described the press reports about Prism as \"outrageous\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410562867|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|810f0ba4251431b80fe2b05495c6df713e5580e3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The girlfriend of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who leaked classified documents about US surveillance operations, has apparently blogged about the couple's life in Hawaii and her uncertainty about the future without her \"man of mystery\".</p><p>Just a day after Snowden identified himself as the source of the leaks, Lindsay Mills, a 28-year-old performance artist, wrote: \"I don't know what will happen from here. I don't know how to feel normal.\"</p><p>She added: \"My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass … at the moment all I can feel is alone.\"</p><p>The authenticity of the blog, which was seen by the Guardian before it was taken down on Tuesday, could not be verified. Snowden had previously told the Guardian his girlfriend was called Lindsay.</p><p>Snowden left Hawaii for Hong Kong three weeks ago, telling his girlfriend he had to be away for a while, but being deliberately vague about the reason for his disappearance.</p><p>In her blogpost on Monday, written hours after Snowden made the explosive revelation that he was the source of the leaks, she wrote: \"Sometimes life doesn't afford proper goodbyes.\"</p><p>Her blog, subtitled \"Adventures of a world-traveling, pole-dancing superhero\", offers intriguing insights into couple's life in Hawaii.</p><p>Snowden, 29, worked as a contractor in Hawaii for the National Security Agency on a $122,000 salary. After telling the world he was the source of a succession of leaks in the Guardian, Snowden checked out of his Hong Kong hotel on Monday. He has not been seen since.</p><p>Mills's blog and social media accounts reveal the couple visited Hong Kong once before, on a vacation, and also lived in Japan. Mills used the blog as a personal diary and promotional tool for her work as a member of the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe, a collection of around 30 dancers.</p><p>It was a life that, in his own words, Snowden decided to \"sacrifice\" in order to reveal the extent and reach of US surveillance techniques.</p><p>The blog contains YouTube videos of Mills's performances, as well as dozens of still images of her, some with Snowden. The pair appear to have been together since at least 2009, living part of the time near Baltimore. Last year they moved to Hawaii.</p><p>The blog suggests the couple had a vibrant social life: camping, snorkelling, hanging out with friends – but it was apparently not without some strains.</p><p>On 30 July last year, Mills wrote: \"For those that have forgotten, I moved to Hawaii to continue my relationship with E. It has been quite an up-and-down emotional rollercoaster since the moment I stepped off the plane.\"</p><p>The couple seem to have been in a serious and stable relationship. \"I looked over at E and smiled,\" Mills wrote after a day tending to their yard. \"This was the most adult, boring moment I've had ever. I felt grown-up, suburban, and oddly content.\"</p><p>But they seem to have had a lot of fun, too.</p><p>\"Friday night I was able to finally introduce E to my skeptical friends (they weren't quite sure E existed),\" Mills wrote a few months later.</p><p>\"We lovingly crammed a large group into a small corner of a delicious Japanese restaurant and filled our bellies with sushi, tempura, and good conversation.\"</p><p>The following day, they were out again: \"Woke up Saturday to find an invitation for more sushi and a night of karaoke with E's co-workers. Not wanting to waste the social momentum I gently nudged my dear into more social goodness.\"</p><p>Mills describes games of chess with Snowden, and discussions about brain functions, philosophy, current affairs. \"Whenever E and I take time to attack our unruly yard, we end up having deep conversations,\" she remarked in one post.</p><p>There are some hints in the blog that Mills shared Snowden's passion for civil liberties issues. In one of the most intriguing updates, in October last year, Mills posted a picture of woman – presumably her – wearing the V for Vendetta mask, symbolic of the Anonymous movement. It contains the caption: \"All they want is our souls.\"</p><p>A few months later, complaining that one of her YouTube videos had been \"slapped with copyright infringement\", she wrote: \"When it comes to regulations I think we have an abundance and I'd love to see laws scaled to essentials.\"</p><p>It was just three days later, on 15 March this year, that Mills announced to her friends that she and Snowden were moving home.</p><p>\"We received word that we have to move out of our house by May 1,\" she said. \"E is transferring jobs. And I am looking to take a mini trip back east.\"</p><p>Booz Allen Hamilton, the NSA contractor who Snowden worked for, has already confirmed he began working for the company in March. The company released a statement this morning confirming that Snowden had been fired.</p><p>\"Booz Allen can confirm that Edward Snowden, 29, was an employee of our firm for less than three months assigned to a team in Hawaii,\" the statement read. \"Snowden, who had a salary rate of $122,000, was terminated June 10, 2013 for violations of the firm's code of ethics and firm policy.\"</p><p>Previously Snowden had worked for another contractor, Dell, and before that for the CIA.</p><p>With Snowden changing jobs, Mills seemed unsure about what she should do next. \"Do I move with E, on my own, to Antarctica? How long do I spend back home and when should I go?\"</p><p>For Mills, the last couple of months appear to have been a mixture of routine life and a growing sense of unease. In April, she said that Snowden was spending \"two weeks on the mainland\", apparently for work. Mills, too, returned home to Maryland for a brief spell.</p><p>Last month, she made a reference to needing to tidy the house, in preparation for a visit from Snowden's family.</p><p>On 17 May, Mills went on a quick trip to a neighbouring island, remarking: \"When I return to sunny Oahu I'll have my hands full of in-laws.\"</p><p>It is not clear whether or not Snowden's family visited. But three days after Mills posted that message, her boyfriend departed to Hawaii for Hong Kong, in full knowledge of what he was about to do.</p><p>It seems Mills had no idea of the real reason for his trip, but she seemed disturbed – or at least aware that something was up.</p><p>\"Sick, exhausted, and carrying the weight of the world,\" she posted on 7 June, shortly after Snowden's leaks about the NSA's telecom and internet surveillance programs were made public by the Guardian and Washington Post.</p><p>She added: \"Speaking of time, I feel mine is less and less of mine own recently. Therefore, I may be invoking radio silence yet again. I'll keep you posted, or I won't. Superheroes need an air of mystery!\"</p><p>In her last message – posted three days later, on Monday – she said: \"As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I'm reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path. The ones I laughed with. The ones I've held. The one I've grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410538578|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|744e2d16c7f6e4aaf2b4c1b862fe931babfba308 -->",

But his life will now be pored over and debated by a public curious to know the background – and motivations – of one of the explosive whistleblowers in modern US history.</p><p>So far, little has emerged about Snowden that has not already been supplied voluntarily by him. </p><p>When he identified himself as source of leaks to the Guardian on Sunday, Snowden spoke openly about his upbringing, education and work for the CIA and NSA, via <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden\">defence contractors Booz Allen Hamilton</a> and Dell. </p><p>He was also candid about his reasons for coming forward. \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,\" he said. \"I can't in good conscience allow the US government to destroy privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.\"</p><p>The 29-year-old, who will turn 30 next week, said he was \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-why\">willing to sacrifice</a>\" a stable and successful life in order to leak the top-secret documents he feels shed light on the expansion of government surveillance. </p><p>His future <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/10/the-nsa-files-edward-snowden\">is anyone's guess</a>. He reportedly checked out of the Hong Kong hotel he was staying in at 12.30pm on Monday. A media pack has already descended on Hong Kong, desperate to track him down. In the longer term, Snowdon has said he <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/10/hong-kong-edward-snowden-asylum\">plans to seek sanctuary</a>, possibly in Iceland.  New details about his past – the Edward Snowden before he was made famous – are hard to come by.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given he was a passionate believer in privacy with knowledge of internet security, Snowden left little trace online. A full 24 hours after he came out of the shadows, there were only the barest details about his family. There were no interviews with high school associates, no new photographs, and no status updates from his Facebook or Twitter accounts, if indeed Snowden had any.</p><p>Snowden was born on 21 June 1983, raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, and later moved to Ellicott City, Maryland. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, 52, still lives in the modest condominium the family once shared. She is known locally as Wendy and works as a chief deputy clerk in the federal courthouse in nearby Baltimore. CNN showed pictures of her outside her home on Monday, but she did not talk to waiting reporters. </p><p>The whistleblower's father, Lonnie Snowden, 52 – reportedly a former US coast guard officer who has since remarried and now lives in Pennsylvania – told ABC News he was still digesting the news but was concerned for his son. </p><p>The concern cuts both ways; in his interview with the Guardian, Edward Snowden said he was most worried about how his family would be treated. \"The only thing I fear is the harmful effects on my family, who I won't be able to help any more,\" he said. \"That's what keeps me up at night.\"</p><p>Public records offered some clues about Snowden's background. Campaign finance data indicated Snowden made two donations, each worth $250, to the campaign of Ron Paul, the staunch libertarian Republican.</p><p>It chimes with a picture that emerged of a man with strong political views; although Snowden said he believed in Obama's promises in 2008, he said he voted for a third party.</p><p>Other parts of Snowden's account – such as his claim to have tried to join elite special forces – were confirmed by official sources. </p><p>\"His records indicate he enlisted in the army reserve as a special forces recruit (18X) on 7 May 2004 but was discharged 28 September 2004,\" said the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-army-special-forces\">US army's chief civilian spokesman</a>, George Wright. \"He did not complete any training or receive any awards.\"</p><p>Some details emerged on Monday about Snowden's girlfriend, with whom he shared, in his words, a \"a very comfortable life\" in Hawaii, until his disappearance less than three weeks ago. The TV show Inside Edition <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/6471-former-nsa-employee-says-he-blew-the-whistle-on-government-spying\">identified her as member of an acrobatic troupe based in Hawaii</a>.</p><p>For the public, Snowden's relationship with her may turn out to be one of the more intriguing questions about his backstory. It is not known how long they were together or how they met.</p><p>The couple lived in a house blue house with a neat lawn in Eleu Street in Waipahu. Snowden said he was earning around $200,000. \"We occasionally saw him as he was coming or going, or checking mail, or getting the garbage,\" a neighbour, Carolyn Tijing, told local station KITV. Others described Snowden as private. </p><p>They appear to have moved out of the property on 1 May. Century 21 real estate agent Kerri Jo Heim told the Associated Press the owner of the house wanted the couple out so that the home could be sold. </p><p>Snowden's girlfriend may have realised this was anything but an ordinary disappearance around the middle of last week, when she received her first visit from NSA officials, accompanied by police. </p><p>That inquiry may have been a matter of routine; protocol would have required the NSA to investigate any unexpected absence by a contracted employee working on top-secret security matters.  It is not known whether  at that stage  Snowden had been identified as a possible suspect involved in leaking classified information.</p><p>Other members of Snowden's family were also contacted by the NSA last<br />week. Snowden's father told CNN that she had returned to the US<br />mainland to be with her family.</p><p>When he left Hawaii, Snowden told his girlfriend that he had to be away for a few weeks, though he was deliberately vague about the reason. \"That is not an uncommon occurrence for someone who has spent the last decade working in the intelligence world,\" Snowden told the Guardian.</p><p>By then, he must have known that he knew he was never going back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410486892|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|acc974f58ca4fd4702ceed466715655bf13e3087 -->",

But Snowden was not your average tourist or businessman. In all, he was carrying four computers that enabled him to gain access to some of the US government's most highly-classified secrets. </p><p>Today, just over three weeks later, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20aux-1%20mini-bento:Bento%20box%208%20col:Position1:sublinks\">he is the world's most famous spy, whistleblower and fugitive, responsible for the biggest intelligence breach in recent US history</a>. News organisations around the globe have described him as \"America's Most Wanted\". Members of Congress have denounced him as a \"defector\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/10/obama-pressured-explain-nsa-surveillance\">whose actions amount to treason</a> and have demanded he be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  </p><p>His supporters argue that his actions have opened up <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america\">a much-needed debate on the balance between security and privacy in the modern world</a>.<br /> <br />So is he whistleblower or traitor? That debate is still raging.</p><p>Snowden, aged 29, had flown to Hong Kong from Hawaii, where he had been working for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden\">the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton</a> at the National Security Agency, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/national-security-agency-surveillance\">the biggest spy surveillance organisation in the world</a>. Since Monday morning, he has gone underground. Hong Kong-based journalists, joined by the international press, have been hunting for him. At the height of the search, reporters recruited Twitter followers to see if they could successfully identify the lighting and other hotel furnishings shown in the video in which he went public. They did: the $330-a-night Mira Hotel, on Nathan Road, the busy main shopping drag in Kowloon district.</p><p>Knowing it was only a matter of time before he was found, Snowden checked out at lunchtime on Monday. It is thought he is now in a safe house.</p><p>What happens now? The US is on the verge of pressing criminal charges against him and that would lead to extradition proceedings, with a view to bringing him back to the US for trial and eventually jail.</p><p>If America is planning to jail for life <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/03/bradley-manning-trial-opens-wikileaks\">Bradley Manning, who was behind the 2010 WikiLeaks release of tens of thousands of state department memos</a>, what retribution lies in store for Snowden, who is guilty of leaking on a much bigger scale? The documents Manning released were merely \"classified\". Snowden's were not only \"Top Secret\", but circulation was extremely limited.</p><p>For an American, the traditional home for the kind of story Snowden was planning to reveal would have been the New York Times. But during extensive interviews last week with a Guardian team, he recalled how dismayed he had been to discover the Times had a great scoop in election year 2004 – that the Bush administration, post 9/11, allowed the NSA to snoop on US citizens without warrants – but had sat on it for a year before publishing.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410795257'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/10/1370880880772/68c54a09-e7b9-4a02-be4c-ffc75745d342-460x276.jpeg' alt='Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald speaks to reporters at his hotel in Hong Kong.

Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/edward-snowden-nytimes-warrantless-wiretapping-story_n_3418503.html\">Snowden said this was a turning point for him</a>, confirming his belief that traditional media outlets could not be trusted. He looked around for alternative journalists, those who were both anti-establishment and at home with blogging and other social media. The member of this generation that he most trusted was the Guardian commentator Glenn Greenwald. </p><p>In January, Snowden reached out to a documentary filmmaker and journalist, Laura Poitras, and they began to correspond. In mid-February, he sent an email to Greenwald, who lives in Brazil, suggesting he might want to set up a method for receiving and sending encrypted emails. He even made a YouTube video for Greenwald, to take him step-by-step through the process of encryption. Greenwald did not know the identity of the person offering the leaks and was unsure if they were genuine. He took no action. In March, in New York, he received a call from Poitras, who convinced him that he needed to take this more seriously.</p><p>Greenwald and Snowden set up a secure communications system and the first of the documents arrived, dealing with the NSA's secret Prism programme, which gathers up information from the world's leading technology companies.</p><p>Greenwald flew to New York to talk to Guardian editors on 31 May; the next day, he and Poitras flew to Hong Kong. (I met the two for the first time in the New York office, accompanied them to Hong Kong and joined them in interviewing Snowden over the best part of a week, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-why\">writing articles based on the leaked documents and the interviews</a>).</p><p>Neither Greenwald nor Poitras even knew what Snowden looked like. \"He had some elaborate scheme to meet,\" Greenwald said. Snowden told him to go to a specific location on the third floor of the hotel and ask loudly for directions to a restaurant. Greenwald assumed Snowden was lurking in the background, listening in.</p><p>They went to a room that, Greenwald recalled, contained a large fake alligator. Snowden made himself known. He had told Greenwald that \"I would know it was him because he would be carrying a Rubik's Cube\".</p><p>Both Greenwald and Poitras were shocked the first time they saw the 29-year-old. Greenwald said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I had expected a 60-year-old grizzled veteran, someone in the higher echelons of the intelligence service. I thought: 'This is going to be a wasted trip.'</p></blockquote><p>After an hour of listening to Snowden, Greenwald changed his mind. \"I completely believed him,\" he said.</p><p>The interviews were conducted in Snowden's room, which overlooked Kowloon Park. Snowden and the journalists, complete with camera equipment, crammed into the tiny space. He had been there for two weeks, having meals sent up. He did not have much with him: some clothes, a book, four computers, that Rubik's Cube. He was becoming worried about the costs and especially the chance that his credit cards would be blocked.</p><p>Even though he was well-versed in surveillance techniques, he would not have been hard to find – having signed in under his own name, using his own credit cards.</p><p>The interviews, combined with the leaked documents, provided the Guardian with four scoops in quick succession, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order\">the court order</a> showing that the US government had forced the telecoms giant Verizon to hand over the phone records of millions of Americans, to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">the previously undisclosed programme, Prism</a>.</p><p>The Prism story was also published independently by the Washington Post after Poitras, a freelance journalist, had earlier approached the investigative reporter Barton Gellman, who took the story to the paper. Once on the ground in Hong Kong, however, Poitras began working with the Guardian team.</p><p>On Sunday, the story shifted from the leaks to the leaker. Snowden had from the start decided against anonymity and Poitras filmed him being interviewed by Greenwald for a video that would announce his outing.</p><p>Snowden's decision to go public has mystified many. Why come out? He had, he said, seen at first hand the impact on colleagues of leak inquiries involving anonymous sources and he did not want to put his colleagues through another ordeal.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410795258'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/10/1370883367536/Hong-Kong-008.jpg' alt='Hong Kong' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hong Kong> Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So what are the options available to him now? In the interviews, he praised Hong Kong <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-hong-kong-gamble\">as a place with a strong tradition of free speech and a working judicial system</a>, in spite of having been returned to Chinese sovereignty. But these courts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-not-safe-hong-kong\">judging by examples of past extradition cases</a>, tend to lean towards being helpful towards the US.</p><p>Snowden would likely argue he is not guilty of a crime and claim the charges are politically motivated.</p><p>He has been hailed as a hero by some and a criminal by others. He was denigrated in columns in the New York Times and Washington Post. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-nsa-is-doing-what-google-does/2013/06/10/fe969612-d1f7-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html\">The Post columnist Richard Cohen, though he has never met Snowden, wrote</a>: \"He is not paranoiac; he is merely narcissistic.\" In the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/opinion/brooks-the-solitary-leaker.html\">David Brooks offered up psychological analysis</a>, writing:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Though thoughtful, morally engaged and deeply committed to his beliefs, he appears to be a product of one of the more unfortunate trends of the age: the atomization of society, the loosening of social bonds, the apparently growing share of young men in their 20s who are living technological existences in the fuzzy land between their childhood institutions and adult family commitments.</p></blockquote><p>On Sunday night, Snowden gave the last of what had been almost a week's worth of interviews. It was his final night in that hotel room: the final night before his old life gave way to a new and uncertain one. He sat on his bed, arms folded, television news on without the sound, and spoke about the debate he had started, homing in on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/obama-response-nsa-surveillance-democrats\">a comment Obama had made on Friday</a>, in response to the leaks. </p><p>\"You can't have 100% security and then also have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,\" the president said. Society had to make choices, he added.</p><p>Snowden challenged this, saying the problem was that the Obama administration had denied society the chance to have that discussion. He disputed that there had to be a trade-off between security and privacy, describing the very idea of a trade-off as a fundamental assault on the US constitution.</p><p>In what were to be the last words of the interview, he quoted Benjamin Franklin: \"Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.\" </p><p>Snowden recited it slowly. For him, it had a special resonance.</p><p>He has gone underground for now. But this saga is far from over.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410551750|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|fc027e4ea6b346770847d946176aa4d778e18b57 -->",

        "body":"<p>Drive south down Camp Williams Road, a highway outside Salt Lake City, and your eye is drawn to the left. A gun-mounted helicopter and other military hardware marks the entrance of the Utah army national guard base. The ice-capped Rockies soar in the distance.</p><p>To the right there is little to see: featureless scrubland, a metal fence, some warehouses. A small exit – not marked on ordinary maps – takes you up a curving road. A yellow sign says this is military property closed to unauthorised personnel.</p><p>Further up the hill, invisible from the highway, you encounter concrete walls, a security boom and checkpoint with guards, sniffer dogs and cameras. Two plaques with official seals announce the presence of the office of the director of national intelligence and the National Security Agency.</p><p>A spokesperson at NSA headquarters in Maryland did not welcome a Guardian request to visit its western outpost. \"That is a secure facility. If you trespass on federal property security guards will be obliged to do their jobs.\" An interview was out of the question.</p><p>Welcome to the Utah Data Center, a new home for the NSA's exponentially expanding information trove. The $1.7bn facility, two years in the making, will soon host supercomputers to store gargantuan quantities of data from emails, phone calls, Google searches and other sources. Sited on an unused swath of the national guard base, by September it will employ around 200 technicians, span 1m sq ft and use 65 megawatts of power.</p><p>This week Utah roasted in near-record temperatures ideal for fires and thunderstorms, putting the state under a hazardous weather outlook advisory. The NSA could have done with a similar warning for the scorching criticism of its surveillance activities, a sudden reversal of scrutiny for the agency and its Utah complex.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410794746'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/14/1371221603337/NSA-Data-Center-in-Bluffd-010.jpg' alt='NSA Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A military no trespassing sign in front of Utah's NSA Data Center. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Deep in Mormon country between the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains, nestled on the outskirts of Bluffdale (population 7,598), it was designed to be largely anonymous. Instead, after Guardian disclosures of data-mining programs involving millions of Americans, the Utah Data Center provokes an urgent question: what exactly will it do?</p><p>The NSA says it will not illegally eavesdrop on Americans but is otherwise vague. Its scale is not in doubt. Since January 2011 a reported 10,000 labourers have built four 25,000-sq ft halls filled with servers and cables, plus an additional 900,000 sq ft of space for technical support and administration. Generators and huge fuel and water tanks will make the site self-sustaining in an emergency.</p><p>Outside experts disagreed on the centre's potential. Some said it will just store data. Others envisaged a capacity to not just store but analyse and break codes, enabling technicians here to potentially snoop on the entire population for decades to come.</p><p>William Binney, a mathematician who worked at the NSA for almost 40 years and helped automate its worldwide eavesdropping, said Utah's computers could store data at the rate of 20 terabytes – the equivalent of the Library of Congress – per minute. \"Technically it's not that complicated. You just need to work out an indexing scheme to order it.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/homeland-security-a-human-rights/surveillance/nsa-whistleblowers-bill-binney-a-j-kirk-wiebe\">Binney</a>, who left the agency in 2001 and blew the whistle on its domestic spying, said the centre could absorb and store data for \"hundreds of years\" and allow agencies such as the FBI to retroactively use the information.</p><p>He said the centre will likely have spare capacity for \"brute force attacks\" – using speed and data hoards to detect patterns and break encrypted messages in the so-called deep web where governments, corporations and other organisations keep secrets. There would be no distinction between domestic and foreign targets. \"It makes no difference anymore to them.\"</p><p>James Bamford, author of The Shadow Factory: The Ultra-Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America, said the public had yet to grasp the significance of Utah's data-mining. \"It's basically a hard-drive. It's also a cloud, a warehouse. It'll be storing not just text and audio but pictures and video. There's a lackadaisical attitude to this. People pay no attention until it's too late.\" Bamford wrote a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/\">cover story about the centre for Wired last year</a>. </p><p>Brewster Kahle, a co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/26/brewster-kahle-internet-archive\">Internet Archive</a>,  a San Francisco-based non-profit that hoovers up knowledge in a digital equivalent of the library of Alexandria, said technology facilitated near-ubiquitous snooping. \"If one had the opportunity to collect all the voice traffic in the US it would cost less than the Pentagon spends on paperclips. Storage these days is trivial, it's not a problem.\"</p><p>A rack of servers the size of a fridge can store 100 TV channels' annual output, said Kahle. \"What's slow to dawn on people is that this level of surveillance is technologically and economically within our grasp.\"</p><p>Some, however, disputed the image of Utah as an insatiable data Kraken. It will have no \"operational function\" – no eavesdropping or codebreaking – and will struggle to store data exploding from ever-expanding use of the internet, smartphones and tablets, said Matthew Aid, an intelligence historian and author of The Secret Sentry: The Untold History of the National Security Agency.</p><p>\"The intelligence people I've spoken are warning of data crunch – a polite way of saying they're drowning. They say they don't have enough capacity and will be back to Congress looking for more money to expand.\" If so the site can do so. \"It's designed to be modular, you can add clip-ons. There is plenty of land.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410794747'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/14/1371221724560/NSA-Data-Center-in-Bluffd-010.jpg' alt='NSA Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sited on an unused swath of the national guard base, the centre will employ 200 technicians, span 1m sq ft and use 65 megawatts of power. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Utah has a colourful history of data management. Pony Express riders such as Buffalo Bill used to gallop through its deserts with sacks of mail dodging peril. \"Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred,\" said the famous – and possibly apocryphal – jobs advert. Mormons have long stored microfilms and documents in excavated chambers known as the <a href=\"http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/family_history/granite_mountain_eom.htm\">Granite Mountain Vault</a>. </p><p>The NSA chose the state apparently for a more prosaic reason: cheap electricity. It also helped that its conservative politicians, notably Senator Orrin Hatch, who served on the senate intelligence committee, supported post-9/11 security measures.</p><p>Revelations about surveillance programs such as Prism and Boundless Informant caused a small backlash this week. Several dozen people rallied outside the state capitol in Salt Lake City complaining of constitutional violations. \"It's just plain creepy!\" said one placard. Others cited the fourth amendment and George Orwell's novel 1984. Local newspapers' op-ed pages also fulminated.</p><p>Others, however, have seen opportunity in the NSA's arrival. The University of Utah has created a data-management course for students in consultation with the agency, which has promised internships at the data centre.</p><p>Officials in Bluffdale shrugged off privacy concerns. \"They're not a very open entity but if someone reads my emails they'll be pretty bored,\" said Mark Reid, the city manager. A deal to extend utilities to the centre, and to recycle water, helped open up scrubland for commercial development, he added. \"It's win-win.\"</p><p>The NSA rejected a request from county mayors to tour the perimeter last month but Bluffdale's mayor, Derk Timothy, was not offended. \"I've never been inside the fence but it's kind of to be expected with a facility like that.\"<br />Revelations about surveillance did not prove abuse of power, he said. \"I don't think they crossed the line. They've been good partners to us, especially when it comes to water.\" The NSA was now part of the landscape. \"They've been building that facility as if they're going to stay forever.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410788617|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|ebf9a6e5863776dfa79e4674009354e75a80f13f -->",

        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) plans to release details of terrorist attacks thwarted by its controversial bulk surveillance of Americans&rsquo; communications data, a senior US senator said on Thursday.</p> <p>Senator Dianne Feinstein (Democrat, California), the chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, would provide &ldquo;the cases where this [surveillance] has stopped a terrorist attack, both here and in other places&rdquo; as early as Monday.</p> <p>The claim that the surveillance programs helped stop terrorist attacks has come under criticism from two US senators who sit on the intelligence committee.</p> <p>&ldquo;When you're talking about important liberties that the American people feel strongly about, and you want to have an intelligence program, you've got to make a case for why it provides unique value to the [intelligence] community atop what they can already have,\" Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/senators-challenge-nsa-surveillance-terrorism?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20aux-1%20top-stories-1:Bento%20box%208%20col:Position1:sublinks\">told</a> the Guardian in an interview on Thursday.</p> <p>But the FBI director, Robert Mueller, forcefully defended the programs on Thursday to the House judiciary committee by saying the broad surveillance could have foiled the 9/11 attacks and averted &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/fbi-mueller-spy-tactics-9-11-boston?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20aux-1%20top-stories-1:Bento%20box%208%20col:Position1\">another Boston</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p>Feinstein&rsquo;s comments followed an afternoon briefing attended by 47 senators about two NSA programs recently disclosed by the Guardian: one that collects the phone records of millions of Americans; and another, known as Prism, that targets the online communications of individuals believed to be outside the US. For many senators, it was their first exposure to the details of how the programs operate.</p> <p>Yet the programs may soon change. Feinstein said she had &ldquo;tasked director [of national intelligence James] Clapper to consider the program, to present some changes, if he feels it necessary. We will consider changes.&rdquo;</p> <p>She added: &ldquo;We will certainly have legislation which will limit or prevent contractors from handling highly classified technical data.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Los Angeles Times reported that Edward Snowden, a former Booz Allen Hamilton contractor to the NSA, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-snowden-nsa-secrets-thumb-drive-20130613,0,791040.story\">used a thumb drive</a> to exfiltrate data about the surveillance programs to the Guardian and the Washington Post.</p> <p>Feinstein also cleared up a lingering uncertainty about the role of the courts in overseeing the NSA&rsquo;s ability to comb through its database of the phone records of millions of Americans. The NSA has the ability to search the database unilaterally.</p> <p>&ldquo;To search the database you have to have reasonable, articulable cause to believe that an individual is connected to a terrorist group,&rdquo; Feinstein said. &ldquo;Then you can get the numbers. If you want to collect content, then you get a court order.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pressed by the Guardian if that meant the NSA did not require a court order to search through the database, she replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my understanding.&rdquo;</p> <p>In a heated Senate appropriations committee hearing on Wednesday, the NSA chief, General Alexander, said: &ldquo;We don't get to swim through the data,&rdquo; and that searching through it requires a &ldquo;very deliberate process.&rdquo; But that process is not overseen by a judge ahead of time, according to the Senate intelligence committee chairwoman.</p> <p>Feinstein also said that before any content could be searched pursuant to a court order, all the NSA possesses is &ldquo;the name and the number called, whether it&rsquo;s one number or two&rdquo;.</p> <p>Yet US intelligence leaders have firmly denied its phone-records databases contain any names of any subscribers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber,&rdquo; according to a 6 June <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/868-dni-statement-on-recent-unauthorized-disclosures-of-classified-information\">factsheet</a> released by Clapper. It is unclear if Feinstein misspoke or learned new information at the briefing, as she spoke to reporters for about four minutes before leaving to catch a plane.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410746194|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|a87e8295481a805a9ba5fa978c464ef0b3076bc3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Hollywood is planning to bring movies centring on the story of data-snooping whistleblower Edward Snowden and the equally controversial US drones programme to the big screen, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/us-drone-program-movie-works-568381\" title=\"\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Few details are available about either project, but the drones movie appears to be further along the road to a potential release. Production company <a href=\"http://www.lakeshoreentertainment.com/\" title=\"\">Lakeshore Entertainment</a> has picked up an untitled screenplay for an &quot;action thriller with military elements&quot; from writer Spenser Cohen, a recent University of Southern California graduate who last year sold a screenplay for upcoming true-life Somali pirate drama <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226264/\" title=\"\">High Target Value</a>.</p><p>Hollywood agency WME is said to be offering a film about Edward Snowden, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-profile\" title=\"\">exposed the US National Security Agency's programme of widespread surveillance of its own citizens via the Guardian on 6 June</a>, to studios.</p><p>Both projects – should they ever hit the big screen – are likely to be mired in controversy, as Kathryn Bigelow discovered after announcing plans to bring a film about the hunt for and killing of Osama bin Laden to cinemas in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149492/zero-dark-thirty\" title=\"\">Zero Dark Thirty</a> was expected to be an Oscars frontrunner, given the pedigree of Bigelow and its writer, Mark Boal, who both won Academy Awards for the Iraq war drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130570/hurt-locker\" title=\"\">The Hurt Locker</a> in 2009. However, concerns from politicians on all sides of the political divide about the film's depiction of torture in the search for al-Qaida's chief appeared to stymie its chances of prize success earlier this year. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/25/zero-dark-thirty-cia-oscars\" title=\"\">Zero Dark Thirty eventually took just one Oscar</a>, for best sound editing, though its worldwide box-office haul eventually came in at a more than decent $108m.</p><p>Snowden's story in particular has all the ingredients for a successful Hollywood political thriller: intrigue, true-life cache and a maverick central character willing to leave behind his girlfriend and go on the run from his own government in order to expose the truth. Barack Obama's drones programme, meanwhile, has already proven itself a useful dramatic tool on the small screen in the highly acclaimed US TV series <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/homeland\" title=\"\">Homeland</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410779809|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|61ea985a04025bf10c134c77352f423fe6910646 -->",

        "body":"<p>Europe pressed the US for greater detail on the Prism surveillance scandal on Friday for the first time and was told that data collection on Europeans was not conducted in \"bulk\" but only in cases of strong suspicion of individual or group involvement in terrorism, cybercrime or nuclear proliferation.</p><p>At a meeting of US and EU justice and law enforcement officials in Dublin, Viviane Reding, the EU commissioner for justice, said she was satisfied that US collection of metadata via the Verizon mobile phone network was \"mainly an American question\".</p><p>The much bigger issues, raised by Edward Snowden's leaks to the Guardian, concerned the NSA hoovering up data from social media and internet servers across Europe in flagrant breach of EU data protection regulations.</p><p>Reding said the US and the EU had agreed to set up a working group of security experts to grapple with the implications for the European public.</p><p>\"Considering Prism, the US answers to the questions I have raised were the following: it is about foreign intelligence threats. Prism is targeted at non-US citizens under investigation on suspicion of terrorism and cybercrimes. So it is not about bulk data mining, but specific individuals or targeted groups. It is on the basis of a court order, of an American court, and of congressional oversight,\" said Reding.</p><p>She emphasised that although national security considerations were vital, the rights of citizens were \"non-negotiable'' and also dwelt on the point of the availability of legal redress. Under EU laws, anyone living in Europe, including Americans, can resort to the courts on the grounds that their data privacy rights have been violated. Europeans living in the US cannot go to the US courts in parallel cases.</p><p>\"I have been asking since a long time already and I continue to ask for full, equal treatment of EU and US citizens. Not more, not less,\" said Reding.</p><p>Eric Holder, the US attorney general, said the Prism programme was aimed at \"facilitating the acquisition of foreign intelligence information on targets outside the US\". He said the programme was only used if it was \"reasonably believed\" that the \"foreign target\" was outside the US and was suspected of being involved in terrorism, cybercrime or nuclear proliferation. Use of the surveillance programme was subject to \"extensive oversight\".</p><p>\"Everything is done consistent with the law,\" Holder said.</p><p>Amid outrage across Europe at the vast scale of the US surveillance operations, the US attorney general added that both sides of the Atlantic were engaged in policies aimed at \"how to remain vigilant protecting civil liberties\".</p><p>Under EU data protection rules tabled 18 months ago but not yet agreed among EU governments, crucial passages have been dropped under strong EU pressure making it easier for the Americans to access data on people in Europe.</p><p>Reding's spokeswoman said on Thursday that when drafting the rules, the European commission had been faced with \"intense US lobbying\". A contentious passage in the original draft set stiff conditions for the transfer of data to third countries. This part was dropped.</p><p>The new rules are supposed to be agreed by the end of the year. But it is likely that they will now have to be reviewed because of the Snowden leaks and the global impact.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410809335|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|591ce4c24d425191230dc8758f5a9a4d0d06ac08 -->",

        "body":"<p>A clear majority of Americans are concerned about the actions and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-nsa-files\">operations of the National Security Agency (NSA)</a> and want the intelligence body to be subjected to further review and greater congressional oversight, a Guardian poll has found.</p><p>In the opinion poll, conducted for the Guardian by Public Policy Polling, two-thirds of voters who responded said that in the light of a week-long series of leaked disclosures about the NSA's surveillance activities they wanted to see its role reviewed. Only 20% thought there were no grounds for further review, while 14% could not say either way.</p><p>In a separate question, 56% said that they believed Congress had failed to conduct sufficient oversight of the NSA, which is a branch of the department of defence charged with collecting and analysing national security information. Recent disclosures by the Guardian have unveiled the NSA's vast data-mining programs of telephone records and other digital communications involving millions of Americans.</p><p>The revelations originated with a former contract worker for the NSA, Edward Snowden, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\">said he decided</a> to blow the whistle on the agency's digital dragnet operations because he wanted the public to know about the \"federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive power that rule the world\". The poll suggests that his stated ambition has, at least for now, been achieved: some 90% of those surveyed said they had heard about the recent news involving the NSA's collecting and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order \"> storing of Verizon phone records</a> and gaining access to data from major internet companies, and 61% said they believed a fresh debate was needed over the balance between privacy and security.</p><p>The poll shows that a substantial majority of Americans – 60% – want their government to be more open about its data collection so that the public can understand what is going on. A much smaller proportion, only 35%, said they agreed that the government needs to keep the data it collects secret in order to protect national security.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410726636'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/13/1371127813292/Congress-oversight-poll.-008.jpg' alt='Congress oversight poll.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: guardian.co.uk</figcaption></figure><p>Most American voters – 58% – are also fearful about private firms acting as contractors to the defence department have too much access to state secrets. Only 8% of respondents said they thought government contractors had too little access.</p><p>Snowden worked most recently for the private firm Booz Allen Hamilton, doing contract work through that company for the NSA in Hawaii. </p><p>Despite these areas of relative agreement, Americans are much less firm in their opinions when asked about official data gathering activities. Some 44% of respondents approve of the government collecting internet and/or phone data from them, and a relatively close 50% think it is a bad idea.</p><p>Similar results were found when the sample was asked what they thought of the government's collection of metadata, with 40% approving and a 50% disapproving. The term was explained in the survey as being the collection of characteristics such as length of a phone call and who called whom but not the content of the phone call itself.</p><p>The Obama administration has attempted to justify the NSA's actions in the light of the recent leaks by saying the agency only skims metadata information rather than listening into conversations. Advocates of greater openness in official affairs say that this is misleading.</p><p>\"It's not surprising that people are more ambivalent about metadata because many people have little knowledge about how deeply personal metadata can be. It can be a window into every aspect of your life – who you are speaking to, for how long, where from – it's a database of everything you do,\" said Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney at the campaign for online rights, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>One group more than any other has intense qualms about the expansion of executive powers in data sweeping: young Americans. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, a commanding 81% want to see the NSA's role reviewed and 69% think there needs to be a wider debate about privacy versus security.</p><p>The poll also indicates that the disclosures could have political ramifications for Obama. Nearly half – 48% – of American voters say they are less likely to support Obama because of the recent revelations on data-gathering, while only 17% say they are more likely to support him.</p><p>This split is less pronounced among Obama's Democratic base, with 25% of Democrats saying they were more likely to support Obama against 28% who said the opposite. Obama's Democratic base, especially among black voters, generally expressed less concern about the NSA disclosures than Republican-leaning voters.</p><p>For instance, 68% of those identifying themselves as Republican said they thought Congress had not done enough oversight of the agency, while only 40% of Democrats were similarly worried.</p><p>There was one area, however, of bipartisan agreement. Both Democratic- and Republican-leaning respondents replied by 59% that they felt the government needed to be more open about its data collection activities.</p><p><em>• Public Policy Polling surveyed 512 registered voters between 10-11 June 2013 on behalf of the Guardian.

As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenfry\" title=\"\">Stephen Fry observed in an exasperated tweet</a>: \"William Hague's view seems to be 'we can hide a camera &amp; bug in your room &amp; if you've got nothing to hide, what's the worry?' Hell's teeth!\"</p><p>Hell's teeth indeed. I can think of thousands of people who have nothing to hide, but who would have good reasons to worry about intrusive surveillance. Journalists seeking to protect their sources, for example; NHS whistleblowers; people seeking online help for personal psychological torments; frightened teenagers seeking advice on contraception or abortion; estranged wives of abusive husbands; asylum seekers and dissident refugees; and so on.</p><p>In a way, Hague's smug, patronising tone was the least troubling aspect of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/jun/10/cameron-speech-gchq-nsa-hague-live\" title=\"\">the NSA/GCHQ story</a>. More worrying was the unexplained contradiction between claims in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/\" title=\"\">Prism PowerPoint slides</a> that the NSA routinely collects data from Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple, and the companies' frantic denials that this was the case. (Interestingly, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter aren't on the list – yet.) The named companies have all claimed that while they do provide user data in response to government requests, they do so only on a case-by-case basis and using tools such as secure virtual dropboxes or encrypted file transfers.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design\" title=\"\">One of the slides</a> in the presentation is entitled \"Prism <em>collection</em> details\" (emphasis added). It describes the companies as \"current providers\" (implying voluntary or involuntary compliance) and informs its audience about \"what will you receive in collection (surveillance and stored comms)?\", which \"varies by provider\".</p><p>There are various ways of reading this. One is that Prism does indeed have direct access to the internet companies' servers because, as one of the NSA bigwigs famously observed: \"If you're looking for a needle in a haystack, then you need the haystack\" and it now has the technology to get it. Another reading is that Prism merely <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/10/prism-pushback\" title=\"\">automates the serving of legally authorised writs on the internet companies</a>. But whatever the explanation, someone is being economic with the <em>actualité</em>, as Alan Clark once said.</p><p>Let us suppose, for a moment, that it's the companies that are the prime economisers in this context. If it is indeed the case that the NSA has logon-type access to their servers, what does that mean for anyone who is uncomfortable about this? Simple: one shouldn't entrust one's personal communications to any of them. That means: no Microsoft cloud services, no Google or Bing searches, no Google Docs, no Gmail, Yahoo mail or Hotmail; no Skype calls; no YouTube or Vimeo videos; no Flickr or Picasa; no Facebook or Twitter. And, of course, no iPhone or iPad use.</p><p>Why? Because all these services and/or devices rely on cloud services hosted in the US, which – we must assume – are routinely hoovered by the NSA for indefinite storage in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/\" title=\"\">the colossal server farm the agency has been constructing in Utah</a>.</p><p>Over the last week, I have had various conversations with friends, colleagues and acquaintances about Prismgate. Many – though not all – confessed to feeling uneasy about what it might mean for privacy and/or liberal democracy. Some were sceptical that the NSA and its overseas franchises such as GCHQ actually possess the technical capability to \"collect the haystack\". All were adamant, however, that they don't want to live in a National Security state.</p><p>But when I raised <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/10/tim-wu-google-boycott\" title=\"\">Tim Wu's recommendation that users should therefore boycott Google</a> and co, the atmosphere changed. The idea of not using Google for search seems unthinkable to most people. My respondents could live without Google Docs, but most thought that webmail was essential. Older people might be able to live without YouTube, but nobody under the age of 25 could. For many, Skype has become a personal lifeline for keeping in touch with distant friends and family members. iPhone and iPad users were appalled at the idea of having to give up their toys. And one person declared that he would sooner shoot himself than go back to using Microsoft Windows.</p><p>The moral of this? Simple: we're screwed either way. We're so hooked on the services provided by Google <em>et al</em> that we can't contemplate boycotting them, <em>whether or not they're collaborating with the Feds</em>. We walked cheerfully into the trap, folks. All that remains now is to live with the consequences.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410711202|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|f3ea138753cb987e9f9ba17eb686e671144fefd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Facebook and Microsoft have struck agreements with the US government to release limited information about the number of surveillance requests they receive, a modest victory for the companies as they struggle with the fallout from disclosures about a secret government data-collection program.</p><p>Facebook on Friday became the first to release aggregate numbers of requests, saying <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/636/Facebook-Releases-Data-Including-All-National-Security-Requests\">in a blog post </a>it received between 9,000 and 10,000 US requests for user data in the second half of 2012, covering 18,000 to 19,000 of its users' accounts. Facebook has more than 1.1 billion users worldwide.</p><p>The majority of those requests are routine police inquiries, a person familiar with the company said, but under the terms of the deal with the justice department, Facebook is precluded from saying how many were secret orders issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Until now, all information about requests under Fisa, including their existence, were deemed secret.</p><p>Microsoft said it had received requests of all types for information on about 31,000 consumer accounts in the second half of 2012. In a \"transparency report\" Microsoft published earlier this year without including national security matters, it said it had received criminal requests involving 24,565 accounts for the whole of 2012.</p><p>If half of those requests came in the second part of the year, the intelligence requests constitute the bulk of government inquiries. Microsoft did not dispute that conclusion.</p><p>Google said late on Friday it was negotiating with the government and that the sticking point was whether it could only publish a combined figure for all requests. It said that would be \"a step back for users\", because it already breaks out criminal requests and national security letters, another type of intelligence inquiry.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Microsoft had all <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/microsoft-twitter-rivals-nsa-requests\">publicly urged the US authorities to allow them to reveal the number and scope of the surveillance requests</a> after documents leaked to the Guardian suggested they had given the government \"direct access\" to their computers as part of the National Security Agency program called Prism.</p><p>The disclosures about Prism, and related revelations about broad-based collection of telephone records, have triggered widespread concern and congressional hearings about the scope and extent of the information-gathering.</p><p>\"We hope this helps put into perspective the numbers involved and lays to rest some of the hyperbolic and false assertions in some recent press accounts about the frequency and scope of the data requests that we receive,\" Facebook wrote on its site.</p><p>Facebook said it would continue to press to divulge more information. The person familiar with the company said that it at least partially complied with US legal requests 79% of the time, and that it usually turned over just the user's email address and internet protocol address and name, rather than the content of the person's postings or messages.</p><p>It is believed that Fisa requests typically seek much more information. But it remains unclear how broad the Fisa orders might be.</p><p>Among the other remaining questions are the nature of court-approved \"minimisation\" procedures designed to limit use of information about US residents. The NSA is prohibited from specifically targeting them.</p><p>\"If they are receiving large amounts of data that they are not actually authorised to look at, the question then becomes what are the procedures by which they determine what they can look at?\" said Kevin Bankston, a lawyer at the Centre for Democracy &amp; Technology. \"Do they simply store that forever in case later they are authorised to look at it?\"</p><p>In addition, some legal experts say recent US laws allow for intelligence-gathering simply for the pursuit of foreign policy objectives, not just in hunting terrorists and spies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410827706|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|b26847ac57e3c0ac087dcc7f43c750c1c33b60a0 -->",

He promised to <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1261593/cy-leung-breaks-silence-snowden-case-we-will-follow-privacy-claims\" title=\"\">\"follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of the institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated\"</a>.</p><p>His spokesman declined to elaborate on what that follow-up may entail, the South China Morning Post said.</p><p>Snowden has alleged that the US hacked hundreds of targets in Hong Kong and on mainland China.</p><p>Leung's statement said the government would handle Snowden's case \"in accordance with the laws and established procedures of Hong Kong\".</p><p>Human rights groups and other organisations arranged the rally after Snowden, a US citizen, told the South China Morning Post that he planned to stay in the territory and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/edward-snowden-us-extradition-fight\" title=\"\">\"ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate\"</a>. Three days earlier he revealed his identity and his presence in Hong Kong in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\" title=\"\">a video interview with the Guardian</a>.</p><p>Protesters waved placards and chanted \"protect free speech – protect Snowden\" as they rallied in the centre of the city before marching past the US consulate and gathering outside government offices.</p><p>Hong Kong has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/edward-snowden-hong-kong-years\" title=\"\">a well-used surrender treaty with the US</a>. Supporters say they are concerned that Beijing may intervene in the decision and are worried about his treatment if he is sent back to the US.</p><p>Legislator Charles Mok told the crowd of more than 500 that they were there to protect not just Snowden but \"all of us\", given the allegations about US surveillance.</p><p>Albert Ho Chun-yan, a high-profile Democratic politician, said: \"It's unlawful, unjustified and unscrupulous … We demand the whole truth be disclosed by the US administration, an unconditional apology from [President Barack] Obama and an assurance this interference will stop.\"</p><p>Allen Kuo, 43, who works in finance, said that as an American the behaviour of the US was \"an embarrassment\". Holding a sign reading \"We stand with Snowden\", he said: \"People say he is a traitor and what he has done is illegal. I think spying on American people is unconstitutional and we need to address that first.\"</p><p>Protestors came from a range of ages and nationalities. Teacher Mary Stickley, who has lived in Hong Kong for 17 years, said: \"This is my first ever march; I just felt pretty strongly about it.\"</p><p>Ruth Jopling, whose two young daughters were clutching Snowden masks, said: \"We think it does not just affect us, but the next generation. That's why we have come as a family. It's time to stand up: he came to Hong Kong, so he must trust us to do something, and it's not good if we let him down.\"</p><p>One placard in the crowd read \"Read my lips, not my emails\". Others had images of Obama above the slogan \"Big brother is watching you\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410847043'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/15/1371298279873/Protesters-blow-whistles--010.jpg' alt='Protesters blow whistles during a protest in support of Edward Snowden in Hong Kong' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Protesters blow whistles during a protest in support of Edward Snowden in Hong Kong.

Shi Tao was jailed after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/nov/14/news.yahoo\" title=\"\">Yahoo handed email records to the Chinese government</a>.</p><p>Tsui said the case was similar because it was about governments ordering internet providers to give them information about customers. \"The important thing is that many Americans came forward to speak up for Shi Tao. Now it's our turn,\" he said.</p><p>Several hundred people participated, but the numbers were small compared with other recent demonstrations. A vigil on the anniversary of the 1989 crackdown this month drew tens of thousands.</p><p>A small poll <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1261483/one-2-hongkongers-say-snowden-should-not-be-surrendered-us\" title=\"\">conducted for the South China Morning Post</a> found that one in two Hong Kong residents did not believe Snowden should be returned if the US made a surrender request.</p><p>Half of the 509 respondents in the poll, conducted by the Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey at Chinese University, said they were against or strongly against his surrender, the Post reported.</p><p>Nearly one in five said Hong Kong should hand him over, and the remainder refused to answer or said they had not formed an opinion.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410841284|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|3b051e827a00096070055039955f555b8440088b -->",

        "body":"<p>Senior officials from the current and previous US administrations lined up on Sunday to defend the government sweep of phone and internet records and condemn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-what-we-know-nsa\">the whistleblower who revealed the secret surveillance programmes</a>.</p><p>The White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said President Barack Obama was of the mind that the no violations of privacy had taken place in regards to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-nsa-files\">the data collections</a>, the existence of which have been the subject of a series of Guardian reports.</p><p>Dick Cheney, vice-president under George W Bush and a key figure in the post-September 11 revamping of US national security, also defended the system. He told Fox News Sunday that it was needed to \"gather intelligence on your enemies and stop the attack before it is launched\". He went on to condemn the man behind the series of explosive leaks regarding. Having described Edward Snowden as a \"traitor\", Cheney went on to cast aspersions over the 29-year-old's decision to travel to Hong Kong, suggesting that he could be a spy for China.</p><p>\"I'm suspicious because he went to China. That's not a place where you would ordinarily want to go if you are interested in freedom, liberty and so forth,\" Cheney said, adding: \"It raises questions whether or not he had that kind of connection before he did this.\" Cheney suggested that Snowden could still be in possession of confidential data and that the Chinese would \"probably be willing to provide immunity for him or sanctuary for him in exchange for what he presumably knows or doesn't know\".</p><p>McDonough refused to speculate over Snowden's motives, but disputed claims that the former contract worker for the National Security Agency  made to the Guardian concerning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\">being able wiretap anyone, including the president</a>.</p><p>\"That's incorrect,\" the White House's most senior staffer told CBS's Face the Nation. He added that Obama did not believe that the surveillance system amounted to a government overreach. \"We have to find the right balance of protecting our privacy – which is sacrosanct in the president's views – and protecting the country from the very real risk and threats that it faces.\"</p><p>McDonough's comments come a day after US intelligence chiefs wrote to Congress defending the legality and usefullness of the surveillance programmes that were first revealed by the Guardian and the Washington Post. The briefing document claimed that the monitoring of metadata had helped prevent potential terror attacks in the US and in more than 20 countries around the world. Some have complained that this claim is unproven.</p><p>Meanwhile, sceptics in Congress have complained that the surveillance programme does not come with sufficient checks to protect innocent individuals. Senator Mark Udall, a leading critic of the secret programme, said that collection of data does not have to be \"all or nothing\". He intends to put forward a bill that would limit the scope of what is allowed under the Patriot Act.</p><p>Udall told NBC's Meet the Press: \"We owe it to the American people to have a debate in the open about the extent of this programme – you have a law that has been interpreted secretly by a secret court that then issues secret orders to generate a secret programme.\"</p><p>Udall added that the way the system operated at present wasn't \"an American approach\" to the problem of balancing privacy with threat reduction.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410892609|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|a53d0461a71291259f4c9405abbcb9127e9dc6ba -->",

        "body":"<p>The US intelligence community has written to Congress to confirm the existence of two sweeping surveillance programmes revealed by the Guardian, but defended their legality and usefulness in preventing terrorism.</p><p>In the fullest official account yet of how the US gathers domestic telephone data and overseas internet traffic, the document sent on Saturday claims that both programmes were authorised by Congress under section 215 of the Patriot Act and section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.</p><p>This has been disputed by a number of senators and congressmen, including one of the authors of the Patriot Act, who say it is more sweeping than they envisaged, but the document details a number of internal checks put in place since that seek to minimise the exposure of private data obtained inadvertently from citizens who are not terrorist suspects.</p><p>Referring to the gathering of US telephone records, it says: \"The metadata is segregated and queries against the database are documented and audited. Only a small number of specifically-trained officials may access the data; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court reviews the program every 90 days; and the data must be destroyed within five years.\"</p><p>The National Security Agency has not responded to questions from the Guardian about whether there was any external audit of this five-year moratorium, not was any additional detail provided to Congress.</p><p>The document also reveals that 300 identifiers \"associated with specific foreign terrorist organizations\" were targeted within the phone metadata for further scrutiny in 2012.</p><p>However, the briefing document does not address concerns raised by a number of members of Congress as to whether further court approval is required to query the database for these specific records, simply saying officers require \"reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulated facts, that an identifier is associated with specific foreign terrorist organizations\".</p><p>Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian on Thursday her \"understanding\" was that Fisa court approval is not required before a database query of Americans' phone records.</p><p>The briefing document says the metadata gathered within this particular programme includes telephone numbers dialled and length of calls, but does not include the content of the calls or location data.</p><p>Earlier on Saturday it was revealed that one of the Congressman present at a secret briefing given by intelligence chiefs on Tuesday claims he was told that agents did not have to obtain extra approval to listen to the content of calls.</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed \"simply based on an analyst deciding that\".</p><p> \"I was rather startled,\" said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee, in an <a href=\" http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589495-38/nsa-admits-listening-to-u.s-phone-calls-without-warrants/\">article on CNET</a>.</p><p>The briefing sent to Congress on Saturday says a similar system of internal checks is in place for the Prism programme, which \"targets the internet communications of foreigners\".</p><p>\"Congress requires the government to develop and obtain judicial approval for 'minimization' procedures to ensure appropriate protection of any information about US persons that may be incidentally acquired,\" it says. \"The Government did that, and its procedures were approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\"</p><p>It also defends the role of US technology companies, saying the law compels them to \"provide certain communication records\" but implied some had put up a fight. \"While required to comply, US companies have put energy, focus and commitment to consistently protect the privacy of their customers, as well as the safety and security of these same customers, around the world,\" it said.</p><p>Disclosure of the latest briefing to Congress from intelligence chiefs follows leaks to the Guardian and Washington Post, and a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/secret-prism-success-even-bigger-data-seizure\">fresh investigation by the Associated Press</a> which claims that collection of data from internet companies is only the tip of a much bigger digital surveillance programme that includes the NSA tapping directly into the global internet backbone to obtain raw traffic data.</p><p>On Saturday the US intelligence community repeated claims made by the FBI director, Robert Mueller, that its surveillance activities were essential to preventing terrorism and hinted that they might have stopped the 11 September attacks had they been in place in 2001.</p><p>The briefing document says the telephone data collection was \"designed to address a seam between foreign and domestic counterterrorism efforts exposed in the 9/11 attacks\".</p><p>It had helped to thwart potential terrorist plots in the US and more than 20 other countries, the document said.</p><p>It gives fresh details to back up claims that both programmes helped foil an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/29/najibullah-zazi-terrorism-plot\">attempted attack on the New York subway in 2009</a> by Colorado-based extremist Najibullah Zazi.</p><p>The document says: \"NSA received Zazi's telephone number from FBI and ran it against the Section 215 Business Records data, identifying and passing additional leads back to the FBI for investigation.\"</p><p>The ability of these programmes to obtain crucial intelligence not available by other less intrusive means has been challenge by two members of the Senate intelligence committee, senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, but the intelligence community stood its ground on Saturday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410867623|2013-10-16T11:46:25Z|68a5551f69e06416a0ea9cecda29e8542ada522b -->",
