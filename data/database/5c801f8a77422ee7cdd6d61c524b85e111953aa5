The two will attempt to consummate a budget deal that <del>will fail on Republican refusal to raise any taxes</del> could put an end to that cycle of &quot;brinksmanship&quot; the president referred to this morning. Via Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meeting for breakfast, Republican House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Patty Murray, said they would explore every avenue to reach a longer-term deal to reduce deficits and replace automatic &quot;sequester&quot; spending cuts.</p> <p>&quot;Our job over the next eight weeks is to find out what we can agree on, and we have agreed that we are going to look at everything in front of us.

The White House attention accelerated Ryan's rise to become his party's leader on budget issues. Voter concern that a Romney-Ryan White House would curtail entitlements helped fuel the Democratic victory of 2012.

He means the shutdown.</p> <p>His reasoning proceeds from the opinion that a<strong> path is now clear to a budget deal</strong> which would include Democrats abandoning their insistence on higher taxes for the rich. There are plenty more counterintuitive nuggets where that came from. Kaletsky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apart from discussing Social Security and Medicare reforms, to which Obama has already agreed, the Democrats need to make only one more concession to facilitate a bipartisan deal: they must abandon their insistence on higher taxes. While conventional wisdom maintains that this is the one concession Obama will never make, it would actually be surprisingly easy because of changing economic conditions. Recent revisions to budget forecasts imply that the U.S. government no longer needs additional revenues to control its deficits. <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/lawrencesummers/2013/10/14/beyond-the-budget-impasse/\">As Larry Summers has pointed out</a>, the federal deficit will narrow to just 2 percent of GDP by 2015, even without further fiscal action. Beyond that an increase of just 0.2 percentage points in the economy’s structural growth rate “would entirely eliminate the projected long-term budget gap.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Kaletsky thinks the president, whose power is waxing, can now &quot;dictate the broad terms of a budgetary truce&quot; to Republicans, and that &quot;the <strong>approaching budget and debt negotiations should prove surprisingly consensual</strong> and calm.&quot; In short, he thinks the Republicans are beaten, and so will change their negotiating posture.

        "body":"<p>On 1 October, democracy was officially suspended in the US people's House of Representatives.</p><p>Now, two weeks in to the federal shutdown, we are living with the results. Millions of Americans are going without important government services, and hundreds of thousands of hardworking civil servants are being forced to go without pay while bills pile up and mortgages come due. Children with cancer are being <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/19kyUsv\">turned away from experimental drug trials</a> at the National Institutes of Health. The Center for Disease Control is left <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/flu-season-may-be-starting-feds-furlough-cant-track-it-8C11329868\">without enough manpower to track the spread of the flu</a>, potentially leaving vulnerable populations at risk. Small business owners are finding it <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1bc51tF\">difficult to secure loans</a>. And the list goes on – <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/shutdown-costs-at-1-6-billion-with-160-million-each-day.html\">to the tune of $160m</a> or more in lost economic activity every day.</p><p>It didn't have to be this way. There are enough votes in the House to pass the Senate's \"clean\" bill to fund government – and this already represents Democrats being willing to compromise to accept the GOP's post-sequester funding levels for the short term. It would have easily passed the House with a bipartisan majority – had the House Republican leadership brought it to the floor for a simple up-or-down vote. But House Republicans – <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/rachel-maddow/53151808\">many of whom have long had the goal of shutting down the government</a> – effectively wrote the shutdown into law with just hours left on the clock.</p><p>If that sounds unbelievable and outrageous, it's because it is.</p><p>The chairman of the House rules committee conceded that, under normal procedure with clause 4 of rule 22, if the House amends a Senate bill and the Senate rejects the House's amendment(s), <em>any</em> House member has the right to bring the original Senate bill up for an immediate up-or-down vote in the House. But just two hours before the government was poised to shut down, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">House Republicans quietly rigged the rules in their favor</a>. They changed that rule to ensure that <em>only</em> Republican majority leader Eric Cantor could bring the Senate bill to reopen the government up for a vote – something they have refused to do.</p><p>The Republicans thought they would get away with this. They had assumed that voters would not notice this egregious display of power and would overlook the fact that they had fundamentally changed the way our representative democracy operates. But they were wrong.</p><p>This past Saturday, on the House floor, as almost 200 Democrats lined up to sign a petition to open the government, I called the Republicans out on their manipulation of the rules – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">video of the exchange has already been viewed nearly 3m times</a>.</p><p>While it involves arcane parliamentary procedure, this issue is fundamental to our democracy. The public recognizes what's at stake in this debate. They recognize that rigging the rules to keep the government shut down makes a mockery of the democratic process in the people's House.</p><p>It's time to stop stalling and allow democracy to work its will. If Speaker Boehner would simply allow the House of Representatives to work as it was designed to, we could open the government immediately.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420148929|2013-10-18T10:23:05Z|c90c27377b886ab5af9fe3c815d12a4453039630 -->",

        "body":"<p>In a just universe, America's civil servants would be back at work and Congress would be on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=f&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/11/shutdown-congress-gets-pay-perks&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=2q5eUpfeKY2d0wWMn4DQCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtIWwQXnoQ0r8bIdF4_biGrw4h_g\">indefinite furlough</a>. </p><p>Federal workers don't create budget crises, yet whenever we have one, they're the ones getting screwed. This time is no different. They can take some comfort in the rock-bottom approval ratings for Congress – currently hovering somewhere between <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-congress-poll-shutdown-zombies-20131008,0,1626947.story\">hemorrhoids and Charles Manson</a> – and specifically for the House Tea Party caucus that precipitated the shutdown. But this is an old story: we<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/americans-blame-republicans-government-shutdown\"> all hate Congress</a>, but love our own representatives. Members of Congress don't answer to national polls, they answer to their constituents. And<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/09/meadows-boehner-defund-obamacare-suicide-caucus-geography.html\"> thanks to redistricting</a>, a large chunk of the House Republicans are insulated in ultra-conservative districts that have been gerrymandered to a point beyond all recognition to the rest of the country (while the remainder live in fear of getting challenged in the primaries if they don't go along with the former's reckless endeavors).</p><p>This is why Representative Ted Yoho, described by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/many-in-gop-offer-theory-default-wouldnt-be-that-bad.html?_r=1&amp;\">New York Times</a> as \"a freshman Florida Republican who had no experience in elective office before this year [who] said the largest economy on earth should learn from his large-animal veterinary practice\", suggested \"<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/yoho-furloughed-workers-should-not-get-back-pay/2146575\">if they're not working, they shouldn't get paid</a>\", regarding those federal workers he helped put out of work. Yoho wasn't just spouting off; he was at a town hall meeting responding to a caller from his home district who complained about the federal workers \"at home watching Netflix or whatever\", as if being furloughed had been their choice. </p><p>In the end, even Congressman Yoho went along with the rest of the House, which <a href=\"mailto:http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/05/20822136-house-unanimously-approves-back-pay-for-800000-furloughed-federal-workers?lite\">unanimously voted </a>to provide back pay to furloughed workers whenever the shutdown ends. But the promise of a check at some uncertain, future date doesn't cover rent, groceries or electricity bills now for the 800,000 workers affected, many of whom <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/living-paycheck-to-paycheck_n_1899685.html\">live paycheck to paycheck</a>. Federal workers have reported <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/yoho-furloughed-workers-should-not-get-back-pay/2146575\">taking out loans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101087804\">selling possessions on eBay</a>, and getting second jobs (the Department of Energy helpfully posted <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/11/energy-department-shutdown_n_4085959.html\">guidelines </a>for moonlighting: bartending is OK, lobbying for energy companies is not). In a member survey by the National Treasury Employees Union, <a href=\"http://www.nteu.org/Documents/ShutdownEffectsSurvey.pdf\">84% reported cutting back </a> (pdf) on necessities, and nearly half have delayed medical treatment to save money.</p><p>Elizabeth Lytle, a furloughed administrative program assistant with the Environmental Protection Agency in Illinois and retired navy reservist, says: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The shutdown has put tremendous financial stress on my family. There's no money coming in. In September my husband was laid off, and I was furloughed the first of October. And if the VA doesn't get any money, I won't get my disability check at the end of the month.</p></blockquote><p>As for back pay, \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" Lytle notes that as a result of the EPA shutdown, cleanup at a nearby <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/outboardmarine/index.htm\">superfund site in Waukegan</a> (the former location of a large outboard-boat-motor manufacturing plant and a former railroad tie, coal gasification, and coke plant facility) has stopped.</p><p>Yet it's not just a matter of a handful of stubborn legislators. Politicians like Yoho reflect a nasty political current within a part of the American electorate: that civil servants like Lytle are not real workers, that they don't matter, that their livelihoods are expendable for the sake of some broader ideological agenda.</p><p>It's reflected by conservative radio host Laura Ingraham gloating \"Starve the beast!\" in response to furloughs at the IRS, by <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/crowd-heckles-cops-at-white-house-brown-shirts-looks-like-something-out-of-kenya/\">Tea Party protesters heckling </a>White House police with calls of \"brownshirts\" and \"Stasi\". </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Starve the beast! \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico\">@politico</a>: Furloughs to shut down IRS for a day: <a href=\"http://t.co/eKANDoRnpN\">http://t.co/eKANDoRnpN</a>\"</p><p>&mdash; Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/statuses/334743671817773057\">May 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>It could be seen during the last round of furloughs resulting from sequestration (for which workers did not receive back pay), when Fox News' Neil Cavuto wondered out loud if this isn't a good thing: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Maybe we have too many federal workers in the first place period, if there's any place to cut it's got to be there.</p></blockquote><p>Civil servants make a handy punching bag. They're to blame for deficits, although total expenditures on federal employees (both civilian and military) make up <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2013/10/03/we-are-shutting-down-only-thirteen-percent-of-the-government-at-most/\">about 13%</a> of the federal budget, far less than Social Security or Medicare, and, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/29/wrestling_with_the_federal_budget/\">according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew</a>, firing every single federal worker in the country would only shrink the deficit by a third. It's an easy sell to balance budgets on the backs of civil servants: the last budget crisis resulted in federal workers being denied cost-of-living raises for the third straight year, along with agency budget cuts and layoffs. In their competing budget proposals, both <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/obama-budget-pensions_n_3054071.html\">President Obama </a>and <a href=\"http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2013/03/gop-budget-calls-smaller-federal-workforce-less-generous-benefits/61813/\">Paul Ryan</a> agreed to cutting federal employee retirement benefits; the only question is by how much.</p><p>Anti-government hysteria has fueled everything from <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/09/16/fox-news-krauthammer-cruz-leading-republican-suicide-caucus-by-opposing-obamacare/\">congressional kamikaze attacks</a> on Obamacare to<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Austin_suicide_attack\"> actual kamikaze attacks</a> on federal buildings, and those who get hurt are inevitably people doing their jobs. </p><p>Bureaucracies are easy to despise when they make us wait at the Department of Motor Vehicles and take for granted when they fix the roads, but no society of laws<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/government-shutdown-affects-you\"> can function without one</a>. Now that veterans' and Social Security claims are going unprocessed, food is not being inspected, parks are closed, and Head Start programs are not staffed, maybe the anti-government caucus will change its tune. But don't count on a<a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/theres-major-salmonella-outbreak-during-government-shutdown/70286/\"> salmonella outbreak</a> or two changing much.

People enrolled in the short-term assistance program will receive October checks, but the agency said it does not have funds to make payments in November.</p><p>\"We are heavily dependent on federal dollars,\" Julie Henry, spokeswoman for the state health and human services department, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/16/us-usa-fiscal-northcarolina-idUSBRE99F00Y20131016\">told Reuters</a>. \"When these kinds of things happen at the federal level, it has an immediate impact.\"</p><p>County social service agencies stopped processing new applications for assistance because federal funds are expected to run out by November if the shutdown continues. In a letter on 10 October, the HHS department also told country directors to stop processing re-certifications.</p><p>It cost $4.7m in federal funds to maintain the program in September and <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/10/15/4390822/3-nc-congressmen-question-work.html#.Ul6fNbvLgoY\">state lawmakers are asking the governor</a> to reassess his decision to halt the program.</p><p>Last week, North Carolina also suspended its WIC program – which provides food for low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five. The state redirected funds and reinstated the program two days later.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/government-shutdown-closures-money\">The USDA has said</a> WIC and the Snap food stamps program do not have guaranteed funding through the end of the month, moving states to tap reserve funds.</p><p>Arizona attempted to withhold welfare funds in the first days of the shutdown, but citizen complaints moved Republican governor Jan Brewer to redirect $650,000 to keep the program running through October.</p><p>Florida's department of children and families said its welfare and food stamps programs will run out of money at the end of the month.</p><p>A spokesperson in Michigan's budget office warned that its cash and food aid programs could close next month. \"We're good to go for October,\" state department of human services spokesperson Dave Akerly told the Detroit News. \"If (a shutdown) goes further than that, there could be problems.\"</p><p>In South Dakota, Native American tribes stopped receiving funds for heating and general welfare programs at the beginning of the shutdown.</p><p>Utah said on Tuesday that it will have to suspend its WIC and food stamps programs in November if the shutdown continues.

        "body":"<p>The government shutdown has so far cost the US economy $24bn &ndash; or $1.5bn a day, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The argument over the government shutdown, now in its 16th day, and over raising the US&rsquo;s debt ceiling, appeared to have come to a short-term resolution Wednesday as Congress rolled out a plan to fund federal agencies and extend America's borrowing authority into early next year.</p> <p>The news of the deal boosted stock markets. S&amp;P warned, however, that the political impasse had shaved at least 0.6% off US GDP on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2013. The cut is equivalent to taking $24bn out of the economy.</p> <p>S&amp;P triggered selloffs on stock markets around the world in 2011 when it downgraded US debt during the previous row over raising the debt ceiling. This week rival Fitch warned that it, too, had turned negative on US credit and was considering a downgrade.</p> <p>S&amp;P said it expected the Congress would pass the Senate resolution to fund the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the current chatter coming out of Washington suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on consumer confidence, especially among government workers that were furloughed,&rdquo; the agency said.</p> <p>&ldquo;If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another humbug holiday season,&rdquo; the agency said. &ldquo;The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the US economy.&rdquo;</p> <p>US markets rebounded on news of a deal in Washington. The Dow closed up 205 points (1.36%), the S&amp;P 500 rose 23.45 points (1.38%) and the Nasdaq 45.42 points (1.2%). Markets had fallen Tuesday when it appeared that a deal was out of reach.</p> <p>In a note to investors Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, wrote: &ldquo;Financial markets have been buoyed by media reports indicating that both the Senate and the House are preparing to vote imminently on a bill to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>\"Once the initial euphoria has worn off, however, we suspect that investors will begin to focus on the short-term nature of the deal, which means that another shutdown is possible early in the New Year.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191944|2013-10-18T10:23:05Z|44769a05932b74324088ab494f01e7be3d4d5f9e -->",

It then passed the US House of Represenatives by 285 votes to 144, with a majority of Democrats bolstered by a minority of Republicans.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House, shortly before the House was due to vote, president Barack Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that has hung over the country in recent weeks. </p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, saying he hoped the next round of spending negotiations between the parties would be more successful.</p><p>\"Hopefully next time it won't be in the eleventh hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>Earlier in the day, House Republican leaders conceded defeat in their two-week battle to derail Obama's healthcare reforms on Wednesday, and said they would not block the deal, despite winning virtually no concessions.</p><p>With just hours to go until the start of the deadline set by the US Treasury for extending the debt limit, House speaker John Boehner signalled he was ready to accept a Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to conservatives who had driven the country the precipice of a new financial crisis.</p><p>The Republican capitulation was swift and dramatic. \"We fought the good fight, but we just didn't win,\" Boehner told a local TV station in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><p>Moderate Republicans, bitter at the wounds inflicted on the party by a fight that ended in an almost complete failure to achieve any of the concessions they had sought, lashed out at their conservative colleagues.</p><p>The standoff ended just after midday when Harry Reid, the majority leader, announced the deal on the the floor of the Senate. Calling for all sides to work together, he said: \"Now is not the time for pointing the fingers of blame. Now is the time for reconciliation.\"</p><p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, acknowledged the fight was over. \"This has been a long, challenging few weeks,\" McConnell said. \"This is far less than many of us had hoped for, but it is far better than some had sought.\"</p><p>The deal, crafted by Reid and McConnell, will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February. It will force both sides into a formal budget conference in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p><p>The only apparent change to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans had targeted when they precipitated the government shutdown, involves asking the Obama administration to carry out better checks on the incomes of people registering for insurance exchanges.</p><p>A senior Republican aide told the Guardian that Boehner had agreed to allow the House to vote on the deal, which in practice means it would pass with support from Democrats and moderate Republicans. The vote was due to take place on Wednesday evening.</p><p>At 3pm, Boehner hosted a short meeting with Republicans in the House. Sources inside said he effectively told his colleagues they had lost the fight, before he was given a tepid applause.</p><p>Several congressman leaving the meeting conceded that hardline Republican tactics, which forced a two-week government shutdown and took the government to the brink of an economic crisis, had left them empty-handed.</p><p>The White House welcomed the Senate deal but cautioned that the battle would not be finally over until House lawmakers voted in favour of it. \"The president applauds leader Reid and minority leader McConnell for working together to forge this compromise and encourages the Congress to act swiftly to end this shutdown and protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America,\" said Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney.</p><p>The White House also hinted that Obama may use the defeat of conservatives in Congress as a way to push ahead with other administration priorities such as immigration reform, that were previously blocked from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.</p><p>\"The president believes that one of the consequences of these manufactured crises is that time is taken away from the pursuit of other goals that we have as a nation,\" added Carney. \"That includes ... the project of bringing about legislation that he can sign that comprehensively reforms our immigration system.\"</p><p>Recriminations among Republicans flew thick and fast, with moderates accusing House conservatives of trashing the party's reputation in pursuit of an impossible ambition to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said this had \"been the best two weeks for the Democratic party in recent times\".</p><p>\"When we evaluate the last couple of weeks, it should be entitled the time of great lost opportunity. If we had been focused on the rollout of Obamacare and its confusion, public support would have diminished. Instead, our numbers have gone down, Obamacare has mysteriously gone up, and other than that, this has been great.\"</p><p>Graham was scathing about the influence of conservative advocacy groups such as Heritage Action, which torpedoed a deal on Tuesday when it threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who backed it. He also warned of the damage that the party had inflicted on itself: \"The way we are behaving and the path we have taken the last couple of weeks leads to a marginalised party in the eyes of the American people,\" he said.</p><p>Ted Cruz, the first-term Republican senator from Texas who had led the rebellion against Obamacare with a marathon 21-hour speech last month, was unrepentant but said he would not stand in the way of the Senate vote even though he opposes the deal.</p><p>Underscoring the fault lines in the Republican party, he blamed fellow senators for failing to go along with his strategy. \"Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House and in particular we saw real division among Senate Republicans. Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this would have been very, very different,\" Cruz said.</p><p>Shortly before the Senate vote, Cruz took to the floor to urge his colleagues to vote against it. \"This is a terrible deal,\" he said. \"It embodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates the American people.\"</p><p>It was the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved, and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. By refusing to blink, Democrats pushed Republicans to show that they would not let the US default on its debts, making it hard for the GOP to repeat its tactic.</p><p>Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican Charles Boustany, said the Tea Party-backed members of the House of Representatives had put the GOP's position at risk. \"This could trigger a wave of discontent that could wash out our Republican majority in the House if we're not careful – it's getting to that level,\" Boustany told the National Journal.</p><p>However, conservatives were equally robust in return. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, admitted his side had emerged with \"a goose egg\". \"We got nothing,\" he said.</p><p>Asked if his party had been damaged in any way over the last two weeks, he replied: \"No, I don't think so. I think we'll find out in 2014, at the ballot box.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420170635|2013-10-18T10:23:05Z|8f3faa3090f530cb5351f282c8235f7c11aae447 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US Congress passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week crisis that has closed large portions of the government, revealed deep divisions in the Republican party and threatened a global financial crisis.</p> <p>A temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014, the bill passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier.</p> <p>But it was able to pass the Republican-dominated House shortly after 10pm only with the support of Democrats. It laid bare a rupture between moderate and more rightwing Republicans, who triggered the crisis by using their budgetary leverage in what turned out to be a futile effort to undermine Obama's signature healthcare reforms.</p> <p>Only 87 House Republicans voted for the bill. The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress.</p> <p>President Barack Obama signed the spending measure into law at about 12.30 am ET on Thursday.&nbsp;In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would &quot;lift the cloud of uncertainty&quot; that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p> <p>&quot;Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,&quot; he said in a statement delivered at the White House. &quot;Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.&quot;</p> <p>Minutes after the bill was passed, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said government employees &quot;should expect to return to work in the morning&quot;.</p> <p>On both sides of the Capitol building Republican lawmakers looked deflated after the votes, which capped a dramatic capitulation after weeks of brinkmanship with Democrats who refused to blink.</p> <p>When it came, the Republican surrender was swift. With just hours to go until the deadline set by the US Treasury for extending the debt limit, House Speaker John Boehner signalled he was ready to accept a Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country the precipice of a new financial crisis.</p> <p>&quot;We fought the good fight, but we just didn't win,&quot; Boehner told a local TV station in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p> <p>The standoff ended just after midday when Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, announced the deal on the the floor of the Senate. Calling for all sides to work together, he said: &quot;Now is not the time for pointing the fingers of blame. Now is the time for reconciliation.&quot;</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, acknowledged the fight was over. &quot;This has been a long, challenging few weeks,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;This is far less than many of us had hoped for, but it is far better than some had sought.&quot;</p> <p>The deal, crafted by Reid and McConnell, will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February, setting the stage for a possible repeat of the showdown. Both sides also agreed to a formal budget conference in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p> <p>The only change to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans had targeted when they precipitated the government shutdown, requires the Obama administration to carry out better checks on the incomes of people registering for insurance exchanges.</p> <p>The bill also ensures the 800,000 federal workers who were furloughed for at least part of the shutdown will receive back pay.</p> <p>By 3pm, Boehner hosted a short meeting with forlorn-looking Republicans in the House. Sources inside the meeting said he told his colleagues they had lost the fight, and was then given a tepid applause.</p> <p>Several conservative members leaving the meeting conceded that the hardline Republican tactics had left them empty-handed. &quot;We got nothing,&quot; said&nbsp;Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who admitted his side had emerged with &quot;a goose egg&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet for the most part they rallied behind Boehner, who had sought to appease the restive conservative element until it was no longer feasible to do so.</p> <p>Recriminations among Republicans flew thick and fast, with moderates accusing House conservatives of trashing the party's reputation in pursuit of an impossible ambition to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p> <p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said the Democractic party had experienced the &quot;best two weeks&quot; in recent history. &quot;When we evaluate the last couple of weeks, it should be entitled the time of great lost opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;If we had been focused on the rollout of Obamacare and its confusion, public support would have diminished. Instead, our numbers have gone down, Obamacare has mysteriously gone up, and other than that, this has been great.&quot;</p> <p>Graham was scathing about the influence of conservative advocacy groups such as Heritage Action, which torpedoed a deal on Tuesday when it threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who backed it. He also warned of the damage that the party had inflicted on itself.</p> <p>&quot;The way we are behaving and the path we have taken the last couple of weeks leads to a marginalised party in the eyes of the American people,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Ted Cruz, the first-term Republican senator from Texas who had led the rebellion against Obamacare with a marathon 21-hour speech last month, was unrepentant. The Tea Party-backed senator was one of 18 Republicans who rebelled against their leadership to vote against the bill in the Senate.</p> <p>Shortly before the Senate vote, Cruz took to the floor to urge his colleagues to vote against it. &quot;This is a terrible deal,&quot; he said. &quot;It embodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates the American people.&quot;</p> <p>However he did not attempt any tactics to delay or stall the vote.</p> <p>Underscoring the fault lines in the Republican party, Cruz blamed fellow senators for failing to go along with his strategy. &quot;Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House and in particular we saw real division among Senate Republicans. Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this would have been very, very different,&quot; he said.</p> <p>It was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved, and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. By refusing to blink, Democrats pushed Republicans to show that they would not let the US default on its debts, making it hard for the GOP to repeat its tactic.</p> <p>A Louisiana Republican, Charles Boustany, said the Tea Party-backed members of the House of Representatives had put the GOP's position at risk. &quot;This could trigger a wave of discontent that could wash out our Republican majority in the House if we're not careful – it's getting to that level,&quot; he told the National Journal.</p> <p>Tim Huelskamp, a member of Tea Party congressional caucus, told the Guardian the divisive vote in the House would help identify the moderates in his party which he said had “given up the fight”.</p> <p>“People back at home realise not all Republicans are conservatives,” he said. “And some Republicans are anti-conservative.”</p> <p>Senator Mike Lee, a Republican ally of Cruz, struck a defiant tone on the floor, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead “The media keeps asking: was it worth it? My answer is it is always worth it to do the right thing,” he said, adding: “This is not over.”</p> <p>That view was not shared at the White House.

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\" title=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees prepared to return to work after a 16-day government shutdown.</p><p>As the US president, Barack Obama, warned: \"We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,\" the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, appealed for more stability.</p><p>\"It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,\" she said.</p><p>\"We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.\"</p><p>A Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit was to pass.</p><p>The World Bank too expressed its relief that the global economy had \"dodged a potential catastrophe\", with its president, Jim Yong Kim, urging policymakers in all countries to \"continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all\".</p><p>Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obama's healthcare reforms. But in Asia and Europe stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014.</p><p>The shutdown is estimated to <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/government-shutdown-has-cost-us-economy-15bn-a-day-sp-says\" title=\"\">have cost the US $24bn – £1.5bn a day – according to the ratings agency Standard and Poor</a>. China's official Xinhua news agency had accused Washington of jeopardising other countries' dollar assets. China is the US government's largest creditor.</p><p>Obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February.</p><p>But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown next year.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, in a statement delivered at the White House. \"Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied: \"No.\"</p><p>Earlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: \"The media keeps asking: 'Was it worth it?' My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing,\" he said, adding: \"This is not over.\"</p><p>However, the political deal on Wednesday was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420229420|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|ab5326cc8180db9257c3eb4fb6458730942f0ad6 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>An eleventh-hour agreement has been forged in Washington to avert a budget and debt default catastrophe. What’s going on?</strong></p> <p>After two weeks in which the federal government has been paralysed and the US economy brought to the brink of defaulting on its debts, a deal was done on Wednesday. Senate majority leader Harry Reid and minority leader Mitch McConnell announced it in the Senate, and a bill later passed both house of Congress. It was signed into law early on Thursday.</p> <p>The federal government is reopening, employees are coming back to their offices and the US Treasury will be able to borrow the money it needs to pay its bills.</p> <p><strong>How did this come about?</strong></p> <p>In their determination to hobble the Affordable Care Act, Republicans in the House of Representatives, egged on by hardliners in the Senate such as Ted Cruz of Texas, refused to pass a budget resolution that would have authorised the funding of the federal government unless Democrats gave concessions over Obama's healthcare law.</p> <p>The White House and Senate Democrats held firm, calculating (correctly, as it turned out) that Republicans would be blamed for the government shutdown, and would – in the end – balk at allowing the US to default.</p> <p>In the last week, cracks appeared in the Republican position and talks began to take place, particularly between moderate Republicans in the Senate and their Democratic counterparts.</p> <p>It’s been a bumpy process.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3be7dc39-4cea-44e3-b970-8438c09d5b1d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2013/10/5/1380983564704/U.S.-Senator-Ted-Cruz--010.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Senator Ted Cruz \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Cruz faces the media after his 21-hour marathon spech atacking Obamacare Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>So where did we end up?</strong></p> <p>Reid and McConnell finally announced an agreement on Wednesday. It would have been announced on Tuesday, but the Republican speaker of the House, John Boehner, intervened, and said he wanted to pass his own bill that would carry the support of conservatives.</p> <p><strong>What happened to that?</strong></p> <p>It fell apart. Boehner, in the end, could not persuade the conservative elements of his party to back his proposals. It didn’t help when conservative advocacy groups, including the powerful Heritage Action, announced they would withdraw lucrative support for Republican candidates who backed the deal. The votes melted away and Boehner was left holding a very sick baby. After a wasted day, Reid and McConnell restarted their Senate initiative.</p> <p><strong>Crisis averted.</strong></p> <p>Not quite. First of all, this bill has to be passed. It’ll easily get the votes in the Senate, and it will also probably pass the House, but, embarrassingly for Boehner, he will need to rely on the minority Democrats to reach the 217 votes he needs – plus a couple dozen Republicans. Then there is the fact the deal doesn’t quite avert the crisis.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f7a922c0-e368-4fdb-acd1-7dae60cce8e2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381766196685/0aa1757d-3ee5-4ab8-a6ed-269350266146-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal workers demonstrate for an end to the US government shutdown, at the west front of the US Capitol.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Federal workers demonstrate for an end to the US government shutdown, at the west front of the US Capitol. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Why not?</strong></p> <p>The short-term threat of a US government default is off the table for now. But the metaphorical can, which has been kicked down many rhetorical roads, is rolling again. Under the deal, the debt ceiling raise will only last until 7 February next year. The government will reopen, but will only be funded through until 15 January next year – so we could see a repeat of all of this in three months.</p> <p><strong>Don’t tell me we’ve got to go through all this again.</strong></p> <p>Well, possibly. But the deal also includes an agreement to appoint members to a bipartisan group of members of Congress to negotiate future spending levels. The hope is they will come to a consensus by early December, so theoretically they will hammer out their differences without the threat of economic disaster hanging over everyone’s head.</p> <p><strong>Because that’s always worked so well in the past.</strong></p> <p>Cynic. There is another important provision in the proposed legislation. It allows the US Treasury to use so-called “emergency measures” to pay its bills beyond February 7 – effectively meaning the guillotine would not fall for some weeks or months after that date.</p> <p><strong>Reassuring. Anything we need to know about the bill?</strong></p> <p>Two more things. First, they’re going to provide back pay to all of those furloughed government workers who have been suspended from work for more than two weeks. They will appreciate that, obviously.</p> <p>Second, the legislation includes a provision to make sure that individuals taking advantage of subsidies under Obamacare do not lie about how much money they’re earning. It is a small, anti-fraud provision, to make sure the government isn’t swindled.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t Obama say he wouldn’t be held to ransom over Obamacare?</strong></p> <p>He did say that. But as White House spokesman Jay Carney pointed out at the briefing on Wednesday, it’s not a ransom when everyone agrees with it. Democrats are happy to live with it because the clause falls way, way, short of the full defunding of Obamacare that Republicans demanded when they first embarked on this standoff.</p> <p>Think of it like a sprig of parsley garnish to make Republicans swallow a meal they really don’t want to eat.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a145aec9-0595-4d0b-a2ee-fa48de4e4bab\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381956678898/e9376b9d-e6e3-4037-b139-6fc3288a1f12-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"White House press secretary Jay Carney speaks during his daily briefing on 16 October.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>White House press secretary Jay Carney speaks during his daily briefing on 16 October.

While conventional wisdom maintains that this is the one concession Obama will never make, it would actually be surprisingly easy because of changing economic conditions. Recent revisions to budget forecasts imply that the U.S. government no longer needs additional revenues to control its deficits. <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/lawrencesummers/2013/10/14/beyond-the-budget-impasse/\">As Larry Summers has pointed out</a>, the federal deficit will narrow to just 2 percent of GDP by 2015, even without further fiscal action. Beyond that an increase of just 0.2 percentage points in the economy’s structural growth rate “would entirely eliminate the projected long-term budget gap.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Kaletsky thinks the president, whose power is waxing, can now &quot;dictate the broad terms of a budgetary truce&quot; to Republicans, and that &quot;the <strong>approaching budget and debt negotiations should prove surprisingly consensual</strong> and calm.&quot; In short, he thinks the Republicans are beaten, and so will change their negotiating posture.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to their stations. But the solution is temporary: the next shutdown deadline is 15 January 2014, three months away.</p> <p>The icebreaker legislation moved the debt ceiling until 7 February, pushing the risk of a Treasury default into March or beyond.</p> <p>The bill attracted 87 Republican votes in the House, on top of the entire Democratic caucus. It passed the Senate 81-18.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We’ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,&quot; President Obama said in a statement before signing the legislation. He called on members of a bipartisan budget conference created by the bill to strike a longer-term budget accord. Their deadline is 13 December. &quot;Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour,&quot; the president said.</p> <p>The conclusion saw near-total capitulation by Republicans, who demonstrated, <a href=\"http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/a-teachable-moment/?_r=0\">in the opinion of </a>conservative columnist Ross Douthat, that they &quot;shouldn’t be trusted with the management of a banana stand,&nbsp;let alone the House of Representatives&quot;.</p> <p>But the beauty of the news is that you can choose your own headline:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/raju/statuses/390807459738447873\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Interesting A1 headlines <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ\">@WSJ</a>: Congress Passes a Debt Bill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes\">@nytimes</a>: Republicans Back Down, Ending Budget Crisis <a href=\"http://t.co/ANW9s2m98n\">pic.twitter.com/ANW9s2m98n</a></p>— Raju Narisetti (@raju) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raju/statuses/390807459738447873\">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T14:46:38.457+01:00\">at 9.46am ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420257734|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|ec72e474c2b09ce95aec49d48df995abed56a206 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US has uttered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/obama-deal-end-federal-shutdown-government-work\" title=\"\">a sigh of relief</a>, and its critics the world over have chortled with glee. The nation that never ceases telling the world how to govern itself – even taking admonition as far as war - cannot run its own whelk stall. Was hypocrisy ever more grotesque?</p><p>Yet to visitors such as myself this week, America's budgetary hysteria and exhausted resolution have seemed a synthetic ritual, a bit like Labour day and Thanksgiving. The constitution delivers these Hitchcockian spectaculars when president and Congress are at odds, as last happened in 1995-6. They wrestle each other to the brink of the cliff, lose their footing, slip and hang on by their fingertips. But they clamber back up. They always do.</p><p>Washington's driving compulsion to keep the show on the road reflects a deep-seated survival instinct. It may be decried by the right as the desperation of those with their hands on other people's money, and by the left as democracy defaulting to sanity. Either way, when taxpayers can't pay the bills, lenders must do so. America's US debt is now about $16.7 trillion and is going to rise, not fall. The Tea Party lost the battle, but it did not lose the argument.</p><p>Some ridicule at America's expense is understandable. The rottenness of modern Washington makes outsiders gasp. The pomposity of its architecture can no longer dignify the log-rolling, the gerrymandering, the lobbyists' egregious power, the money sloshing everywhere, and the partisan polarisation that drips from every news programme.</p><p>The most bizarre participant is the Republican party. Its representatives all sang Amazing Grace and invoked God's help in unison before voting down the penultimate Senate rescue package. It was like a Taliban loya jirga. Even in the final vote, a majority of Republicans refused to back the rescue, thus voting for the US to default on its debts.</p><p>The party of Lincoln, reconstruction and reform, as its elder statesman, Senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-mccain\" title=\"\">John McCain</a>, admitted, has degenerated into a sad squabble of factions. The Tea Party, with just 40 signed-up congress members, threatened every Republican voting for rescue with a primary election challenge, no idle threat. It's small wonder that many opted for the devil of default rather than the deep blue sea of oblivion.</p><p>The Tea Party represents a serious strand in American public life – old-world fundamentalist in its exclusivity, self-righteousness and religious zeal. Its defence policy is little short of jihadist. It hates compulsory government, such as Medicare and Obamacare. It believes in state and local rights. It sees Barack Obama as an amalgam of federal power, liberal smugness and black Americanism, and hates him for it.</p><p>Like the right wing in any country, this strand lies in waiting for any political system that has grown too fat, centralised and arrogant. It cannot be dismissed as a crazed rural minority. Its threat to congressional Republicans was real, and remains so. When Tea Party members and candidates were warned they might cause the entire federal project to collapse, they saw that as a hope, not a threat. They still do.</p><p>For all that, a classic of American brinkmanship has been averted with some credit for common sense. The Tea Party was not just defeated – it was humiliated. It was brought down by the cynicism of using Obamacare as its cause, using shutdown and default as a nuclear weapon against its foe, and yielding a catastrophic failure to win public opinion. Obama's victory yesterday was not so much for him as for the American people, as they screamed, \"Pull yourselves together\", in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/10/07/government-shutdown-blame-republicans-polls/2938787/\" title=\"\">poll after poll</a>. The shutdown and its resolution were not the evil in the US system, but a sign of its ultimate sanity.</p><p>Outsiders should beware of dumping too much contempt on Washington. The separation of powers between the presidency and congress is not just hallowed by history: it is constantly tested in the fire. The US was born of disregard for the demands of subsidiary assemblies by George III and his then prime minister, Lord North. It forged its independence as a nation on the anvil of states' rights. This involved creating a deliberate, transparent tension between the states and federal government, one that held together a union that could easily have fallen apart. Where other federations fail – or in Europe's case are wilting – the US does not.</p><p>Certainly, the constitution is questioned on all sides. Commentators, thinktanks and political scientists agree that it is sick. Just as Iraq and Afghanistan have heralded the US's retreat from global suzerainty, so federal chaos is undermining faith in the system of government. Expressing this consensus, the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/21/unwinding-history-america-packer-review\" title=\"\">The Unwinding</a>, George Packer, argues in the new Prospect magazine that the whole gamut of conservative America has run out of ideas. The \"weaknesses in a system of democratic checks and balances [are] now glaring\" and need to be refocused on a stronger executive president, he says.</p><p>I am not sure. It is the presidency and its agencies that have made federal government bureaucratic and wasteful. The Pentagon is so cumbersome it can no longer win wars. Corporate lobbying and union power have driven federal medical and welfare entitlements to an unsupportable level. Obamacare, admirable in intent, is chaotic, with computers crashing and applicants left floundering.</p><p></p><p>Congress may be part of the problem. But it does exert a crude brake on the budget through having to vote for supply. It has delivered a jolt to government spending this past month, but has not curbed it. There is still no sign of Obama cutting back on welfare spending, a long-term cause of the looming debt mountain (as of Britain's). There may be another breakdown next year.</p><p>Governments round the world are facing the \"impossibility of democracy\", whereby electoral majorities vote for benefits they do not themselves have to finance, and thus resort to debt. Britain's last Labour government was reckless in this respect, as US presidents of both parties have been. Both countries face tax famines, in part because the world has not confronted the cancer of global corporate tax evasion. This is nowhere near resolved.</p><p>A catastrophe that threatened real damage to economic recovery has been avoided. But it is no bad thing that it happened. The conflict over resources was real, as was the continuing war between the extravagance of this generation and the burden heaped on to the next. Battles that elsewhere are swept under the carpet are fought in the US in full view, democracy red in tooth and claw. That is good. Thank you, America.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420278705|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|6aefeae254636e09dda9d1cf00b88cb4d5103e46 -->",

Go out and win an election.\"</p><p>He said the shutdown had undermined the economy and damaged the reputation of US political system internationally. \"There are no winners here. These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy. The American people are completely fed up of Washington. Probably nothing has done more damage to American credibility in the world than the spectacle we have seen in the last couple of weeks.\"</p><p>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde welcomed the deal but said the shaky American economy needs more stable long-term finances. \"It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,\" Lagarde said in a statement.</p><p>The financial services company Standard &amp; Poor's estimated the shutdown had cost the US economy $24bn.</p><p>Obama expressed a hope that the decision by Republican House speaker John Boehner to allow moderates in his party to vote with Democrats to end the shutdown may herald a new era of bi-partisan co-operation in the House of Representatives.</p><p>In particular, the administration is hoping that an agreement in Congress to set up a formal \"conference\" to negotiate a longer term financial deal may allow a budget bill to be passed by the end of the year as well as separate legislation on immigration and a farm bill.</p><p>This may prove wishful thinking given the continued rancour and recriminations among Republicans, but there were tentative signs of progress on Thursday morning as House fiscal hawk Paul Ryan met with Democratic senator Patty Murray to discuss how the new budget conference would work.</p><p>Ryan, who was one of the few House leaders to vote against Wednesday's compromise, said they had a very good conversation and are committed to finding ways to enact \"smart deficit reduction.\"</p><p>More than 87 Republicans in the House and 27 in the Senate (a majority of the caucus in the upper chamber) voted for the deal that ended the shutdown and the threat to withhold borrowing authority.</p><p>A similar number of House members are thought to be in favour of immigration reform, which would be the next big test of any lingering bipartisan spirit, but Boehner will be reluctant to again test the unofficial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule\">\"Hastert rule\"</a>, which advises party leaders against bringing forward legislation which does not have majority support among their own members.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420323940'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/17/1382028555206/People-arrive-at-the-Smit-010.jpg' alt='People arrive at the Smithsonian national air and space museum' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>People arrive at the Smithsonian national air and space museum.

I'm very glad to be back,\" she said.</p><p>Asim Akbari, a lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he had first heard that he would be allowed back by watching the news about Tuesday's congressional deal. \"Almost the whole department has been out. I was surprised when I checked my email this morning how empty it was.\"</p><p>Many federal workers have been explicitly banned even from monitoring work emails during the shutdown. \"We were paid for four days during the first week, but we were due our next pay next week, so the shutdown has ended just in time,\" Akbari said.</p><p>\"There was no economic rationale for any of this,\" vice president Joe Biden said as he greeted workers returning to the Environmental Protection Agency with hugs, handshakes and muffins. \"I hope everybody walks away with a lesson that this is unnecessary and I hope we can regain the trust of the American people.\"</p><p>Union leaders representing the mass of furloughed workers who have spent the past 16 days at home without pay insisted that Thursday's reopening of offices was just the start of the process of putting the government back on track.</p><p>\"Calls kept coming in, letters arriving, emails continued to pile up – and all of that backlog now needs to be dealt with. It will take a week or two for people to dig in to all that,\" said Jeffrey David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which has about 700,000 members.</p><p>Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that \"hundreds of thousands of federal employees suffered doubly, both from a loss of pay and from being kept from doing their jobs. She added that her members now faced \"an enormous task to get their agencies up and running at full steam and to dig in to the backlog\".</p><p>Some agencies expect to be particularly badly affected, although it will take time for the full consequences of the shutdown to be assessed. The National Science Foundation, for instance, mothballed its entire research programme in Antarctica amid fears from its scientists that valuable experiments and data could be jeopardised.</p><p>Tourists to the nation's capital, deprived of some of the country's best-known sights, flocked to the reopened destinations, though not all were open. The National Zoo and National Archives were both closed until Friday, and the National Gallery of Art was set to reopen on Saturday.</p><p>Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Shen Ling, 29, a teacher from China, said she and her friends heard the news that the shutdown was over in Chicago airport, just as they were about to board their flight. \"We had prepared for the worst,\" she said.</p><p>Another Chinese tourist, on the National Mall with his fianceé, said he had not followed the politics of the fiscal crisis closely. \"But this is what happens when you have two parties,\" he quipped. \"One party is better.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, some members of Congress were already bracing for another battle. \"All this does is delay this fight four months,\" Republican Congressman Mo Brooks said. \"We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits, and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy because that's where America is headed.\"</p><p>Some polls showed a steep decline in public approval for Republicans. Senator John McCain, who has been vocal in his criticism of more hardline members of his party, said voters were clearly exasperated with how both sides had dealt with the crisis. \"Hopefully, the lesson is to stop this foolish childishness,\" McCain said Thursday on CNN.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420277641|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|ff420928aa6c0a18d6f0d8e4d6762f39b73cfd39 -->",

        "headline":"Federal employees head back to work as US returns to business as usual",
        "body":"<p>The first wave of federal workers locked out of their offices because of the government shutdown have begun to return to work, and tourists flocked to reopened national monuments. But there were warnings on Thursday that it would take time to bring government operations back to full service.</p> <p>Federal agencies in Washington and elsewhere saw a trickle rather than a flood of staff heading back to their desks, after employees were told to return in what one senior manager described as a <a href=\"http://www.nteu.org/documents/M-14-01_FINAL.pdf\">&ldquo;prompt and orderly manner&rdquo;</a>. But union leaders representing the mass of furloughed workers who have spent the past 16 days at home without pay insisted that Thursday&rsquo;s reopening of offices was just the start of the process of putting the government back on track.</p> <p>&ldquo;Calls kept coming in, letters arriving, emails continued to pile up &ndash; and all of that backlog now needs to be dealt with. It will take a week or two for people to dig in to all that,&rdquo; said Jeffrey David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which has about 700,000 members.</p> <p>Then there is the issue of pay. In addition to the furloughed workers, which numbered up to 800,000 at the start of the shutdown and who should eventually be given back-pay as a result of Wednesday night&rsquo;s deal, there are about 1.3 million essential civilian employees who were asked to carry on working without pay. They, too, will receive back-pay, though delays are expected.</p> <p>Cox told the Guardian that there was &ldquo;an urgency to get our members paid as quickly as possible&rdquo;.</p> <p>Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of federal employees suffered doubly, both from a loss of pay and from being kept from doing their jobs. She added that her members now faced &ldquo;an enormous task to get their agencies up and running at full steam and to dig in to the backlog&rdquo;.</p> <p>Some agencies expect to be particularly badly affected, although it will take time for the full consequences of the shutdown to be assessed. The National Science Foundation<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/16/us-shutdown-antarctic-reserve-hobart-marine\">, for instance, mothballed its entire research programme in Antarctica</a> amid fears from its scientists that valuable experiments and data could be jeopardised.</p> <p>Around the maze of government buildings near Federal Center metro station in downtown Washington, the scene of a mass exodus on 1 October, when thousands were sent home at the start of government shutdown, the area was still much quieter than normal. Many of those who were returning had been informed by watching television news reports rather than receiving direct instructions from managers.</p> <p>Erin Klein, who tracks US radio stations for the Broadcasting Board of Governors, was relieved to be returning to work, and keen to check on the status of the database she manages. &ldquo;I can't believe we have been gone so long. I'm very glad to be back,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>For many like Klein, the enjoyment of more than two weeks off work has been tinged with concern about the programs they operate and anxiety about whether and when they will be paid. &ldquo;I have occupied myself in other ways,&rdquo; said Klein. &ldquo;I have taken a free online course on writing strategic presentations, spent time with my family and done a bit of cooking.&rdquo;</p> <p>Asim Akbari, a lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he had first heard that he would be allowed back by watching the news about Tuesday's congressional deal. &ldquo;Almost the whole department has been out. I was surprised when I checked my email this morning how empty it was.&rdquo;</p> <p>Many federal workers have been explicitly banned even from monitoring work emails during the shutdown. &ldquo;We were paid for four days during the first week, but we were due our next pay next week, so the shutdown has ended just in time,\" Akbari said.</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden greeted federal employees as they came back to the Environmental Protection Agency building on Washington's 12th Street, where 168,000 workers had been laid off. &ldquo;No inspections on water and air and the Everglades,&rdquo; Biden told them in an impromptu address. &ldquo;These guys not only took a hit and weren&rsquo;t sure &ndash; I mean, the anxiety of knowing whether they&rsquo;d get paid. But now they&rsquo;re back, and they&rsquo;ve got all that work piled up, so they&rsquo;ve got a lot to do.&rdquo;</p> <p>Tourists to the nation&rsquo;s capital, deprived of some of the country's best-known sights, flocked to the reopened destinations, though not all were open. The National zoo and National Archives were both closed until Friday, and the National Gallery of Art was set to reopen on Saturday.</p> <p>But the monuments that line Washington's National Mall were bustling with tourists, as maintenance workers hastily tended to the overgrown grass &ndash; 6in long in places. Almost all of the sightseers said they had pre-booked flights they were unable to change; many had resigned themselves to a trip to Washington consisting of shopping and viewing buildings from the outside.</p> <p>Gene Hall, 82, one of 32 Korean war veterans from Missouri and Illinois, said his group had been told to brace themselves for the possibility they would only see one of two memorials &ndash; and only because the intense political pressure had forced the service to allow some veterans in. \"I think it was ridiculous,\" he said of the shutdown. \"I vote Republican but I am a moderate, and I think what has gone on has been political.\"</p> <p>Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Shen Ling, 29, a teacher from China, said she and her friends heard the news that the shutdown was over in Chicago airport, just as they were about to board their flight. \"We had prepared for the worst,\" she said.</p> <p>Another Chinese tourist, on the National Mall with his fiance&eacute;, said he had not followed the politics of the fiscal crisis closely. \"But this is what happens when you have two parties,\" he quipped. \"One party is better.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420286998|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|821ef18d8f980554da0f3711c69a309c74e4739e -->",

        "body":"<p>Republican rancour over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/republicans-disarray-congress-passes-debt-default-bill\">the budget deal</a> boiled over again on Thursday, after Senator John McCain attacked a last-minute amendment to spend $2.8bn on infrastructure work on the Ohio river, which connects the political backyards of party leaders in the Senate and the House.</p> <p>Widely suspected to be a classic case of political &ldquo;pork&rdquo;, designed to smooth the passage of the bill, the authority to carry out work to improve navigation on the river by replacing two locks and dams was tucked on to the end of bill that ended the government shutdown on Wednesday night.</p> <p>A major political beneficiary is likely to be the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who is facing a tough re-election battle in Kentucky, where the work will be carried out. But it will also improve navigation along the river, which passes within 20 miles of the Ohio congressional district belonging to the House speaker, John Boehner.</p> <p>Republican leaders distanced themselves from the amendment on Thursday, directing questions to the Senate energy and water subcommittee, which is chaired by Lamar Alexander, a Republican in the neighbouring state of Tennessee.</p> <p>The Democratic committee leader Diane Feinstein joined the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, in defending the much-needed infrastructure project as a &ldquo;good deal for taxpayers&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;It's a series of locks on a dam. If it isn't funded, it shuts down,&rdquo; said Feinstein. &ldquo;It's in the public good.&rdquo;</p> <p>Defenders of the Olmsted Locks and Dam project <a href=\"http://blogs.courier-journal.com/watchdogearth/2013/10/16/mitch-mcconnell-olmsted-dam-and-the-backstory-of-wha-call-the-kentucky-kickback/\">say the work is required to ease bottlenecks where the Ohio and Mississippi rivers meet</a>.&nbsp;But the surprise amendment to the budget bill attracted fire from McCain, who said it had been slipped in the at the last minute and was &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;They added money for a dam which I frankly had never even heard of and they couldn't have gotten through a regular legislative process,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/2748716562001/\">McCain said in an interview on Fox News</a>.</p> <p>McCain said the American people &ldquo;should be rolling their eyes&rdquo; at the whole process of passing government spending authority, saying &ldquo;it contributes to the cynicism that Americans have&rdquo; about the political process.</p> <p>The authorisation for the dam project was one of <a href=\"http://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr2775-senateamendment\">dozens of specific spending amendments</a> introduced in the Senate deal, ranging from a &ldquo;gratuity of $174,000 for the widow of Senator Lautenberg&rdquo; (Frank Lautenberg, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/03/frank-lautenberg-new-jersey-senator-dies\">the long-serving New Jersey senator who died in June</a>) to &ldquo;authority for activities to counter Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army&rdquo; in Uganda.&nbsp;A much smaller amount of funding for the dam project, $1.7bn,&nbsp;had been agreed during earlier legislation in the House.</p> <p>A spokesman for McConnell said the White House supported the project and that Senate appropriators had requested the project be included in the stopgap spending bill.</p> <p>Separately, McConnell insisted that Republicans would not repeat the tactic of forcing a government shutdown when current spending authority expires early next year.</p> <p>&ldquo;One of my favourite sayings is an old Kentucky saying, 'There&rsquo;s no education in the second kick of a mule',&rdquo; McConnell said, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/361533/mcconnells-exit-interview-robert-costa\">in an interview with the National Journal</a>. &ldquo;The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We&rsquo;re not going to do it.&rdquo;</p> <p>He also hinted that there may be more compromise to come between Republicans and the White House, in budget discussions over taxes and welfare payments.</p> <p>&ldquo;The price for entitlement reform, so far from the administration, has been taxes,&rdquo; said McConnell. &ldquo;There is some willingness to discuss trading entitlement spending reductions for discretionary spending relief. But, so far, there has been no real willingness on the part of the administration to do that. That&rsquo;s worth discussing, though.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420303323|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|9f9b848f8ec3b76ebb6ff7e658c8943eb6cd25e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US federal government gradually came back to life on Thursday after a 16-day shutdown and a bruising political battle, as the political recriminations from the crisis reverberated around Washington.</p> <p>Republican rancour over the budget deal boiled over with accusations that hardliners in the party had trashed their reputation and handed a gift to their political opponents. Democrats emerged from the crisis united and emboldened.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/17/obama-chastises-republicans-us-government-shutdown-video\">In remarks delivered at the White House</a>, President Barack Obama was scathing about the Republicans’ doomed bit to dismantle his healthcare reforms and undermine his authority. Visibly angry, he told them: &quot;You don't like a president? Go out and win an election.&quot;</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, highlighted the cost of the shutdown as estimated by Standard &amp; Poor’s and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/10/17/pelosi_lambastes_gop_temper_tantrum_120368.html\">blamed it on Republican</a>s, saying: &quot;Was their temper tantrum worth $24bn?&quot;</p> <p>There was also fury between Republicans when details emerged of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/john-mccain-republicans-ohio-river-pork\">a last-minute add-on to the bill that reopened the government and extended the federal borrowing limit</a>. The bill authorised&nbsp;$2.8bn on infrastructure work to the Ohio river in Kentucky, where Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell is facing a tough re-election battle. It will also improve navigation along the river, which passes within 20 miles of the Ohio congressional district represented by the House speaker, John Boehner.&nbsp;Senator John McCain, a former Republican presidential candidate, said the plan had been slipped in the at the last minute and was “disgraceful”.</p> <p>Wednesday night’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/republicans-disarray-congress-passes-debt-default-bill\">deal to end the crisis will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February</a>, setting the stage for a possible repeat of the showdown. Both sides also agreed to a formal budget conference, in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a2202aef-35ce-4e1c-8b92-b1b989b2b3d1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382024450956/National-Park-Service-Ran-008.jpg\" alt=\"National Park Service Rangers \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>National park service rangers walk back to their vehicle after visiting the Jefferson Memorial in Washington. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p>On Thursday, senior Republicans were divided about the wisdom of their high-risk strategy of forcing the shutdown and bringing the US close to defaulting on its debt. &quot;This was a terrible idea,&quot; McCain told CNN. He said it would not happen again when the next deadlines arrive, and added: &quot;I guarantee it.&quot;</p> <p>McConnell also said the party would not repeat the tactic.&nbsp;“One of my favorite sayings is an old Kentucky saying, 'There’s no education in the second kick of a mule',” he said,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/361533/mcconnells-exit-interview-robert-costa\">in an interview with the National Journal</a>. “The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We’re not going to do it.”</p> <p>He also hinted that there may be more compromise to come between Republicans and the White House, in forthcoming budget discussions over taxes and welfare payments.</p> <p>“The price for entitlement reform, so far from the administration, has been taxes,” added McConnell. “There is some willingness to discuss trading entitlement spending reductions for discretionary spending relief. But, so far, there has been no real willingness on the part of the administration to do that. That’s worth discussing, though.”</p> <h2>Stalled agenda</h2> <p>Hoping to jump start his own stalled agenda, Obama urged lawmakers to concentrate on three items in the coming weeks: a balanced plan to reduce long-term deficits, legislation to overhaul the immigration system and passage of a farm bill.&nbsp;This may prove wishful thinking, given the continued rancour and recriminations among Republicans.</p> <p>Obama's party, meanwhile, emerged from the three-week showdown in Congress united. All Democrats in Congress supported the legislation that passed on Wednesday night, to fund the government and raise the debt limit.&nbsp;Of the Republicans, 18 in the Senate and 144 in the House opposed the legislation, while 27 in the Senate and 87 in the House supported it. The fault line separated Tea Party adherents from the balance of the rank and file, and there were clear signs the split will be enduring.</p> <p>In Mississippi, where Republican senator Thad Cochran has not yet announced if he will seek a new term in 2014, the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed a potential rival, the Republican state senator Chris McDaniel.&nbsp;The group is among several that have played an increasingly active role in Republican primary elections in recent years, often supporting Tea Party-aligned challengers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another group, Heritage Action, played an influential role in the two-week political showdown. In the days leading to the impasse, it was a strong backer of the campaign to demand that &quot;Obamacare&quot; be defunded in exchange for Republican approval of funding for the government.&nbsp;On Tuesday, as it was hosting a fundraiser at a high-end golf resort in Bandon, Oregon, the group weighed in to oppose legislation that Boehner put together in hope of retaining influence in final negotiations.</p> <p>Americans for Limited Government, meanwhile, attacked Representative Scott Rigell, of Virginia, who voted for the legislation that reopened the government and raised the debt limit. Noting that the measure had not defunded the healthcare law, the group said the congressman &quot;owns Obamacare just as much as if it had been a vote to adopt it in the first place&quot;.</p> <p>In a statement issued in connection with his vote, Rigell said he was voting for the bill &quot;given the lack of a viable alternative at this moment&quot;.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-350d407c-77d0-4f4c-b0f6-79fae083715c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382033309532/2eb86eca-96e7-4d63-afde-62d634b1324d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Joe Biden greets workers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Vice-president Joe Biden greets Environmental Protection Agency workers as they return to work after 16 days of a government shutdown.

I'm very glad to be back,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Asim Akbari, a lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he had first heard that he would be allowed back when watching the news about the congressional deal. &quot;Almost the whole department has been out,” he said. “I was surprised when I checked my email this morning how empty it was.&quot;</p> <p>Many federal workers have been explicitly banned even from monitoring work emails during the shutdown. &quot;We were paid for four days during the first week, but we were due our next pay next week, so the shutdown has ended just in time,&quot; Akbari said.</p> <p>The vice-president, Joe Biden, greeted workers returning to the Environmental Protection Agency with hugs, handshakes and muffins.&nbsp;&quot;There was no economic rationale for any of this,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope everybody walks away with a lesson that this is unnecessary and I hope we can regain the trust of the American people.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-62d5a0ac-c6bc-4958-9ca5-7782650231ba\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382030896100/49a806d3-e605-4293-8153-3502ff3dd328-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Visitors walk through the Korean War Veterans Memorial after it was reopened to the public in Washington.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Visitors walk through the Korean War Veterans Memorial after it was reopened to the public in Washington.
