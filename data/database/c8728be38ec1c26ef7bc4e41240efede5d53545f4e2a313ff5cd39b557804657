Unless you want to sound like an ignorant peasant.</p><p><strong>It's rare that I'm given the choice. So what is an Altrincham?</strong> It's a market town in the north of England. Historically part of Cheshire, it is now one of Greater Manchester's leafiest southern suburbs.</p><p><strong>In the sense that there are a great many trees, bushes, shrubs etc? </strong>Partly in that sense. But mainly in the sense that Altrincham is rather posh. \"The immediate population is made up of an exceptionally high number of professionals, captains of industry and homeowners,\" <a href=\"http://www.altrincham.org.uk/about/area-information.aspx\" title=\"\">says the town's website</a>. \"The prosperity of the town and its inhabitants are such as to make it almost unparalleled outside the southeast.\"</p><p><strong>So they keep their ferrets down their butlers' trousers?</strong> Yes. Or in little Mulberry ferret bags. They also pay £2,227 per square metre for their houses, according to the Halifax, <a href=\"http://www.primeresi.com/how-much-does-a-square-metre-of-property-cost-across-the-uk/38908/\" title=\"\">which is the highest price of anywhere in Britain</a> apart from the south of England.</p><p><strong>By eck!</strong> That compares with £2,214 in Edinburgh, £2,189 in Solihull or £2,144 in Leamington Spa.</p><p><strong>What is it that makes Altrincham so popular?</strong> Oh, you know. It's a mixture of things. Posh shops, nice houses, good schools, bit of countryside. Close to the airport, but not too close. Plus it's only a short distance from Manchester, and various other places where there are football teams …</p><p><strong>Footballers! I knew it! So footballers live there?</strong> Some do, yes. It's part of the fancy bit of Cheshire that they favour.</p><p><strong>Well, with all that going for it, the place must be about as expensive as London.</strong> Let's not get carried away. The average price per square metre in Altrincham is still less than half the cost of buying a house in Hackney (£5,418), Southwark (£5,111) or Lambeth (£5,108). Those three boroughs contain some of London's most squalid bits of inner city, yet they are still among the 10 most expensive places in the country.</p><p><strong>Oh.</strong> And in Kensington and Chelsea, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/29/kensington-london-tops-uk-house-prices\" title=\"\">the most expensive place of all</a>, it's £10,854.</p><p><strong>Is it just me, or do you think there might be a bit of a gap opening up between the southeast and the rest of the country?</strong> That has been noticed.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> Where's there's muck there's brass.</p><p><strong>Don't say:</strong> And where there's footballers there's muck.</p>","headline":"Altrincham: the highest house prices outside the south-east","trailText":"<p>What makes the Greater Manchester suburb such a popular location?

Is it a dirty book?</strong>  Almost. After is a piece of erotic fan fiction, <a href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/story/5095707-after\" title=\"\">published in instalments online</a>, about Harry Styles from One Direction.</p><p><strong>Oh good, I've got a free afternoon. How many instalments are there?</strong> Currently, there are 294.</p><p><strong>Wow. Just bulletpoint the story for me, will you? </strong>Well, Harry meets a girl named Tessa. In chapter 22, Tessa goes to the Vancouver Mall. In chapter 75, Harry describes himself as \"a sexy rude naked guy\". In the next chapter they almost have sex but end up watching a Channing Tatum film on a laptop instead. I stopped reading after that, but presumably the rest is just as gripping.</p><p><strong>Who on earth wrote this stuff? </strong>A 25-year-old Texan called Anna Todd. She's a big One Direction fan <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/harry-styles-fan-fiction-author-anna-todd-secures-six-figure-deal-publishing-after-1593952\" title=\"\">and the proud owner of a new six-figure book deal</a>.</p><p><strong>There's going to be a book? </strong>And a film, apparently. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2662647/One-Direction-fan-lands-SIX-FIGURE-book-deal-online-fantasy-fiction-boy-band-attracts-800million-reads.html\" title=\"\">And Todd had also just launched a new line of After-inspired jewellery.</a> People can't get enough of dirty Harry.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Fan fiction is big business. The chapters of After have been read a combined total of  800m times. And don't forget that 50 Shades of Grey started life as a piece of Twilight fan fiction, and as we know, everyone loves 50 Shades of Grey.</p><p><strong>So this is how you get rich? Write in a stream of consciousness style about celebrities having sex with an impressionable young woman and wait for the money to roll in?</strong> It depends on which celebrities you pick. Stories about Harry Styles and Robert Pattinson, for example, will do well. Stories about <a href=\"http://dinostories.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/dinostory-number-five/\" title=\"\">Philip Schofield having sex with a dinosaur</a>, possibly less so.</p><p><strong>How does Harry Styles feel about this?</strong> There's a strong possibilty that he's not too happy about it. When the book comes out, the Harry character will have a different name. But don't worry. He'll still be a cheeky brown-haired Brit. Just a different one.</p><p><strong>Like Bradley Walsh, for instance?</strong> Sure, why not.</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"It could have been worse. It could have been about Justin Bieber.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"Someone get Hollywood on the line. We're making an erotic Justin Bieber fan fiction movie.\"</p>","headline":"How one fan's erotic fantasies about Harry Styles became a publishing goldmine","trailText":"One Direction fan Anna Todd's

Is that why we're talking about her? Is it a novel or a memoir? I love her. I hope it's a memoir. Or a novel. I really don't mind. She's amazing.  </strong>She's a murderer.</p><p><strong>What?</strong> She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wintersonworld/statuses/478111920919040000\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> \"Rabbit ate my parsley. I am eating the rabbit,\" along with a picture of the disembowelled, semi-skinned, wholly dead rabbit in question lying on her kitchen counter.</p><p><strong>Was she the one who actually killed it?</strong> Yup. Caught it in a humane trap next to the parsley bed, then did the necessary. Or unnecessary, according to many on Twitter.</p><p><strong>Why – do they only follow vegetarians?</strong> That's what Winterson said. She also tweeted a picture of her cat eating the entrails and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wintersonworld/status/478134731855659008\" title=\"\">noted that the remaining skin,</a> \"which includes the head makes a great glove puppet\".</p><p><strong>That seems characteristically provocative. Did it provoke?</strong> It did indeed. Some followers were not impressed.</p><p><strong>Highlights, please.</strong> \"Before I unfollow you, you make me sick. I will never again read a word you write. Rest in peace, little rabbit.\" (Although the tweet used more inventive punctuation).</p><p><strong>Harsh.</strong> Another said: \"How you and your cat have disappointed me! At least the cat has an excuse.\"</p><p><strong>I take it Winterson fought back?</strong> She is not known for walking away from a good fight,  certainly, and nor did she. She pointed out the hypocrisy of eating farmed supermarket meat then objecting to a picture of something killed by hand that involved \"no waste no packaging no processing no food miles\". An unrepentant tone was maintained throughout.</p><p><strong>She should have said: \"My commitment to  organic and sustainable living is Written on the Body of this animal.\" </strong>Because she wrote a book called Written on the Body?</p><p><strong>Yes! Or: \"Oranges are Not the Only Fruit that I could braise this rabbit with.\"</strong> Because … yes, I see.</p><p><strong>Or \"This has become a bit of a Tanglewreck, like my first children's book was called, and my dinner is ready so I'm off.\"</strong> That's enough.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"Come round for ethically-and-environmentally-sound-comma-irreproachably-principled dinner.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"Poor ickle flopsy bunnikins gone all deaded by the bad lady!

Immediately, Fifa's new technology signalled a goal to the referee, and he awarded one.</p><p><strong>Gosh, how terribly exciting for people who give a toss. </strong>Yes, and Pearce certainly is one. So when an animation then appeared on the stadium screens showing the ball not crossing the line, with the words \"NO GOAL\", he went fully crackers, shouting: \"It signals no goal! No goal has gone up on the screen!\"</p><p><strong>Except? </strong>Except what everybody had just watched was the first contact between the ball and the post. The screens immediately went on to show the second contact with the goalkeeper, confirming that it had indeed marginally crossed line. The word \"GOAL\" then appeared.</p><p><strong>Presumably this calmed Pearce down? </strong>Rather the opposite. \"Oh goodness me!\" he shouted. \"They've changed their minds now! Does goal-line technology work or doesn't it?\"</p><p><strong>I'm getting a bit confused myself. </strong>Basically, the answer is yes. After many years' of waiting, goal-line technology has finally been introduced, and was needed in a big match, and has proved that it works perfectly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/jun/15/world-cup-2014-world-cup-football\" title=\"\">confusing nobody except Jonathan Pearce</a>, who kept countering for the rest of the match. His co-commentator Martin Keown tried explaining what had happened, but to no avail.</p><p><strong>I see. So is Pearce normally a halfwit? </strong>No, but he gets shouty when roused. I think he was just terribly excited because he thought he had another bit of Fifa incompetence on his hands. Luckily for him, he's not the only commentator making a prat of himself at this World Cup.</p><p><strong>Who are the others? </strong>Well, despite being quite informative, Phil Neville <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/phil-neville-commentary-world-cup-bbc-twitter-england-italy\" title=\"\">was roundly mocked</a> for sounding (and perhaps being) utterly bored throughout the England match. Keown himself spent half the Honduras game admiring all the fouls, and even described one French player as \"more of a man\" than another. Andy Townsend continues trying to pass off \"I've seen em given, Clive\" as worldly wisdom whenever someone claims a penalty …</p><p><strong>Are there machines that could replace commentators yet? </strong>Some say Phil Neville is getting close.</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"G-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-l …\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"… disallowed.\"</p>","headline":"Jonathan Pearce: not the only World Cup commentator looking foolish","trailText":"<p>Fifa's goal-line technology used in the France and Honduras game confused no one except the BBC's Jonathan Pearce.

It's also a portmanteau of Merkel and Hollande, the old German chancellor and the new French president.</p><p><strong>So it's the new Merkozy? </strong>Exactly. But much less cosy than the old one.</p><p><strong>Because? </strong>Because unlike Mer and Kozy, Mer and&nbsp;De grew up on very different sides of the political tracks. She's an austerity-loving conservative and he's a stimulus-seeking socialist&nbsp;elected on the back of a pledge to renegotiate the eurozone's fiscal pact.</p><p><strong>Is that a problem? </strong>It is.</p><p><strong>Why so? </strong>Because Merkel insists that the fiscal pact is simply \"not up for debate\". She claims if they open up negotiations on the agreement, Greece will demand to renegotiate the troika package, other countries will follow suit and then everything that's ever been agreed in Europe since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia will have to be thrown out and rewritten from scratch. At which point every town, village and remote clifftop lighthouse in Europe will be simultaneously rendered worthless, ransacked by&nbsp;looters and set on fire.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a pretty intractable position she's got there. </strong>Nah, it's more flexible than it looks.</p><p><strong>Really? </strong>Yup. Hollande's off to see Merkel tomorrow afternoon as soon as he's been sworn in and experts reckon the pair should agree a compromise in no time.</p><p><strong>How exactly? </strong>By putting the fiscal pact to one side and putting together a \"growth pact\" to run alongside it, thus allowing both to walk away from discussions with their heads held high. The key question is whether the growth pact will be – as many supporters of Hollande are hoping – built around a fiscal stimulus funded by&nbsp;further borrowing, or – as Merkel's government is insisting it will have to be – a series of measures to&nbsp;improve European competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Hold on. Isn't \"measures to improve European competitiveness\" just another term for austerity? </strong>Pretty much, yep. That'd be why the French are saying \"Merde!\".</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"Merkel + Hollande = Merde ...\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"... so does Monti + Cameron = Moron?\"</p>","headline":"Pass notes, No 3,174: Merde","trailText":"<p>The only word for an uneasy compromise, soon to be found right at the very heart of the
