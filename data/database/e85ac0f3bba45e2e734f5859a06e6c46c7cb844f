        "headline":"The NBA is more fun with Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook",
        "body":"<p>The first week of the NBA season is always a bit tricky to write about, it's too early to say anything but too much has actually happened to just say nothing. So, as always, every bit of information imparted below should be read with the caveat \"it's early though\". If the Philadelphia 76ers are still fighting for the number one seed in the Eastern Conference come springtime, for instance, expect most sports prognosticators <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcWTIWYDMQ\">to pull a Werner Herzog and eat their own shoes</a>. With that in mind, here's some of the things we've learned in the first week of real NBA action in the 2013-14 season.</p><h2>Chris Paul will be in the MVP discussions this year</h2><p>These last few years have not been a great time to be a MVP candidate in the NBA. First of all, there's that whole LeBron James thing, when you're playing around the same time as someone who may end up being the best of all time, you pretty much have to wait around until he gets injured or voters are sick of handing him hardware to get your chance. Then, of course, there's the fact that there's that Kevin Durant guy, who is almost as talented as LeBron and a few years younger to boot. The field gets even more crowded when you factor in the return of Derrick Rose, the Chicago point guard who was the last guy not named LeBron to win it. Plus old-timers like Tim Duncan from the San Antonio Spurs and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers could always have a MVP-caliber season remaining to sway the often-times sentimental voters.</p><p>So, it's been a bit tricky time to be Chris Paul, despite the fact that he could very well be the best point guard in the league. After biding his time with the New Orleans Hornets, mostly ignored by the media, Paul forced a trade to Los Angeles, landing with the Clippers after NBA Commissioner David Stern nixed a trade that would have made him the next Lakers legend. While he single-handedly turned the Clippers into a force in the Western Conference <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyoL5BwqDOs\">- while teaming up with forward Blake Griffin for highlight-reel plays</a> - the Clippers weren't able to get past the first round of the playoffs and Paul has yet to find his name even on the the shortlist of MVP hopefuls.</p><p>In the NBA, just like in most sports, individual awards are often dependent on how well one's team does, which might be a big reason why Chris Paul encouraged the Clippers to make a change at head coach during the offseason. (Of course, the main reason that Paul used his influence to get rid of Vinny del Negro probably had something to do with the fact that del Negro kinda sucked.) With former Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers in the fold, and the Lakers struggling to find an identity with Kobe Bryant out with an Achilles injury, the Clippers finally have the big stage to themselves, and Paul has been making the most out of it.</p><p>The Clippers have started out their season 3-1, with the biggest reason for their success being Paul. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/11/5/5068250/chris-paul-la-clippers-pace-hook\">Paul has been averaging 26 points and 13 assists per game, while shooting 51 percent from the floor</a>. While past performance still has Durant as the most likely MVP candidate to come out of the Western Conference, Paul will be in the conversation.</p><h2>Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook have returned</h2><p>Talk about two different timetables, Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook both suffered season-ending injuries early on during their teams' playoff runs so, in that sense, it's not a surprise that they made their regular season returns within days of each other. Well, except for the fact that the Chicago Bulls lost point guard Derrick Rose early in the 2012 NBA Playoffs while the Oklahoma City Thunder lost Russell Westbrook to a meniscus tear in their first round playoffs run against the Houston Rockets in 2013.</p><p>When Derrick Rose injured his ACL in the closing moments of the Chicago Bulls' first playoff game of 2012, it threw the entire Eastern Conference into chaos. Rose was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2011 and was supposed to be the closest thing that the Miami Heat's LeBron James had to a rival in the East. Instead, the Miami Heat's 2012 run to the NBA Finals went through an aging Boston Celtics team rather than the young, tough Chicago Bulls. As Rose took his time recovering from his injury in 2012, a decision which he was heavily criticized for, the superstar-free Indiana Pacers emerged as the team most likely to stop the superstar-centric Miami Heat.</p><p>When Rose finally returned to the Chicago Bulls during this preseason, there was a lot of hype that the Bulls would finally emerge as the clear second-best team in the Eastern Conference. After all, the Bulls managed to remain dangerous without Rose, center Joakim Noah emerged as a team leader, Jimmy Butler had a breakout season in Rose's absence and head coach Tom Thibodeau's squad took on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">a very physical defensive identity that gave the Miami Heat fits at times</a>.</p><p><em></em><br />Unfortunately for Chicago, waiting around until Rose felt completely healthy hasn't paid off early on in the 2013-14 season as they've won just one game since Rose's return. <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/chi-derrick-rose-chicago-bulls-turnovers-20131103,0,5091853.story\">Rose still looks rusty</a>, and the only good thing about how the Bulls have been playing recently is that it has settled fan fears that Rose-at-75% could have given the Chicago a shot at beating the Heat last postseason. A completely recovered Derrick Rose could very well make the Chicago Bulls one of the most dangerous teams in the Eastern Conference, but it's not clear that we've seen a completely recovered Derrick Rose yet.</p><p>When the Oklahoma City Thunder lost Russell Westbrook to a meniscus injury halfway through their opening round playoff series against the Houston Rockets, they essentially lost any chance they had to make it to back-to-back NBA Finals. Without Westbrook, it was up to Kevin Durant to account for nearly all of his team's offensive output. While the immensely talented Durant was able to keep the Thunder in games, he was clearly gassed by the time the fourth quarter came around. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9280528/nba-playoffs-2013-memphis-grizzlies-finished-oklahoma-city-thunder-game-5\">The Memphis Grizzlies were able to dispatch the Thunder in the second round of the playoffs</a>, clearing the space that allowed the San Antonio Spurs to make their surprise return to the Finals.</p><p>Although it seemed like once again Kevin Durant would have to keep his team afloat at the start of the 2013-14 season, Westbrook's timetable for return kept getting pushed up. Instead of missing the first few weeks of the season, as everyone expected, Westbrook made his return <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2013-11-03/russell-westbrook-return-okc-thunder-suns-result-score-stats-knee-injury-torn-meniscus-kevin-durant-reggie-jackson-jeremy-lamb\">in Sunday's win over the Phoenix Suns</a>. The worry that Thunder fans have about Westbrook is the exact opposite that Bulls fans had about Rose: is Westbrook just trying to push his way back to full strength too soon? To those of us neutral observers, we can only hope that Rose and Westbrook's returns stick, because the NBA is a lot more fun with the two of them in uniform than it is with them in suits on the sidelines.</p><h2>Philadelphia 76ers can't even tank right</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/nba-2013-14-season-preview\">In the Guardian's NBA preview</a> we compared the Philadelphia 76ers season with the Mel Brooks film <em>The Producers</em>. If the goal of the Broadway producers in that movie was to lose money, the goal of this Philadelphia 76rs season was to lose games, as many as possible in order to set them up as this is the best chance to pick early in this year's NBA Draft. Call it \"Springtime for Wiggins\". It's - we can't emphasize this enough - very early in the season but instead the 76ers have started out with a 3-1 record, putting them in second place in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Just like in <em>The Producers</em>, the Philadelphia 76ers' plan seems to have hit a snag, an unexpected run-in with accidental success. In the 76ers case that snag is named Michael Carter-Williams. With the Draft day media attention focused more on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/28/nba-draft-number-one-anthony-bennett\">the 76ers trading away Jrue Holiday in order to pick up Nerlens Noel</a>, the first clear sign that the franchise was tanking, there wasn't a lot of attention paid when the team selected Syracuse star Carter-Williams with the 11th overall pick.</p><p>Instead, Michael Carter-Williams has taken advantage of playing his rookie season for a rebuilding team containing very few established players, averaging 21 points, nine assists, five rebounds and four steals a game. That was enough for <a href=\"http://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2013/11/michael_carter-williams_named.html\">Carter-Williams to be named Eastern Conference Player of the Week</a>, and gain an early lead NBA Rookie of the Year talk. Of course, if he keeps this up, expect Philadelphia management to sideline him with a mysterious injury before he completely ruins their season.</p><h2>The New York Knicks are struggling</h2><p>What's more embarrassing, to succeed when you're attempting to tank or to fail when you're expected to take advantage of a weaker conference? While the Philadelphia 76ers keep unexpectedly winning, the Knicks are struggling with a 1-3 record, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-131105/daily-dime\">including a home loss to the still-woeful Charlotte Bobcats</a>.</p><p>The news could be getting worse for New York depending on the latest information regarding center Tyson Chandler. Chandler is the key to New York's defense, heck during certain stretches of time he has been the entirety of New York's defense. If Chandler remains sidelined for too long with a right knee injury he suffered in Tuesday night's game, then it seems unlikely that things will get much better in the early-going for New York. <a href=\"http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2013/11/06/chandler-injury-a-big-scare-for-knicks/\">As head coach Mike Woodson put it succinctly</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Our defense … It stinks right now\".</p></blockquote><p>If Tyson Chandler is out for any extended time, this might be the best chance for their new-look rivals in the Brooklyn Nets to make New York their town. If Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov really wants to test the loyalty of the Knicks faithful, this writer strongly recommends that he starts floating rumors that Isiah Thomas will be returning as Knicks' GM. Knicks fans have long since proven they can handle losing, but that? <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-gm-mills-forget-isiah-article-1.1483383\">That might be too much</a>.</p><h2>Other things we've learned this week</h2><p>• If Philadelphia seems to be having problems figuring out this whole tanking business, they can look to the Boston Celtics for some inspiration. Not only has Boston started out 0-4 under new head coach Brad Stevens, that stretch includes <a href=\"http://www.csnne.com/boston-celtics/cs-blow-22-point-lead-lose-home-opener-bucks?p=ya5nbcs&amp;ocid=yahoo\">letting a 22 point lead over the Milwaukee Bucks slip away in their home opener</a>.</p><p>• Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers remain the last of the unbeaten teams. No wonder David Stern was determined to retire mid-way through this season, he's just one LeBron James injury away from trying to explain to advertisers why their premiere franchise is located in Indianapolis. That's way more crowd shots of Andrew Luck for a national broadcast to have to lean on.</p><p>• Meanwhile surprise number one 2013 NBA Draft pick Anthony Bennett of the Cleveland Cavaliers has yet to actually <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24191878/four-games-in-and-cavs-anthony-bennett-yet-to-make-first-basket\">do that thing where you throw a ball up during an actual game and it lands in a hoop for points</a>, as his scoring has been limited to two free throws and zero field goals. At this rate, the Cavs might as well have signed out-for-the-season Nerlens Noel.</p><p>• The New Orleans Hornets are now officially the New Orleans Pelicans and to celebrate they introduced a brand new, <del>family-friendly mascot</del> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-new-orleans-pelicans-reveal-mascot-and-its-very-scary-20131031,0,5023236.story#axzz2js3Z6fN9\">Oh my god what the fresh hell is this?</a></p><p>• It's hit the point where the only truly funny segments on \"Saturday Night Live\" are their sports-related parodies, <a href=\"http://www.sportsgrid.com/video/snl-jay-pharoahs-shaq-impersonation/\">so it's nice to see Jay Pharoah unleash a ridiculous but amusing impression of Shaquille O'Neal</a> at the start of the NBA season. Of course, Pharoah's Shaq is far more insightful and eloquent than the real one, but they still have time to fine-tune it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421790438|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|cb0c4ddbc7026e1af6ed9436423117cd023b57bd -->",

        "body":"<p>Alastair Cook has been on the receiving end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/shane-warnes-criticism-may-have-been-fair-admits-alastair-cook\" title=\"\">Shane Warne's criticisms</a> since England started beating Australia last summer. In response three options were open to the England captain: to counterattack vigorously; to smile quietly like a choirboy, ignore the barbs and occasionally point at the scorecards; or – and this is the clever one – to agree with him, a reaction that can disconcert antipodean antagonists at a stroke.</p><p>In Australia, Cook has shrewdly opted for a combination of the last two. He politely agrees with Warne that he has much to learn about captaincy – \"I could be more imaginative,\" he says. More specifically, after Warne advocated that his old Hampshire mate Michael Carberry should open the batting because Joe Root might be \"crucified\" at the top of the order, Cook has proceeded to follow that course.</p><p>The probability is that the England hierarchy was not swayed by Warne's headline-grabbing observations, delivered at a Sky TV promotion, but the elevation of Carberry has two possible happy consequences.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/06/michael-carberry-states-ashes-case-with-unbeaten-153\" title=\"\">England's creakiness at the top of the order might be resolved</a> and it might keep Warne quiet for a while. Now Warne, Darren Lehmann's mate and Michael Clarke's best friend, might be seen as the tourists' unwitting strategist rather than their constant tormentor. No doubt England's analyst is on red alert in case the best captain Australia never had delivers a few more gems.</p><p>The promotion of Carberry reminds us that England are not as intransigent as they are often made out to be. This is not the first time they have surprised us. Leaving aside the selection of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/21/australia-shane-watson-england-woakes-kerrigan\" title=\"\">Simon Kerrigan and Chris Woakes at The Oval</a> in their last Test match, think back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/14/england-joe-root-dream-india\" title=\"\">Nagpur in December 2012</a>, where they first selected Joe Root. This was not expected, yet it was a triumph for rational thinking.</p><p>England had won two Tests against India quite brilliantly yet Cook and his advisers decided to change a winning combination. They ditched Samit Patel – they decided they did not need his bowling – and opted for Root, who hit a timely, time-consuming 73 in the middle order. It seems an obvious move now; it didn't then.</p><p>Now the probability is that Root, after opening throughout the recent Ashes series, will resume as a middle-order batsman. Carberry has had a dream start to his tour and is surely favourite to partner Cook in Brisbane.</p><p>There are caveats about Carberry's success – the pitches have been very flat, the bowling modest and the atmosphere far removed from what is anticipated at a steamy Gabba in a fortnight's time – but they are not sufficient for England to change course.</p><p>It is easy to be tempted by the idea of Root, who has opened the batting for the bulk of his first-class career, being stationed at six. If everything goes to plan he can be around to deal with the second new ball after Carberry and co have dealt with the first one. Smiles all round, except for Root's Yorkshire colleague, Jonny Bairstow.</p><p>Bairstow is fast becoming the fall guy in the England camp. Upon boarding the plane at Heathrow he might have been forgiven for thinking that he was England's likeliest No6 while Root continued as an opening batsman.</p><p>Now it seems as if Bairstow is likely to resume his Test career only if Matt Prior damages a finger on the morning of the match. In Hobart, he has to trot off to the nets again with Bruce French (England's wicketkeeping coach) while another county colleague, Gary Ballance, has been given another chance after his first-ball duck in Perth.</p><p>This may be construed as a compassionate selection – though not necessarily by Bairstow. And maybe Warne, a godsend to the media during the phoney-war phase of the tour, will rail that the omission of Bairstow, a firebrand of a batsman, is another example of England's negativity. In which case it seems Cook might not agree with him this time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421807939|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|865e256ab4635cb12c5be9f31dd4fa5888d70830 -->",

There are conflicting reports concerning El Macca in the opener at Chepstow. The jockey's mount is forecast to go off favourite and though connections reportedly believe he is not high-class material he may be good enough in an ordinary race.</p><p></p><p>He is not the sort of favourite I would be backing and <strong>Brave Buck (3.15)</strong>, market leader in the handicap hurdle later on the card, is much more to my liking. The selection looks to have excellent prospects having showed much-imporved form to win last week and with the form already boosted.</p><p></p><p>Much the same argument can be made for <strong>Forest Walker (1.20) </strong>at Warwick.

        "headline":"Whatever Shane Warne says, the Ashes sledgers need to raise their game",
        "body":"<p>Given how studiedly manscaped he is these days, it wouldn't be the most enormous stretch if trash-talking dandy Shane Warne simply swept into the Ashes commentary box on the first day of the series, adjusted his monocle, and declared that to be tired of sledging is to be tired of cricket.</p><p>But is it? The veneration of the practice continues unabated in some quarters, yet with each Ashes series I find the easily amused glee in this aspect of proceedings slightly more tedious than I did the last time around. A ball of the series has yet to be bowled, but already the keepers of the annals are celebrating new entries, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/ashes-alastair-cook-shane-warne-england\" title=\"\">Warne's digs at Alastair Cook</a> grabbing a wearingly predictable number of headlines, before being parried by no less Wildean a figure than Will Carling. \"Bloody hell even their sledging is now shite!!!\" he sledged.</p><p>Once the action proper starts, and snippets of the on-pitch repartee filter out, many will celebrate whatever the latest variants are concerning a player's BMI and the sexual appetite of his spouse. Lest we forget, this is an art form which, with very few exceptions, can be boiled down to the endless rehashing of part or all of the following: You're shit, you're fat, and I've shagged your wife. Who's a shit.</p><p>Naturally, there are rare occasions when only calling someone a fat expletive will do, and a cheap laugh can be a genuine hoot, if it is deployed rarely enough to be a surprise – the retaliatory equivalent of Indiana Jones being confronted by the master swordsman and simply pulling out his pistol and shooting him. Used anything other than very sparingly indeed, however, it's a bore. Or, as the nursery disciplinary code used to run: first time funny, second time silly, third time smack.</p><p>Strip away the befuddling nostalgia around the celebrated examples of sledging down the years, and they have mostly dated terribly. The moments of genuine wit are so few and far between as to almost conform to the infinite-monkeys-on-infinite-typewriters principle. The moments of insight are arguably even fewer, which is perhaps why other sports have failed to adopt what is so often fabled as a match-winning form of verbal combat. Tennis stars, for instance, have yet to serve up their aces with a chaser of what they imagine to be the equivalent of a cheeky Bruce Willis one-liner.</p><p>Yet apparently on the basis that WG Grace was a bit lippy – albeit in a considerably more mannerly fashion – sledging continues to be referred to as \"a noble tradition\". Traditions are always unthinkingly noble, aren't they? In fact, \"noble traditions\" are a bit like \"billionaire philanthropists\" – you can't seem to have one half of the epithet without the other. Except, of course, you can.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one tells the self-styled grand masters, which is possibly why some articles on the noble tradition still feel able to speak admiringly of an ancient exchange between Beefy Botham and Rod Marsh. \"How's your wife and my kids?\" inquired Marsh, as you may recall. \"The wife's fine,\" retorted Botham, \"the kids are retarded.\" (Hey – he does a lot for charity, innit.)</p><p>Perhaps the only other place where the bar of wit is set so low is Westminster. There, Dennis Skinner can deliver some dead-on-arrival non-zinger, only for at least half the House to threaten to do themselves a mischief, so hysterical is their mirth. A few months ago the prime minister could not suppress his self-admiring laughter as he honked the following at the Labour front benches: \"I know I've been the one on holiday in Ibiza – but they've been the ones taking policy-altering substances!\" What can you say? Anywhere normal, this clunkfest would have been met with either withering silence or a pitying groan. In Westminster, it was received so rapturously it practically broke the laughter track.</p><p>This tends to be the way in all hermetically sealed worlds, particularly those whose defining characteristic is impregnable self-regard. Outside of the Premier League, for instance, what is always glorified as \"mind games\" could be simply classified as bad manners or being babyish. But within the bubble, where all critical faculties are apparently suspended, it is routinely regarded as game theorising on a par with the stratagems deployed by either side in the most mutually paranoid days of the cold war. And so with cricket sledging, where – within the Center Parcs of on-pitch idiocy – someone offering a variant on someone's wife's post-coital generosity with the biscuits is regarded as having out-Twained Twain.</p><p>Study the collected works of sledging, and it becomes clear that the bread and butter of the 21st century form is largely artless, low-level abuse delivered by people who think swearing is always funny. Which isn't to say swearing can't be hilarious – if it is done well. Done badly, though, it is not a substitute for wit, but another lame gag whose reliance on a naughty word merely foregrounds its failure in all other aspects.</p><p>As for whether it could be done better, one can but dream. Given this is the era of technical innovations and scripted so-called reality shows, I implore the International Cricket Council to embrace modernity and consider hiring The Thick of It's brilliant&nbsp;swearing consultant, Ian Martin. In an ideal world, he'd write the sledging for an entire Ashes series – but under this sort of time pressure, I'd settle for him being flown out to Australia without delay, to deliver a&nbsp;crash course to both sides in raising their game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421788468|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|f24f53781b21aaddee3a0f4c9d29c332483628af -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry says Shane Warne influence is behind England century",
        "body":"<p>Shane Warne would have loved it. Sitting at a table in the gym that serves as the press conference area at the work-in-progress that is the Blundstone Arena, Michael Carberry sang his praises as \"basically the reason why I actually got a chance to play Test cricket\" – and at the back of the room, Joe Root, the man who had been dropped down the order by England to make way for Carberry at the top, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/sport/blog/2013/nov/06/shane-warne-sledging-ashes\" title=\"\">as Warne had helpfully suggested</a>, had completed a cycling session with Matt Prior, so had to listen to every word.</p><p>Carberry had spent six blissful hours at the crease with Alastair Cook, the man who seems highly likely to be both his opening partner and captain in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in a fortnight. They became the first England pair to bat through a completed day since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998, and the first England openers to put on 300 in any fixture since <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/22322.html\" title=\"\">Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook's 359</a> in South Africa in December 1948.</p><p>Hard to believe that only a week ago Carberry was widely expected to have a long and frustrating tour, having been brought to Australia purely as cover for the opening pair of Cook and Root; and that last winter he was working as an electrician in Southampton, with reason to believe that at the age of 32, the single Test cap he won in Bangladesh in 2010 would be his last.</p><p>Two years before that, he was denied a trip to Australia, as a member of the England Performance Programme who shadowed the 2010-11 Ashes squad, after blood clots were found on his lungs. \"It's obviously been well-documented that I have had some tough times personally off the field,\" he said with considerable understatement after potentially the most significant and timely innings of a long and character-building career.</p><p>\"By the grace of God, I'm here to enjoy what I'm doing now. When things like that happen, it gives you perspective on your cricket. It made me probably relax more, and try to enjoy the game for what it is – rather than, as young players do, put pressure on yourself to get where you want to get to.\"</p><p>So even now, he insisted, \"I'm trying not to look too far ahead. I'll worry about the Gabba when I get there.\"</p><p>But there was no sheepishness about his tribute to Warne, even with Root in his eyeline. \"I think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/06/england-joe-root-michael-carberry\" title=\"\">Shane Warne</a> is basically the reason why I actually got a chance to play Test cricket,\" added Carberry, who had underachieved in two seasons with Surrey and three with Kent before joining Warne at Hampshire.</p><p>\"I was a young guy, a little bit lost in county cricket. I came to Hampshire – and from day one, he made me feel very much at home and gave me the backing every young player needs. He allowed me to play a brand of cricket I wanted to play. I think he was very influential in terms of me doing what I've done, then getting the chance to play for England a few years on.\"</p><p>The influence has not ended there. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/06/michael-carberry-test-england-bangladesh\" title=\"\">Whenever I've caught up with Shane</a>, he's always had very kind things to say about my game. He's someone I still keep in contact with, even though he might be overseas. He's always been a great friend to me.\"</p><p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p><p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/28/england-new-zealand-second-test\" title=\"\">second Test against New Zealand in May</a>, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls – of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day – efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p><p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p><p>The selection of Australia's A team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers – Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p><p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half-century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p><p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p><p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p><p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p><p>Chris Tremlett was the other eye-catching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421788334|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|49c53d6eb7a63442d7c8e5d92f8a8b11417d02f5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tony McCoy's bid to complete the remarkable milestone of 4,000 career winners over jumps is unlikely to be achieved at Chepstow on Wednesday after one of his two mounts was declared a non-runner.</p><p>The multiple champion jockey needs two more victories to reach his target, but Mission Complete was taken out of the his intended race owing to the soft ground prevalent at the Welsh track.</p><p>McCoy had already rated his chances of completing his mission at Chepstow \"slim\" when he spoke to reporters after a luckless day at Exeter on Tuesday.</p><p>McCoy's only ride at Chepstow, El Macca, runs in the opening maiden hurdle at 1.10pm. Unless the rider gets another ride on the card, McCoy must wait until Thursday, where he is expected to ride at Towcester, before he can attempt to bring up the landmark.</p><p>Jonjo O'Neill, who supplies the bulk of McCoy's rides, does have another runner in Minella For Steak in the race in which Mission Complete was withdrawn and there is a possibility that the jockey may switch to ride the gelding, on whom he won at Ffos Las last week.</p><p>McCoy was, indeed, booked to ride Minella For Steak at the initial declaration stage on Tuesday. The sport's rules allow him to be switched onto the horse at any time until shortly before the race at 2.40pm, since his intended mount has been taken out of the race.</p><p>His two rides on Thursday at Towcester are both owned by J P McManus, his longstanding employer and friend. Church Field has already won four races this year, though he faces 15 rivals in a competitive handicap hurdle. McCoy's second ride on that card is Mountain Tunes, bought by McManus for £75,000 at auction in April after winning a point-to-point race in Ireland. He will line up in a novice hurdle.</p><p>McCoy had expected to have a rare day off on Friday, following the abandonment of the card scheduled at Fontwell, where the course is waterlogged. But a replacement card has been arranged for that day at Southwell and it is thought that he may have rides there. Initial entries will be published this afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421787073|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|8091ab5823cb9ff826b76f6b7f216f4bcdc47519 -->",

That's a whole different scenario.\"</p> <p>Stewards formally issued the charges on Wednesday with the trainers to appear before the Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board on Friday afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421776876|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|ab5d7b6ba8824174ce2876b0a5c5afd181d1a2c7 -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry states Ashes case with unbeaten 153",
        "body":"<p>Michael Carberry seized an unexpected opportunity to make an eloquent case to be Alastair Cook's opening partner in the first Ashes Test in a fortnight with his first century in an England shirt on a blissful day at the Blundstone Arena.</p> <p>Carberry, who made 78 in the first game of the tour in Perth when Cook was ruled out by a back injury, was surprisingly selected to open with the captain against a higher-calibre Australia A attack, forcing Joe Root to drop back to the middle order.</p> <p>England briefed that there were still no guarantees about their Brisbane selection - &ldquo;We are open to all possibilities,&rdquo; Cook had said before the match. But Carberry could hardly have done any more, combining skill and stamina to make an unbeaten 153 as he and Cook became the first England pair to bat through a whole day's play since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998.</p> <p>Suddenly a Test recall at the age of 33, almost four years since he won a single cap in Bangladesh in early 2010 &ndash; also as Cook's opening partner, when Andrew Strauss was taking a break &ndash; is looming not as the long shot it seemed only a week ago, but as a probability.</p> <p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p> <p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the second Test against New Zealand in May, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls &ndash; of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day &ndash; efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p> <p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p> <p>The selection of Australia's A-team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers &ndash; Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p> <p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p> <p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p> <p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p> <p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p> <p>Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen are due in next but attention now will focus on Root and Gary Ballance, who was again selected ahead of their Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow to give him another chance to impress after his dismissal for a golden duck in Perth.</p> <p>Chris Tremlett was the other eyecatching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421768555|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|1bf32f9bb6dfd4d24e1c5cbafe4f28da21958855 -->",

        "body":"<p>Shane Watson has been cleared of a serious hamstring strain and remains confident of being able to play as an all-rounder in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane.</p> <p>Watson underwent a scan on Tuesday afternoon after struggling with a left hamstring problem in the final one-day international in India and more is expected to be known about his likely availability later this week. The 32-year-old was forced off the field when bowling in Bangalore, but returned later to bat under duress.</p> <p>Watson's long injury history has raised concerns the No.3 could be ruled out of the England opener starting on November 21, or at least restricted to just batting in the Gabba match. But it appears Watson is a chance to still bowl in the first Test provided he responds well to treatment and can get through training when the team assemble in Brisbane on November 17.</p> <p>Assessment from Cricket Australia medical staff confirmed a low-grade muscle strain and team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said everything would be done to get Watson on the park.</p> <p>\"He will have intense treatment and rehabilitation in Sydney over the coming days and just how well he responds to this will determine how quickly he can resume full training and match preparation,\" said Kountouris.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that Shane and the medical team will be doing everything possible to get him fit and available for selection ahead of the first Test. We'll be assessing him on a daily basis and expect to have a clearer picture of his progress later in the week.\"</p> <p>It appears likely the former Test vice-captain will miss NSW's Sheffield Shield clash with Queensland starting next Wednesday, which would mean he'd head into the Ashes series without a first-class match under his belt.</p> <p>If Watson is fit to take his part, it would appear Australia's only vacancy will be the No.6 batting position - with ODI star George Bailey the leading contender. However, Alex Doolan and Shaun Marsh also have a chance to push their claims in Australia A's clash with England in Hobart.</p> <p>Watson is a pivotal member of the Australian line-up, as No.3 batsman and a fourth seam bowler. His omission would significantly alter the balance of the side and could mean James Faulkner earns a recall.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421769981|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|9b8039fac076ba9f072df8a871c2233075fe5367 -->",

        "headline":"The Joy of Six: AFL draft debacles",
        "body":"<h2><strong>1. Inglorious beginnings</strong></h2> <p>These days it feels as though fans put much more effort into scouting and analysing prospective draft picks than many actual club recruiters used to in the early days of the draft. From the inaugural draft in 1986 until well into the 90s, &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; would have been a more apt description for the cattle call that was the national draft.</p> <p>Poor old Richard Lounder was taken by Richmond at number one in the 1987 draft and has no doubt spent the rest of his life saying &ldquo;yes, <em>that</em> Richard Lounder&rdquo; when he introduces himself to people. The South Australian booted four goals in an impressive debut but managed only three more games for the Tigers in 1989. He returned home to Adelaide not long after, tired of footy and destined to be the butt of jokes on football forums and quiz nights for the rest of his life. For his part he held no grudges against the media or fans, but <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/21/1069027325424.html\">later claimed</a> he would have benefitted from modern day &ldquo;support structures&rdquo; to adjust to life in Melbourne, not to mention working a 40 hour week on top of his football commitments. Draftees now don&rsquo;t know how good they have it.</p> <p>Likewise, Geelong&rsquo;s prized number one pick in the 1990 draft, Stephen Hooper, made little impact after crossing the Nullarbor to pursue his AFL dream. He did later <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/photos-e6frf9o6-1226521470980?page=3\">take Basil Zempilas out</a> in a WAFL ruck contest though, so all was not lost. The following years&rsquo; number one pick and fellow Western Australian John Hutton also failed to catch on in the big leagues. The Claremont spearhead only put together 36 matches for Brisbane, Sydney and Fremantle and holds the rare distinction of being moved on after his debut season. Maybe Jack Watts hasn&rsquo;t had it so bad after all.</p> <p>Without the benefit of sophisticated junior pathways, video analysis and draft combines, recruiters came up with some howlers in the Draft&rsquo;s first decade. Names like Anthony Banik, Todd Breman, Jody Arnol, Brendon Fewster, Rory Hilton and Danny Roach are destined to live on in the imaginations of football fans, immortalised in unintentional comedy.</p> <h2><strong>2. The ones that got away</strong></h2> <p>If there is nothing more frustrating than unfulfilled talent, there&rsquo;s an extra serving of pain for football fans when early draft picks are spurned on a wayward talent.</p> <p>For decades St Kilda seemed to be a magnet for this type of player and their number nine pick from the 1999 draft, midfielder Caydn Beetham, was no exception. Picked amid the tumult of Tim Watson&rsquo;s short-lived reign as Saints coach, Beetham had pace, physical presence and a booming right boot. Following St Kilda&rsquo;s sacking of Watson and his high-profile replacement Malcolm Blight, Beetham knocked back a lucrative offer from Collingwood during his second season. By the end of season three a <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/04/1046540188305.html\">black-eyed, broken-nosed Beetham</a> called a meeting with new coach Grant Thomas and quit the game for good, citing a lack of passion and a desire to live the life of a normal 21-year-old. He&rsquo;d hardly been embracing a professional lifestyle anyway, constantly chafing at the attempts of senior players to ease him in to the big time. Saints fans were left to ponder an unfulfilled talent, but also what might have been had they taken some other players still on the board when Beetham&rsquo;s name was called. Robert Murphy, Darren Glass, Paul Chapman and Cameron Ling were stars elsewhere.</p> <p>Likewise, it was all meant to be different for the Western Bulldogs and their number four selection of 2002, tall forward Tim Walsh. Held back by a spate of injuries in his first two years with the Dogs, Walsh finally made his senior debut in 2005. It was the first and last senior outing for the prized pick and by the end of the 2007 season he was gone. Players like Jarrad McVeigh, Andrew Mackie and Jared Rivers, all taken after Walsh, were thriving.</p> <p>Most clubs have had similar bad luck stories, the Dons with 1996 bust Daniel McAlister, the Dockers with Ryley Dunn, Eagles forward Andrew McDougall, the Dees with Luke Molan and Chris Lamb, North utility David Trotter, Adelaide talls Fergus Watts and John Meesen, plus the Blues with much-maligned defender Luke Livingston. Towering above them all in more ways than one, was there any bigger miss than Adelaide-turned-Carlton bad boy Laurence Angwin?</p> <h2><strong>3. A series of Deebacles</strong></h2> <p>Melbourne supporters hardly need any reminding of the dire state the club has found themselves in over the last few years, but through a combination of bad luck, bad management and questionable player development, they&rsquo;ve had some decidedly average takings from the last half decade of drafts. They&rsquo;ve also provided ample evidence that a club cannot work its way out of trouble with priority picks.</p> <p>Selected by the Dees with pick four of the 2007 draft, it all should have panned out OK for Cale Morton. A Larke Medal winner for the best player at the National Under-18 Championships, Morton looked the ideal modern footballer. Tall and boasting incredible endurance, the Dees banked on him developing into a decade-plus star but something went seriously amiss. He never seemed to put any weight onto his spindly frame, was in and out of the Demons side and drew attention for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtwII83oE\">all the wrong reasons</a>. The cause of frustration to fans and coaches alike, Morton would seek new pastures at West Coast after five seasons and 73 games with the listless Demons.</p> <p>In Morton&rsquo;s wake came one of the most heavily scrutinised number one picks in draft history, 196cm Brighton Grammar Golden Boy Jack Watts who was billed as a potential Messiah for the struggling club. To say it has been a rough road since would be the biggest understatement of draft history, but with a fresh start under new coach Paul Roos, Watts might yet go some way to placating his legions of knockers.</p> <p>Then there was 2009&rsquo;s number one (priority) pick Tom Scully, who was given the honour of wearing Ron Barassi&rsquo;s famous number 31 but became so unenthused by what he saw in his first two seasons with the Dees that he packed his bags for Western Sydney and a lucrative pay day. On his return to the &lsquo;G in opposition colours, Scully incurred the venomous wrath of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8isHHKwsGAo\">angry fans</a> and salt-of-the-earth <a href=\"http://images.3aw.com.au/2012/06/25/3402088/250612_scullymoney.jpg\">private schoolboys</a> alike.</p> <p>By 2010 the Dees had taken key position prospect Lucas Cook at number 12. The beanpole forward didn&rsquo;t break through for a senior game before receiving his marching orders at the end of his second season at Demonland. That their supporters have maintained their sense of humour through such a painful period is actually quite remarkable.</p> <h2><strong>4. The TV event that failed to set hearts racing</strong></h2> <p>In keeping with the dismal showings of many first-round picks in the early stages of draft history, the biggest day in the calendar for AFL hopefuls was not deemed worthy of a TV production in its formative years. That started to change at some point in the 90s, when the league decided that the televised drafts of the US sports leagues could work just as well for them. The problem was that they kept the event&rsquo;s look and feel of a particularly dreary insurance industry seminar, as though the cameras weren&rsquo;t even there. To say that the productions that resulted failed to capture the imagination is an understatement.</p> <p>The Seven Network&rsquo;s 1999 draft telecast at least provided the world with one of the great <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lAfCFmJN44\">unintentionally hilarious YouTube clips</a>, which remains a great way for Tigers supporters to keep things in perspective. By 2007, the league still favoured the nondescript backdrop of a conference centre and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w-JTkUaPXg\">rows of awkward, pimply teenagers</a> sitting and waiting for their name to be called out. There were tears of joy and fear from worried parents about to pack their sons off interstate, but the stifled atmosphere of formality usually triumphed over anything genuinely entertaining.</p> <p>In recent years the league has moved towards an event more in keeping with the NFL/NBA tradition, so top picks now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhR3qCZwm_4\">come up on stage to receive their club jumper</a> from their new coach as perennial draft analyst Kevin &lsquo;Shifter&rsquo; Sheehan gives the lowdown on each prospects strengths and weaknesses. Yep, it&rsquo;s an absolute riot.</p> <h2><strong>5. The Terror of being a Tiger</strong></h2> <p>So things have turned around for the Tigers of late. They&rsquo;re finally back playing finals and starting to believe that the club could get back to where it belongs. With that in mind it&rsquo;s a little bit mean-spirited to remind them of their inglorious moments at the draft table, but no-one could deny how plentiful they&rsquo;ve been.</p> <p>The source of the most long-standing anguish at Punt Road was the 1999 decision to take lightly-framed South-Australian midfielder Aaron Fiora over key-position prospect Matthew Pavlich. To be fair to the Tigers, the draft&rsquo;s history at that point was littered with the delisted corpses of tall forwards, but in the following decade they&rsquo;d watch Pavlich develop into a bona fide star of the competition while Fiora became an unfortunate emblem of a disastrous period in the club&rsquo;s history. Booed by his own fans and struggling to move out of Pavlich&rsquo;s All-Australian shadow, Fiora was gone after five years and 78 inconsistent outings for the Tigers.</p> <p>For Richmond&rsquo;s number four pick at the 2004 draft, the realities of being taken before a genuine superstar were perhaps even harsher. Richard Tambling was on a hiding to nothing for most of his six-year stay with the Tigers as the man the Hawks took in his wake, breathtaking tall Lance Franklin, became the star forward of the competition. His fortunes could not have contrasted any more with that of dual-Premiership Hawks star; as Franklin signed an eight-figure, nine-year with Sydney at the end of 2013, Tambling was being delisted by his second club Adelaide without fanfare and is destined to be remembered as a byword for the Tigers&rsquo; years in the wilderness.</p> <p>The year after the Tambling selection, Richmond plumped for spindly East-Perth unknown Jarrad Oakley-Nichols with the eighth pick, Norwood tall Cleve Hughes at 24 and South-Australian Travis Casserly at 40 in one of their worst draft wipe-outs of all. It didn&rsquo;t help that part-time recruiter Francis Jackson was sharing duties with football director Greg Miller, himself filling a variety of roles at the cash-strapped club, but Oakley-Nichols was a spectacular bust. Club legend Kevin Bartlett would later reveal that neither Jackson nor Miller had even seen Oakley-Nichols playing up close and were going off video tape of the junior when they called his name.</p> <p>More misses blighted the Tigers through the 2000s, with names like Kayne Pettifer, Danny Meyer and Troy Taylor giving Richmond fans more grey hairs than reasons to cheer, but under the direction of Damian Hardwick and the now full-time Jackson, a series of fruitful recruiting campaigns and the judicious use of early picks has seen the club climb back off the canvas.</p> <h2><strong>6. The curse of pick six</strong></h2> <p>Even if you&rsquo;re not particularly superstitious, you have to admit that there is something terrifying about the prospect of your team holding pick six in any national draft. Of all the hoodoos and curses of the past 30 years, it makes for some genuinely painful reading.</p> <p>St Kilda&rsquo;s 1987 selection, Michael Quirk of Myrtleford, faded into such astonishing obscurity that he doesn&rsquo;t even warrant a Wikipedia entry. The Saints weren&rsquo;t alone in taking a dud with their first round pick, but they passed over Graeme Wright, Steven Tingay, Brendan Gale and Chris McDermott to select Quirk.</p> <p>Geelong&rsquo;s 1988 number six Ray Sterrett is probably known only to members of his immediately family and he was followed in 1989 by Mark Brayshaw. Brayshaw later took the post of Richmond CEO during the years in which the Tigers used their first round picks on Kayne Pettifer, Alex Gilmore (of zero games fame) and Danny Meyer, while also witnessing the aforementioned Tambling/Franklin howler. So even having a former number six pick on your staff may be putting your club at risk of draft calamity. Brayshaw is now on the North Melbourne board of directors. Their supporters should have some concerns about this.</p> <p>Melbourne had two golden seasons from the mercurial Allen Jakovich before injury and diminishing returns got him the chop, but what followed over the next decade was absolutely dire. Sydney stepped up to the plate in 1991 with Paul Burton (zero games) and in 1992 it was Robert Pyman&rsquo;s turn (40 games spread across five years and three clubs). Fitzroy kicked things into overdrive from 1993, with Trent Cummings (three wins from 27 games. Yes, three) and Robert McMahon (two games in three years and surplus to Brisbane&rsquo;s needs during the merger) failing to catch on. Then came Saint Daniel Healy, who managed 38 fairly anonymous games.</p> <p>1997s model James Walker was a fairly solid acquisition for Freo, playing 150 games and winning a couple of grand final sprints , but Carlton&rsquo;s Murray Vance (five games that reinforced his status as a walking punchline), Lion-turned-Don Damian Cupido (where do you even start with a guy who Kevin Sheedy publicly banished to the Bendigo Reserves?), Roo Dylan Smith (delisted within three seasons that produced 11 senior games), much-maligned Bomber Kepler Bradley (who has reinvented himself to a degree at the Dockers but was a whipping boy for Dons supporters) and Dogs defender Tom Williams (cursed with injuries, he&rsquo;s only managed 78 games in seven years) all failed to raise pulses.</p> <p>In &rsquo;06 and &rsquo;07 the Hawks went back-to-back with Beau Dowler (sadly cut down by injuries) and Mitch Thorp (gone without fanfare after three years that yielded 2 games), solidifying the curse like no other. Since then, David Myers, Chris Yarran, Reece Conca and Chad Wingard have, to their own varying degrees, proved that things might be starting to turn around a bit. The less said about the luck experienced by Sydney&rsquo;s 2010 selection Gary Rohan the better, but even he&rsquo;s now back from injury and looking good.</p> <p>And who is looking to dodge the bullet at number six this year? For the first time ever it&rsquo;s the Pies. Fingers crossed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421765138|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|25852b1b5545307c6d5d71f6c557f2bb56a01407 -->",

But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/dunaden-tres-blue-melbourne-cup\">controversy marred the buildup to the race</a> when Waterhouse&rsquo;s other horse Tres Blue was found to have received treatment during the morning of the race.</p> <p>The Irish-bred horse, a late entry to the Cup from Waterhouse&rsquo;s stables, had been administered with a cream for an irritated hoof. Former winner Dunaden was also found to have been treated, with an oral treatment for an ulcer. Neither substance was prohibited.</p> <p>\"We had been treating him for greasy heel all week and we just inadvertently treated him again in the morning before the race,\" Waterhouse said.</p> <p>At the time race officials ruled that the breach of the regulations &ndash; which outlaw the administration of any treatment on the day of a race, either with drugs or other substances, irrespective of whether they are prohibited &ndash; was insufficient enough to warrant any immediate sanctions. Both horses were cleared to compete, with Tres Blue finishing 22nd and Dunaden 11th.</p> <p>But Waterhouse, along with Dunaden&rsquo;s trainer Mikel Delzangles, faces disciplinary action with an inquiry to be heard later in the week after the Australian Racing Board introduced a six-month minimum penalty for a breach of race-day treatment regulations.</p> <p>The Adelaide trainer Paul Beshara was banned last month for that length of time after claims his horse Happy Trails received an injection on the day of the Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes in September.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421762342|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|17f07e8ca565102edb1c6708a416e94607f391ad -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>A supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again</strong></h2> <p>There’s not much more that needs to be said about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/nov/04/india-australia-odi-what-we-learned\">completely bonkers run-orgy</a> in Australia’s recently completed ODI series in India, but it really did end in fitting style early on Saturday night. Waking up on Sunday morning I had to double-check I hadn’t just had a bizarre dream. Did James Faulkner really just pummel the fastest Australian ODI century ever? Did Shane Watson really come out to bat with an injured hamstring and proceed to launch six after six, injuring himself further in an apparent attempt to break the fastest 50 record Glenn Maxwell had just equalled? Put it this way, Vinay Kumar got hit for 102 runs off 9 overs and it wasn’t even the 10thmost mystifying thing about the game.</p> <p>None of it leaves Australia any better placed for the forthcoming Ashes series, though some would say the potential loss of Shane Watson could end up being a blessing in disguise. In the meantime,<a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/ian-chappell-believes-australian-selectors-must-look-past-runs-and-leave-george-bailey-out-of-ashes/story-fn67wltq-1226752058225\"> Ian Chappell says</a> that George Bailey shouldn’t be picked in the Test squad on the basis of ODI form, which is all well and good but for the fact that Alex Doolan is the only other genuine candidate banging down the door, with a hundred and half century in Tasmania’s opening Shield game. No doubt we will all sit and await the breathless updates on Watson’s injury progress until the eve of the Brisbane Test, but whether he’s really a lynch-pin is a moot point. Australia do have a history of winning Test matches when he’s out.</p> <h2><strong>First-class cricket is back</strong></h2> <p>While taking a break from answering the same questions about Ricky Ponting’s autobiography over and over again, Australian Michael Clarke has lifted Aussie spirits with a successful return from his back ailments. Clarke made a patient 88 in the first innings and had a bird’s eye view of Alex Doolan’s impressive display. At the other end from Clarke, Steve Smith continued his low-key but fruitful preparation for the Ashes summer. In Smith’s 10 innings for New South Wales since returning home from England, the 24-year-old has passed 40 on seven occasions.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Cameron White continues to pile up the runs and his first-innings 83 against Western Australia to open his first-class summer was, well, first-class. With 61 in the second dig he continues to press his claims, but converting his scores to triple figures will help even more in that regard. The Vics were stone-walled by forgotten man Marcus North in the fourth innings and his 118 from 314 deliveries was an impressive rearguard to secure a draw. Centuries to Tom Cooper and Peter Forrest, seven wickets to Queensland leg-spinner Cameron Boyce and an impressive showing from Test spearhead Ryan Harris were the main takeaways from Queensland’s draw with South Australia. For trivia boffins, it was the first time the Redbacks had played a Shield game away from Adelaide Oval since 1892.</p> <p>In England’s tour match against the WA Chairman’s XI, interloping Queenslander Chris Lynn was in the runs, along with pretty much everyone else who had a bat. There’s a bit to be said about the 23 year-old and both his first innings century and the unbeaten 61 that saw out the end of the drawn three-day match were scored at a brisk rate. Centuries to Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott as well as some strong bowling spells from Boyd Rankin made it a worthwhile exercise for the tourists.</p> <h2><strong>A radio shake-up and more of the same</strong></h2> <p>Cricket Australia’s promotion of the one-day international summer has begun in earnest with a <a href=\"http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid2649885097001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAu-f-8Kk~,XmIdfJLsQzDgVarg6LwXC6cEVm9QsPon&amp;bctid=2786528981001\">new TV commercial</a> featuring a whole lot of costumes and not much cricket. The 30-second ad contains approximately three seconds of actual cricket action and you could be forgiven for thinking that CA are embarrassed by what they are trying to sell. If your marketing communication strategy is just a blank A4 piece of paper that says “dress ups”, it might be time to re-assess the direction you’re taking.</p> <p>All of this might be written off as peripheral marketing fluff, but the message it sends does not inspire confidence. Might it have been better to utilise <a href=\"http://au.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/17144859/ellyse-perry-named-australias-marketable-athlete/\">Australia’s most marketable athlete</a>, who is on CA’s books, rather than bogans dressed as beer wenches? Following on from last year’s Basement Jaxx DJ sets, the musical accompaniment by Bomfunk MC’s is at least in keeping with CA’s push to bring in the kids. The kids from 1999, that is. That Richie Benaud was roped in to this debacle is just too depressing for words.</p> <p>CA have also signed a new <a href=\"http://www.cricket.com.au/news-list/2013/11/1/ca-signs-deal-with-fairfax-radio\">five-year radio rights deal</a> with Fairfax Radio, who will cover the Sydney and Melbourne Tests, one-day internationals, T20I games and the Big Bash League. CA gushed about the deal being “an exciting new chapter for cricket in Australia”, though how you’d deduce that from a cursory listen to 3AW is anyone’s guess. It will at least see Tim Lane, one of Australia’s premier broadcasters, calling cricket again. As a result, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/cricket/theres-cricket-on-the-radio-but-not-the-sheffield-shield/story-e6frg7rx-1226751600445\">the spurned ABC has walked away</a> from covering Sheffield Shield cricket. Whether any more than a handful of us hardy fans even notice is possibly worth pondering. Cricket’s loss is football’s gain though, with the public broadcaster set to increase their A-League content to fill the void.</p> <h2><strong>Player of the Week </strong></h2> <p>By scoring the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR4jpCrxJpk\">fastest one-day international century</a> by an Australian and performing the superhuman feat of keeping his economy rate under eight per over, James Faulkner has done it in a canter.</p> <h2><strong>Tweet of the Week </strong></h2> <p>In a retirement decision more saddening than the departure of Sachin Tendulkar, David Warner has drawn the curtain on a glittering career at the keypad. Twitter will never be the same again.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidwarner31/statuses/396589034744451072\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Hey guys, I'm back on Instagram and you can follow me It's dwarner31.

They can be <a href=\"http://www.tnfcricket.com/oli-e-foundation.aspx?rw=c\">purchased here</a>, and there’s surely no better reason to get a new grip onto your bat.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421759712|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|c54e9839d3c1f22c2808b3432eb6797e24fe3cfe -->",

Set in the rural NSW town, the rather topical spin on the tale is that one of the families is Australian, the other English. And the ashes they are playing for are those of an unfortunately barbecued cat &ndash; the source of the initial falling out.</p> <p>With the team behind The Dish and The Castle having been consulted on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.backyardashes.com.au/\">Backyard Ashes</a>, the film's makers have promised a charming, down-to-earth feel, with writer director Mark Grentell assuring us: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the greatest feature film ever written but it&rsquo;s not too bad.&rdquo;</p> <p>So, while Michael Clarke et al do battle with the Poms in the real Ashes, an Aussie turner and fitter will go head-to-head with his English financial administrator nemesis on the silver screen &ndash; with the results expected to jog viewers&rsquo; childhood memories of long, sunny afternoons spent in the backyard.</p> <p>How was backyard cricket played at your home? Does one-hand, one-bounce mean anything to you? Is a barbecue obligatory? What about drinking for the adults? Are pieces of garden furniture and shrubbery included as fielders? Are spectators allowed to catch the ball? How about six-and-out? Who fetches the ball from over the fence? Are there any consequences/incentives for smashing a window? Has your uncle been banned from ever playing again? Can you be out first ball?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421758324|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|82dbf6084dd0c5d95de1e40da1a5c6b3bb3710f6 -->",

However, the consequences have rumbled on and Djokovic was clearly angry when asked to comment on the case on Tuesday night.</p><p>\"Viktor is a very good friend of mine,\" Djokovic said of his fellow Serb, shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-atp-world-tour-finals\" title=\"\">beating Roger Federer in the opening round of the ATP World Tour Finals </a>at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. \"I know him since I was eight years old. I've been involved very much in this case of his. I've been talking to him. I've been talking to his agent.</p><p>\"When you are randomly selected to go and provide the test – blood test or urine test – the representatives of Wada, anti-doping agency who are there in the tournament, are supposed to give you the clear indications and explain you the rules and regulations and what the severe consequences or penalties that you might undertake or you might have if you fail to provide the test. The representative, she didn't do that in his case.</p><p>\"First of all he's not positive on any banned substance. I'm not saying that it's completely not his fault but the way it was is that he had a medical pass where he was fainting … if he feels bad when he provides the blood test. He asked if it's possible to avoid providing blood test that day and he would come the next day – not because he wanted to hide anything, he just felt bad.\"</p><p>Djokovic added: \"I heard Andy Murray also said that he wants to take some action, making sure that he has [an] independent laboratory also following his tests that he provides to Wada and the Independent Drugs Tribunal. That says enough. I don't have trust in them any more. I don't have trust [in] what's going on. For me, the whole procedure of the court case is totally against the player and player's rights.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421758904|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|c175736624482fadbda9fff783fbd816ee219f03 -->",

        "body":"<p>England sprung a major surprise in their team selection for the second warm-up match of the Ashes tour in Tasmania to confirm Alastair Cook's pre-match assertion that \"we are open to all possibilities\" before the first Test in Brisbane.</p><p>Michael Carberry was selected to open against Australia A with Cook – exactly as Shane Warne, England's least favourite media pundit, had advocated – and Joe Root drops down into the middle order.</p><p>Root was due to come in at five ahead of Gary Ballance, with no place again for Jonny Bairstow, leaving him and Monty Panesar with the unwanted distinction of being the only two members of the 17-man squad not to have played in either of the first two tour games.</p><p>There was another hint of England's pre-Brisbane thinking when Chris Tremlett was selected ahead of Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as the third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. England continued to maintain that their minds are open regarding selection for both the pace attack and the last couple of batting positions but Tremlett, Carberry and Ballance have been given a huge opportunity to stake their claims.</p><p>Cook, speaking before his first appearance of the tour, had admitted that England may be forced to go into the opening performance of their Ashes defence without a full dress rehearsal.</p><p>Cook was one of the players who benefited most from England's carefully planned preparations for the last Ashes series in Australia three years ago. He built sufficient form and confidence as one of the top seven who played in each of the three warm-up games to score 67 and an unbeaten 235 in the first Test at the Gabba.</p><p>But after missing the low-key opening game of this tour in Perth with a mild recurrence of his long-term back complaint, the captain concedes that England are having to be much more flexible on this tour.</p><p>\"It's very different from 2010-11,\" he said. \"We came here very clear what our full-strength side was and on that tour we played the first two warm-up games as that Test match XI.</p><p>\"In this situation circumstances are different. We are unsure of pretty much two places and it's exciting because everyone in the squad knows that and watching that competition grow – if someone grabs that opportunity he is going to find himself in a good place.\"</p><p>Cook believes that the greater experience of Australian conditions in this squad makes a repeat of those 2010-11 preparations unnecessary. \"The bowlers are more experienced in these conditions than last time we were here,\" he added. \"Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann know their games and conditions they are about to bowl in so it is a matter of tailoring to their needs.\"</p><p>Cook explained that Broad had preferred to miss the opener in Perth if it allowed him to prepare for Brisbane with consecutive fixtures against Australia A in Hobart and then the final warm-up game against a New South Wales Invitational XI in Sydney next week.</p><p>But he made it clear that England have arrived with no hard and fast plans for their batting order. \"We are open to all possibilities,\" he said. \"We haven't decided on our batting line-up.\"</p><p>The Australia all-rounder Shane Watson has been cleared of serious damage to his hamstring. He is therefore expected to be available for Brisbane but will not play for New South Wales next week as planned. Watson pulled up when bowling during a one-day international against India in Bangalore at the weekend.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421754851|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|7f8fe7a222fb7f99df4a4d3b156d4a952089c43a -->",

        "headline":"Novak Djokovic made to work as Roger Federer shows fight in defeat",
        "body":"<p>Whatever fight there is left in Roger Federer at 32, Novak Djokovic felt the heat of it in victory on the south bank of the Thames on Tuesday night. The Swiss lost to the Serb for the second time in four days – but he did not die like some elegant swan in the reeds.</p><p>For two-thirds of the contest at least he gave the most robust response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/roger-federer-novak-djokovic-atp-finals\" title=\"\">Djokovic's contention on the eve of these ATP World Tour Finals</a>: \"From my point of view he hasn't been moving as well as he did the year before, and that's one of the reasons why he hasn't had much success this year, but he is Roger Federer.\"</p><p>He is still Roger Federer but not the one who has scared his peers and underlings for more than a decade. And Djokovic (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/nov/03/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-lose-semi-finals-paris-masters-video\" title=\"\">who beat Federer in the semi-finals of the Paris Masters on Saturday</a>) was right: he is not moving as he once did. Although he is intermittently dangerous, even Federer would not recognise this version of himself from 18 months ago, when he beat Andy Murray to win Wimbledon, his 17th grand slam title.</p><p>While the Serb won 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 in two hours and 22 minutes on Tuesday night to open his account, Federer left the O<sub>2</sub> Arena by boat for the team hotel further up the river towards Westminster at least encouraged that he can still put anxiety on the racket of the second-best player in the world.</p><p>He foundered on Djokovic's rock-solid defensive game, as have so many. \"He proves it time and time again that he's one of the best defenders in the game we've ever had,\" Federer said. \"It's been a tough season overall. So I guess I'm just rattled at times with my level of play consistently. There's still a lot to play for. Now I hope I can take it to [Juan Martín] Del Potro and [Richard] Gasquet. I just want to make sure I don't get too negative on myself because of the loss today. I mean, it was against Novak after all. It's not against some journeyman.\"</p><p>Appearing in his 12th consecutive World Tour Finals, Federer pushed Djokovic all the way – until the third set got away from him. Thereafter youth, strength and power broke him down. They both now have a day's rest before resuming battle. After 11 months on the road they need it.</p><p>Comfortable enough in the first set, Djokovic had the match wrapped up in the second before Federer forced a tie-break with shots to revive memories of his finest times. However, after two hours of tennis, Djokovic was 2-0 up in the third. Resistance then wilted, the last shot of the match an unreturned Djokovic serve.</p><p>If Federer comes back from this defeat to win his seventh end-of-season title, he will rightly be acclaimed alongside Rafael Nadal, whose own return from the wilderness has been the story of the summer.</p><p>Earlier Nadal looked in sublime form, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/rafael-nadal-david-ferrer-atp-world-tour-finals\" title=\"\">beating David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2 </a>to gain immediate revenge for his defeat on Saturday in the semi-finals in Paris. Nadal needs one more win – against the in-form Stanislas Wawrinka on Wednesday afternoon – to secure the end-of-year world No1 ranking he snatched from Djokovic this summer.</p><p>For Nadal, revenge over David Ferrer in their sixth encounter of 2013 – and the 26th of their nine-year rivalry – could hardly have been swifter or more emphatic. Less than 72 hours after losing to his friend and compatriot (and nearly six months after beating him in the French Open final), the indefatigable man from Mallorca produced some of his most lethal tennis to win in 64 minutes.</p><p>Nadal has never won this tournamentand was soundly beaten by Federer in the final three years ago, yet he said he needs no extra motivation to do well on a surface that has not always favoured his attritional tennis. It is no secret, either, that the hard courts have done most damage to his knees, which he had to rest for seven months before returning to the game in February.</p><p>But, regardless of the conditions or the rigours of the modern game, Nadal played well within himself as Ferrer, one of the busiest players on the Tour, slapped a weary forehand into the net and brought a one-sided match to its inevitable conclusion. Nadal, who said on his arrival on Monday he was feeling the strain of a long season, converted six of seven break points and bounced back from dropping serve once in each set.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421753330|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|e33a639b9cff8ff6c981888f657dba4b1b442782 -->",

        "body":"<p>Australian swimmers have picked up six gold medals at the World Cup shortcourse meet in Singapore, collecting a handful of world and national records on their way.</p> <p>After setting a world record in the morning's opening heats on Tuesday, the quartet of Bobby Hurley, Christian Sprenger, Alicia Coutts and Cate Campbell shaved a further second off their new world mark to win gold in the 4x50m mixed medley relay final.</p> <p>The team broke the previous world-best of 1:39.54, recorded by France in Doha last month, in the morning then finished in 1:38.02 in the final.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gold-Coast-based Thomas Fraser-Holmes took out the men's 400m individual medley in an Australian record time of 4:01.98, finishing almost six seconds quicker than the rest of the field. The 22-year-old was just outside the Commonwealth record, but was more than two seconds quicker than the previous best by an Australian, 4:04.24 swum by Matt Dunn in 1998.</p> <p>In the women's 200m freestyle, Wollongong teenager Emma McKeon beat out World Championship medallists Katinka Hossuz from Hungary and Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem to set a new national record. The 19-year-old's time of 1:52.40 was half a second quicker than Australia's previous best - Kylie Palmer's 1:52.96 at the 2010 World Short Course Championships in Dubai.</p> <p>Among Australia's other medallists, Emily Seebohm took gold in the women's 50m back with a time of 26.70, while Queenslander Madison Wilson took bronze in 27.02. Robert Hurley beat Fraser-Holmes with a time of 3:38.68 in the men's 400m freestyle, while Fraser-Holmes finished second in 3:38.92.</p> <p>After setting a new Australian record in the heats of the 50m freestyle, Campbell took her foot off the pedal slightly in the final, but still managed to take gold ahead of younger sister Bronte.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Christian Sprenger picked up silver in the men's 50m breaststroke hitting the wall in another Australian record time of 26.24, with South African Roland Schoeman taking gold in 25.68. Sprenger's time improved on his Australian record from the heats by 0.23 of a second.</p> <p>The Singapore leg of the series concludes on Wednesday night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421753477|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|5a5a5a90ed645de0a4a491f6cc97a70a433c813f -->",

        "body":"<p>USA, the World Cup giant-killers, were winners again after the Cook Islands became the second team to be eliminated from the tournament.</p><p>Tonga's thrilling 22-16 victory at Leigh Sports Village kept alive their hopes of topping Group C while the Cook Islands' second consecutive defeat means the USA Tomahawks are guaranteed to finish top of Group D.</p><p>That almost certainly means a quarter-final for the Americans with the tournament favourites, Australia, in Wrexham on 16 November.</p><p>The result was cruel on the Cook Islands winger Chris Taripo, who scored all his side's points and delighted the stadium-record crowd of 8,544 with a superb hat-trick of tries that earned him the man-of-the-match award.</p><p>The Cook Islands conceded the game's first try to Sika Manu after six minutes but the excellent Taripo went over for two tries in seven minutes and also kicked a goal to put his side 10-6 up.</p><p>The Newtown Jets player twice demonstrated clinical finishing after kicks from Isaac John and Drury Low prised open the Tongan defence.</p><p>The underdogs were good value for their lead but they were powerless to stop the rampaging forward Jason Taumololo who crashed over for a 31st-minute try to restore Tonga's lead, and the centre Konrad Hurrell, who bashed his way over for a third try just before half-time.</p><p>The Sydney Roosters stand-off, Samsoni Langi, kicked three goals as the Tongans led 18-10 at the break but the game was back in the balance within three minutes of the restart when Taripo produced a brilliant flying finish in the corner to take Low's pass and complete his hat-trick.</p><p>The winger added the touchline conversion for good measure to cut the gap to two points but Tonga opened up a six-point lead when the left-wing, Jorge Taufua, squeezed over in the corner on the hour.</p><p>The Cook Islands never gave up hope, however, and Tonga were forced into some desperate defence in an enthralling final quarter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421750076|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|3b61e1c937d6ed9c4d1cdcb5b116cfefd865d1da -->",

        "headline":"André Villas-Boas blasts 'incompetent critics' in Hugo Lloris concussion row",
        "body":"<p>André Villas-Boas has angrily defended his decision to allow Hugo Lloris to continue playing against Everton on Sunday despite the goalkeeper appearing disoriented after being hit on the head by Romelu Lukaku's knee as the pair challenged for a ball.</p><p>Tottenham Hotspur have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/tottenham-villas-boas-goal-record-everton\" title=\"\">widely criticised for not substituting the player</a> but Villas-Boas insisted that the club did nothing wrong and accused \"incompetent people\" of turning on Tottenham solely to attract attention to themselves. Villas-Boas also said it was \"remarkable\" Lukaku's role in the incident has not been quesioned further and suggested the Everton striker could have avoided the clash.</p><p>Tottenham originally intended to replace Lloris with Brad Friedel after the incident but the Frenchman demanded to play on and, after examination on the pitch by the club doctor, Shabaaz Mughal, and club physiotherapist, Geoff Scott, Villas-Boas let him do so.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/05/tottenham-hugo-lloris-head-injury\" title=\"\"> That decision has since been condemned</a> by, among others, the Professonal Footballers' Association, the international players' union FifPro, Fifa's chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, and the head injury charity Headway, who described the club's actions as \"dangerous and irresponsible\". However, Villas-Boas remains unrepentant.</p><p>\"I stand absolutely by the decision that I took and the decision that the medical department has taken following the checks that they made on the player, all of which were according to the book,\" said Villas-Boas. \"I stand by the decisions that gave us the green light for the player to continue. I have nothing else to say regarding that matter. I registered the fact that a couple of people have taken this opportunity to find a chance to get themselves publicised, people who have had no experience on the pitch whatsoever in this type of situation.\"</p><p>As far as the club are concerned Lloris did not lose consciousness and was not concussed as a result of the blow to the head.</p><p>Villas-Boas suggested that it is wrong to question the responsibility of the same medical staff whose actions helped save the life of Fabrice Muamba when the former Bolton Wanderers player collapsed from cardiac arrest during an FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane two years ago.</p><p>\"Two persons and the medical department that two years ago saved the life of a player on the pitch has been completely forgotten, poorly treated and badly respected by lots of opinion-makers.</p><p>\"What is extremely disappointing is the fact that two persons – a great doctor and a great physio who saved the life of Fabrice Muamba – were put into question by lots of incompetent people and people who have no experience on the pitch, in the action, in the moment. That is extremely serious and disappointing.\"</p><p>Lloris underwent a precautionary brain scan on Sunday night, during which nothing irregular was detected. Nevertheless, the incident ignited a debate regarding the effectiveness with which footballer clubs tend to deal with head injuries, with critics suggesting that other sports handle them with more appropriate prudence. Villas-Boas said any comparison between the Lloris incident and others was spurious. \"My medical department has followed the Premier League guidelines for this type of situation, that's the only thing I can tell you,\" he said. \"The situation is obviously not comparable to NFL situations, rugby situations or Petr Cech's situation. It astonishes me that you try to put this in the same mould as situations that happened in the past. We have all the indications that the player is OK and we don't see incidents like this happening again.\"</p><p>Villas-Boas added that it was \"remarkable\" that Lukaku, whose injured his knee during the clash, has not come under more scrutiny for his role in the incident. The Portuguese, who was Chelsea manager when Lukaku joined that club from Anderlecht, claimed the striker could have moved his knee to prevent it hitting Lloris and said he was saddened that Belgian has not made contact with the goalkeeper since Sunday to check on his wellbeing.</p><p>\"I want to believe that Lukaku's leg was not left late to clash into Hugo's head. I find it remarkable that through all of this amount of publicity that this incident has got nobody has actually dedicated themselves to finding out if he could have avoided the goalkeeper and I am disappointed that Lukaku hasn't contacted Hugo.</p><p>\"Lukaku is a fantastic footballer and I don't question his integrity or his human side. We had a warm hug on the pitch before the game so I have maximum respect for him and I think he has for me. But amid all this negative excitement I find it surprising that no time was lost to actually study the incident. I don't want to question Lukaku. He's a young player and wonderfully gifted but I think he could have jumped over perfectly.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421793382|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|352c4a5759cd6dfda45e1e2437dd5cb41508b0e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>David Moyes refused to condemn Ashley Young as the Manchester United winger was involved in another diving controversy in the goalless Champions League draw at Real Sociedad.</p><p>The England international won a 69th-minute penalty for United – which was missed by his fellow substitute Robin van Persie – after reacting theatrically to a slight pull by the Sociedad midfielder Markel Bergara. Two former United players turned television pundits, Roy Keane and Ray Wilkins, accused Young of \"conning\" the Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, with Wilkins labelling the dive \"pathetic\".</p><p>But Moyes, who took Young to task for diving against Crystal Palace earlier in the season, would not be drawn on whether the midfielder had resorted to theatrics again. United had Marouane Fellaini sent off for a second bookable offence in the 90th minute and Moyes did say of the penalty: \"I thought there were some strange decisions all night and that was another one of them.\" But he refused to criticise Young's part in its award.</p><p>\"I have seen it again,\" the United manager said. \"The boy tugs him in the box. The referee is two yards away from it and decides to give it. He's got a penalty kick for a decision tonight. I don't know about his reputation but the referee is there and he gave it. The referee made decisions all night. He's the one who saw fit to award a penalty and send a player off. I thought the referee made the decision and that was the referee's choice.\"</p><p>The new Republic of Ireland assistant manager Keane was more forthright, however. \"He's obviously played for it,\" he told ITV. \"If you are a Man United player and you see a player getting tugged back, you want him to go down. Ashley Young's obviously gone down too much over the last few months. He's been heavily criticised in England but we are in a foreign country and it's more accepted. But he's almost conned the referee there. If he scores the penalty, as a United player you would be delighted, but he's conned the referee there.\"</p><p>Wilkins said on Sky Sports: \"This [dive] is pathetic. This is as bad for me as all these over-the-top tackles we're getting at the moment because that is a conning of the referee. I just wish Ashley would cut this out because he's a good player but he's getting a bad name.\"</p><p>Van Persie also hit the post from open play and Javier Hernández missed a glorious chance from six yards as United had the edge in the Basque country. Moyes said: \"I see it as a missed opportunity to take three points. We had some good chances, especially in the second half, and I felt we were worthy of getting all three.</p><p>\"We are still in a strong position. If we'd won it would have given us a really strong chance of winning the group. We are still top but I do feel like we've missed a chance tonight.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421754241|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|ba3ae8b836c337dba35faf72edae3ea7fed7f4d8 -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry states Ashes case with unbeaten 153",
        "body":"<p>Michael Carberry seized an unexpected opportunity to make an eloquent case to be Alastair Cook's opening partner in the first Ashes Test in a fortnight with his first century in an England shirt on a blissful day at the Blundstone Arena.</p> <p>Carberry, who made 78 in the first game of the tour in Perth when Cook was ruled out by a back injury, was surprisingly selected to open with the captain against a higher-calibre Australia A attack, forcing Joe Root to drop back to the middle order.</p> <p>England briefed that there were still no guarantees about their Brisbane selection - &ldquo;We are open to all possibilities,&rdquo; Cook had said before the match. But Carberry could hardly have done any more, combining skill and stamina to make an unbeaten 153 as he and Cook became the first England pair to bat through a whole day's play since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998.</p> <p>Suddenly a Test recall at the age of 33, almost four years since he won a single cap in Bangladesh in early 2010 &ndash; also as Cook's opening partner, when Andrew Strauss was taking a break &ndash; is looming not as the long shot it seemed only a week ago, but as a probability.</p> <p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p> <p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the second Test against New Zealand in May, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls &ndash; of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day &ndash; efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p> <p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p> <p>The selection of Australia's A-team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers &ndash; Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p> <p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p> <p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p> <p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p> <p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p> <p>Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen are due in next but attention now will focus on Root and Gary Ballance, who was again selected ahead of their Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow to give him another chance to impress after his dismissal for a golden duck in Perth.</p> <p>Chris Tremlett was the other eyecatching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421768555|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|1bf32f9bb6dfd4d24e1c5cbafe4f28da21958855 -->",

        "trailText":"The forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, said England wanted to 'put the throttle down' against Argentina but warned of their scrummaging threat",
        "headline":"Mako Vunipola injury opens door to Alex Corbisiero's England return",
        "body":"<p>The Lions prop Alex Corbisiero is set to return to England's front row against Argentina after Mako Vunipola was ruled out on Tuesday night with a strained knee ligament. A second front-row amendment could yet be required as Tom Youngs's wife is expecting the couple's first child and Bath's Rob Webber has been asked to stay on with the squad as cover.</p><p>The availability of Corbisiero, who played a leading role in the Lions series-clinching win in Sydney, is timely as England seek to counter Argentina's scrummaging threat at Twickenham on Saturday. The visitors lost all their Four Nations Tests and were beaten twice at home by England in June but the England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, is still predicting an intense set-piece \"battle\".</p><p>This season's new scrum laws, with pressure now being exerted after the initial engagement, suits the Pumas and Rowntree, a tireless student of front-row combat, says he does not expect a one-sided romp on Saturday against injury-hit opponents whose coach, Santiago Phelan, stepped aside on the eve of the tour.</p><p>\"We want to put the throttle down and go for this team,\" said Rowntree, acknowledging England were \"rusty\" for the first 50 minutes of their victory over Australia and need to improve. \"Even though they have a new coach and have a few players missing, I think they will come to Twickenham, play a very simple game and take us on in the forwards. Historically that's what they've done at Twickenham and I've a lot of respect for them. We have to match their threat … if they want to do that to us, we have to be in the battle to the end, otherwise we'll be made to look stupid.\"</p><p>Rowntree's research also suggests Argentina's scrums last more than eight seconds on average, approximately 25% longer than anyone else's, as they seek to squeeze as much energy out of their opponents as possible. \"They're big, physical and like a set-piece confrontation and that will never change. They like a long scrum. They want to punish you there.\"</p><p>Picking a strong-scrummaging hooker such as Dylan Hartley must be a serious temptation regardless of Youngs's availability, with competition for places increasingly fierce in every position, according to Rowntree.</p><p>\"Guys are putting their hands up every week and that's what we want. It's not about keeping people happy. I don't want them happy. There are some angry guys when they're not picked. What's important is we are honest and positive with them about why they are not playing or what they have to do better.\" There was good news for Geoff Parling, absent against Australia following a training knock, who has been recalled ahead of Dave Attwood. Danny Care, Christian Wade and Luther Burrell are also among the 27 players retained by the head coach, Stuart Lancaster.</p><p>Dan Cole, though, appears to have seen off the challenge of David Wilson for his tight-head shirt and is looking forward to propping against Marcos Ayerza, normally his colleague at Leicester.</p><p>\"If you don't get it right, they are good,\" said Cole. \"The Argentinians want to take you on in the scrum. The technique falls into place because they have a desire to beat you. They want to wear you out.</p><p>\"Speak to Marcos and there is a certain pride and honour in the way they scrum. They don't like cheating. It is a pushing contest and the team that gives up goes backwards. That is the gentlemanly way of doing it. It wears you out… the human body is not designed to be pushed backwards for long periods of time.\"</p><p>The durable Cole, set to win his 42nd cap since his debut in February 2010, is also looking to make up for not starting a Lions Test in Australia.</p><p>\"I did come back frustrated but the Lions won the series so I can't complain. I was happy to be involved in the Tests but obviously you want to start. You use it as motivation. The Lions' starting tight-head is probably the best tight-head in the world, or certainly up there. You want to be that person.\"</p><p>His chances of achieving this will partly rest on his workload over the next four years, the 26-year-old having been actively involved in no fewer than 40 games last season. \"I want to play every game for Leicester and England but you also seek to be the best you can be. I don't think 40 games a year is going to be that good for you. That's when you trust in your coaches to look after you.\"</p><p>The fly-half Katy McLean, meanwhile, will captain England's women against France at Twickenham on Saturday in place of the injured Sarah Hunter. The flanker Maggie Alphonsi is back for the first time in 20 months after a knee injury. The uncapped Bristol prop, Sasha Acheson, is on the bench.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421732119|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|e8f5b1a0ccf51cf71209d2d84739dcc4c8548d82 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tony McCoy's bid to complete the remarkable milestone of 4,000 career winners over jumps is unlikely to be achieved at Chepstow on Wednesday after one of his two mounts was declared a non-runner.</p><p>The multiple champion jockey needs two more victories to reach his target, but Mission Complete was taken out of the his intended race owing to the soft ground prevalent at the Welsh track.</p><p>McCoy had already rated his chances of completing his mission at Chepstow \"slim\" when he spoke to reporters after a luckless day at Exeter on Tuesday.</p><p>McCoy's only ride at Chepstow, El Macca, runs in the opening maiden hurdle at 1.10pm. Unless the rider gets another ride on the card, McCoy must wait until Thursday, where he is expected to ride at Towcester, before he can attempt to bring up the landmark.</p><p>Jonjo O'Neill, who supplies the bulk of McCoy's rides, does have another runner in Minella For Steak in the race in which Mission Complete was withdrawn and there is a possibility that the jockey may switch to ride the gelding, on whom he won at Ffos Las last week.</p><p>McCoy was, indeed, booked to ride Minella For Steak at the initial declaration stage on Tuesday. The sport's rules allow him to be switched onto the horse at any time until shortly before the race at 2.40pm, since his intended mount has been taken out of the race.</p><p>His two rides on Thursday at Towcester are both owned by J P McManus, his longstanding employer and friend. Church Field has already won four races this year, though he faces 15 rivals in a competitive handicap hurdle. McCoy's second ride on that card is Mountain Tunes, bought by McManus for £75,000 at auction in April after winning a point-to-point race in Ireland. He will line up in a novice hurdle.</p><p>McCoy had expected to have a rare day off on Friday, following the abandonment of the card scheduled at Fontwell, where the course is waterlogged. But a replacement card has been arranged for that day at Southwell and it is thought that he may have rides there. Initial entries will be published this afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421787073|2013-11-06T15:45:58Z|8091ab5823cb9ff826b76f6b7f216f4bcdc47519 -->",

He gave a sample the following day and the test was negative. However, the consequences have rumbled on and Djokovic was clearly angry when asked to comment on the case on Tuesday night.</p><p>\"Viktor is a very good friend of mine,\" Djokovic said of his fellow Serb, shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-atp-world-tour-finals\" title=\"\">beating Roger Federer in the opening round of the ATP World Tour Finals </a>at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. \"I know him since I was eight years old. I've been involved very much in this case of his. I've been talking to him. I've been talking to his agent.</p><p>\"When you are randomly selected to go and provide the test – blood test or urine test – the representatives of Wada, anti-doping agency who are there in the tournament, are supposed to give you the clear indications and explain you the rules and regulations and what the severe consequences or penalties that you might undertake or you might have if you fail to provide the test. The representative, she didn't do that in his case.</p><p>\"First of all he's not positive on any banned substance. I'm not saying that it's completely not his fault but the way it was is that he had a medical pass where he was fainting … if he feels bad when he provides the blood test. He asked if it's possible to avoid providing blood test that day and he would come the next day – not because he wanted to hide anything, he just felt bad.\"</p><p>Djokovic added: \"I heard Andy Murray also said that he wants to take some action, making sure that he has [an] independent laboratory also following his tests that he provides to Wada and the Independent Drugs Tribunal. That says enough. I don't have trust in them any more. I don't have trust [in] what's going on.
