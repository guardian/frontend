        "body":"<p>This was a night for the Manchester basketball cognoscenti and curious sports fan to sample a first taste of the NBA cabaret.</p><p>With Rio Ferdinand, Patrick Vieira, Andy Cole, Jack Rodwell, Fernandinho, Darren Fletcher and young man-of-the-moment Adnan Januzaj among those court-side, America's major basketball league made its bow outside London.</p><p>This pitted the Philadelphia 76ers against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with Kevin Durant, a four-time All-Star and key member of the US 2012 Olympic champions, the biggest noise of a contest that was part of each franchise's preparation for the regular season, which starts at the end of the month. At half-time the score was 51-48 to Durant's Thunder, with Rumble the Bison, the latter's mascot, having set the evening's quasi-pantomime tone with his antics.</p><p>In between quarters one and two Rumble, an \"anthropomorphic\" bison who has his own website, searched out Ferdinand and in mock adoration knelt before him to ask for an autograph, which the Manchester United defender duly furnished.</p><p>There were also humorous boos when Rodwell (of Manchester City) was shown on the big screen and a loud cheer when Cole (formerly of United) was featured during the opening quarter.</p><p>Despite this being a friendly there was no sense of either team easing off as the end of the third 12-minute period approached and the score read 71-65 to the Thunder, who lost the 2012 NBA Championship finals and have clinched the crown only in their former guise as the Seattle Supersonics, in 1979.</p><p>The 76ers are the more storied of these organisations, having numbered the all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, and Charles Barkley in their ranks and who last when to the finals in 2001, which they lost, although they are the owners of two championships (1967 and 1983), plus one when the Syracuse Nationals, from 1955.</p><p>NBA got the grandstand finish it hoped for, the score 101-99 to the Thunder with only 10.4 seconds remaining and Scott Brooks's team winning 103-99.</p><p>He said: \"We had a great experience, a lot of good times for our players, to go and get around town. Our staff had the same thing, so thank you for the experience.\"</p><p>Surveying what was a 13,472 sell-out, the NBA will consider this opening foray beyond the capital a success. While it is yet to be decided if they will return to Manchester, it would be no surprise if there is a move to plant a footprint here as part of the quest for global expansion.</p><p>The news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/08/nfl-three-games-wembley-2014\" title=\"\">three NFL games will be staged at Wembley in 2014</a> – with the possibility of there being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/28/london-nfl-franchise-minnesota-pittsburgh\" title=\"\">a London-based team some time in the near future</a> – is bound to concentrate minds at the NBA.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419426852|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|353a11ad79583f77978758e5180b4b8fdc11de48 -->",

        "body":"<h2>1) Brian Lara’s 501 for Warwickshire</h2> <p>The name Chris Scott might not immediately resonate with even hardcore cricket fans, but it should. Scott was the Durham wicketkeeper who dropped Warwickshire’s Brian Lara on a measly 18 before the West Indian went on to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3klZq-iqyM\">post his landmark 501 not out</a>, the greatest run-making feat in first-class cricket history. After the drop Morris supposedly muttered: “Oh dear, he’ll probably go on and get a hundred,” possibly <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149228.html\">claiming a record of his own for cricket’s greatest understatement</a>.</p> <p>Though it’s almost 20 years ago now, that purple patch in which Lara seemed to set records for fun remains fresh in the memory of many cricket fans. In the wake of his Test record 375 against England only months earlier, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/462128.html\">the 501</a> was Lara’s seventh hundred in eight successive first-class knocks. That failure was a 26 against Middlesex, where he was dismissed by three-cap England seamer Richard Johnson of Middlesex. Don’t worry: Lara bit back with 140 in the second innings.</p> <p>Durham’s 8 for 556 declared seemed a pittance once Lara got going. His 427 ball, near-eight-hour stay included 62 fours and 10 sixes. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCwgoUalpAE\">Lara was bowled off a no-ball on 12</a> and then Scott grassed the aforementioned chance before the West Indian subjected Durham’s bowlers to hour upon hour of pain.</p> <p>“Brian, as long as you’re at the crease I won’t declare,” said Lara’s captain, Dermot Reeve, having been warned of the batsman’s intention to break the record when he’d only just passed 200. In the end it was the level-headed advice of non-striker Keith Piper that it was the last over and that Lara should get a wriggle on that spurred him on to one last boundary slashed through cover off part-timer John Morris. Morris had seen his first innings double-century well and truly fade from the limelight over the course of the past two days of play.</p> <p>“No matter where you put a fielder, he hit it in a different place and he has this uncanny knack of hitting the gaps all the time,” lamented the Durham skipper, Phil Bainbridge. “To have witnessed it and been on the same field as that innings was probably one of the highlights of my career, really.”</p> <p>On the second day of the innings, Lara piled on 390 runs including 147 in the first session before lunch. For Durham left-arm spinner David Cox, it was a dubious honour to spend his first-class debut supplying Lara with fodder for the record-breaking innings. “I just wanted to get on with my job and see that I could prove that I could bowl at him and I was proven wrong.” Cox’s 30 wicketless overs went for 163 in one of cricket’s great baptisms of fire.</p> <h2>2) Fred Fanning kicks 18 goals</h2> <p>Though Hawthorn’s Jason Dunstall drew breathtakingly close in 1992, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7a/Fred_Fanning.JPG\">Melbourne full-forward Fred Fanning’s</a> 18-goal haul against St Kilda at the Junction Oval in 1947 remains the single most legendary solo stat in Australian Rules Football. Having warmed up with a lazy 10-goal effort the week before against Footscray, Fanning’s Round 19 performance against the Saints featured only one miss. It was a season in which the burly forward would notch up 97 goals for the year.</p> <p>His opponent that day was St Kilda’s Stan Le Lievre, who recalled 50 years later: “Nobody wants to put their hand up to playing on him but it doesn’t worry me.</p> <p>“The ball was coming down quickly from blokes like Norm Smith and Fred was a very big man, hard to get around. Somebody said I should grab hold of his footy nicks and pull them off every time the ball came down, but they would have run out of nicks.” Fanning’s exploits led the Age to note, “His marking against strong opposition was spectacular and his accurate kicking left little to be desired.”</p> <p>Fanning was more than imposing by the standards of the era, standing <a href=\"http://australianfootball.com/players/player/fred+fanning/6567\">193cm tall and purportedly weighing in at 102kg</a>. He was done at the Demons by the end of that season at the age of 25, but the record stands to this day. In 104 league games for the Dees, Fanning managed 411 goals. As well as the 1945 Best and Fairest award, Fanning claimed a premiership medal in Melbourne’s 1940 triumph over Richmond.</p> <p>Fanning was also long-considered responsible for the mightiest punt in Aussie Rules history with his 105m effort from the centre of the MCG during Melbourne’s 1939 reserves grand final against the Tigers. Upon his disappearance from VFL ranks, Fanning built a lucrative career in various country football leagues and his goal-kicking feats for Hamilton included a Western District record of 22 goals in a game in 1949 and another haul of 20 the following season.</p> <h2>3) Wilt Chamberlain scores 100</h2> <p>In a game that lends itself to all kinds of statistical fetishism, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxMeEzhvNRs\">Wilt ‘The Stilt’ Chamberlain’s 100 point game of 1962</a> remains the most totemic basketball stat of them all. It’s bonkers really, when you think about it.</p> <p>During that 1962 season the center averaged 50 points and 25 rebounds per game, which probably sounded as insane then as it does now. He’d eventually garner a reputation for being more than a little selfish in his pursuit of statistical achievements (<a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/12310/did-wilt-chamberlain-really-sleep-20000-women\">including some frankly implausible off-court exploits</a>) over team success, but some of them are marks that might never be touched again.</p> <p>Coming up against the New York Knicks at Hershey Arena, Pennsylvania, only 4,124 fans would witness the single most breathtaking solo scoring performance in NBA history as Chamberlain’s Philadelphia Warriors overcame the Knicks 169-147. Bizarrely enough, the game featured a curtain-raiser basketball match-up between NFL players of the hometown Philadelphia Eagles and the Baltimore Colts. At that point Chamberlain himself was not considered a sufficient drawcard by team management and the stands remained barely half-full.</p> <p>The landmark was achieved with only 46 seconds remaining on the clock. Radio caller Bill Campbell described the historic moment: “He made it! He made it! He made it! A Dipper Dunk! The most amazing scoring performance of all time! One hundred points for the Big Dipper!”</p> <p>Sadly, no footage exists of the game, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxMeEzhvNRs\">only bits of Campbell’s radio broadcast</a> and an<a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/d2253ce0180df3015c557b310d5653d6/tumblr_mj1qqxIH0b1r70xplo1_1280.jpg\"> iconic photo by AP’s Paul Vathis</a> showing Chamberlain holding up a piece of paper on which Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Harvey Pollack had hastily scrawled the number 100. Amazingly, Vathis was the only press photographer who stayed until game’s end.</p> <p>For the rest of his career Chamberlain shot at barely above 50% from the free-throw line but on that famous night went 28-for-32 to go with his 36-for-63 from the field. The closest anyone has come since was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyAhap7huXI\">Kobe Bryant’s 81 point game against the Toronto Raptors</a> in 2006 but Bryant was operating with the benefit of the 3-point line, which hadn’t appeared yet in professional play when Chamberlain set his record.</p> <p>And what did Wilt do after the game? Merely jumped in his Cadillac and drove back to West Manhattan, presumably shouting the entire bar at his nightclub, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/richard_rothschild/03/01/wilt.chamberlain/index.html\">Big Wilt’s Smalls Paradise</a>. </p> <h2>4) Welker and Flutie go it alone</h2> <p>Stats-minded sports fans are particularly well served by US sports and I’ve long held the view that the three primary appeals of baseball to its followers are: 1) Its myriad statistics and associated scope for fantasy leagues, 2) That it provides an excuse to collect baseball cards well beyond the socially accepted age bracket and 3) That it legitimises getting drunk in the bleachers on a work day. Would baseball even still exist if it wasn’t for these things?</p> <p>But I digress. Of equal or possibly more appeal to the stats nerds is American Football and the NFL has seen its fair share of virtuoso solos over the years. Few are as exotic as the efforts of Wes Welker for the Miami Dolphins during their 2004 regular-season game against the New England Patriots, when he became the first player in NFL history <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2012/02/05/multitalented_wes_welker_is_the_patriots_little_big_man/\">to record a field goal, extra point, kickoff, punt return and kickoff return in the same game</a>. In football parlance players are sometimes said to have “brought their own ball”, but Welker also probably hand-stitched the thing himself. That was in the early stages of Welker’s career, and it showed the determination to be involved that is a large part of his character.</p> <p>In a similar vein, 43-year-old quarterback Doug Flutie became the first man <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S_7TT2a1H4\">since the 1940s to score a NFL point with a drop-kick</a> while appearing as a back-up for the New England Patriots in 2006. Earning the Pats an extra point after a touchdown, it was the final act of a career notable for some soaring individual highs. <br />A Heisman Trophy winner who played in the NFL, USFL and CFL in a nomadic 20-year professional career, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-qkpsygNYo\">Flutie’s hail mary touchdown pass</a> for Boston College to snatch a victory with only seconds on the clock remains a college football classic and gave rise to “The Flutie Effect”, where applications for admission to the college rose dramatically after the famous game.</p> <h2>5) Dock Ellis and the LSD-fuelled no-hitter</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vUhSYLRw14\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_vUhSYLRw14?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>On his way to becoming a Major League Baseball All-Star and World Series winner, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher and <a href=\"http://monsterfresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dock-ellis-corn-rows.jpg\">fashion maverick</a> Dock Ellis unleashed one of the more notable ‘no-hitters’ in a 1970 game against the San Diego Padres. Of the 282 no-nos in baseball history it’s almost definitely the only instance in which the pitcher himself was high on LSD.</p> <p>No stranger to controversy or incident in his rise from the minor league ranks, Ellis found himself in the Pirates starting rotation towards the end of 1968 with his stock rising steadily until that Padres game on 12 June, 1970. It would make him a darling of Baseball Digest and High Times alike. The general consensus is that no footage exists, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vUhSYLRw14\">though this short animated documentary</a> is the best cartoon about a psychedelic drug-taking baseball player you’ll ever watch.<br />With a mere six hours until the first pitch of the game Ellis, “as high as Georgia pine”, thought he was enjoying an acid-fuelled day off at a friend’s house in Los Angeles when he was rudely awoken by the news he was the starting pitcher for that night’s game. “Dock, you better get up, you gotta go pitch,” <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=Dock-Ellis\">said his host</a>.</p> <p>Having taken his last hit of LSD only hours prior, the pitcher immediately flew from LA to San Diego, arriving at the Padres stadium just 90 minutes before the game. Keeping to his standard routine of taking a handful of Benzedrine pills before his first pitch, Ellis later claimed that he could barely feel the ball in his hand. “The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn’t.</p> <p>“I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over home plate.”</p> <p>Ellis’s efforts at fielding from his own pitching were every bit as memorable: “I remember diving out of the way of a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn’t hit hard and never reached me.” It was the only no-hitter he’d ever pitch.</p> <p>Ellis was an outspoken advocate for the rights of black players, and Jackie Robinson lauded him for his “courage and honesty”. Ellis’s drug dependency ended in 1980 upon his retirement from baseball and he later found work as a substance abuse counselor himself beforehis death in 2008 at the age of 63.</p> <h2>6) Michael Phelps wins eight golds at the 2008 Olympics</h2> <p>Yes it was only five years back and we haven’t given the achievement enough time to air out and be viewed objectively, but Michael Phelps’s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCjWbwv680A\">gold medal spree at the 2008 Beijing Games</a> is going to take some beating as the greatest solo act in Olympic history. Technically speaking three of his eight gold medals came in relays, but it’s still a freakish haul for one athlete.</p> <p>Even more incredible is that seven of those eight wins were in world record times; in the 100m butterfly he had to settle for a mere Olympic record. They sit among the 39 world record performances of his career. A problem with assessing Phelps’s greatness is just getting your head around the sheer weight of wins and records. His 22 medals (18 gold) dwarf the achievements of any other Olympians in Games history.</p> <p>Some of his Beijing feats are best assessed in isolation because they make for amazing reading. His win in the 400m individual medley final shaved almost two seconds of the world record he’d set during the heats. In the 4x100m freestyle relay that followed, Phelps and his US team-mates won a final in which all of the top five teams beat the previous world record. His fourth gold was a world record-breaking 200m butterfly in which Phelps battled through the last 100m as his goggles filled with water. Barely an hour later he joined his 4x200m freestyle relay team-mates to obliterate another world record and become the first team to break the seven minute barrier.</p> <p>Under mounting pressure, his seventh medal of the games came after Milorad Cavic embarked on an ill-advised publicity campaign saying: “it would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to ‘some guy’. I’d like to be that guy.” It only served as motivation for the American, who beat Cavic by one-hundredth of a second to claim the gold and another world record. Finally, in the 400m medley relay, Phelps and his team held off Australia to secure the champion his <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=3539386\">historic eighth gold and sporting immortality</a>.</p> <p>“I wanna be the first Michael Phelps, not the next Marc Spitz,” <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0THHIc4fwHM\">concluded Phelps</a> upon finally unseating his famous countryman for the single-Games record before adding, “records are always made to be broken.” This one will take some beating</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211573|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|8c8b7039f6d1682915ff71653da712708a826c49 -->",

        "body":"<p>The NBA comes to Manchester on Tuesday evening when the Philadelphia 76ers tip-off against the Oklahoma City Thunder for a pre-season game that marks the first occasion the razzmatazz of the United States's major professional basketball league will be experienced outside London.</p><p>While ticket sales have been slow, with some being given away to schools and other sections of the local community, the NBA is confident the Phones 4u Arena will be a sell-out on the night for a local crowd who packed the venue for last summer's pre-London 2012 warm-up between the USA and Team GB.</p><p>Kevin Durant is the bona fide superstar on show, the 6ft 9in Thunder forward a four-times All Star and member of the USA team who went undefeated en route to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/usa-spain-london-2012-basketball\" title=\"\">claiming gold at the Games last summer</a>.</p><p>Of his return to Manchester, Durant said: \"It's great being back in this arena, we played here last summer. It brought back a lot of memories walking in here, so I'm excited I'm back and I know the fans are going to come out and support us.</p><p>\"The fans were unbelievable last time. We played the Great Britain team, so of course they came out and cheered for those guys, but it's pretty fun to be back here and I'm excited to play.\"</p><p>A four-day NBA Fan Zone at the city's Printworks complex began on Saturday where fans have been able to meet Thunder and Oklahoma players plus former stars including Peja Stojakovic, Vlade Divac, Dikembe Mutombo and John Amaechi, the Stockport-born former NBA centre. While Thunder have never won an NBA Championship – in the franchise's former guise as Seattle Supersonics it claimed a title in 1979 – the 76ers have two (1967 and 1983), plus one as the Syracuse Nationals, from 1955.</p><p>Scott Brooks, the Thunder coach, is clear what fans should expect from the NBA spectacle. \"It's the greatest athletes in the world playing a game it takes individually and it takes a team effort to make it look good. I think it's a beautiful sport and like a lot of sports you need teamwork, you need togetherness, you need ball movement, you need toughness,\" he said.</p><p>While the 76ers beat Bilbao 106-104 in their first warm-up game in Europe on Saturday in Spain, the Thunder were beating Fenerbahce, 95-82, in Istanbul.</p><p>\"I've loved it,\" said Brooks, of being away from his homeland. \"I haven't spent a lot of time outside America but the days we've spent in Istanbul were just terrific, a fabulous city, a beautiful place, so much history. And the last few days in Manchester have been great, the people have been so friendly here.\"</p><p>Although Saturday's game is a friendly, expect the 25-year-old Durant, in particular, to register heavily after proving last season he should be counted among the all-time great NBA shooters when becoming only the sixth (and youngest) player to join the 50-40-90 club.</p><p>This is a rating considered the elite mark for points-scorers as it refers to a 50% return from field-goal, 40% conversion of three-pointers and a 90% yield from free-throws.</p><p>With the regular season due start at the end of the month, he said: \"It was a goal I wanted to achieve. I'm glad I reached it but I've got bigger goals in mind. Its going to be tough to do it again but of course I'm going to try.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419302492|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|772e18e6b3628c4774e16768f2098a3d32a37ae5 -->",

        "headline":"Michael Jordan and NBA stars' trash talk makes news (and sells video games)",
        "body":"<p>Breaking news: Basketball players love to boast and talk trash and fans love to hear it. Although we need no further evidence of this, plenty has emerged over the last week. First Kevin Durant and Dwyane Wade got into a supposed spat involving player rankings, a feud which captured headlines despite the fact that it could be part of a promotion. Then, Michael Jordan, the former greatest player in basketball, called out nearly everybody, including LeBron James, the reigning greatest player in basketball. This time around, at least, there was <a href=\"http://n4g.com/news/1365540/the-legendary-michael-jordan-speaks-out-in-a-candid-interview-to-celebrate-the-launch-of-nba-2k14\">no question that it was part of a promotion</a>.</p><p>The first incident, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/9719344/dwyane-wade-kevin-durant-exchange-social-media-jabs-player-rankings\">between Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat</a> involved <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/09/20/top-100-players-of-2014-nos-10-1/?sct=nba_bf3_a5\">Sports Illustrated's Top 10 NBA Players of 2014 list</a>. When Durant protested that former teammate James Harden, currently of the Houston Rockets, deserved to make the list he suggested that <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/09/24/kevin-durant-dwyane-wade-james-harden-top-10-players-2014-sports-illustrated-point-forward/\">Wade be bumped down to Number 11</a>.</p><p>Dwyane Wade, the player who was getting \"Next Jordan\" accolades after his 2006 NBA Finals run, <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/eqnvA3FCAP/#\">responded with a photo of a note on his Instagram account</a> saying \"Kevin Durant said James Harden should replace me in the Top 10... Note to self* Make him respect your place in history - again\". That \"again\" would be a reference to the 2012 NBA Finals where Wade's Miami Heat knocked out Durant's Thunder in five games. Durant responded to this Instagram slight by jumping on Twitter, providing further reminder to future generations that this all happened in 2013, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/statuses/382689964271480832\">and posting</a> \"Show me don't tweet me..\".</p><p><em></em></p><p>When Durant elaborated on the slight a few days later, his explanation did not really help to calm anything down: \"Basically what I was saying was that D-Wade passed the torch onto guys like James Harden,\" <a href=\"http://newsok.com/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-elaborates-on-dwyane-wade-comments/article/3888501\">Durant told NBC Sports Radio</a>, \"just to name one. I think that was just my opinion\". Calling Wade past his prime, while not entirely untrue, certainly was meant to sting a bit more than Durant's \"this wasn't a big deal\" disclaimer initially suggets.</p><p>Unless <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/26/3651200/greg-cote-wade-sensitive-to-slighting.html\">this whole thing is a complete charade</a>. After all, Durant and Wade both star in the same Gatorade advertising campaign and that this whole thing feels a bit, well okay a lot, scripted. Many believe this whole debate, which has now spilled over into several different forms of social media, could just be promotion for a new campaign. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/24/10-reasons-buzzfeed-ruins-everything\">That's social media in our post-@horse_ebooks world</a>: We're always on the lookout for the next big fakeout. The funniest outcome would be if this whole beef turns out to be completely real, <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2013/9/24/4768450/kevin-durant-dwyane-wade-spark-incredibly-real-internet-beef\">since these cynical attempts at finding and exposing this as advertising</a> tend to give Gatorade a whole bunch of free publicity by mentioning the campaign and sometimes even linking to their commercials:</p><p><em></em><br />Even if Wade's response to Durant's slight is legitimate, the big question here is \"why exactly is this big news in the first place?\" Heck, even if it comes out that this whole thing is staged, the question remains: why does having a NBA star say \"I'm a better player than so-and-so\" remain one of of the simplest ways for marketers to ensure headlines? Obviously, it's a bit different when saying such a thing results in fiction between star players on rival teams, like in this case, but stories of players making bold claims often gain far more attention than they would seem to warrant.</p><p>For instance, in early August, John Wall of the Washington Wizards caused some controversy when he claimed that, despite a spotty pro career spent with a floundering franchise, <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/08/05/john-wall-best-point-guard-washington-wizards/\">he was the best point guard in the NBA \"right now\"</a>. While this was greeted with a certain amount of deserved mockery, some took it as a way to rethink how we look at professional athletes. After all, why wouldn't John Wall, not too far removed from being the best player in college basketball, think he was the best point guard in the league? <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/22999156/wizards-john-wall-believes-hes-the-best-point-guard-in-the-nba\">CBS Sports' Zach Harper broke it down</a>: </p><blockquote><p>First, we tend to get mad at players for having confidence in themselves, and sometimes having supreme confidence in their abilities. It's looked at as irrational or egotistical. What's interesting about that is NBA players have to believe in themselves to an excessive degree in order to beat the odds of making the NBA. Genetics and talent have a lot to do with it, but rarely does a player get to the NBA without having incredible confidence in himself and his ability to make the league.</p><p>From there, to be able to be one of the better players in the league, you have to think highly of yourself and your abilities because you're now competing with the world's best players and all of those players have a similar level of over confidence. For John Wall to believe he's better than Derrick Rose and Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook and others right now is kind of ridiculous, but doesn't he need to feel that way in order to have a chance of making that a reality?</p></blockquote><p><em></em><br />In the history of the NBA, no other player has had more of that competitive spirit than Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan. So, it was no surprise what happened when Jordan, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=9753244&amp;ex_cid=sportscenter\">in an interview promoting the video game \"NBA 2K14\"</a> was asked about which players he would like to play one-on-one against in his prime. Jordan rattled off a long, long list of past-and-present basketball titans, while casually asserting that he wouldn't lose to any of them, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2013/10/01/michael-jordan-i-could-beat-lebron-james-but-kobe-bryant/\">\"other than to Kobe Bryant because he steals all of my moves\"</a>. Despite this particularly bitter jab at the Lakers icon, the one name among Jordan's list that got everyone's attention was \"LeBron James\". The second he invoked King James, this became the \"MJ says he would have beaten James one-and-one\" interview.</p><p>Yet that aspect of the story has a bit of \"dog bites man\" feel to it, because <em>of course</em> Michael Jordan thinks he could have easily handled LeBron James in his prime. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/michael-jordan-says-could-beat-lebron-james-1-153805134--nba.html\">In his heyday, Michael Jordan absolutely believed he could have beaten anybody else, that's part of what made him so dangerous</a>. Okay, the major reason that Jordan was so dangerous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/17/michael-jordan-50-birthday-memories-years\">at his prime, is because he actually could beat everyone else</a>. This wasn't a John Wall situation. If anything the most provocative part of this interview, was his belief that the game was harder and more physical during his prime, an opinion he stated with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-AZy2W0qKg\">more than a little bit of a Dana Carvey \"grumpy old man\" edge to him</a>. It's not just that Jordan thinks Peak-Years MJ could have beaten LeBron James, that's not enough for him, he has to believe that his entire generation was superior to James's generation, in his mind he was the greatest NBA player during the league's greatest era. That's the kind of boast that fully shows the limits, or lack thereof, of Jordan's ego.</p><p>The LeBron throwdown, the Kobe jab and the \"my era can beat up your era\" riff all adds up to a <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-130910/could-michael-jordan-beat-lebron-james-one-one\">a lot more to talk about here in Jordan's interview</a> than in Durant and Wade's bickering over 11th place in a poll. If KD and D-Wade are indeed collaborating on a publicity stunt for Gatorade, it's not shocking that Michael Jordan, still in his prime as a genius of cross-marketing, has overshadowed them with a few comments made in an interview that doubles as a commercial for a video game. Let's give the last word to LeBron James, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_osh4gRHXCI\">who just so coincidentally happens to be on the cover of \"NBA2K14\"</a>, and his <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9753017/michael-jordan-thinks-beaten-lebron-james-prime\">razor-sharp reaction to Jordan's claim</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Where he'd say this at? Oh, it was for my game? It's good promotion then.\"</p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418801264|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|4ddbad4389c2c298b4d32fca0e0ee2bb30d42364 -->",

        "body":"<p>While Michael Jordan was busy putting the finishing touches on one of the greatest seasons in sport history against <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o79Jm3xc0Z4\">a hapless Seattle Supersonics outfit in game six of the 1996 NBA finals</a>, Luc Longley studied the elated expressions on the faces of friends, family and strangers. Seconds away from joining the basketball record books and amidst the deafening cheers of Chicago's United Center, a sense of arrival finally dawned on Longley after a half decade of trudging through the harsh NBA landscape. However, it would not be until years later that he fully came to realise how pioneering his journey had been for Australian basketball.</p><p>As the first Aussie to play in the NBA, Longley travelled an unlikely and uncertain path before becoming an invaluable contributor during the second-half of Jordan's six-championship run with the Chicago Bulls. But Longley may not have even made it to the States had it not been for a dose of luck.</p><p>A couple of notable American colleges journeyed to Perth to get a better look <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vlahov\">at a young Andrew Vlahov</a>. A great player in his own right, Vlahov would go on to have a successful career at Stanford University and later the Perth Wildcats, but it was the teenage Longley that turned heads during the 1986 visit.</p><p>Longley ended up at the University of New Mexico and after a dominant senior season he declared for the NBA Draft. However, instead of enjoying the limelight as a franchise building block, the seventh overall selection set off to join the Minnesota Timberwolves and suffer through basketball purgatory.</p><p>Longley faced uncharted territory and could turn to very few people as he made the transition to the NBA. After years of being able to throw his weight around against smaller opponents – he stands at 7ft 2in –  the 22-year-old suddenly came up against men his size and larger on a nightly basis and like many young professional athletes in the United States, often thrown enormous checks before they are legally allowed to consume alcohol, Longley ran into the ups and downs of the financial side of American sports.  </p><p>\"I found the transition very, very hard,\" Longley tells the Guardian. \"In college I'd been able to dominate with length, strength and height. When I got to the NBA everyone was just as big so I really had to re-develop my game, go back to the drawing board a little bit and find out where my strengths were going to lie in this new environment.\"</p><p>The tough growing pains eventually wore off and his game took noticeable strides in his third season. He was still playing for a ghastly Timberwolves team infected by bad attitudes, but added maturity and the addition of former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McHale_%28basketball%29\">Boston Celtics' legend Kevin McHale</a> to the Minnesota staff began to turn to his career around.</p><p>\"My young brother wrote me and he actually hit the nail on the head – I'd always played the game for fun and for the love of it and when I got to the NBA guys were playing for their livelihoods, their families, careers and reputations. It was a level of intensity I hadn't geared up for and was reluctant to as well for some reason,\" said Longley.</p><p>\"His letter encouraged me to do that at about the same time as Kevin showed up. I spent a whole off-season in Minnesota rather than Australia in the gym and the weight room getting my body right. Once I got stronger I became more confident.\"</p><p>Despite gradual improvement, Minnesota decided to trade their lottery pick 49 games into the 1993-94 season. Longley ended up in a Jordan-less Chicago, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/24/entertainment/la-et-0824-jordan-espn-20100824\">away from the game on a baseball sabbatical</a>, but still flourished under the leadership of legendary coach Phil Jackson and the best second banana in NBA history, Scottie Pippen. Away from the \"basketball desert\" of Minnesota, Chicago's disciplined winning ways began to make basketball fun again. It had taken 250 games across five gruelling seasons, but Longley had finally landed on the right path.</p><p>\"I'm back\". Those two words famously announced Jordan's return from almost two years of retirement the following season, setting the stage for a new chapter in Longley's career, but one that didn't come without \"teething problems\".</p><p>The Bulls had gone through a near complete overhaul after winning the 1993 finals against Phoenix and their new roster was forced to acclimatise to the return of the world's biggest sporting name.  Tickets were suddenly impossible to find, media scrutiny trumpeted and security doubled. \"When Michael came back we were on a fast learning curve.\"</p><p>Longley and Michael took some time to mesh and it wasn't until the Bulls added some big pieces ahead of their 1996 championship push, headlined by the eccentric Dennis Rodman, that Longley's value became fully recognised.</p><p>\"It took me a little while to get used to playing with someone like MJ, or someone that good to be frank, and it took MJ a while to realise what my strengths and weakness were,\" Longley said.</p><p>\"He was pretty brutal in assessments of his team-mates and I probably didn't appreciate that very much to start with, but it all worked out pretty quickly, in fact I was injured for a stretch and it was then I think Michael realised how much he liked having me around.\"</p><p>The Bulls cast featured a number of unique and well documented personalities and keeping them in check became vital to the team's on-court success.</p><p>\"It wasn't easy [the mix of personalities], but I thought it was interesting. There was a fair bit of latitude for guys to be who they were, but there was also a very clear hierarchy in understanding in what was tolerated and what wasn't and it got stretched, tested, pushed and pulled.\"</p><p>\"One of my jobs on the team – an unspoken role – was mediating between some of the different groups and keeping everyone on the same page. That's probably overstating it. I made it easier, not harder. Put it that way.\"</p><p>Longley played a vital role for the Bulls during their three straight championships between 1996-98, contributing 9.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game over the three-season stretch  while providing some much needed talent and height alongside the brilliantly scrappy, but undersized defensive forward Rodman.</p><p>After years of struggling to find an identity in the hugely competitive NBA, Longley finally felt at home as the Bulls overcame the Sonics for his first title.</p><p>\"That first championship against Seattle when we were at home, the clock was winding down to under a minute, we were up by double-digits and I realised the game was over so I was looking around the crowd,\" Longley reminisced of the Bulls' record breaking 72-10 season.</p><p>\"You feel like you are at the centre of the basketball universe and you've gotten to the place you've been treading your whole life, and sometimes you didn't even know you were treading there, somehow it was a bit like an arrival is the way I remember feeling.\"</p><p>Ronnie Nunn, a former NBA official of 19 years, was part of the officiating crew that handled the 1998 NBA finals, Jordan's sixth and final championship before retiring for a second time.</p><p>Now retired and working as a officiating and basketball big man consultant, Nunn describes Longley as an integral piece of Chicago's roster and a person that earned the respect of many in a foreign environment.</p><p>\"Luc Longley was a gentle giant of a man in our game,\" Nunn told the Guardian. \"Longley represents one in the line of many gentle giants that have been showcased on an NBA floor and who have followed some kind of baton passing generational ethic: because I know I can hurt somebody with my strength and size, I choose to compete but not endanger those who I compete against.\"</p><p>Longley's greatest adversary wasn't an opposition center looking to batter and beat him each and every night, it was managing his own health. His huge frame made enduring the gruelling 82-game NBA regular season a constant battle. He played a career-high 72 games for Phoenix in the tail end of his career, but averaged just 56 over the course of 10 NBA seasons including just 25 in his final season with the New York Knicks before retiring due to a degenerative condition in his left ankle.</p><p>\"My biggest job in the NBA was not guarding Shaquille O'Neal or learning post-moves, it was managing my body.\"</p><p>\"I think unless you are incredibly blessed like a Michael Jordan or a Scottie Pippen, if you're just a little bit down the genetic food chain in terms of the resilience of your body – even in the 82 game regular season, let alone a playoff game, it is an ordeal. Nine games out of 10 you're playing with pain and injury and that's part of your job and being a professional sportsman.\"</p><p>Jordan's retirement led to general manager Jerry Krause splitting up the Bulls. Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets, Rodman signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent and Longley was dealt to the Phoenix Suns. He spent three more years in the league, but never fully overcame the injury bug. Upon his retirement, Longley returned to his hometown, Fremantle, but intentionally stayed away from basketball.</p><p>\"When I hurt my ankle it stopped me from playing and it was little bit like a bad divorce or bad separation, I needed to be away from the game at that stage and felt pretty badly about the whole situation and you'd rather retire on your own terms.\"</p><p> \"If I hadn't had other people to care about, I would have moved to the bush and grown my hair out and you would have never heard from me again, but life doesn't work that way and other people depend on you.\"</p><p>After a 12-year break, including a short stint as a part owner of the Perth Wildcats with Vlahov, Longley finally made his basketball return with the Boomers in May this year. The 44-year-old Longley joined coach Andrej Lemanis's staff after working in a consulting role heading into the 2012 London Olympics.</p><p>Longley is energised to be once again involved in basketball, but his role with the Boomers isn't restricted to helping the Australian national team win more games and gain more of a national presence; he's also responsible for ushering in the country's next crop of basketball elite. That begins, but is not limited to, Dante Exum. Projected to take the NBA by storm in the coming years, Exum heads the next batch of NBA bound talent.</p><p>\"I can chat to Dante and offer advice,\" says Longley. \"With teenage children, you don't give advice, you sprinkle it out like chicken feed and let them peck away at it when they're ready.</p><p>Dante is a man with a good head on his shoulders, as is Ben Simmons who I think is equally likely to end up in the show, but those guys will find their own way and I certainly offer advice and leave it out there for them to do what they want with it.\"</p><p>Helping guide Australia's top players is something Longley doesn't take lightly. He knows his journey to the NBA, and becoming our most successful story in the process, was an unlikely one that didn't benefit from the same available wisdom. Looking back, he's proud to have played a part in Australian basketball history.</p><p>\"What I am proud of though is I was able to get from Fremantle, Western Australia, all the way to where we beat Seattle in the World Championship.</p><p>\"That is an unlikely and improbable journey and if you asked just about anyone as a junior or a young man, no one would have predicted it.</p><p>\"I had a lot of people that believed in me, but I had probably more that didn't – including me at times – so to be the first Australian to play in the NBA is something that I hold dear and am very, very proud of and when I see other Australian players over there it makes me feel good.</p><p>\"I've seen Andrew Bogut over there doing his thing, Aron Baynes, who I have been able to work with a little bit with the Boomers, going to get a run again this year. I feel somehow just a small part responsible and I like that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418220885|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|3f5c2d155c5597b5ee9214c8b9920834c6129be9 -->",

        "headline":"NBA's nicknames-on-jerseys idea not so hot if you don't have a cool moniker",
        "body":"<p>Poor Shane Battier. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/24/nba-nicknames-jerseys-miami-heat-brooklyn-nets\">The NBA has given the Miami Heat and the Brooklyn Nets permission to put their nicknames on the back of the jerseys</a> during one of their four regular season meetings, which works great for Miami's LeBron \"King\" James and Brooklyn's Paul Pierce, who will always be The Truth. The problem is that a lot of players who will play in the game lack such catchy, popular nicknames. </p><p>While Dwyane Wade's most recent attempts to rebrand himself as <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/dwyane-wade-nicknames-himself-wow-shot-down-lebron-021029177--nba.html\">WOW</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/6/21/4450938/nba-finals-2013-dwyane-wade-nickname-three-heat\">Three</a> haven't worked, he at least has the old Flash handle, or the we're-counting-this-as-a-nickname standby \"D-Wade\" to fall back on. </p><p>Miami Heat role player Shane Battier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-finals-game-7-live\">who we last saw helping lead his team to a championship in game seven of the NBA Finals</a>, might be <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/9714385/nba-miami-heat-brooklyn-nets-wear-nicknames-jerseys\">getting the short end of the stick with this promotion</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Miami forward Shane Battier – who wasn't exactly thrilled about the nickname idea – said he wanted to wear \"Batman\" on his jersey, although he was told that Warner Bros. holds the rights to that name. Other players also have had to deal with copyright-related issues with their suggested monikers. Battier said he'll go with \"Shaneo\" instead.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe Warner Brothers wouldn't be big on Battier being \"Bat-man\" for copyright reasons, they haven't had much of a problem with Dwyane Wade using the Flash, but would they let a bench guy like Shane Battier take up the cowl? They're still taking heat for Affleck. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApZI2f8kZM0\">Maybe Battier could best hope for Bat-Mite</a>? Hey, it's way less sad than \"Shaneo\". (We could suggest finding a way to include the Houston Rockets' Dwight Howard in this game, rocking his Superman monicker, but Howard ruins everything fun, that's his real superpower, plus there's <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?page=windhorstshaq-100212\">the further proprietary issues with Shaq</a>.)</p><p>All of this talk of not-so-secret identities has us wondering: where does this game leave players like Shaneo, the NBA players who lack marquee alter-egos? The guys without nicknames, or nicknames bad enough that they would most likely be seen with <a href=\"http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/04/23/the-comic-book-fools-of-april-the-legion-of-substitute-heroes-special-1/\">the Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> than any sort of Justice League might have the perfect opportunity to reinvent themselves. With the premiere <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/20/agents-of-shield-jed-whedon-marvel\">of Joss Whedon's Agents of SHIELD</a>, about the less superheroic denizens of The Avengers landscape, and the news that <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/25/gotham-batmans-commissioner-gordon-getting-fox-tv-series\">Fox might be creating a show about Batman's less glamorous ally Commissioner Gordon</a>, the zeitgeist is just right for these lesser-knowns to steal the spotlight.</p><p>So what new identities should these supporting players bring on the court?</p><p>Maybe some on the Heat can take inspiration from shooting guard Ray Allen, who will most likely wear \"Shuttlesworth\" on his back because of his turn as Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee's He Got Game. Borrowing a name from a movie you've made an appearance in seems like the easiest move to make, and maybe teammate Chris Bosh should take a page from that. Chris Bosh, despite being a perennial all-star, lacks the cooler nicknames of his teammates. There's a chance that Bosh might have to settle with the nickname <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9k3I5XWm3Q\">\"Boshtrich\"</a>, which isn't dignified at all. Considering <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2SQKqVQUCc\">this cult favorite YouTube video</a>, wouldn't he gain more style points by putting some variation of his Multiverse-saving alter ego Star Prince Akilobataar's name on the back of his jersey?</p><p>Sure, it's a bit more of an esoteric reference, but it's usually best to avoid going with comedy in this situations. This is why Miami's emphatically not super Mario Chalmers will likely stick with the misleading but cool-sounding Super Mario tag rather than going with the Simpsons fan recommendation of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDAwUImV8JY\">\"Superintendent Chalmers\"</a> (or occasionally \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orP4WZQdi0k\">Supernintendo Chalmers\"</a>).</p><p>There is one Heat player who could take this nickname gimmick as a chance to show his sense of humor. <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27312041\">Guardian commentator CollaroyAl suggests that Chris Andersen</a>, change his nickname to reference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/19/chris-birdman-andersen-catfish-hoax\">the recent, incredibly peculiar, resolution of his legal troubles</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I wonder if Chris Andersen will have \"Birdman\" or \"Catfish\" on his jersey?</p></blockquote><p>(It should also be noted that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XqdOkSXUC0\">Birdman too may have some copyright issues</a>, even if he's not quite Batman-level as far as intellectual property.)</p><p>Speaking of troubled players, it will also be curious whether former top prospect Michael Beasley, who the Heat re-acquired after he flamed out in Phoenix, will still be around on this yet-to-be-determined date. Certainly if any player involved would attempt to push the limit it would be him. If the league allowed pictures and symbols in lieu of names – a \"Prince in the '90s\" move – look for Beasley to reference his own <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/9/3/4691060/michael-beasley-released-phoenix-suns-marijuana\">off-court concerns</a> by wearing a familiar leaf icon and not an actual nickname. For what it's worth, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bluntman-Chronic-Kevin-Smith/dp/1582402086\">he would also have a superheroic precedent.</a></p><p>Of course, the Miami Heat players have a ridiculous surplus of nicknames compared to their opponents. Maybe this is the real reason <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/31/nba-offseason-winners-losers-celtics-nets-lakers-rockets\">the Brooklyn Nets traded for the Truth and the Big Ticket during the offseason</a>, as the Boston imports have by far the best known nicknames on the roster. Heck even throw-in Jason Terry's JET dwarfs anything anyone has come up with for Deron Williams or Joe Johnson. They will most likely go with D-Will and JJ on nickname night despite these being less nicknames and more, well, just plain old abbreviations. (You could say the same about Kevin Garnett's more popular \"KG\" handle, but he would probably shout you down. In fact this is the most likely ending to any social interaction one would have with Garnett.)</p><p>Brook Lopez is one of the best centers in the league, but googling \"Brook Lopez\" and \"nickname\" leads you to discussions where people <a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=%22brook+lopez%22+%2B+%22nickname%22&amp;safe=off\">try to solve the problem that Brook Lopez doesn't have a nickname</a>. Some suggest, in fact, that Brook Lopez attempt to use the \"Batman\" name, <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/22007728/behind-the-screen-brook-lopez-the-man-with-two-minds\">as Lopez is a super-fan</a>. Hey, he's also known <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/photos/gallery/_/id/8337913/image/3/robin-brook-lopez-best-sports-twins\">for having a less well-known, less talented and less cooler partner named Robin</a>.</p><p>Say Brook Lopez actually does find a way to get Batman on the back of his jersey by game night? This would be just one last bit of humiliation for the poor guy struggling the most with this idea. If all else fails, Shane Battier could probably play it safe and go with Shaneo come gameday, but we believe the truly brave thing would be to walk onto the court wearing \"Battioke\" on his back:</p><p><em></em><br />Heck, we might consider that kind of courage almost heroic.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418197899|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|3be181bc437344a7e59eb81359d1e50d2bb9009c -->",

        "headline":"Chris 'Birdman' Andersen victim of internet catfish scheme",
        "body":"<p>It seems that another high profile US sportsman has fallen victim to an internet \"catfish\" hoax.</p><p>Miami Heat's Chris \"Birdman\" Andersen won the NBA championship earlier this year but his life was far from perfect. Last year, when Andersen was playing for the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Sheriff's Office Internet Crimes Against Children team seized property from Andersen's home, leading to widespread speculation. The unit investigates \"child porn, internet luring, child predators and child pornography\".</p><p>At the time, the heavily-tattooed star's attorneys claimed he was the victim. Now more details of the case appear to reveal that Andersen was indeed a casualty of a complex internet impersonation scheme. 'Catfishing' is where internet scammers fabricate online identities and entire social circles to trick people into romantic relationships.</p><p>Andersen's lawyer, Mark Bryant, told the Denver Post that the player was impersonated online by a Canadian woman. The hoaxer posed as the basketballer and sought relationships and gifts, and also threatened at least one person. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24122972/chris-birdman-andersen-former-denver-nugget-victim-internet\">The Denver Post reports</a> that a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed that a woman from a small town in Manitoba had been charged in a case that was jointly investigated with the Douglas County Sheriff. The RCMP declined to confirm the identity of the hoaxer, but the Post identified her as Shelly Lynn Chartier, 29, who has been charged with a string of crimes, including possession and transmitting of child pornography, impersonation, extortion, and making threats.</p><p>Bryant <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/9690368/chris-andersen-miami-heat-cleared-extremely-complex-case\">told ESPN</a>: \"We were always confident that Chris was innocent but we just couldn't figure out what had happened. It turned out that it was a Manti Te'o situation. It was Manti Te'o on steroids.\"</p><p>Manti T'eo, who now plays for the San Diego Chargers, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/19/manti-te-o-espn-interview-hoax\">the victim of a hoax involving a dead girlfriend</a> just as he was becoming a college football star.</p><p>Andersen, who has a 'mohawk' hairstyle and a past which includes a drugs ban, joined the Miami Heat after leaving the Nuggets. He played a surprisingly key role in Miami's NBA playoffs run and has re-signed for the forthcoming season. But through last season speculation hovered around the basketballer.</p><p>The new revelations appear to answer questions about why the Internet Crimes Against Children unit searched Andersen's home in March last year. Andersen was not charged with a crime, and Bryant said that \"there was no crime committed in Colorado\".</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Douglas County District Attorney's office told the Denver Post: \"Based on the information that we have been able to obtain and analyze we are not pursuing charges against Chris Andersen.\"</p><h2>Retaliation</h2><p>It appears that the 35-year-old veteran was threatened with retaliation by a young woman from California with whom he had a relationship. The woman apparently became upset when Andersen's interest in her waned. The woman's family demanded payment from Andersen. \"I want him to pay for everything on her Amazon wishlist and 5k for her bedding stuff and her victoria secret wishlist,\" wrote a woman claiming to be the young woman's mother.</p><p>Andersen's lawyer now says the woman in California was also a victim of the woman in Canada and the message from the mother is now believed to have been written by the Canadian.</p><p>Andersen and the Californian only met once in person and Bryant said all online communication unknowingly flowed through the woman in Canada, who simultaneously impersonated both victims.</p><p>Bryant said the woman in Canada — posing as Andersen — threatened the woman in California with violence and with releasing offensive photos of the woman taken when she was under 18.</p><p>Andersen and his attorneys claimed last year that he had been chatting online with a young woman from Canada. She sent scantily clad photographs of herself. The woman traveled to Colorado, with ID proving she was over 21, but became angry when Andersen was not interested in pursuing a relationship. The woman then allegedly set up the catfish hoax. This woman, posing as Andersen, constructed the relationship with the woman from California, communicating with her and eventually making explicit demands.

        "body":"<p>Former US basketball star Dennis Rodman said on Monday he will collaborate on a book with Kim Jong-un and is organizing an international basketball event in North Korea in an effort to \"open doors\" to the secretive country.</p><p>\"I know in time Americans will see I'm just trying to help us all get along and see eye to eye through basketball, and with my friendship with Kim, I know this will happen,\" Rodman said at a press conference in New York on Monday.</p><p>The Paddy Power Dennis Rodman Invitational in Pyongyang – named after the Irish betting company that sponsored Rodman's recent trip to North Korea – will bring former NBA players to play against the country's national team. </p><p>The publicity-hungry betting company's presence did little to dispel the impression that the whole enterprise was anything more than a PR stunt. Indeed, Rodman said he would not be getting involved in the release of Kenneth Bae, the 44-year-old American who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/02/kenneth-bae-north-korea-sentences\">in April was sentenced</a> to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea. </p><p>\"I don't want to talk about politics, because if I do that, it's a whole different ball game,\" Rodman said. He added that things might change once he's there, but that he is not going to North Korea to rescue anybody. </p><p>\"That's the main reason why I'm doing this basketball game – to open doors,\" Rodman said. </p><p>Rodman also announced that he will also have a month of access to Kim so the pair can write a book together, but that he does not plan on using that access for political reasons.</p><p>\"I know one thing, he trusts me,\" Rodman said. \"I'm not going to be a partition, I'm his friend.\"</p><p>Rodman said he has the phone numbers and email addresses for Kim, the prime minister and other North Korean officials, and does not expect Kim to conduct any attacks. \"If he wanted to bomb anybody in the world, he would of done it, but it's amazing how he pulled things back,\" Rodman said. </p><p>During the press conference, Rodman repeatedly asked people to take him seriously, which few have done since he became famous for his <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/eyrs3\">ever-changing hair</a> and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110629124702/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article786188.ece\">antics</a> as a Hall of Fame member of the the all-star Chicago Bulls during the mid-90s. </p><p>He said he might be able to get former Chicago Bulls teammates, such as Scottie Pippen, to play in North Korea, but that no one should expect him to successfully recruit Michael Jordan, \"because he's Michael Jordan\". </p><p>Michael Jordan may be the best equipped player from the team to handle such diplomatic endeavors, due to his experience in the 1996 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/\">Space Jam</a>, in which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ3MU5hREHI\">he entered the cartoon-realm of Looney Tunes</a> to assist Bugs Bunny against a gang of misguided cartoon aliens.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416873235|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|4d6aa805cc306f5be7a23f387c7f078af41ff489 -->",

        "headline":"Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs: everything you need to know",
        "body":"<p>It has taken 82 regular-season games and three postseason rounds, but finally the NBA field has narrowed down to two teams. On Monday night, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/04/miami-heat-nba-finals-blowout-pacers\">the Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals</a>, punching their ticket to their third straight NBA finals. On Thursday night, the Heat will face the well-rested, Western Conference-winning San Antonio Spurs for the NBA championship. So, who are these two teams, how did they get here and how do they stack up against one another? </p><p>Well, this quick-ish reference guide will tell you everything you need to know about the Heat and the Spurs – and also, probably, a lot of other things that you could quite honestly do without.</p><h2>MIAMI HEAT</h2><h2>Who they are</h2><p>The entire state of the NBA changed in the summer of 2010. Free agent LeBron James, a Cleveland Cavaliers superstar well on his way towards establishing himself the best player in the game, went on national television to announce that he was signing with the Miami Heat. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTeCc8jy7FI\">The Decision</a>, as the ESPN program was called, created a NBA superteam of sorts as James \"took his talents to South Beach\" to join hometown hero Dwyane Wade and the Toronto Raptors All-Star Chris Bosh. </p><p>The public reaction was swift and almost entirely negative – James was seen as someone who had betrayed his home state (he is an Akron native) to team up with superstars, because he couldn't win a championship on his own. It didn't help matters when the city of Miami threw a victory parade, minus the whole victory part of the equation, to celebrate their basketball team landing the biggest free agent in NBA history. James somehow managed to make things even worse in the by proclaiming that the newly formed Heat would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT-I8jQDQ7c\">win at least eight championships</a>, or when they tragically attempted to coin the phrase \"the Heatles\" (no this is not one of my jokes, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/04/heat-players-nickname-themselves-the-heatles/\">this is a real phrase they attempted to coin</a>). In the matter of a few days, James and the Heat established themselves as the newest villains in the NBA.</p><p>It was enough to make fans forget that the Heat actually had a long history well before James made his Decision. Well, OK, it's not an incredibly long one, considering that the Heat, like so many Florida sports franchises, were the product of possibly overambitious league expansion, forming in 1988. Unlike <a href=\"http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=tb\">other expansion teams in Florida</a>, though, the Heat have formed a bit of history. Since most of the early stuff involves dreadfully dull postseason series with the New York Knicks, let's skip ahead to 2003, when the franchise drafted a talented young shooting guard called Dwyane Wade. After he emerged as a star that first year, the Heat traded for the Lakers center and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AVaOl5vrx0\">part-time rapping genie</a> Shaquille O'Neal. With Wade and Shaq as their core, the Heat spent several years as one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference, eventually winning its first championship in 2006. After that championship, the Heat decided to keep a lineup full of aging former All-Stars mostly intact, apparently forgetting either how the aging process affects players or the fact that time is linear. By 2010, Shaq was gone, head coach Pat Riley had handed his responsibilities to his assistant, Erik Spoelstra, and it looked likely that Wade would leave for a more talented team.</p><p>Instead, Wade lobbied for the talent to come to him. First he announced he was re-signing with the Heat and that he had convinced Chris Bosh to come along. A month later came The Decision, and suddenly the Heat had transformed into the Team American Loved To Hate – and wow, were they ever so much fun to hate. When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/jun/13/miami-heat-dallas-mavericks-nowitzki\">Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals</a>, a series where James made a habit of disappearing in the fourth quarter, it somehow felt like an underdog victory (because nothing screams \"true underdogs\" like a Dallas-based team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban\">bankrolled by a billionaire mogul</a>).</p><p>That loss might have been the best thing to happen to the Heat, as James elevated his game the following year. In 2012's playoffs he played the best basketball of his, or any NBA player's, career <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/08/lebron-james-good-job-good-effort\">in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals, against the Boston Celtics</a>. The Heat went on to only lose one more game, Game One of the finals, against the Oklahoma City Thunder, on their way to a second championship. LeBron finally had his ring.</p><h2>How they got there</h2><p>How did the Heat get to their third straight NBA Finals? Oh no big deal, just being the best team in basketball for most of the year. After clinching the best record in the NBA during the regular season, a stint that included a 27-game win streak (good for second all-time in NBA history) the Heat were awarded the No 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. This gave them an opening series against the eighth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, who basically only made it to the postseason because the rules required eight teams from each conference. (The Heat also will have home court advantage in the finals, meaning the first two games, the sixth game and a potential Game Seven will all be at their American Airlines Arena.)</p><p>Surprising nobody, the Heat swept the Bucks in four, moving on to face the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were supposed to be Heat-killers, but were playing without point guard Derrick Rose, who was still recovering from an ACL injury suffered in last year's playoffs. When the Bulls caught the Heat by surprise in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">an extremely physical Game 1 and pulled off an unexpected victory</a>, it looked like the potential start of an unexpectedly great series. James and the Heat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/09/miami-heat-nba-playoffs-chicago-bulls-game-2\">quickly put an end to the tomfoolery with a blowout Game 2 win</a>, and proceeded to win the next three games to advance to the Eastern Conference finals, to face the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>The Eastern Conference finals turned out to be more competitive than most expected. The Pacers benefited from breakthrough performances by center Roy Hibbert and Paul \"John Ringo\" George, while taking advantage of subpar play from Wade and Bosh, who were both playing through injuries. The Pacers were able to counter every Heat victory with a win of their own, pushing the finals to a Game 7. The good news is that after James basically kept his team alive for most of the series, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/04/indiana-pacers-miami-heat-game-7-live\">he finally received help from Wade and other teammates in a Game 7 victory on Monday night</a>. The bad news is that because of their protracted, physical battle with the Pacers, this banged-up Heat team only earned a few days to prepare for Thursday night's Game 1 of the NBA Finals, while the Spurs ran out of game tape to study in preparation so long ago that they have had time to catch up on the Game of Thrones episodes remaining on their DVR.</p><h2>Probable starters</h2><p><strong>LeBron James</strong>, power forward: What's there to say? Holy cow, what isn't there to say? He's been the league MVP for two years in a row, he's the reigning NBA finals MVP, he led Team USA to a gold medal in last summer's Olympics, he's on this year's All-Defense first team, oh and there's that <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/sportsman/12/02/lebron-james-2012-sportsman/index.html\">Sports Illustrated's sportsman of the year thing</a> … OK, you get the idea, there's a lot of compelling evidence out there that suggests that the dude knows how to play basketball. If Tim Duncan is arguably the best player of his generation, it seems almost certain that James will be recognized as the best player of his. The Spurs most likely will just accept that James will be good for around 30 points a game, and focus on stopping his more mortal teammates, starting with …</p><p><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong>, shooting guard: Before LeBron's arrival, Wade was the man in Miami, even earning some Michael Jordan comparisons as he led the Heat to their first championship, in 2006. Since The Decision, injuries have taken their toll, establishing him as the clear sidekick in his partnership with James. He's still a pesky and dangerous playmaker, although his effectiveness of late has been sapped by a knee injury that the Spurs certainly will exploit.</p><p>Since The Decision, Wade has also taken what in the pro-wrestling world would be called \"a heel turn\". Wade's reputation has changed from likable young superstar to <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/general/blog/gregg-doyel/22311531/way-of-wade-flopping-dirty-plays-for-the-win\">being considered one of the dirtiest players in the league</a>. The moral: never trust a guy who doesn't know how to spell his own first name.</p><p><strong>Chris Bosh</strong>, center: Miami's canary in the coalmine. You can tell how well the Heat are doing just by checking his numbers in games where all of the Big Three are playing. If Bosh is ineffective, the Heat are simply a very good team. If Bosh is racking up his fair share of points and rebounds, the Heat are an unstoppable offensive juggernaut. Bosh is routinely picked on for being an unconventional NBA big man – he's more tall than he is imposing – and for having the least impressive resume of the Big Three. Ignore the criticism and the played out, (<a href=\"http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2009/03/shaqs-nickname-for-chris-bosh-rupaul/\">often transphobic</a>) jokes: there's a reason the Heat ran into trouble when Bosh was out with an abdominal injury in the 2012 playoffs. but became nearly unbeatable when he made his way back into the lineup. The Heat have to hope that <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/5/29/4375446/chris-bosh-injury-heat-pacers-nba-playoffs-2013\">his ankle issue doesn't become a huge factor</a> in this series.</p><p>And then there's this:</p><p><em></em></p><p><strong>Mario Chalmers</strong>, point guard: The Heat list Chalmers as the point guard, but that doesn't really cover it. His true position is being <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304898704577478900746815584.html\">the Most Yelled At Person In Basketball</a>. It's both a blessing and a curse to be in the starting lineup with three possible Hall of Famers all begging to get the ball from you.</p><p><strong>Udonis Haslem</strong>, power forward: Along with Wade, Haslem is the last remaining member of the 2006 championship team. He has had a resurgence in the Eastern Conference finals, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/27/dwyane-wade-udonis-haslem-heat-pacers\">coming up with hist two best postseason games since those heady days of '06</a>. Don't expect him to score in the double-digits again during the NBA finals, especially since that would probably mean that one or more of James, Wade or Bosh wasn't being healthy or productive.</p><h2>Bench players</h2><p><strong>Ray Allen</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Chris Andersen</strong> (power forward); <strong>Joel Anthony</strong> (center); <strong>Shane Battier</strong> (small forward); <strong>Norris Cole</strong> (point guard); <strong>Juwan Howard</strong> (power forward); <strong>James Jones</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Rashard Lewis</strong> (power forward); <strong>Mike Miller</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Jarvis Varnado</strong> (power forward)</p><p><strong>Key guys</strong>: Hall of Fame-bound <strong>Ray Allen</strong> was supposed to be the big free agent signing for the Heat over the summer, but the guard (and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNJtcD-vaK4\">much better actor than Shaq</a>) who owns the title for most three-pointers in NBA history has gone through an extended cold streak in the postseason. Miami have to hope that his productive first-half performance in Game 7 against the Pacers is a sign of things to come. </p><p>Despite the fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/23/lebron-james-chris-birdman-andersen-miami-heat\">his tattoos, mohawks and on-court demeanor make him look like at best a sideshow geek and at worst a particularly irredeemable inmate on Oz</a>, <strong>Chris \"Birdman\" Andersen</strong> has actually been the Heat's most valuable bench player, contributing big on defense and making all of his shots during the Eastern Conference finals. Unless they want to see more of <strong>Joel Anthony</strong>, the Heat have to hope that he's learned something from his Game 6 suspension for shoving Tyler Hansbrough. (Spoiler alert: He hasn't.)</p><p><strong>Shane Battier</strong> and <strong>Mike Miller</strong> were the key bench guys in last year's NBA finals – their three-point shooting was a big part of why the Heat were able to take out the Thunder in just five games. Second-year standout <strong>Norris Cole</strong> has hit some big shots over the course of the season – the Heat just have to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/flo-ridas-manager-was-ejected-from-game-in-miami-511163837\">keep him away from rapper Flo Rida's manager</a>. <strong>Juwan Howard</strong> is apparently not retired. Who knew?</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Head coach </h2><p><strong>Erik Spoelstra</strong>: In the NBA, there's a very thin line between being a coach of the year candidate and being unemployed – just ask Spoelstra. Although he has been the Heat's head coach since 2008, his job seemed in jeopardy when the LeBron-led team failed to live up to expectations. Following the finals loss in 2011 and bumps in the road in the 2012 playoffs, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK61-XZWwHc\">most notably his on-court tussling with Wade</a>, there was talk that Spoelstra was too young and inexperienced to get the most out of his star-packed lineup. The speculation was that team vice president Pat Riley would step back in and relieve Spoelstra of his duties as head coach (as he did with Stan Van Gundy during their championship run of 2005-06).</p><p>Instead the 2012 Heat won it all, giving Spoelstra enough cache to experiment in 2013. Realizing the kind of talent he had to work with, Spoelstra's starting lineups were more suggestions to his players than definitive roles. Most notably, he's been playing James in positions other than his \"natural\" role as a small forward, creating nightmarish defensive matchups for other teams. In other words, no matter how these NBA finals go, Spoelstra won't have to be constantly looking back at Riley, at least not unless <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/articles/pat-riley-glares-at-1988-bottle-of-hair-gel-as-he,18582/\">he needs any hairstyling tips</a>.</p><h2>SAN ANTONIO SPURS</h2><h2>Who are they?</h2><p>The Spurs might just be the most successful NBA franchise of the 21st century, having appeared in four NBA finals since 1999 and having won four NBA finals since 1999 – a decent enough track record. They have made the playoffs every year since drafting power forward Tim Duncan, benefiting from the fact that the core group of Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have played their entire NBA careers with the franchise. Despite all this, <a href=\"http://theshadowleague.com/articles/nobody-checks-for-the-spurs-because-they-ve-made-it-that-way\">they have been saddled with a reputation for being \"boring\"</a>. Of course, fans of most basketball teams could only wish that their teams were this level of \"boring\".</p><p>The Spurs have been around in some form since 1967, when they started as the Dallas Chaparrals in the American Basketball Association (think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJVF7fWZRMg\">Will Ferrell in \"Semi-Pro\"</a>, if you're among the six or seven people who have seen that movie). In 1973, the franchise moved to San Antonio and became the Spurs, presumably because executives were tired of trying to explain what the heck a Chaparral was.* The Spurs joined the NBA in 1976, when the ABA merged in.</p><p>The Spurs' modern history doesn't begin until the 1996-97 season, when they were so terrible, almost certainly on purpose, they were able to secure the top pick in the 1997 draft, which they used on Wake Forest power forward Tim Duncan. The Spurs <a href=\"http://www.warriorsworld.net/2013/05/29/the-mirror-effect-warriors-and-spurs/\">built around Duncan over the next year</a>, being especially successful in the international market, drafting France's Parker and Argentina's Ginobili. They have gone on to win the NBA finals in 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007, which has been enough to at least discuss \"dynasty\" talk (which is a big important word among people paid talk about sports, for some reason – see also \"elite quarterback\" and \"ace pitcher\"). The keys to the Spurs' success have been consistency, unselfish play and a strong emphasis on basketball fundamentals. OK, when put that way, this actually does sound a little boring, but it's the kind of boring that wins championships.</p><p>* <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparrals\">According to Wikipedia</a> a chaparral is \"a shrubland or heathland plant community found primarily in the US state of California and in the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico\". Yeah, this just screams basketball, doesn't it? No wonder the ABA didn't last.</p><h2>How they got there</h2><p>The Spurs weren't talked about as favorites in the Western Conference at the start of the season, despite the fact that the previous year they went on a 20-game winning streak from <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0803/nba.longest.winning.streaks/content.3.html\">the end of the regular season to Game 2 of the Western Conference finals</a>. The West seemed wide open: Kevin Durant and the Thunder were reigning conference champions, the Lakers had improved by managing a trade for superstar center Dwight Howard, and the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies looked like much improved ballclubs. Meanwhile, the Spurs looked to be just another year older.</p><p>The Spurs being the Spurs, all they did was win games, staying on top of the standings most of the year. In fact, the only reason the Thunder ended up having the best record in the Western Conference by season's end was that Parker and Ginobili missed time due to injuries in the last two months of the season. The Spurs settled for second place, which ended up being a blessing in disguise as they faced the seventh-seeded Lakers rather than the eighth-seeded Houston Rockets. The Lakers were the perfect first-round opponent, suffering from both the loss of their best player, Kobe Bryant, and from the presence of Howard, whose first year in LA ended up a complete disaster. The Spurs swept the Lakers in four games.</p><p>The only real challenge to the Spurs during the postseason were the Golden State Warriors, in the second round. The much younger Warriors looked like they had a chance to pull out a win, mostly because Golden State's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2X9XdInbo\">Steph Curry would go on stretches</a> where it seemed like he was playing a game called \"Let's Find A Place On The Court Where I Won't Make This Shot\" … and losing badly. Despite looking shaky in the first two home games of the series, the Spurs' experience won out over the Warriors' younger roster and San Antonio clinched the series in Game 6.</p><p>The Spurs moved on to the Western Conference finals, facing the Memphis Grizzlies, who had done them a favor by knocking off Kevin Durant, the second best player in the NBA, and the Thunder (a task made easier after point guard Russell Westbrook suffered a season-ending injury the round before). The Spurs and Grizzlies looked like an even match on paper – and the Spurs swept for the second time in three postseasons series. That was on 27 May, which means that in the last week and a half you and I have played exactly as many seconds in an official NBA game as anyone on the Spurs roster. </p><h2>Probable starters</h2><p><strong>Tim Duncan</strong>, power forward: What's there to say? No seriously, what is there to say? Duncan is one of the greatest players in NBA history, perhaps the best power forward of all time. He has been the most important player in one of the most successful teams, and is a major reason why these Spurs have won four championships and are four games away from winning No 5. Perhaps only Kobe Bryant rivals him as the best player of his generation, although they have come to represent the exact opposite types of players. While Bryant has gotten the label of being selfish, concerned more with his own statistics and accomplishments, Duncan has been regarded as the epitome of a team player. If Duncan doesn't get nearly as much media attention as Bryant, well, he also doesn't get nearly as much criticism. </p><p>OK, well he still gets tagged with the \"boring\" label, but even that piece of criticism is a bit of a backhanded compliment. Duncan is so good that he makes basketball not only seem easy, but downright boring. Duncan's nickname, the Big Fundamental, reflects the fact that his lengthy resume of winning seasons, championships, and All-Star appearances isn't built on moments of flashy brilliance but rather his well-rounded game and remarkable consistency. </p><p><strong>Tony Parker</strong>, point guard: Although these Spurs are still Duncan's team, Parker – born in Belgium but raised in France – has emerged as the Spurs' best player in recent years, partly because the 31-year-old point guard is reaching his peak as Duncan and Ginobili ease into elder-statesmen roles. Parker, who was drafted in 2001, has always been a great point guard, but in recent years he has grown as a scorer. The last time he was in action he was scoring 37 points in a successful attempt to end the Grizzlies' season.</p><p>Parker also more than makes up for his other teammates' off-the-court anonymity. Most notably, he was married to the Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria for several years, putting him in the tabloid spotlight until their divorce in late 2010. (Parker reportedly was cheating on her with the wife of one of his teammates, a detail that has done little to change American stereotypes about the French – or about basketball players, for that matter.) More recently, Parker made the headlines for the wrong reasons again when his Olympics run with France was put in jeopardy after he suffered an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/tony-parker-sues-nightclub-over-injury-from-drake-chris-brown-fight/2012/06/22/gJQA6cSIvV_blog.html\">eye injury in a New York nightclub, when the entourages of Chris Brown and Drake got in a fight over Rihanna</a>. The moral, as always, is that Chris Brown ruins everything.</p><p><strong>Tiago Splitter</strong>, center: The Brazilian, despite having a name that sounds like an ill-fated secondary pitch made up by a struggling pitcher, bounced around Brazil and Spain before making his debut with the Spurs in 2011. The big man has developed into the Spurs' center, starting 58 games during the regular season.</p><p><strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong>, small forward: Acquired in a trade that sent George Hill to the Pacers, a trade neither team currently regrets, Leonard has been a breakthrough player for the Spurs this season. His defense was a big reason that the Grizzlies' offense was often stymied during the conference finals, so much so that he would probably be a person of interest if basketball investigators looked into the mysterious May disappearance of Grizzles forward Zach Randolph.</p><p><strong>Danny Green</strong>, shooting guard: Measure once, cut twice? It took a long time for Green to stick in the majors. He was cut twice, first by the Cavaliers and then by the Spurs, before the latter gave him a second chance. In 2011-12, Green began to start more often, as the Spurs wanted to have Ginobili back in his preferred role of sixth man off the bench. By outlasting Jeff Green (Boston Celtics), Gerald Green (Indiana Pacers) and Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors), Danny has established himself as the most dangerous Green left in theplayoffs. </p><p><strong>Manu Ginobili</strong>, shooting guard: The greatest basketball player to come out of Argentina – he lead his country to a gold medal in the 2004 Olympics – Ginobili is technically not a starter, but he is second only to Duncan and Parker in terms of importance. As the sixth man, off the bench, he's one of San Antonio's biggest offensive weapons even if the 35-year-old isn't quite as reliable a shooter as he once was. He's also the player the Spurs trust the most when they have a chance to tie or win the game with a bucket. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOrIAJKpQKI\">The three-pointer Ginobili made in double overtime against the Warriors in Game 1 of theirsemifinals series</a> might very well be the biggest shot of the season so far for San Antonio.<br /><a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/05/manu-ginobilis-bald-spot-through-the-years/\"><br />Plus, his bald spot is epic.</a></p><h2>Bench players</h2><p><strong>Aron Baynes</strong> (power forward); <strong>Matt Bonner</strong> (power forward); <strong>Nando de Colo</strong> (point guard); <strong>Boris Diaw </strong>(center); <strong>Gary Neal</strong> (point guard); <strong>Cory Joseph</strong> (point guard); <strong>Dejuan Blair</strong> (center); <strong>Tracy McGrady</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Patty Mills</strong> (point guard)</p><p>There is an argument to be made – a bad argument but an argument nonetheless, that <strong>Matt Bonner</strong> was actually <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/62659/the-bonner-effect-how-shutting-down-the-spurs-shooter-could-be-the-key-for-the-grizzlies\">one of the biggest factors in the Spurs' sweep of the Grizzlies</a>. The \"Red Mamba\" provided some on-court highlights, while his Coach B clips on YouTube have provided much needed levity and something this writer likes to link to for the flimsiest of reasons:</p><p><strong>Key guys</strong>: Beyond <strong>Boris Diaw</strong>, who splits time as the Spur's big man with Tiago Splitter, the non-Ginobili/Bonner parts of the bench have been relatively quiet during the playoffs. If a game gets out of reach, always a possibility when a team is playing the Heat, <strong>Tracy McGrady,</strong> the former Houston superstar the Spurs rescued from China, shares duties with Australia's <strong>Patty Mills</strong> as either the Human Victory Cigar/Human White Flag, depending on whether the Spurs are winning big or losing big.</p><h2>Head coach </h2><p><strong>Gregg Popovich</strong>: Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs since 1996, when he committed one of the all-time greatest tanking jobs in sports history, accidentally-on-purpose guiding them to a 20-62 regular season, to put them in <a href=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Draft#How_the_draft_works\">the best possible position to pick up Tim Duncan in the draft</a>. Popovich has not suffered through a losing season since snaring Duncan, he's coached the Spurs into the playoffs on an annual basis and he has been a key part of the team's four championships. He's been awarded coach of the year in 2003 and 2012, and probably deserves more.</p><p>This success –he is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA – has allowed Popovich a lot of leeway. At this point, time and success has made his curmudgeonly persona almost lovable, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4QpIVibbGc\">with his curt, cranky in-game interviews with sideline reporters bordering on comedic performance art</a>. He has even grown powerful enough to thumb his nose at NBA commissioner David Stern. When the NBA scheduled a Spurs v Heat regular-season game at the end of a long road trip, Popovich rested most of his starters, despite the fact that the league was hyping that prime-time game as a potential NBA finals preview. (OK, so maybe this talk of \"nobody expected the Spurs to get this far\" might be a tad disingenuous.) To Popovich's credit, the ragtag group of roleplayers and benchwarmers almost pulled off a victory. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/05/stern-popovich-wizards-win-hornets-change-name\">That wasn't enough to prevent Popovich getting a hefty fine from Stern</a> (or receiving after-the-fact scorn from writers working on finals previews who really could have benefited from having a little bit more to work with before making their predictions). </p><h2>How the Spurs and Heat match up</h2><p>Um, we'll see? Although the teams have played twice this season, those games don't really tell us much, even by regular-season NBA standards. The Heat won both but the <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/games/20121129/SASMIA/gameinfo.html\">first meeting was the game where Popovich rested most of his starters</a>. In the second game, <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/games/20130331/MIASAS/gameinfo.html\">the Heat were resting Wade, James and Chalmers for legitimate injury reasons</a>. So we really have no idea of what it will look like when the 2013 version of both of these clubs meet. Hey, that might make these NBA finals more fun – it's like a flashback to what the World Series was in baseball before interleague play came along: a battle between two teams that hadn't really seen each other during the regular season.</p><p>There's some talk that the extra time off may result in the Spurs being rusty, but it seems really doubtful that this experienced team will somehow suddenly forget how to play basketball at a high level. Popovich, <a href=\"http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/tim-duncan-did-not-play-old/125796\">who once rested Duncan by putting him on the \"Did Not Play\" list for being \"old\"</a>, wouldn't have been thrilled if the Spurs had had to play a grueling seven-game series like the one the Heat barely survived. If anything, the fact that both Wade and Bosh are beat up is probably the biggest advantage the Spurs have. This will sound like a cop out, and most likely is a cop out, but the results of these finals will probably revolve around health. If Wade and Bosh are healthier and more effective than they were during the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat should be able to the defeat the Spurs. If not, the Spurs officially will have the second- and third-best players in the series in Parker and Duncan, and will have a shot at championship No 5. </p><p>It seems a bit reductive to have the NBA finals hinge on just who's healthy, but that's basically been the story of this season. This hasn't been an NBA season, it's been a horror movie. The Heat and the Spurs have made it this far, in part, because so many of the other contenders have lost key players. In the Eastern Conference, the Bulls played without Derrick Rose, the Celtics didn't have Rajon Rondo and the Pacers were without Danny Granger. It was even more pronounced in the Western Conference, where the Nuggets lost Danilo Gallinari late in the season, the Lakers lost Kobe Bryant right before the playoffs and (maybe most crucially) the Thunder lost Russell Westbrook in their very first playoff series. The Heat and the Spurs made it this far because of the injuries to other teams – it only makes sense for injuries to be the deciding factor in the game's ultimate round.</p><h2>Prediction</h2><p><em>(Warning: The following is for entertainment purposes only, specifically the entertainment of watching the writer's predictions explode in his face over the course of the next two weeks.)</em></p><p>Wade and Bosh will be more productive they were than in the Eastern Conference finals. James will have at least one monstrous performance, while averaging around 25 points a game. The Spurs will give the Heat fits, and will absolutely embarrass them in at least one game, when it will look like they have a good shot at winning the series. In the end, however, it will turn out that the Heat took care of the team with the best chance of eliminating them when they knocked out the Pacers.</p><p><strong>Miami</strong> in six.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">Guardian US will have liveblog coverage of every game</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409724515|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|d03dd2e43a0efaa3d089549d802d0317443234f8 -->",

        "headline":"NBA is right to fine but not suspend Roy Hibbert for 'no homo' slur",
        "body":"<p>Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert should have been in a celebratory mood on Sunday, after all he was a huge part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/02/heat-pacers-game-six-seven-nba-playoffs\">his team's win against the Miami Heat in Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals</a>. Instead, Hibbert was dealing with the fallout from his use of a homophobic slur during a colorful postgame press conference. On Sunday, the NBA - particularly conscious of potentially offensive language after Washington Wizards big man Jason Collins came out as gay in an April issue of Sports Illustrated - fined Hibbert $75,000 for, among other things, his use of a homophobic slur.</p><p><em></em><br />Hibbert could not have been surprised at being fined, he even began his postgame rant  on Saturday with \"I don't care if I get fined\", but he may have been somewhat surprised about the part of his comments that ended up being the most controversial. Following the Pacers' upset victory over the Heat, Hibbert unleashed an uncensored rant pointed at the media, at one point describing them using Samuel L. Jackson's favorite swear word. While Hibbert probably would have been fined for his use of \"motherfucker\", the more controversial part came later as he was describing how he defended the Miami Heat's LeBron James: <br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There was what — was it Game 3 here? I really felt that I let Paul down in terms of having his back when LeBron was scoring in the post or getting to the paint, because they stretched me out so much. No homo.</p></blockquote><p>While expecting to be fined for addressing the press with profanity, which most fans probably consider something close to a victimless crime, the more serious problem with Hibbert's remarks was his use of the derogatory phrase \"no homo\". Hibbert himself acknowledged this in his <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9334504/2013-nba-playoffs-roy-hibbert-indiana-pacers-apologizes-postgame-gay-slur\"> public apology</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I am apologizing for insensitive remarks made during the postgame press conference after our victory over Miami Saturday night. They were disrespectful and offensive and not a reflection of my personal views. I used a slang term that is not appropriate in any setting, private or public, and the language I used definitely has no place in a public forum, especially over live television. I apologize to those who I have offended, to our fans and to the Pacers' organization.</p></blockquote><p>In the last few years the NBA, like most other professional sports organizations, has become more aware of projecting an image of acceptance and tolerance of the LGBT community. The league's fine against Roy Hibbert, in fact, is roughly along the same lines as the one they issued to Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who was forced to pay $100,000 in April 2011 after <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=6344596\">he made a much more offensive gay slur on the court directly to a referee</a>.  In both of these cases, the fine was meant to be less punitive and more just to establish what the league finds acceptable. The NBA's press release emphasizes this point: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>While Roy has issued an apology, which is no doubt sincere, a fine is necessary to reinforce that such offensive comments will not be tolerated by the NBA.</p></blockquote><p>Some believe Hibbert should be suspended for his comments, notably David Zirin, who made<a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/174612/no-homo-no-way-suspend-roy-hibbert-game-7\"> a compelling argument for suspension in the Nation</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The league could send one hell of a message by saying, \"We pledged that the NBA would be a safe, nondiscriminatory atmosphere, and even though we recognize how unfair this will seem to Pacers fans and their organization, we are answering to a higher principal. Roy Hibbert therefore will not be playing Game 7.\"</p></blockquote><p>As much as I empathize with the reasons behind Zirin's stance, and would not have had any problem with the NBA had they decided to suspend Hibbert, the NBA's fine feels about right as far as punishments go. $75,000 is a large enough fine to be deterrent, but not so punitive that it feels like an overreach on NBA commissioner David Stern's part. As bad as Hibbert's choice of words were, they were off-handed remarks not made in an intentionally hateful context, making it difficult for the NBA to justify suspending a player in the middle of a playoff series for off the court reasons. If anything, a suspension could end up being counter-productive, as it would shift attention away from the subject at hand, the unacceptability of hurtful language, and towards yet another debate about whether or not the commissioner is abusing his power, given that this game is so important.</p><p>Thankfully for the league, Hibbert's comments were not anywhere in the league of former NBA star Tim Hardaway's infamous \"I don't like to be around gay people... It shouldn't be in the world for that or in the United States for it\" tirade. Had Hibbert been saying something that overtly and deliberately homophobic, Stern probably would have had little choice to suspend him for Game Seven of the Eastern Conference Finals, and the backlash to that decision could very well have done more harm than good in the short-term in providing ammunition to the \"this is Political Correctness run amok\" crowd that Zirin references in his article. (Hardaway, it should be noted, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/dave_zirin/08/22/tim.hardaway/index.html#ixzz2V7wbOuJE\">later repented and is currently one of the biggest allies the LGBT community has among current and former athletes</a>, a perfect example of the possible positive results stemming from a public outcry.)</p><p>This is not to say that the NBA will, or should, never suspend a player for bigoted language or behavior. The league will almost certainly be even more vigilant about such language in the future than it was in the past following former Washington Wizards center Jason Collins' April announcement that he was gay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/apr/30/jason-collins-comes-out-why-matters\">making him the first active player in the big four US professional sports to come out</a>. Collins' coming out is, of course, the hidden narrative behind this story. In fact, shortly after the swift negative reaction to his press conference comments, Roy Hibbert actually went to Twitter to contact Collins, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hoya2aPacer/status/341082858942767104\">seemingly with the intent of starting a dialogue about the appropriateness of his comment</a>. </p><p>While this was a very commendable move on Hibbert's part, and Collins' (private) response may very well have played some role in his apology, it also brings up a very real reason why it's important for the NBA, and all sports leagues, to create an atmosphere where gay athletes aren't afraid to be honest about themselves with the general public. With Collins being the only active player out at the moment, assuming that he is with a team next season, he will find himself being the go-to guy anytime there's any controversy revolving around LGBT rights not only within the NBA, but in the US sports scene in general. This is not only an unfair burden on Collins; it also creates the impression that one person could possibly act as the spokesperson for the entire, diverse LGBT community.</p><p>That situation will only change when more athletes are out, and that will only happen if the atmosphere around the league feels safer and more accepting than it does now. Which is exactly why the NBA should not tolerate Hibbert's \"no homo\", as benign of a phrase as it might seem to some at first. Although Hibbert, like the vast majority of those who use the phrase, most likely was not being consciously hateful, he was still expressing a statement, like the use of \"gay\" as a synonym for lame or uncool, that perpetuates the idea that being gay as a thing that one does not want to be. Beyond that, the phrase point blank includes the word \"homo\", a word which in any other context is in effect a homophobic slur. Many of Hibbert's defenders rest their argument on the fact that \"no homo\" is a phrase people use all the time without meaning anything bigoted about it, but that's all more the reason why it's a good thing that his comment has gotten this much negative attention. If you didn't know that phrase was potentially insensitive for some before, you can't honestly plead ignorance now.</p><p>In this incident, the league's fine and Hibbert's apology both feel like the best case scenario in how this incident could have played out. The NBA has made a statement that this not acceptable language, and maybe it's helped others both in and out of league think before using language that may be offensive for others. Ideally, Hibbert's slip, and the NBA's justifiable response, will end up being just one more stumbling block on the way towards a future where Jason Collins will no longer have to be the sole voice for the LGBT community among active players.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409973500|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|fc869ce313a6482b5248eb637d9d3812d659e188 -->",

And not to say that there weren't tremendous performances on show. Just little tension.</p><p>LeBron James scored 27 points, finishing two assists shy of a triple-double, as defending champions <strong>Miami Heat</strong> picked up where they left off in the NBA playoffs a year ago, never trailing on the way to beating the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong> 110-87 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference first-round series on Sunday.</p><p>Ray Allen scored 20 off the bench, Dwyane Wade scored 16 and Chris Bosh added 15 for the Heat.

        "body":"<p>Spencer Hawes had 18 points and career highs with 16 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 98-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night.</p><p>Jrue Holiday added 27 points and 12 assists to help the Sixers win for only the third time in 15 games. While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home.</p><p>The Sixers led by one at the end of the third quarter, then opened the fourth on a 19-4 run to put away the Pacers. Evan Turner and Thaddeus Young each contributed some lead-stretching buckets in the fourth to put all five starters in double figures.</p><p>Roy Hibbert had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.</p><p>The 76ers had enough this time to finish off one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They had a late lead and the Heat on the ropes until they blew it and lost by four Wednesday night.</p><p>Just like they did against Miami, the Sixers got into an early groove in the quarter to put the upset alert on notice. Dorell Wright hit a 3-pointer and Lavoy Allen came off the bench to score his first two baskets to get a big run going. They forced turnovers on consecutive possessions at one point during the spurt and built a 10-point lead.</p><p>Somehow, Hawes, the much-maligned 7-1 center, outplayed Hibbert. Hawes has settled in nicely as a starter after an erratic first 42 games as a reserve. He had a fantastic one-handed rebound right over Hibbert's head in the third that put the crowd of 18,587 on their feet. Hawes had six blocked shots through the first three quarters and made the Pacers think twice about going inside.</p><p>At San Antonio, Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113.</p><p>Manu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio, which is 1½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.</p><p>Wayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland. Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.</p><p>Neither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon, LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Detroit Pistons their eighth straight loss with a 112-101 victory.</p><p>Rodney Stuckey had a season-high 32 points for the Pistons, who have yet to win a game in March.</p><p>After trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, the Blazers took a 90-81 lead on Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 8:33 remaining in the game. Portland extended the lead to 99-87 on J.J. Hickson's dunk.</p><p>In other games Saturday, Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points in the Washington Wizards 127-105 win over the Phoenix Suns, Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Boston Celtics powered past the Charlotte Bobcats 105-88 and Gordon Hayward scored 17 points in the Utah Jazz's 90-84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405732009|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|12c21a9568c3b9e03f467deef75fb6f8d8fcf011 -->",

        "headline":"Has Dwight Howard stolen LeBron James' title as Most Unpopular Player?",
        "body":"<p>Last week the Miami Heat became the first NBA team <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/basketball/news/12375/8551252/NBA-Miami-Heat-booked-their-place-in-the-play-offs\">to clinch a postseason appearance</a>. This tells us two things. First, it tells us that the Miami Heat are really insanely good, in case anyone was still doubting that. Secondly it tells us that we're into the last stretch of the regular season when individual games start to take on greater significance. (Offer not valid in Charlotte, Sacramento, Washington D.C., Orlando or New Orleans.)</p><h2>Dwight Howard is still not winning friends and influencing people</h2><p>When LeBron James finally won his first championship last year, it seemed to mark the end of his reign as the Most Hated Superstar in the NBA. Winning tends to silence critics. There was no official announcement or ceremony, but over the past year Lakers center Dwight Howard has done everything in his power to earn that dubious honor. Once the Magic's franchise player, Howard wore out his welcome in Orlando by demanding to be traded at times and making public gestures hinting he was willing to stay at other times. The Orlando Magic, eventually tired of this behavior, finally traded Howard to the Lakers over the summer, but not before they fired the team's head coach and GM in one last attempt to placate Howard. The way Howard left Orlando tarnished his public image, earning him labels such as \"difficult\" and \"coach-killer\", a reputation that has only gotten worse during his brief time with the struggling Lakers.</p><p>Tuesday night, Howard returned to Orlando for the first time as a member of the Lakers. Both franchises have been struggling since the trade. The Lakers, despite being stacked with Hall of Famers, are trying to sneak into the playoffs as the number eight seed while the Howard-less Magic have been forced into an indefinite rebuilding phase. This \"homecoming\" would have been contentious no matter what, but Howard, who has an almost uncanny ability to make bad situations even worse, didn't help things with <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/03/07/dwight-howard-orlando-magic-los-angeles-lakers/1969913/\">this comment</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> \"My team in Orlando was a team full of people who nobody wanted, and I was the leader and I led that team with a smile on my face\". </p></blockquote><p>There may be no more telling fact about how Howard is perceived by his fellow players than how quickly and bluntly Howard's former teammates responded. Jameer Nelson was quoted in the Orlando Sentinel as saying \"when are you going to take ownership and stay out of the media in a professional manner?\" (Note: This line about staying out of the media may have more sting if Nelson wasn't, well, speaking to the media.) J.J. Redick, the Magic shooting guard who was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of the rebuilding process, was, if anything, even more blunt: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I would be more surprised when Dwight starts taking responsibility. That would be the most negative thing I can say, but that's the truth. You can't take all the credit and not accept any of the blame.\"</p></blockquote><p>At this point there's nothing really Howard can say or do off the court that will rehabilitate his image. If Howard is truly concerned with how the public sees him, and by all accounts he very much is, he is going to have to follow LeBron James's example and come through in big games. On Tuesday night, with all eyes on him, Howard came through with one of his best games in a Lakers uniform, scoring 39 points and 16 rebounds in a 106-97 win over his old team. A few more of those games could go a long way.</p><h2>We are no longer accepting nominations for Dunk of the Year</h2><p>Brandon Knight's Sunday was so lousy that he <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2013/03/12/brandon-knight-detroit-pistons-sprained-ankle/1981083/\">sprained his ankle the next day</a> and it was still a major improvement. On Sunday night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers, the Detroit Pistons guard attempted, and failed, to contest DeAndre Jordan's Dunk of the Year.</p><p><em></em></p><p>As sometimes happens when a player gets posterized, Knight became the punchline of the night. On Twitter the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPBrandonKnight&amp;src=typd\">#RIPBrandonKnight</a> started trending. Indeed, Knight's fall to the floor after his entirely futile attempt to stop Jordan does indeed somewhat resemble a particularly hammy extra dropping dead in an action movie.</p><p>Because this is the age of the internet, the jokes at Knight's expense jump-started an immediate backlash. As many pointed out, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--basketball-s-backward-culture-makes-punch-line-of-brandon-knight-for-trying-to-stop-deandre-jordan-s-dunk-174058736.html\">most notably Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski</a>, Brandon Knight's sin was doing his job on the defensive end. Maybe Knight wasn't making the smartest play, but it's hard to fault a guy for being willing to risk public humiliation trying to stop the opponent from scoring.</p><p>Then, of course, there was the backlash to the backlash. Deadspin, as you might imagine, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/geez-lighten-up-francis-quoth-adrian-wojnarowski-f-452430474?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">was solidly in the pro-ridicule camp</a>. Mike Prada of SB Nation <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/3/11/4090558/deandre-jordan-dunk-brandon-knight-pistons\">made a convincing case</a> that Knight did not, in fact, make the right play. In the end the best response to Brandon Knight's YouTube infamy and Twitter demise came from Knight himself. After the game, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonKnight07/status/311001874239221760\"> Knight tweeted</a>:</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Derrick Rose might return soon, Amar'e Stoudemire definitely won't</h2><p>Even though doctors have cleared Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose to play, it's uncertain when, or if, he will actually appear in a game. Rose, the 2011 MVP, has been recovering from an ACL injury suffered in last year's playoffs. Rose says that he has no set return date and his limitations are mental rather than physical. \"I can do everything,\" <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/chi-chicago-bulls-derrick-rose-20130312,0,7117005.story\">Rose told the Chicago Tribune</a>. \"It's just me having the confidence to do it and me feeling normal\".</p><p>This clearly doesn't sound like a player who is eager to play anytime soon, and it might be in the Bulls' best interests not to rush him back. Head coach Tom Thibodeau has done a great job this year working with a roster that was designed to work around Rose, not without him. Most notably, Joakim Noah and Luol Deng have become All-Stars in Rose's absence. Still, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16685178-419/morrissey-sorry-thibs-bulls-even-with-rose-arent-title-contenders.html\">this Bulls team doesn't seem like it could beat the Miami Heat in a seven game series </a>without Rose at 100%. Unless Rose has access to Kobe Bryant's mysterious German doctor or Vijay Singh's supply of deer antler spray, that seems unlikely. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bulls/post/_/id/12490/bulls-rose-need-to-decide-in-near-future\">The Bulls could very well punt on this season rather than risking losing Rose</a>.</p><p>One NBA player who is not going to be coming back any time soon is the New York Knicks' Amar'e Stoudemire, who has now had surgery on both knees in the same season (as far as we know, these injuries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/03/amare-stoudemire-fire-extinguisher-paul-pierce-tebows\">are not fire extinguisher related</a>). It's very likely that the Stoudemire will not be available until the postseason, if then. Hey, at least head coach Mike Woodson no longer has to worry about trying to get him and Carmelo Anthony on the same page anymore. </p><p>Of course, no team is better off without an offensive threat like Amar'e Stoudemire. If Stoudemire's not available and reasonably effective in the postseason, this Knicks season that began so promising could end in yet another brief and insubstantial playoff run. Unfortunately for the Knicks' future, Stoudemire's contract is literally guaranteed to be neither brief nor insubstantial, he's owed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemires-absence-hurts-knicks-offense.html?_r=0\">$45.1 million over the next two seasons</a>. Even before this latest setback, Stoudemire had a reputation for being injury prone, a trend that's not likely to improve now that he's on the wrong side of 30. In other words, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/03/new-york-yankees-alex-rodriguez-hip-injury\">the Knicks might have the basketball equivalent of Alex Rodriguez </a>in their hands.</p><h2>Signs point towards a Western Conference Finals rematch</h2><p>For months now the conversation has been about whether or not the Oklahoma City Thunder have enough to match up with the Miami Heat in the playoffs. This conversation, however, assumes that the Thunder will return to the NBA Finals, that may not be a sure thing considering how the San Antonio Spurs have been playing. The Thunder may be the best team in the West, and Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook make them the most dangerous one, but here it is in early March and the Thunder have yet to overtake the Spurs for that top spot in the Western Conference.</p><p>Monday night, the Spurs defeated the Thunder in San Antonio 105-93. It's just one win, a home win at that, but it was still a statement game from the Spurs, a message that they were not planning on giving up that number one seed. The Spurs, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/06/miami-heat-unbeaten-tony-parker-out\">as noted last week</a>, have been at a disadvantage without their best player, point guard Tony Parker. So far the Spurs have won three out of four games without their MVP candidate. If this were another team that might be surprising, but the Spurs are the one team that you can never count out.</p><p>The Western Conference felt wide open during the first half of the season. The Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets and the Memphis Grizzlies all had stretches where they looked like they could be dark horses, but it's looking more and more likely that Oklahoma City and San Antonio are the two best teams in the conference. Anything other than a Thunder/Spurs rematch in the Western Conference Finals would be something of an upset.</p><h2>Other things we've learned</h2><p>• After the Boston Celtics lost Rajon Rondo, Jared Sulinger and Leandro Barbosa for the season, many speculated that GM Danny Ainge would re-sign former Celtics such as Keyon Dooling, Delonte West or Brian Scalabrine to get them through the second half of the season. As it turns out, Scalabrine himself, currently an analyst with CSN New England, tried to sell Ainge on the idea of a comeback. During a conference call to promote Sky Sports' Sunday NBA double-header, Scalabrine elaborated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> I was asking him \"Come on DA, nobody knows this system like me... just give a 10-day man\", but to no avail. He gave me some good advice. \"If you do broadcasting and then go back to playing, and then you go back to broadcasting sports people don't take you serious…. I think he was a little bit right about just focusing on what I'm doing now and trying to improve as a broadcaster.</p></blockquote><p>Sadly there will be no SCAL-A-BRINE chants during the end of blowouts this season, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiWvSQzCo0A\">but at least Celtics fans still have Gino</a>.</p><p>• Speaking of Delonte West, Sam Riches <a href=\"http://www.theclassical.org/articles/waiting-for-delonte\">wrote a pretty thoughtful piece</a> for the Classical about West specifically, and mental health issues in basketball in general.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5989639/stone+cold-kobe-bryant-only-thing-i-fear-is-bees?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">The only thing that scares Kobe Bryant? Bees.</a> So I'm guessing that's at least one vote in favor of the New Orleans Hornets becoming the Pelicans.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/demarcus-cousins-ejected-elbow-mike-dunleavy-head-team-200625665--nba.html\">DeMarcus Cousins is still DeMarcus Cousins.</a></p><p>• Monstrous Three-Pointer Display of the Week: The Brooklyn Nets' Deron Williams was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw8c5SmcvJo\">one man Three-Pointer Contest</a> against the Washington Wizards, hitting 11 in the game, setting a NBA record for the most threes in a half by hitting 9 of them before halftime.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405310784|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|5faa28a21f2d15edfc958f06a6f02430ba7c15d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>So, the 2013 NBA Trade Deadline has come and gone and, for all the talk about Dwight Howard/Paul Pierce/Josh Smith being on the move, nothing much has changed. Unless you believe that J.J. Redick changing his zip code from Orlando to Milwaukee is earth-shattering, there were not any major moves on Thursday. So now, most major moves will happen when a player returns from injury (hello Danny Granger), presumed retirement (hello Derek Fisher) or from elsewhere (hey <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/26/dennis-rodman-north-korea\">Dennis Rodman is apparently going to be playing in North Korea</a>). In other words, the only major player movement happening in your favorite team might be limited to their participation in surreal viral internet memes.</p><h2>The 2013 Trade Deadline was mostly dead</h2><p>The trade deadline is supposed to be the time of year when bad teams looking to rebuild trade away their movable parts to teams in the playoff hunt looking for difference-making players. This year, teams mostly did... nothing really. Unless you happen to have been a huge Duke supporter during the J.J. Redick era, no big names were moved and no teams did anything super drastic. In fact some have called last Thursday \"<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/trade-deadline-worst-ever-003028760--nba.html\">the worst trade deadline in NBA history</a>\".</p><p>So, let's go over \"the big trade\" where the Orlando Magic sent sharp-shooter J.J. Redick to the Milwaukee Bucks.<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/breaking-down-very-dull-moves-2013-nba-trade-231029970--nba.html\"> In the trade Orlando packaged Redick with Gustavo Ayon and Ish Smith for Beno Udrih, Tobias Harris and Doron Lamb</a>. The most important thing to take out of this deal is that yes, really, all of those names just mentioned in fact belong to professional basketball players. Every slow trade deadline is just a learning opportunity in disguise. It's not a bad trade for either team, Redick will be a free agent this summer so this allows the Magic, who aren't going anywhere, to get something back from the three-point machine. It's a decent get for the Milwaukee Bucks who could make some noise in the playoffs, but it's not a move likely to have any big time ramifications.</p><p>In fact the most controversial move of the dead deadline occurred the day before when, <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8970449/the-trade-deadline-exchange-part-1\">the Sacramento Kings sent Thomas Robinson, their struggling first round draft pick, along with Tyler Honeycutt and Francisco Garcia to the Houston Rockets for cash and a handful of spare parts</a> (Patrick Patterson, Toney Douglas, Cole Aldrich). What are the Sacramento Kings doing? Well, the answer is saving money. At this point, with the Kings likely to move to Seattle and become the SuperSonics, ownership is not really interested in moves that benefit the club in any way beyond financial. So, in basketball terms it does not make sense that the Kings would abandon their fifth overall pick after only four months or so of disappointing play, but it may just be that ownership is already in \"just don't care anymore\" mode. You're welcome Houston.</p><p>In retrospect, maybe it was just sports media wishful thinking to assume that the Los Angeles Lakers were actually going to trade away Dwight Howard so soon after trading for him, even if Howard doesn't seem to be fitting in with the team and could sign somewhere else as a free agent this off-season. Some expected GM Danny Ainge to \"blow up\" the Boston Celtics after they lost Rajon Rondo for the season, but the team has played well enough without Rondo that Ainge could afford to indulge his sentimental side and keep both Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett for the umpteenth trade deadline. Heck, the C's even added a piece by getting Jordan Crawford from the Washington Wizards <a href=\"http://greenstreet.weei.com/sports/boston/basketball/celtics/2013/02/21/what-jordan-crawford-can-do-for-celtics/\">for the contract of a guy who can't play and a big dude who exists just to eat up fouls.</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/2/21/4014574/josh-smith-nba-trade-deadline-hawks-bucks\"><br />Even Josh Smith didn't go anywhere.</a></p><p>The reason why this NBA trading deadline was so dead? Well, the season's biggest trades, by far, were made before the season even began. Dwight Howard had already been moved once, from the Magic to the Lakers, a move that has generated at least one third of the storylines of this NBA season. Then the Oklahoma City Thunder made a surprise trade before the start of the regular season, sending James Harden to the Houston Rockets after the team could not work out an extension. That was two All-Stars traded away right before a single game could be played. Then, shortly before the trading deadline, the cash-cutting Memphis Grizzlies, who had one of the few desirable pieces that could be traded in Rudy Gay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/feb/06/rudy-gay-memphis-grizzlies-toronto-raptors\">sent their best scorer to the Toronto Raptors</a>. So, not only had the NBA season already seen two superstars moved at the height of their value before it had even began, one of their few other possible trade targets was moved a few weeks before the official deadline. So it really hasn't been a bad season for NBA trades at all, it's just been a matter of unusual timing.</p><h2>Danny Granger returned to the Pacers</h2><p>Saturday night, Indiana Pacers swingman Danny Granger returned to the floor after recovering from a knee injury. In his triumphant return against the Detroit Pistons, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/24/danny-granger-hits-one-of-his-10-shot-attempts-in-return-from-injury-and-his-teammates-are-ecstatic-video/\">last season's key Pacers scorer ended up hitting one shot... out of ten</a>. Okay, so it was not the storybook return his teammates were probably hoping for, but the Pacers still won the game and kept pace as the second seed in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Even though the Heat seem to have a stranglehold on the Eastern conference, certainly someone has to face them in the Eastern Conference Finals, and why couldn't it be this well-balanced Indiana Pacers team? After all, there was a point last season where it looked like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/18/indiana-pacers-beat-miami-heat-nba-playoffs\">the Pacers could have done the improbable and knocked out the Heat in the second round</a>, and they've become a much more rounded team in Granger's absence. It could be that nobody gives credit to the Pacers because they don't have the big market or the star power of Carmelo Anthony's New York Knicks teams and they don't have an intriguing X-factor like the divisional rival Chicago Bulls, who may or may not see the return of savior Derrick Rose this season. </p><p>The other reason people aren't giving credit to this Pacers team? Well the Miami Heat have been running away with this whole conference thing, and it's hard to give credit for the first runner-up in what is essentially a one man race. As of Tuesday, the Pacers were seven games in the loss column behind the Heat in the Eastern Conference Standings. That's the exact number of games in the loss column the eighth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks are behind Indiana. In other words, barring a key Miami injury, everyone else in the conference is essentially fighting over that second spot.</p><p>Still, bolstered by an All-Star season from Paul George and an All-Star caliber season from David West, this has been an Indiana Pacers team to overlook at one's own peril. Now,with Granger returning from injury, these 1-for-10 shooting nights will probably be a rarity, the thought is that center Roy Hibbert's season can only get better from here and that the Pacers should be a tough out in the playoffs. Will that be enough to stop LeBron James? Who knows, but \"will anything be enough to stop LeBron James?\" seems to be the question this year.</p><p>Monday evening <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ4UqLAwz5g\">the Pacers found themselves in an epic fight with the Warriors</a>. Well, that's one way for Roy Hibbert to start making an impression on the court again.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>The NBA welcomed back Derek Fisher</h2><p>If, in the wake of Billy Hunter's ousting, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/feb/20/jerry-buss-la-lakers-girls-cheerleaders\">Derek Fisher's career as union president comes to an end</a>, at least it looks like he will have his old job as a backup plan. The Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps seeing the success the New York Knicks have had with Rasheed Wallace and Jason Kidd, or the Los Angeles Clippers have had with Grant Hill, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8992010/derek-fisher-rejoins-oklahoma-city-thunder-not-planning-retiring\">have signed veteran guard Fisher</a> to give them some depth for the remainder of the season. Or maybe Oklahoma just looked up in the standings to the Western Conference leading San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim \"DNP - Old\" Duncan, and noticed the veteran experience gap.</p><p>This, of course, is one of the ramifications of the end of the NBA Trading Deadline: since teams can no longer make straight trades they have to be a bit creative in filling roster needs. In some cases, this means teams signing players who get cut by their old teams, in other cases this means scouring the D-League or China for anybody that could be remotely useful, and oftentimes this means hooking back up with players whose retirements were either not voluntary or not permanent. Although Fisher asked the Dallas Mavericks to waive him earlier in the year to \"spend more time with his family\", apparently being offered a chance to return to the NBA Finals, and the possibility of a sixth title, was enough to get him back in action.</p><p>While Fisher probably won't be a major player for the Thunder, the team that may be the biggest obstacle in the Miami Heat's quest to win back-to-back as NBA championships certainly couldn't hurt to have a little bit of veteran leadership. Head coach Scott Brooks all but admits this: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"We're not looking for him to score... we're just looking for him to be one of those intangible players, those winning basketball players\". </p></blockquote><p>In other words, Derek Fisher's contributions to the Thunder might amount to little more than telling Kevin Durant \"here's a story about what a young guard named Kobe Bryant did in a similar situation\" to the younger players, but that might be all the Thunder need.</p><h2>The Raptors win...the Harlem Shake competition at least</h2><p>This column was not going to discuss the Harlem Shake. </p><p>It was well aware of the viral video sensation, where at first an ignored goofy figure dances to a song alone before being joined in the second act by a cast of colorful characters going crazy. This column was not going to provide any links to such examples, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzl7inEmE3I\">not even you Dallas Mavericks</a>, because there's nothing lamer than an out-of-touch writer clumsily attempting to explain a viral internet meme at this point in its existence. Just read the opening sentence of this paragraph for an example. The only possibly reactions at this stage would be for this writer to embrace the Shake by declaring it the \"new Gangnam Style\", or to savagely mock it by declaring it the \"new Gangnam Style\". In any case, the result would be like when you hear someone over 50 have a really strong opinion about a One Direction song, whether it's positive or negative it just seems really weird. </p><p><em></em><br />Then Amir Johnson of the Toronto Raptors <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/25/harlem-shake-toronto-raptors-amir-johnson-dwane-casey/?sct=uk_t2_a12\">produced his own version</a> of the Harlem Shake, and mostly thanks to a deadpan performance from coach Dwane Casey, well, the results transcend the genre (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPLc29pRpJY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">nice try 2013 All-Star Game</a>).</p><p>Of course, why not have some fun if you're the Toronto Raptors. Nobody expects anything from you this season, but you've been hanging around the ninth and tenth seed all season long. Management, rightly or wrongly, believes in you enough to have brought in Rudy Gay (and, um, Sebastian Telfair who was <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/page2/s/wiley/030708.html\">compared to LeBron James at one time</a> believe it or not). If nothing else, this proves that the Toronto Raptors, a team whose very name was the result of a short-lived \"Jurassic Park\" fad, should be the go-to NBA team for all future internet memes of uncertain duration.</p><h2>Other Things We've Learned</h2><p>• For the record, I wish the craze had been the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHSURA2RCAQ\">\"Harlem Shuffle\".</a> Don't laugh, if LeBron James <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI6_es6Lkow\">broke out with this</a> next Heat game, we could get Bob &amp; Earl back on the Billboard charts by next week. He can do that, he's at the height of his powers now.</p><p>• The newest person to criticize the struggling, Andrew Bynum-less Philadelphia 76ers? That would be Doug Collins, who just happens to be the head coach of the struggling, Andrew Bynum-less Philadelphia 76ers. Following a loss to the Orlando Magic, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/sixers/index.ssf/2013/02/doug_collins_goes_off_on_sixer.html\">Collins went off on, well, just about everyone</a>. </p><p>• Elsewhere in Chicago, the Derrick Rose Injury Situation has hit the <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/sports/18490957-419/bulls-taj-gibson-out-derrick-rose-shows-improvement.html\">\"who the heck even knows\"</a> stage.</p><p>• It was fun while it lasted. Golden State Warriors' <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/24/andrew-bogut-back-injury-update-warriors-golden-state/\">Andrew Bogut is out indefinitely with a back injury.</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/26/kobe-bryant-technical-fouls/?sct=uk_t2_a8\">The NBA rescinded a technical foul call on Kobe Bryant on Tuesday</a>, putting his number at 13, giving him two more to work with before facing a one-game suspension. The Lakers, of course, are currently one game out of the last playoff spot and Kobe is kinda an important part of the Lakers winning. So, in other words, expect Kobe to magically stop getting technical fouls shortly.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7tPuiMxgc\">The Dunk That Wasn't Of The Week</a>: LeBron James is even winning the pregame ceremonies. Can we please <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/25/nba-lebron-james-ridiculous-pregame-dunk/1946213/\">get this guy in the Dunk Contest already</a>?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404411277|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|fc6893b8893d5026510636a64898b8389c54a131 -->",

        "body":"<p>Miami's LeBron James led the way as the Heat dominated the middle two quarters on the way to an easy 111-89 win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Friday's clash of NBA divisional leaders.</p><p>James scored 30 points on 9 for 11 shooting and thanks chiefly to his own efforts he was able to sit out the fourth quarter. It was his fourth straight 30-point game, tying him with Dwyane Wade as the only Heat player with such streaks in the franchise's 25-year history.</p><p>Among the day's other key results, Memphis beat Golden State in a match of two Western Conference contenders, Detroit ended undermanned San Antonio's 11-game winning streak, Chicago polished off a long road trip with victory at Utah, Oklahoma City put in a big third-quarter surge to beat Phoenix, and James Harden led Houston over Portland.</p><p>Miami's Wade had 20 points as the Heat shrugged off the absence of Chris Bosh and Ray Allen, improving its home record to 21-3.</p><p>The Clippers got Chauncey Billups, Chris Paul and Blake Griffin back from injuries, but that trio of starters combined for only 23 points. DeAndre Jordan led Los Angeles with 17 points.</p><p>Memphis' Marc Gasol scored six of his 20 points in the closing stages to seal the Grizzlies' 99-93 win over the Golden State Warriors.</p><p>Gasol, who also grabbed 11 rebounds, was 9 of 14 from the field, while Tony Allen had 17 points on 7-of-8 shooting.</p><p>Stephen Curry had 32 points and eight assists for the Warriors, who lost their third straight.</p><p>The Detroit Pistons matched their highest score of the season to beat San Antonio 119-109, with the Spurs missing Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili.<br />Greg Monroe had 26 points and 16 rebounds for Detroit, which led by 21 points in the second quarter.</p><p>Tony Parker scored 31 points for San Antonio.</p><p>Chicago's Carlos Boozer scored 19 points, including 11 straight in the fourth quarter, to seal the Bull's 93-89 win against his old team, the Utah Jazz.</p><p>Boozer, plagued by foul trouble early, got rolling with about 5 minutes remaining. His layup tied the score 83-83 with 2:29 left and he scored the next five from the free throw line, including a pair with 27 seconds left.</p><p>Nate Robinson added 18 points for the Bulls, who rebounded nicely from a 32-point loss in Denver 24 hours earlier and ended a six-game road trip.</p><p>Al Jefferson had a season-high 32 points for Utah.</p><p>Oklahoma City Thunder went on a 21-0 points run in the third quarter to set up the 127-96 win over the Phoenix Suns.</p><p>Kevin Durant scored 21 points and Thabo Sefolosha had a season-high 18 for the Thunder, who brought up their third-straight big home win.</p><p>Phoenix even came out of a timeout with six players on the floor at one point during the Thunder's run, but all that did was result in another point after Durant made the resulting technical foul.</p><p>Michael Beasley led the Suns with 25 points.</p><p>The Houston Rockets beat the Portland Trail Blazers 118-103, with Harden recording 35 points and 11 assists.</p><p>Chandler Parsons scored 20 for the Rockets but Harden was the key man, going 13 for 16 from the field and 4 of 5 from 3-point range.</p><p>That performance justified his selection on the West's bench for the All-Star game, which is the next game to be played at Toyota Center.</p><p>LaMarcus Aldridge, another All-Star reserve for the West, scored 31 points for Portland.</p><p>New York's Carmelo Anthony had 36 points and nine rebounds, scoring 12 late points to lead the Knicks over the Minnesota Timberwolves 100-94.</p><p>Anthony topped 30 points for the 17th time this season for the Knicks, who trailed by 11 with seven minutes to play. But Anthony did all his fourth-quarter damage in those final minutes, hitting a 19-footer with 1:10 to play that put New York up for good.</p><p>Toronto's Rudy Gay scored 17 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and overtime, rallying the Raptors over the weary Indiana Pacers 100-98.</p><p>The game went into overtime after Amir Johnson's buzzer-beating tip-in stood following a replay review. The Raptors won it when Gay hit a 17-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left and Paul George's 15-footer rimmed out as the horn sounded.</p><p>New Orleans' Greivis Vasquez had his first career triple-double 21 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds to lead the Hornets to a 111-100 win over the Atlanta Hawks.</p><p>Eric Gordon added 27 points for the struggling Hornets, who won back-to-back games for only the fourth time this season.</p><p>In other games, the Washington Wizards held the Brooklyn Nets without a field goal for nearly nine minutes at one stage and won 89-74, the Los Angeles Lakers overcame a 20-point deficit to beat the Charlotte Bobcats 100-93 and the Cleveland Cavaliers won 119-108 over Orlando to hand the Magic their 12th straight loss.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/403787134|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|265fa12a539898e370305c9f001781834292f0ca -->",
