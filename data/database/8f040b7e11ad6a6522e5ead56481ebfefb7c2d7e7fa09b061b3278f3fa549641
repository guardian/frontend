Polling shows the move is the single most popular reform the government has made to the welfare system.</p> <p>Results of the pilots released by the Department for Work and Pensions show 8,000 people were financially affected in the test areas, with many large families losing more than £100 a week. Only those in work, people entitled to a war widow(er) pension, disabled people and the sick are exempt.</p> <p>Duncan Smith has already been criticised by the Office for National Statistics for claiming the cap had led to 8,000 people finding work. He was told by the ONS it was not possible to find any causal link between the cap and those finding work.</p> <p>An unrepentant Duncan Smith told Today on Monday: &quot;You cannot absolutely prove those two things are connected – you cannot disprove what I said. I believe this to be right. I believe we are already seeing people going back to work who were not going back to work until this group were capped.&quot;</p> <p>Pressed on claims made by Haringey council, one of the trial areas, that out of 740 households subject to the cap only 34 had found work, he said the BBC could always find politically motivated people to make that kind of remark. &quot;We have not published evidence in this. I believe I am right,&quot; said Duncan Smith, pointing to evidence from jobcentres.</p> <p>He added that the principle was simple, saying: &quot;You cannot go on earning more money [while] out of work on benefits than those in work trying hard.&quot;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-perceptions-of-the-benefit-cap-and-pre-implementation-impacts\" title=\"\">government&apos;s own polling on the cap </a>warns that the limited evidence it offers that people affected by the cap have moved into work should not be regarded as clear proof the policy is working.</p> <p>The report states that: &quot;There is evidence that the policy has encouraged some claimants to take action to avoid the benefit cap before implementation&quot;</p> <p>Of those claimants currently working and who knew about the cap, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/15/benfit-cap-reality-check-is-it-working-iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">61% had found a job after being notified</a> that they would be affected. But the report says that &quot;this does not show causation&quot; - meaning that the claimants may have gone into work anyway.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ipsos Mori confirmed the poll did not offer conclusive evidence that the cap was working. &quot;It does not show causality. Iain Duncan Smith may be saying that this is what he believes to be the cause but he cannot say it offers proof.&quot;</p> <p>On the effects of the benefits cap on those facing high housing costs, Duncan Smith said: &quot;We believe that in London there is plenty of accommodation and the vast majority of accommodation is available – a third of all rental accommodation in the private sector is available for people on social rents.</p> <p>&quot;The great talk about thousands being made homeless has not come true. The homeless figures have hardly moved at all.&quot;</p> <p>Duncan Smith said it was wrong for welfare claimants to live in houses where the rent is £50,000 or £100,000 a year, saying other families lived out of central London and commuted to work.</p> <p>The reforms are due to save £275m in 2013-14 and £275m in 2014-15 (in cash terms) or £270m in 2013-14 and £265m in 2014-15 (in 2012-13 prices).</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat former minister Sarah Teather criticised the plans saying &quot;I fear it&apos;s about the worst kind of politics, chasing populism at the expense of children&apos;s well-being is not politics that I care for very much, and I don&apos;t think we do ourselves as politicians or the British public very much good by following that line.&quot;</p> <p>Duncan Smith denied he was punishing people, saying it was &quot;no life to lead to accept the fact that you languish on benefits, trying to avoid ways of getting back to work&quot;. He added: &quot;You put people into housing they cannot afford when they go back to work because the rules are you lose part of your housing benefit when your income goes up.&quot;</p> <p>The cap, which limits combined benefits, will be rolled out across the rest of England, Scotland and Wales over the next 12 weeks.</p> <p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, accused Duncan Smith&apos;s department of operating on the basis of blind faith and guesswork after it published the Mori poll of 500 people &quot;who were notified within the last year that they would be capped, but who subsequently moved into work&quot;.</p> <p>The figures were apparently designed to show that the cap leads to employment, with over half of those who knew about the cap finding a job. But many in the relatively small sample were already looking for a job, and said their chief barrier to work was the lack of opportunities.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"945","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-18T08:48:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-07-15T08:36:56Z","internalComposerCode":"56aa17e4e4b0457ad8ecc04a","internalOctopusCode":"7838366","internalPageCode":"1936621","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:04:29Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-07-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

But campaigners have warned that many households will be unable to cope with the resultant drop in income.</p> <p>The government&apos;s own impact assessment of the Welfare Reform Act estimated that as many as 56,000 households would be affected, losing on average about £93 a week. In London, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2013-05-13b.154027.h#g154027.q0\" title=\"\">more than 7,000 low-income families will lose more than £100 a week</a>.</p> <p>The cap is designed to ensure that benefits payments do not exceed the income of the average working household. Benefits that count towards the cap include child benefit, housing benefit, jobseeker&apos;s allowance and incapacity benefit, while others, including disability living allowance and its successor, the personal independence payment, are exempt.</p> <p>The cap, which applies to all people of working age, was introduced in April in four London boroughs – Croydon, Bromley, Haringey and Enfield . It began being rolled out elsewhere on Monday and will be fully implemented by 30 September.</p> <p>The DWP says the cap will save £110m a year, which compares with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending\" title=\"\">a total benefits bill of £159bn in 2011-12</a>.</p> <p>In May, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/09/iain-duncan-smith-benefits-cap-statistics\" title=\"\">the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was criticised by the UK&apos;s statistics watchdog</a> for misusing figures to promote the effectiveness of the benefits cap on getting people into work.</p> <p>In a press release issued by the DWP in April alongside &quot;ad hoc&quot; statistics, Duncan Smith was quoted as saying: &quot;Already we&apos;ve seen 8,000 people who would have been affected by the cap move into jobs. This clearly demonstrates that the cap is having the desired impact.&quot;</p> <p>However, in an open letter, Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, said this claim was &quot;unsupported by the official statistics published by the department&quot;. He added that the statistics used to support the statement had explicitly cautioned that the figures were &quot;not intended to show the additional numbers entering work as a direct result of the contact&quot;.</p>","wordcount":"408","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-18T08:06:30Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-07-15T07:57:04Z","internalComposerCode":"56a6cc43e4b085519d005cdd","internalOctopusCode":"7838247","internalPageCode":"1936612","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:04:36Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-07-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3haea","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"12","internalShortId":"/p/3haea"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain","webTitle":"Benefits cap is rolled out across Britain","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-15T08:06:30Z","sectionName":"Society","sectionId":"society","type":"article","id":"society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","editions":[{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1937146","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-412890315","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/15/1373921995999/Iain-Duncan-Smith-010.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Iain Duncan Smith","caption":"'Iain Duncan Smith still has only questionable statistics with which to defend his muddled policy objectives'.

Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>There are few emotions quite as visceral as the anger that comes from thinking someone is getting something they don&apos;t deserve – the something for nothing society that Tory ministers love to condemn. Listening to Prince Charles&apos;s advisers explaining to MPs on <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jul/15/prince-charles-tax-live-blog\" title=\"\">the public accounts committee</a> why the Prince should pay nothing other than income tax on the Duchy of Cornwall&apos;s vast property-dealing and farming operations provokes just that kind of why-him fury, the outrage of gut instinct. Somehow, despite owning such plainly commercial businesses as a Waitrose warehouse in Milton Keynes and the Holiday Inn in Reading, the Duchy is not in legal terms a corporation. Consequently, it seems, it has no tax obligations at all. It was a Tory MP who summed it up most succinctly: &quot;Feudal power plundering the public purse.&quot;</p> <p>Hard-pressed taxpayers are being encouraged to consider the cost of benefits as some kind of plunder, too. As YouGov <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/zinooici1f/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-120713.pdf\" title=\"\">reported again</a> on Monday, the day of the national roll-out of the benefits cap, the idea of limiting the maximum amount of benefits a family can receive so that they don&apos;t get more than a similar family on the average wage – about £500 a week – is extremely popular, with a 79% approval rating. Part of that must be down to the way the language of welfare reform is surreptitiously laced with innuendo about scroungers and skivers. Being popular, though, is a long, long way from being right. And when Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, justifies his policy with unsupported assertions and dodgy statistics, Liam Byrne, his Labour shadow, ought to have a smarter response in mind than appearing to try to sound tougher still – as he did on Monday with his attack on Tory competence.</p> <p>This is not to underestimate Labour&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2013/06/05/margin-calls/\" title=\"\">difficulties</a>. The Tory strategy of eliding its undeserving benefits claimants narrative with Labour&apos;s traditional concern for the poor – in his Today programme interview, Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly referred to Labour as &quot;the welfare party&quot; in order to undermine its criticisms of his policy – is too slippery to address easily. Last month, after too long a delay, Ed Miliband began to counter attack. He took the key step of <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/one-nation-social-security-reform-miliband-speech\" title=\"\">accepting the case for a benefit cap</a>, and he set out the kind of structural reforms that would tackle the underlying causes of benefit dependence – more jobs, cheaper childcare, lower cost housing. All of these are right and important, but as a whole the argument is too big and complex to establish in a single speech. It&apos;s like trying to divert a cruise missile by firing bits of silver paper in the air.</p> <p>That&apos;s the context of Mr Byrne&apos;s accurate but <a href=\" http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/07/labours-disastrous-new-line-attack-benefit-cap-its-too-soft\" title=\"\">tactically dangerous attack</a> on Monday on Conservative incompetence. Undoubtedly, there&apos;s a certain black humour in showing that the cap won&apos;t work because ministers haven&apos;t managed to construct the system so that it does what they want it to do. But the job of the opposition is not to show the government how to do the wrong policy better; it&apos;s to explain persuasively to voters why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/benefit-cap-defiance-logic-editorial\" title=\"\">it&apos;s wrong in the first place</a>. Right now, raising the issue of competence might not be such a smart move either.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as thousands of families face moving out of their homes to unfamiliar areas and new schools away from family networks, the policy continues to fray. The continued <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/10/universal-credit-suffers-delays\" title=\"\">delay in introducing universal credit</a> is one problem; the anticipated cost to individual local authorities of thousands more homeless families – first raised by the communities secretary Eric Pickles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/02/full-text-letter-eric-pickles-welfare-reform\" title=\"\">more than two years ago</a> – is another.

Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>To accompany the roll-out of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap\" title=\"\">benefit cap</a> on Monday morning, the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/iain-duncan-smith-statistics-benefits-cap\" title=\"\">interview</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036tsn9/live\" title=\"\">BBC Today programme</a> in which he claimed that the policy was working because the threat of being hit by the cap had persuaded more people to move off benefits and into a job.</p> <p>But is he right?</p> <h2><strong>What is the benefit cap?</strong></h2> <p>Essentially, the benefits cap proposes that no out-of-work household should have a benefits income of more that £26,000 a year (£500 a week for families, £350 for single people), which the government says is the average household income of working families. Approximately 40,000 households in the UK will be affected, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p> <p>Over half of the households are in London, where high private sector rents (and consequently, housing benefit payments) mean that one in three of the households affected by the cap in the capital will lose at least £100 a week as a result.</p> <p>Households will avoid the cap if an adult member can find a job that offers at least 16 hours a week (for single parents) or 24 hours (for couples). The government says the threat of the cap will be to incentivise more people into work, cutting the benefits bill.</p> <h2><strong>Does the benefit cap work?</strong></h2> <p>Duncan Smith claimed in the BBC interview that benefit claimants had been galvanised to get a job by the threat of the cap. He said:</p> <blockquote> I believe we are already seeing people go back to work who were not going to go back to work until they were short of the cap </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote> I believe that this will show as we go forward that people who are not seeking work are now seeking work because that&apos;s the way to avoid the cap </blockquote> <p>This line was trailed in the Telegraph, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9401928/Benefits-cap-pushing-thousands-into-work.html\" title=\"\"> which reported:</a></p> <blockquote> These figures show the benefit cap is already a success and is actively encouraging people back to work </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith said in the interview that although he had no statistical evidence yet to back up his claim, the DWP had published polling which supported his view. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-perceptions-of-the-benefit-cap-and-pre-implementation-impacts\" title=\"\">poll, by Ipsos Mori</a>, consisted of telephone interviews in May and June with 500 people who had been notified over the past 12 months that they would be affected by the cap, but who had subsequently moved into work.</p> <p>The survey was carried out to attempt to find out from claimants whether being told they would be affected by the cap specifically &quot;encouraged them to find work&quot;.</p> <p>The DWP report states:</p> <blockquote> There is evidence that the policy has encouraged some claimants to take action to avoid the benefit cap before implementation </blockquote> <p>But how many is &quot;some claimants&quot;? In order to be motivated by the threat of a cap on benefits, you need to know that the threat exists in the first place. Only 57% of claimants remembered getting written notification that they would be affected by the cap. Of those who remember getting the letter, 37% found it very or fairly difficult to understand. This suggests that the cap may have been a hazy presence for many recipients.</p> <p>The poll then asked those who recalled being notified of the cap what actions they subsequently took, if any. Strikingly, the biggest category, almost half of claimants (46%), said:</p> <blockquote> Nothing </blockquote> <p>So how many looked for a job? According to the poll, 31%. But asked what they were doing before they were told about the cap, 52% said they were already looking for a job (A separate poll question said that 71% recalled actively attending job interviews and submitting CVs in the weeks before notification).</p> <p>According to the poll, notification of the cap had remarkably little impact on a range of behaviours, whether taking benefits advice, increasing the number of hours worked, or moving to a cheaper property (although marginally more claimants said the letter persuaded them to contact to the Job Centre).</p> <p>The report says that of those who recall being notified of the cap (or being aware of it), 47% took &quot;some sort of action&quot;. Asked what that action might be, 62% said they looked for a job. According to the DWP:</p> <blockquote> That equates to 29% of all those ... who were aware they would be affected </blockquote> <p>That suggests that just under a third of all those threatened with the cap looked for a job.</p> <p>But was it the threat of the cap specifically that spurred them on? The report notes that of those who remember being formally notified, 61% said they found their current job after they had been formally told they would be threatened with the cap. That sounds promising.</p> <p>But the report issues a firm rider to this claim:</p> <blockquote> This analysis is confined to correlation and does not show causation </blockquote> <p>In other words, it would be wrong to claim that the poll finds a clear link between the benefit cap and moving into work. Some people may have been persuaded to go out and get a job but it is equally likely that they may have found work anyway.</p> <p>And the report makes it clear that most people threatened by the cap were not &quot;workshy&quot;. The vast majority of respondents reported that they have always worked (10%), mostly worked (43%) or sometimes worked (29%). Only 5% had never been in paid employment.</p> <p>This suggests that work was a part of the lives of the vast majority of these households before the cap, as well as after.</p> <h2><strong>So, is Duncan Smith right?</strong></h2> <p>The employment secretary &quot;believes&quot; the cap is working. But as his own poll report shows, there is very little evidence that it may be working as he intends, and certainly no proof of a link. In summary, the poll shows that:</p> <p>• Given the draconian consequences of the cap, remarkably few of those affected even remembered even being notified of it.</p> <p>• Of those that were aware of the cap, most said they were actively looking for work anyway.</p> <p>• Of those who found work, 61% entered work after notification – but there is no evidence that the cap played a role in getting them into employment.</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson accepted that while the poll did not show absolutely that the cap was having the effect intended, it did offer &quot;quite compelling evidence&quot;.</p> <p>Duncan Smith has made similar claims about the efficacy of the cap before. In April, he claimed that the cap had stung 8,000 affect people into work, clearly demonstrating the cap had the desired impact. However, statisticians pointed out that while it was true that 8,000 people had moved into work, there was no evidence that this was caused by the threat of the benefit cap.</p> <p>The work and pensions secretary was subsequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/09/iain-duncan-smith-benefits-cap-statistics\" title=\"\">admonished by the UK Statistics Authority</a>, which said the claim was &quot;unsupported by the official statistics&quot;.</p> <p>Duncan Smith may yet be proved right on the cap. But the latest polling does not offer that proof.</p>","wordcount":"1182","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-22T17:36:54Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-07-15T17:26:16Z","internalComposerCode":"569cf454e4b0ab8f24545b2a","internalOctopusCode":"7839094","internalPageCode":"1937063","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:04:30Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3hb42","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"12","internalShortId":"/p/3hb42"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/15/benfit-cap-reality-check-is-it-working-iain-duncan-smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/15/benfit-cap-reality-check-is-it-working-iain-duncan-smith","webTitle":"Benefit cap: is it persuading more people to get a job?","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-15T17:36:54Z","sectionName":"News","sectionId":"news","type":"article","id":"politics/reality-check/2013/jul/15/benfit-cap-reality-check-is-it-working-iain-duncan-smith","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"news","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news","editions":[{"id":"news","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1937162","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-412895188","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/15/1373927091862/Steve-Bell-cartoon-16.07.-001.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"© Steve Bell 2013","caption":"Steve Bell cartoon 16.07.2013.

Following his most recent tweet on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain\">the benefits cap that comes into action on Monday</a>, he may be inclined to revisit the ribald advice. On Monday morning, Cameron tweeted his support for the changes and the minister spearheading them, Iain Duncan Smith, writing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/356670882065809408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>We&#39;re rolling out a cap on Benefits today - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP\">@IDS_MP</a> and I are determined to make work pay, and help the UK compete on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GlobalRace&amp;src=hash\">#GlobalRace</a>.</p>&mdash; David Cameron (@David_Cameron) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/356670882065809408\">July 15, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But his eagle-eyed followers were quicker than the prime minister to realise that the Twitter account @IDS_MP is, in fact, a parody account of the work and pensions secretary – and one with which Cameron may not be keen to ally himself.
