These allegations were that Bishop provided false or misleading information to the commonwealth, and that her existing relationships with MyJet Aviation could have influenced her decision to engage that service provider.<br /></p> <p>“The AFP has not identified any evidence to support allegations of criminality against Ms Bishop or any other person in respect of those matters,” McCartney told Conroy in a reply. “As such the AFP will not be commencing an investigation and will take no further action in relation to the allegations.”</p> <p>In the letter, McCartney also said the AFP had not received any referrals from the Department of Finance in relation to allegations of Bishop misusing entitlements.</p> <p>“As such, no action is being taken by the AFP with respect to those allegations.
