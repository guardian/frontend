        "headline":"GTA V Online launches, popularity could cause server issues",
        "body":"<p>Online video game launches tend to be precarious things. Publishers can buy in vast networks of servers and hire the best software engineers to ensure gamers aren't left out in the cold. But when many thousands hit the infrastructure at once, the results can be wildly unpredictable. We only have to look at the chaotic arrival of EA's Sim City or Blizzard's Diablo III for evidence of this. Both games pretty much collapsed at launch, with fans unable to sign in for many hours and instead jamming the forums with questions and complaints. </p><p>So this is going to be an edgy day for Rockstar. Released last month to huge critical acclaim, Grand Theft Auto V has sold in the region of 15m copies, making it the year's biggest entertainment release. And today at noon the publisher is unlocking the ambitious multiplayer mode: Grand Theft Auto Online. Providing fans with a persistent version of the game's world, Los Santos, owners of GTA V can access the new mode for free, join gangs, and get involved in heists, races, death matches and other nefarious activities, all the time earning Reputation Points which unlock new goodies such as weapons and cars. </p><p>It's essentially a massively multiplayer game, like World of Warcraft, but set in a modern city rather than a fantasy kingdom. Each time you play, you enter a server that is currently restricted to 16 players, but the entire universe is interconnected – there's even a persistent economy and a stock market that changes dynamically based on what players all over the world spend their in-game cash on.</p><p>Of course, with the launch merely hours away the big question is, will it work? Rockstar itself has already admitted that server problems are likely. In <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51422/some-more-details-on-grand-theft-auto-online.html\">a post on its Newswire site</a> last week, the publisher stated: </p><blockquote><p>One thing we are already aware of, and are trying to alleviate as fast as we can, is the unanticipated additional pressure on the servers due to a significantly higher number of players than we were anticipating at this point – we are working around the clock to buy and add more servers, but this increased scale is only going to make the first few days even more temperamental than such things usually are.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, GTA V owners are already experiencing some of the problems of a connected gaming experience. The game's smartphone app, iFruit, which lets users train lead character Franklin's dog as well as customise cars, has been besieged by server connection delays, as has access to the in-game Snapshot app, used to take and share photos. Some fans are mystified as to why Rockstar failed to anticipate this demand – after all, GTA IV sold more than 25m copies.</p><p>But anticipation of huge gamer numbers is one thing, actually preparing for it is quite another. It's not just a case of connecting everyone to one giant online brain. \"Although we use the term 'servers' in a lot of cases it's not like there's actually one machine – or a set of machines – that handle the whole job,\" says Ed Fear, a creative producer at UK studio Mediatonic. \"You have machines that do certain functions, or contain certain zones of the world, or hold certain data, and they all operate together to give the impression that you're interfacing with one 'thing'. Unexpected load on one of these areas can unbalance the whole caboodle.\"</p><p>Developers do have a range of methods for load-testing server networks, from running beta programmes (limited numbers of gamers testing the game before release), to designing AI bots that work as virtual testers, to loading the infrastructure with fake work to test the strain. </p><p>These are useful tools, but they can only ever provide a limited glimpse at what may happen at launch. \"The challenge is scale,\" says veteran game developer Martin Hollis. \"It doesn't matter how much you test with 10 players or with 10,000 players, you can't always exactly anticipate what will happen with 1,000,000 players. Of course you should do your homework. Of course you should test with 1m robots, or more exactly, with automated scripts generated by people experienced in preparing automated scripts for testing massively multiplayer games. You can simulate a lot. But you can't simulate everything, and bitter experience has shown that you can't foresee everything. There is always a surprise or two with every massively multiplayer game, doubly so if you are dealing with millions of players in a spike.\"</p><p>What pre-release testing also fails to account for is the sheer unpredictability of the consumer swarm. In the aftermath of EA's troubled SimCity launch earlier this year, Lucy Bradshaw, studio head at the title's developer Maxis, <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/9/4081464/simcity-interview-ea-maxis-lucy-bradshaw\">told Polygon</a>, \"A lot more people logged on than we expected. More people played and played in ways we never saw in the beta.\"</p><p>It's the last bit that is most telling. Beta testers tend to understand and work within the confines of unfinished software. They're often fans of the developer or the series, and they feel honoured to be part of the testing process. Paying consumers will react very differently to a slow server or bugs in the system – they'll re-start, they'll log out and log back in – they'll get angry. Furthermore, if they do get on, they will interact with the game in very different ways, testing its boundaries, trying weird stuff – doing things the developers didn't expect. You can't predict what 2m people are going to do.</p><p>And you also can't predict the vagaries of several million different internet connections, broadband suppliers, and computer infrasturctures along the pipeline of the internet. \"The real key to this is that games require all of the clients (usually 32 to 64) to be perfectly synched,\" says Andrew Smith of Split Milk Studios. \"As soon as one player becomes out of step, the knock-on effects become nightmarishly difficult to contain. </p><p>\"Picture a ten-pin bowling scenario: the bowler is the server or the game, and the pins are the clients or players. As the ball hits, the first pin falls, and knocks on to the next and it all works. However, if any pin freezes in place for a split second, at random, it completely ruins your ability, as a bowler, to reliably and accurately go for strikes. Now apply that to a game as complex as GTA and you can see why a simple beta is never going to be enough – there are millions of pins.\"</p><p>So the key message from Rockstar is, bear with us. This is effectively a mass open beta. As the website puts it: \"The first couple of weeks we expect to be heavily focused on tuning the experience as it goes from internal testing to the reality of being played by tons of people in the real world so that all the usual teething problems for an online game are overcome. We hope it will all run incredibly smoothly, but please bear with us if it doesn't, and help us fix any and all problems!\"</p><p>In short, if you were planning to take the afternoon off to go online with your friends and rob security trucks, you may want some back up entertainment prepared for when the servers slow, or things go wrong. Because if past experiences of major online game launches tell us anything it's that it won't just be the flash cars inside GTA Online that will be crashing.</p><p><hr /><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/26/gta-v-micro-transactions-console\">GTA V and the future of micro-transactions</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/21/grand-theft-auto-5-women-misogynistic-violent\">Helen Lewis: Yes, it's misogynistic and violent, but I still admire GTA</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\">GTA 5 review: a dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life</a></p><p><hr /></p><h2><strong>Are you being served?

Here, he provides an inside guide on the problems of building and preparing an online video game.</em></p><p>\"The number one problem is bottlenecks. You can distribute many aspects of your server infrastructure, but if you have a point where the need for data coherency outweighs the desire to parallelise your systems then that is likely to become the weak point in the chain. For example, after a maintenance period, your servers are down, when the systems come back up, everyone will be wanting to login – which then really hammers that part of the system.  And distributing login systems becomes harder as they all need access to the same data.  </p><p>\"You can distribute the data based on geographical location, but that then runs the risk of increasing costs whilst not actually matching the levels of demand.  There are many ways to approach this, but the fact remains that this is something that is still relatively new to a lot of game developers and trying to do it yourself can often result in a system that works but is very susceptible to collapse under load. Building systems that scale well under load is not a new problem, but it is new for game developers and quite often the budgets in terms of time and staff expertise will be skimped on in favour of focusing on much more visible, whiz-bang features.</p><p>\"Finding good beta testers is also hard – people generally want to play, not test the game. Professional QA teams will put together detailed test plans, which ensure coverage of all aspects of the game, but executing that at the level required to fully stress your back-end systems would require an unfeasibly large QA department.  If you architect your systems well enough, you can build automated tests for this, but humans will introduce a degree of unpredictability that can't really be planned for (and therefore, tested). If you have test teams in Paris, London and Frankfurt, you may find that your network connectivity to say, Rome, has issues with bandwidth and latency that you didn't anticipate. </p><p>\"Consumer broadband is in a better place now that it was 10 or even five years ago. ISPs are more aware of gaming and they tend to provide routers that will work with services such as Xbox Live and PSN without problems. The good ones will ensure that traffic for those systems is routed and prioritised to give their customers a good experience.  </p><p>\"That said, there are still many factors involved and someone using a Wi-Fi connection in a noisy (electro-magnetic) environment may see spikes of packet loss and/or latency that can have consequences for the quality of the experience they get. In the worst case, it may result in them appearing as having lost their connection to your server.  They then have to reconnect which can put further stress on those login servers.  A brief outage in a major backbone on the Internet is not unheard of, the effect on Netflix, iPlayer may even be masked by the buffering those systems use.  You probably won't notice when using email or the web.  But if you're in an online game session, it could cause a few thousand players to lose their connection to the server.  They then all have to login again, and the system comes under increased pressure.</p><p>\"The biggest problems come from spikes in activity and your systems not being able to adequately handle those spikes. Companies that run MMO games have gained a lot of experience in this. Games like Grand Theft Auto started out with much simpler multiplayer expectations, with the game experience being much more transient and isolated. Now, as the amount of persistent data about a player increases and they make progress from one session to the next, this leads to more data storage. The amounts are trivial compared to the storage capacity of modern cloud services, but you then need to have robust systems to store, retrieve and update that data.  It needs to be fault-tolerant and above all resistant to corruption or loss. The only thing that will infuriate your player base more than not being able to play the game is losing some or all of their progress.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/21/grand-theft-auto-5-women-misogynistic-violent\">Helen Lewis: Yes, it's misogynistic and violent, but I still admire GTA</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/26/gta-v-micro-transactions-console\">GTA V and the future of micro-transactions</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\">GTA 5 review: a dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418716608|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|59d76c166987cb60b08d3a6a4ddc3dc09809c7db -->",

        "body":"<p>Well, they did it. The US government is officially on a partial shutdown, with Congress <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/01/us-government-shutdown-takes-effect-workers\">having failed to reach an agreement</a> by midnight on Monday.</p><p>The shutdown will have far-reaching effects throughout the US. Though some services – mail delivery, Social Security and Medicare benefits – are not affected, others, like national parks and routine safety inspections of food, are curtailed as the majority of federal employees tasked with their operation have been ordered not to report to work on Tuesday. </p><p>A look at how a shutdown will affect other services across the federal government:</p><h2>Federal workers</h2><p>About 800,000 federal employees are not furloughed and will not be paid. Already hit hard by several unpaid furlough days caused by sequestration this year some workers have <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/325267-federal-workers-demanding-back-pay-if-government-closes\">begun lobbying</a> to receive back pay in the event of a shutdown. While Congress agreed to retroactively pay them during previous shutdowns, the fractured nature of this Congress makes such a step unlikely. </p><h2>US military</h2><p>The military's 1.4 million active-duty personnel will stay on duty, but their paychecks initially faced a threat of delay. Amid the division, the House passed – and Obama signed – a bill to ensure their checks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/01/us-government-shutdown-takes-effect-workers\">would still be delivered on time</a>. \"You and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we're seeing in Congress,\" Obama said.</p><p>About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees are furloughed.</p><h2>Food programs</h2><p>The Wic program, which provides low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five with healthy food, is not funded as of Tuesday morning. \"No additional federal funds would be available,\" says the Department of Agriculture, though it suggests that some states – some, not all – may have a state-run fund that can fill in the gaps for women who need help purchasing things like formula. They estimate the state funds would last about a week.</p><p>School lunches for low-income students are not affected. Food stamps are not affected. </p><h2>Public health</h2><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are facing a reduced ability to detect and investigate disease outbreaks. The annual influenza program – the one that tracks the flu and helps people get flu shots – has been shut down. The CDC has also stopped offering its usual assistance to state and local authorities, who rely on the agency for help in tracking unusual outbreaks. </p><p>The National Institutes of Health will continue to treat patients at its hospital center, but no new clinical trials will begin. </p><h2>Animals</h2><p>The animals at the National Zoo are being cared for, but the zoo, like all Smithsonian museums, is closed to the public. The live animal cams have been shut down. That's right, Congress' inability to reach a deal means no more panda cam, America. </p><h2>Science</h2><p>Nasa will furlough almost all of its employees, though it will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space Station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service will keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings, and the National Hurricane Center will continue to track storms.</p><h2>Travel and tourism</h2><p>National parks and monuments are closed, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty. Park rangers spent Tuesday morning erecting barricades to prevent people from accessing these public spaces.</p><p>Federal air traffic controllers will remain on the job and airport screeners will keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints, though some airports have warned of delays at security. Federal inspectors will continue enforcing safety rules.</p><p>The State Department will continue processing foreign applications for visas and US applications for passports, since fees are collected to finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas will continue to provide services to American citizens.</p><h2>Courts</h2><p>Federal courts will continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases will continue to be heard.</p><p>The US supreme court is scheduled to begin its new term on October 7. In previous government shutdowns, it continued to operate as normal.</p><h2>Mail</h2><p>Deliveries will continue as usual because the US Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running.</p><h2>District of Columbia</h2><p>The city, which does not have autonomy over its own budget, briefly flirted with the idea of using the potential shutdown to make a stand when mayor Vince Gray moved to designate all city employees \"essential,\" thereby avoiding the cuts in services like libraries that were expected.

        "body":"<h2>Please explain what just happened</h2><p>The US government has begun shutting its non-essential services. Hundreds of thousands of workers are waking up to the news that they are on unpaid leave, and they don't know how long it will last. The shutdown, triggered at midnight Washington time, will bring a range of services to a standstill across the world's largest economy.</p><h2>Why?</h2><p>The Federal government had no choice. The US financial year ended on 30 September, and politicians on Capitol Hill have failed to agree a new budget for the 2013-2014 financial year. Even a 'stopgap' funding deal proved beyond them. Without a budget deal approved by both parts of Congress, the House of Representative and the Senate, there's no legal agreement to pay non-essential staff.</p><h2>Weren't they supposed to fix this last night?</h2><p>They tried. A series of proposals rattled between the two sides on Monday night until midnight struck without a deal.</p><h2>Why couldn't they agree a deal?</h2><p>Under the US constitution, the president cannot unilaterally bring in legislation. And despite weeks of talks, Republicans continue to include cuts and delays to Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in the budget legislation they sent up to the Senate.</p><p>The House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, whose Tea Party movement remain deeply opposed to Obamacare. They tried to use the budget as leverage to crowbar changes to the Act. The Senate, which is under the control of Obama's Democrats, has stood firm.</p><h2>Will the shutdown mean the entire US government grinds to a halt?</h2><p>No, it's not an anarchist's (or libertarian's?) dream. Essential services, such as social security and Medicare payments, will continue. <br />The US military service will keep operating, and Obama signed emergency legislation on Monday night to keep paying staff. But hundreds of thousands of workers at non-essential services, from Pentagon employees to rangers in national parks, will be told to take an unpaid holiday.</p><h2>So what happens how?</h2><p>US politicians are meeting again in Washington on Tuesday. Before Monday's session broke up, the lower house proposed a 'bipartisan committee' to consider a way forward. The Senate is expected to reject this proposal, sticking to its position that Obamacare cannot be unravelled. Federal staff will remain unpaid until a budget is agreed. A 'stopgap' funding plan is an option, but Obama appeared wary of that option, arguing that would simply guarantee a repeated fight in a few weeks' time.</p><h2>How much damage will it cause?</h2><p>If people aren't getting paid, they won't spend as much in the shops. They may be unable to meet essential financial commitments, such as mortgages and credit card payments.</p><p>Analysts at IHS Global Insight have calculated that it will knock $300m a day off US economic output (total US nominal GDP, or output, was around $16 trillion last year).</p><p>The key issue is how long it lasts. Moody's Analytics reckons that a two-week shutdown would cut 0.3% off US GDP, while a month-long outage would knock a whole 1.4% off growth.</p><h2>When did this last happen?</h2><p>It's the first shutdown since 1995-1996, when Bill Clinton and the House of Representatives (and its speaker, Newt Gingrich) also failed to agree on a budget to fund federal services. That row ran for 28 days (over two stages).<br />But it was a more regular event in the 1980s, usually for a few days at a time. In total, the US government has partially shut down on 17 occasions before today.</p><h2>Why doesn't it happen in other countries?</h2><p>The shutdown situation is a product of the US democratic system. The president is both head of state and head of the federal government, without a guaranteed majority in either of the legislative bodies where new laws are debated and voted upon (because presidents, congressmen and women and senators are elected separately). The president can't simply ram laws through Capitol Hill.</p><p>In Britain, for example, tax and spending policies are outlined in the budget, presented to parliament by the chancellor of the exchequer. These changes are brought into law in a finance bill in the House of Commons. That's in effect a confidence vote in the government, and even the most fractious backbench MP would balk at rebelling on it.</p><p>Finance bills are also one area where the elected House of Commons has the upper hand over the unelected House of Lords. The Lords have no power to reject a money bill; they can only delay it for a month.</p><h2>How does the US shutdown row tie in with the debt ceiling battle?</h2><p>They are separate issues, but the shutdown is raising fears over the debt ceiling.</p><p>America has a legal limit on its borrowing of $16.7tn dollars, and it's likely to hit that point in mid-October.</p><p>If a deal isn't reached, then America would run out of borrowing room, meaning the world's biggest economy would default on its debts. Both problems need solving – and a shutdown is now eating into valuable time to fix the debt ceiling.</p><h2>Why can't they just raise the debt ceiling?</h2><p>Again, legislation is needed. Republicans are again trying to link the plan to Obamacare – arguing that the healthcare reforms are unaffordable.</p><h2>How are the markets reacting?</h2><p>So far, there's no panic. Investors are calculating that the shutdown will be short. But prepare for nervousness as that debt ceiling deadline gets closer.<br />The dollar, though, is being hit – dropping half a cent against major currencies.</p><p><em>This article originally confused the two Houses of Congress.

That's why I've spoken out,&quot; he said in a television interview with BBC News on Tuesday. &quot;It's an unusual step to speak out. I don't do it lightly but I am not willing to see my father's good name undermined in this way.&quot;</p><p>The Daily Mail prompted an angry stream of reaction after it stood by the blistering personal attack with a trenchant <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\" title=\"\">1,000-word editorial</a> headlined &quot;An evil legacy and why we won't apologise&quot;. The newspaper agreed to print <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439593/Why-father-loved-Britain-Ed-Miliband.html\" title=\"\">a right of reply by Miliband</a>, but ran it alongside <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439565/As-Ed-Miliband-reacts-angrily-critique-Marxist-father--We-repeat-This-man-did-hate-Britain.html\" title=\"\">an abridged version of the original article</a>.</p><p>&quot;I was appalled when I read the Daily Mail on Saturday and saw them saying that he hated Britain. It's a lie,&quot; the visibly angry Labour leader told the BBC.</p><p>&quot;I'm even more appalled that they repeated that lie today and have gone further and described my father's legacy as 'evil'. Evil is a word reserved for particular cases and I was not willing to let that stand.</p><p>&quot;It's perfectly legitimate for the Daily Mail to talk about my father's politics but when they say that he hated Britain I was not willing to put up with that because my father loved Britain, my father served in the Royal Navy, he was a refugee who came here and found security in this country.</p><p>&quot;What I'm interested in is defending my father's good name. I don't want the British people to think my father hated Britain – because he loved Britain. When the Daily Mail not only says that but publishes a photo on its website of his gravestone with a pun about it saying he was a grave socialist&nbsp;… I'm furious because what is political debate coming to in this country when this happens? That's why I've spoken out.&quot;</p><p>He added that the row was not about regulating the press or a desire to stifle what newspapers write about his father, a prominent socialist scholar. &quot;There are boundaries. Newspapers and people across politics must not overstep those boundaries,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not about government or politics stepping in and stopping that happening it's about the way we conduct our debates in this country.&quot;</p><p>Miliband said he had spoken to his brother David, the former Labour MP, and his mother about the Daily Mail article. &quot;It feels so jarring with what we know about my dad. I know my dad better than anybody, as do David and my mum, and when we used to go on holiday what was the thing he used to look forward to doing most? It was coming back to Britain because he loved this country so much,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Britain saved his life and this paper is saying that he hated Britain and that is a lie. It is a lie and I'm not willing to let it stand.&quot;</p><p>The row showed no sign of defusing when, shortly after Miliband's television interview, a spokesman for the Daily Mail maintained that the newspaper was right to tell its readers that the Labour leader's father &quot;hated British institutions&quot;.</p><p>The spokesman said: &quot;We ask fair-minded people to read our editorial today. For what this episode confirms is that you cannot allow politicians anywhere near regulating the press.</p><p>&quot;While we respect Mr Miliband's right to defend his father – and he has done so in the Daily Mail today – it is worth stressing that Ralph Miliband wasn't an ordinary private individual but a prominent academic and author who devoted his life to promoting a Marxist dogma which caused so much misery in the world. He hated such British institutions as the Queen, the church and the army, and wanted a workers' revolution. Our readers have a right to know that.&quot;</p><p>The spokesman described Ed Miliband as a leading advocate of statutory regulation of the press and said his father was &quot;a proponent of one of the world's most poisonous political doctrines under which freedom of expression was crushed and newspapers controlled by governments&quot;.</p><p>David Cameron and Nick Clegg waded into the row on Tuesday, backing Miliband's response. Cameron said he had not read the original article but said that &quot;if anyone had a go at my father, I would want to respond vigorously&quot;.</p><p>Clegg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nick_clegg/status/384957363913904128\" title=\"\">wrote on Twitter</a>: &quot;I support Ed Miliband defending his dad. Politics should be about playing the ball, not the man, certainly not the man's family.&quot;</p><p>David Miliband <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DMiliband/status/384931635302780928\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: &quot;My dad loved Britain. Here's the truth,&quot; and linked to his brother's article defending their father, who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis.</p><p>Ed Miliband wrote in the Mail: &quot;There is no credible argument in the article or evidence from his life which can remotely justify the lurid headline and its accompanying claim that it would 'disturb everyone who loves this country'.&quot;</p><p>Critics of the Mail highlighted the paper's stance on Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. Lord Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnprescott/status/384950223543734272\" title=\"\">posted a picture</a> of a Daily Mail article by Viscount Rothermere published eight decades ago headlined: Hurrah for the Blackshirts, and said: &quot;Here's a Daily Mail leader praising fascists written by the great-grandfather of the paper's current owner.&quot;</p><p>The Bradford West MP George Galloway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgegalloway\" title=\"\">said</a>: &quot;How low can the Daily Mail sink? How about its despicable smear on Jewish refugee from Nazism and D-Day vet Ralph Miliband? The Daily Mail which supported fascism and ran a front page splash in support of British Nazis titled 'Hurrah for the Blackshirts!'&quot;</p><p>Raymond Snoddy, the prominent media commentator, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaymondSnoddy/status/384960241504231424\" title=\"\">said the Mail</a> owed Miliband an apology for its latest attack. &quot;Daily Mail really hasn't sustained the case that Miliband snr was The Man Who Hated Britain merely Marxist class warrior. An apology is due,&quot; he tweeted.</p><p>Owen Jones, the Independent columnist and socialist commentator, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OwenJones84/status/384809112162152448\" title=\"\">said</a>: &quot;Weirdly compelling how all the worst elements of our country – fear, prejudice, hate – have been stuffed into paper form, aka the Daily Mail.&quot;</p><p>The Labour MP Paul Farrelly said the Mail's &quot;disgraceful smear&quot; was linked to Ed Miliband's backing of an independent press watchdog that would limit the involvement of newspaper owners.</p><p>&quot;The Daily Mail continues to plumb new depths in its attacks on both Labour and Ed Miliband, he said. &quot;People should be under no illusion that this campaign of intimidation is not just political, but highly personal – because Ed has come out strongly for a truly independent press watchdog, not controlled by the likes of Mail editor Paul Dacre.</p><p>&quot;This disgraceful smear of Ed's dead father shows once again what a mockery it is for the Mail's editor to have overseen the code on standards at the discredited Press Complaints Commission. The sooner our media moves on from this sort of behaviour, the better.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418741213|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|c57208d2dc025c0c5c2ff9665629b987ad7d9b8e -->",

        "body":"<p>The process of closing down large parts of the US government was under way on Tuesday morning, after frantic rounds of late-night political sparring failed to avert the first federal shutdown in nearly two decades.</p><p>More than two million federal workers were told to go to work as usual, where they would be informed whether they were part of the \"essential\" core that would still work. An estimated 800,000 were due to be ordered home, although they could spend the morning setting out-of-office email alerts and preparing for an absence without pay that could last days if not weeks.</p><p>Some federal workers were reportedly instructed to switch off their BlackBerry smartphones to prevent them from working remotely, a disciplinary offence.</p><p>From 7am, forlorn-looking commuters could be seen heading to government buildings and agencies across Washington DC, where they would learn their fate. The city, where the government is a huge employer, will feel the impact of the federal shutdown more acutely than anywhere else in the US. The White House said it estimates a one-week shutdown would cost the wider US economy $10bn.</p><p>In a symbolic image of a country immobilised by political stalemate, the national parks service in the capital began the process of placing barricades around the Lincoln Memorial; museums were closed and water fountains that stretch along the National Mall were due to be switched off. In New York, the Statue of Liberty was closed to visitors. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418755635'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380636555608/82c1527c-eec0-45c0-88f6-9da90d73b10f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Tourists look at a sign announcing that the Statue of Liberty is closed due to a US government shutdown in New York.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tourists look at a sign announcing that the Statue of Liberty is closed due to a US government shutdown in New York.

Air traffic controllers, prison guards and border patrol agents will remain in post, but if the shutdown drags on long enough, their paychecks could be delayed.</p><p>The first shutdown since 1996, when Bill Clinton was president and Newt Gingrich was the House speaker, occurred after Republicans staged a series of last-ditch efforts to use a once-routine budget procedure to force Democrats to abandon or delay the healthcare reforms that were the signature of Obama's first term.</p><h2>'Holding country to ransom'</h2><p>Three separate attacks on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, were staged by the House, only to be rejected in turn by the Democrat-controlled Senate, which accused Republicans of holding the country to ransom.</p><p>Shortly before midnight on Monday, Senate majority leader Harry Reid marked the end of the process by rejecting House calls for formal talks to reconcile their conflicting positions.</p><p>\"This is a very serious time in the history of our country,\" Reid said. \"Millions of people are going to be affected tomorrow and the Republicans are still playing games.\"</p><p>Reid was due to reconvene the Senate at 9.30am on Tuesday to consider a Republican proposal to convene a bipartisan committee to resolve the impasse. However he had already declared his reluctance to give ground, telling Senate colleagues: \"We will not go to conference with a gun to our head.\"</p><p>Referring to the conservative wing of the Republicans in the House, Reid added: \"It is embarrassing that these people are elected to represent the country are representing the Tea Party.\"</p><p>The White House has drawn up a list of essential staff who are legally allowed to carry on working, but President Barack Obama warned that a shutdown would have an immediate effect on the fragile US economy.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418755636'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380628484787/252b6f33-6fa2-42ac-a263-3eb6a62b668e-460x307.jpeg' alt='U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel speaks to the traveling press about the U.S. government shutdown, at his hotel in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013.' width='460' height='307' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel speaks to the traveling press about the U.S. government shutdown, at his hotel in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</figcaption></figure><p>\"We do not have a clear indication that Congress will act in time for the president to sign a continuing resolution before the end of the day tomorrow, October 1,\" said a White House statement issued shortly before midnight. </p><p>\"Therefore, agencies should now execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations. We urge Congress to act quickly to pass a continuing resolution to provide a short-term bridge that ensures sufficient time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year, and to restore the operation of critical public services and programs that will be impacted by a lapse in appropriations.\"</p><p>Obama also issued a statement to military employees after signing a Republican-proposed law that exempts active-duty servicemen from the effects of the shutdown, but will not protect civilian workers.</p><p>\"I know the days ahead could mean more uncertainty, including possible furloughs,\" Obama said. \"You and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we're seeing in Congress.\"</p><p>House speaker John Boehner denied that Republican tactics were responsible for the shutdown, insisting Democrats were to blame for refusing to negotiate over Obamacare.</p><p>\"I didn't come here to shut down the government,\" Boehner told one of several heated House debates. </p><p>\"I came here to fight for a smaller, less costly and more accountable federal government. But here we find ourselves in this moment dealing with a law that's causing unknown consequences and unknown damage to the American people and to our economy. And that issue is Obamacare.\"</p><p>But Democrats are confident that US public opinion will continue to hold Republicans to blame for what could be days of disruption until a deal can be struck.</p><p>They argue that Republicans are using underhand methods to overturn a law that was passed four years ago, ratified by the supreme court and endorsed by voters at the last presidential election.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, said: \"If we surrender to hostage-taking tonight, these guys would be back within a couple of weeks without a shadow of a doubt. What we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinary anti-democratic act.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418743484|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|17ce77f178e6573e34baaad5f04e6313d9a3161c -->",

Essentially, there's no way for Rockstar to account for every piece of hardware attempting to access its servers:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What the player is using to communicate with the server always plays a huge part since it dictates response speeds. If you couple this with the network the client is on and the number of hops the packets of data need to get to go from client to server and from server to client then there's a lot to go wrong. When designing games based on a server architecture, we usually use what's known as connectionless communication protocol where the client and server essentially talk to each other and hope that the packets they send reach their destination. This is in part to deal with the unpredictable nature of client status and how hard it is for the client to actually connect with the server in a reliable way.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T16:18:28.923+01:00\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524ad6ade4b0d2df47eff995\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T15:05:36.793+01:00\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/statuses/384829261237862400\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GTAOnline&amp;src=hash\">#GTAOnline</a> Details: Game Day Access Info and More - <a href=\"http://t.co/PgYSZVNII5\">http://t.co/PgYSZVNII5</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/SLi8uR65ay\">pic.twitter.com/SLi8uR65ay</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/statuses/384829261237862400\">September 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524ad595e4b00c9d0a811013\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T15:01:03.078+01:00\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OutsideXbox/statuses/385019924810178560\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The first time you die in GTA Online, you're respawned by an Epsilon Program angel(?) <a href=\"http://t.co/wTMlwfPuyO\">http://t.co/wTMlwfPuyO</a></p>— OutsideXbox (@OutsideXbox) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OutsideXbox/statuses/385019924810178560\">October 1, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524ad333e4b00c9d0a811010\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T14:56:12.860+01:00\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Eurogamer has a story on the in-game payment cards, which let players purchase GTA currency for real cash.

The usual way of dealing with this is to run a cluster where there isn't just a single machine but quite a few machines. The issue with this then becomes one of replicating the state of the online world amongst all of this different servers. When you launch a game it's not an easy task to work out how large the cluster needs to be. One solution is a scalable system that brings servers online based on demand which is how services like Amazon elastic cloud work - you can literally bring new servers into life if the usage count of your servers spikes. Given a large persistent world [like GTA Online] this is not a trivial action since it probably requires large amounts of data to be replicated so on launch day they would want to predict a typical use case that copes with a large initial flood of users.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524ad150e4b00c9d0a81100d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T14:44:51.580+01:00\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Rockstar has set up a dedicated <a href=\"http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200426246\">GTA Online launch status</a> page, which is cataloging the latest problems encountered by players.

        "headline":"Ed Miliband pays high price for forcing Daily Mail to carry his right of reply",
        "body":"<p>Ed Miliband is rapidly emerging as a scourge of the right-wing press. His bitter complaint to the Daily Mail about its attack on his father follows his willingness to go to war with Rupert Murdoch over phone-hacking.</p><p>And it underlines just why he has been eager to forge a new system of independent press regulation, in opposition to the majority of newspaper publishers, as part of the post-Leveson settlement.</p><p>Politicians get so used to personalised press criticism that they usually shrug and accept, as Miliband observes, that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439593/Why-father-loved-Britain-Ed-Miliband.html\">\"it comes with the territory\"</a>.</p><p>But he was unable to turn the other cheek when he read the Mail's article, which claimed that his father, Ralph, was a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2435751/GEOFFREY-LEVY-SATURDAY-ESSAY-Red-Eds-pledge-bring-socialism-homage-Marxist-father.html\">\"man who hated Britain\"</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/01/ed-miliband-daily-mail-father-row\">As Patrick Wintour reports,</a> Miliband argued his case for a right of reply with such force that the Mail's editor, Paul Dacre, was forced to give him space.</p><p>It came at a price. Dacre could not allow Miliband's article to appear without reinforcing the paper's prejudices. So he surrounded Miliband's defence of his father with two more articles, one repeating most of the original piece and another, an editorial, stating: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/An-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">\"We stand by every word of what we published.\"</a> </p><p>Even so, I cannot recall the Mail ever running an article that contained such trenchant criticism of its journalism. At the heart of Miliband's piece are these key paragraphs:</p><blockquote><p>\"Britain has always benefited from a free press. Those freedoms should be treasured. They are vital for our democracy. Journalists need to hold politicians like me to account — none of us should be given an easy ride — and I look forward to a robust 19 months between now and the general election.</p><p>But what appeared in the Daily Mail on Saturday was of a different order all together. I know they say 'you can't libel the dead', but you can smear them.</p><p>Fierce debate about politics does not justify character assassination of my father, questioning the patriotism of a man who risked his life for our country in world war II, or publishing a picture of his gravestone with a tasteless pun about him being a 'grave socialist.'\"</p></blockquote><p>Miliband, barely hiding his personal hurt, manages to show how \"a free press\" can be subverted by intense political bias.</p><p>Elsewhere he shows how the Mail constructed its assault on the memory of his father by relying on \"a single diary entry\" written by his father as a 17-year-old fugitive from Nazi oppression.</p><p>While prepared himself to take the usual brickbats Labour leaders can expect from the Mail, he writes: \"My Dad is a different matter. He died in 1994. I loved him and he loved Britain. And there is no credible argument in the article or evidence from his life which can remotely justify the lurid headline [The man who hated Britain].\"</p><p>He accuses the Mail of brushing over his father's wartime years in the navy and his contribution to the fight against a regime that murdered his Jewish relatives.</p><p>In accepting that his father had \"strongly left-wing views\" he points out that, despite them, he viewed Britain as \"a source of hope and comfort for him, not hatred… he loved Britain for the security it offered his family and the gentle decency of our nation.\"</p><p>Miliband's article destroyed the basis for the Mail's Saturday essay by Geoffrey Levy. But the Mail was having none of it.</p><p>Its editorial is a disingenuous attempt to appear surprised at Miliband having dared to complain: \"Red Ed's in a strop with the Mail…  he has stamped his feet and demanded a right of reply.\"</p><p>It calls Miliband's response \"tetchy and menacing\" and affects to overlook the key point of his argument - that the attack relied on a single entry in a 17-year-old's diary - by simply repeating it as some kind of justification for its hatchet job.</p><p>The Mail then charts Ralph Miliband's so-called sins for his supposed \"hatred\" for Britain's \"values, traditions and institutions\" and his opposition to the Falklands war.</p><p>At one point, I thought I was reading a piece from the Daily Express in the lead-up to the 1945 general election with its references to \"extremist left-winger Harold Laski\" and Miliband's friendship with \"fellow Marxist\" Eric Hobsbawm.</p><p>Then, despite a denial, comes the attempt to link father to son:</p><blockquote><p>\"We do not maintain, like the jealous god of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. </p><p>But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.\"</p></blockquote><p>It continues by arguing that \"his son's own Marxist values can be seen all too clearly in his plans for state seizures of private land held by builders and for fixing energy prices by government diktat.\"</p><p>And finally comes another message ahead of this month's landmark decision by the privy council on the future of press regulation:</p><blockquote><p>\"More chillingly, the father's disdain for freedom of expression can be seen in his son's determination to place the British press under statutory control…</p><p>If he crushes the freedom of the press, no doubt his father will be proud of him from beyond the grave, where he lies 12 yards from the remains of Karl Marx.\"</p></blockquote><p>Miliband now knows well enough that, in this secular world, \"the jealous god of Deuteronomy\" is not the problem. It is the wrathful god of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, who seeks to control his, and our, destiny.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418716121|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|a6ab1ad8b906498ee1aef824da3473471e7bd607 -->",

        "body":"<p>Edin Dzeko has taken a swipe at Roberto Mancini while hailing the Italian's successor at Manchester City, Manuel Pellegrini, for showing the belief that has helped the striker to an impressive start to the season.</p><p>Dzeko was frustrated at being rotated by Mancini with one infamous illustration coming two years ago at Bayern Munich, whom City host in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.</p><p>Dzeko was taken off after 55 minutes by Mancini at the Allianz Arena during the group stages of the 2011-12 competition, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/27/bayern-munich-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">City losing 2-0</a>. The decision angered the forward who engaged in a touchline spat with Mancini before throwing his tracksuit to the turf.</p><p>This presaged Carlos Tevez refusing to warm-up which subsequently caused the Argentinian's major fall-out with Mancini and club.</p><p>Regarding his displays so far under Pellegrini, which have yielded four goals in nine appearances, Dzeko said: \"I think my form is a tribute to the new coach. The manager is very important to a player's form, and I have noticed a difference. I think for every player it is important he knows the manager believes in him, and it is important he has the confidence of the manager. That helps you to find the best form.\"</p><p>At various times since joining from Wolfsburg in January 2011 for £27m, Dzeko has been linked with a move away from City due to his uneven form. He said: \"There was a lot of speculation about my future, I heard I was supposed to be leaving, but I never heard from the club they wanted to sell me. And you never heard from me I wanted to leave. I am happy, I have the confidence of the manager and my form is good.\"</p><p>Reminded of the disputes he and Tevez had with Mancini at Bayern and asked how much City have progressed since then, Dzeko bristled when initially mishearing the question. \"What has Carlos Tevez got do with it?\" he asked, before the subject was clarified and he replied: \"I think the club is also improving, I really do.</p><p>\"Since that game against Bayern in Munich the club has been bringing in some great players and the new manager, and we want to improve all together on the pitch, do it together. We are playing together and we have confidence.\"</p><p>David Silva and Sergio Agüero have both been nursing injuries and regarding whether the former will be available, Pellegrini said: \"David is in the squad list. He can be at least some minutes tomorrow.\" On Agüero, the manager added: \"Sergio is fit and he is also on the list.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418730018|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|bd89cc275bb74a4c83673025a9153af866e78faf -->",

American classics of the 50s and 60s are strongly represented – On the Road by Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood – as are tales of working-class boys made good, which emerged in the postwar years: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141041735/billy-liar\" title=\"\">Keith Waterhouse's Billy Liar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099445364/room-at-the-top\" title=\"\">Room at the Top by John Braine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780753814321/the-outsider\" title=\"\">The Outsider by Colin Wilson</a>, a study of creativity and the mindset of misfits. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780422705400/divided-self\" title=\"\">RD Laing's The Divided Self</a> speaks to a fascination with psychotherapy and creativity, as does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780140174915/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind\" title=\"\">The Origin of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, by Julian Jaynes. </a> There is no evidence that Bowie's scientific inquries extend beyond psychology – Stephen Hawking's cosmic theories are out – but his tastes are otherwise broad.</p><p>Political history features, in titles such as Christopher Hitchens' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780857898357/the-trial-of-henry-kissinger\" title=\"\">The Trial of Henry Kissinger</a>, and Orlando Figes' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780712673273/a-peoples-tragedy-the-russian-revolution\" title=\"\">A People's Tragedy</a>, as well as collections of interviews.</p><p>A broad taste for fiction emerges, too, from early Ian McEwan (<a href=\"http://www.ianmcewan.com/bib/books/sheets.html\" title=\"\">In Between the Sheets</a>) and Martin Amis's definitive 1980s novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/may/15/martin-amis-money-tv-series\" title=\"\">Money</a>, to 21st-century fictions such as Sarah Waters' Fingersmith and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\" title=\"\">Oscar Wao</a> by Junot Diaz.</p><p>He also displays a penchant for irreverent humour, with the inclusion of Spike Milligan's comic novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780140023749/puckoon\" title=\"\">Puckoon</a>, and the entire oeuvres of <a href=\"http://www.viz.com/\" title=\"\">Viz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Private Eye</a>. </p><p>And, of course, there's music – with soul music especially prominent. Bowie selects <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/music/9781841952406/sweet-soul-music-rhythm-and-blues-and-the-southern-dream-of-freedom\">Sweet Soul Music: Rhythm and Blues and the Southern Dream</a> of Freedom by Peter Guralnick, <a href=\"http://www.djhistory.com/books/nowhere-to-run-the-story-of-soul-music-gerri-hirshey-1994\" title=\"\">and  Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music</a> by Gerri Hirshey, as well as Charlie Gillett's The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll.</p><h2>David Bowie's top 100 must-read books</h2><p>The Age of American Unreason, Susan Jacoby (2008)<br />The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz (2007)<br />The Coast of Utopia (trilogy), Tom Stoppard (2007) <br />Teenage: The Creation of Youth 1875-1945, Jon Savage (2007)<br />Fingersmith, Sarah Waters (2002)<br />The Trial of Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens (2001)<br />Mr Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder, Lawrence Weschler (1997)<br />A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1890-1924, Orlando Figes (1997)<br />The Insult, Rupert Thomson (1996)<br />Wonder Boys, Michael Chabon (1995)<br />The Bird Artist, Howard Norman (1994)<br />Kafka Was the Rage: A Greenwich Village Memoir, Anatole Broyard (1993)<br />Beyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective, Arthur C Danto (1992)<br />Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson, Camille Paglia (1990)<br />David Bomberg, Richard Cork (1988)<br />Sweet Soul Music: Rhythm and Blues and the Southern Dream of Freedom, Peter Guralnick (1986)<br />The Songlines, Bruce Chatwin (1986)<br />Hawksmoor, Peter Ackroyd (1985)<br />Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music, Gerri Hirshey (1984)<br />Nights at the Circus, Angela Carter (1984)<br />Money, Martin Amis (1984)<br />White Noise, Don DeLillo (1984)<br />Flaubert's Parrot, Julian Barnes (1984)<br />The Life and Times of Little Richard, Charles White (1984)<br />A People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn (1980)<br />A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole (1980)<br />Interviews with Francis Bacon, David Sylvester (1980)<br />Darkness at Noon, Arthur Koestler (1980)<br />Earthly Powers, Anthony Burgess (1980)<br />Raw, a \"graphix magazine\" (1980-91)<br />Viz, magazine (1979 –)<br />The Gnostic Gospels, Elaine Pagels (1979)<br />Metropolitan Life, Fran Lebowitz (1978)<br />In Between the Sheets, Ian McEwan (1978)<br />Writers at Work: The Paris Review Interviews, ed Malcolm Cowley (1977)<br />The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, Julian Jaynes (1976)<br />Tales of Beatnik Glory, Ed Saunders (1975)<br />Mystery Train, Greil Marcus (1975)<br />Selected Poems, Frank O'Hara (1974)<br />Before the Deluge: A Portrait of Berlin in the 1920s, Otto Friedrich (1972)<br /> n Bluebeard's Castle: Some Notes Towards the Re-definition of Culture, George Steiner (1971) Octobriana and the Russian Underground, Peter Sadecky (1971)<br />The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock and Roll, Charlie Gillett(1970)<br />The Quest for Christa T, Christa Wolf (1968)<br />Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The Golden Age of Rock, Nik Cohn (1968)<br />The Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov (1967)<br />Journey into the Whirlwind, Eugenia Ginzburg (1967)<br />Last Exit to Brooklyn, Hubert Selby Jr (1966)<br />In Cold Blood, Truman Capote (1965)<br />City of Night, John Rechy (1965)<br />Herzog, Saul Bellow (1964)<br />Puckoon, Spike Milligan (1963)<br />The American Way of Death, Jessica Mitford (1963)<br />The Sailor Who Fell from Grace With the Sea, Yukio Mishima (1963)<br />The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin (1963)<br />A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess (1962)<br />Inside the Whale and Other Essays, George Orwell (1962)<br />The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Muriel Spark (1961)<br />Private Eye, magazine (1961 –)<br />On Having No Head: Zen and the Rediscovery of the Obvious, Douglas Harding (1961)<br />Silence: Lectures and Writing, John Cage (1961)<br />Strange People, Frank Edwards (1961)<br />The Divided Self, RD Laing (1960)<br />All the Emperor's Horses, David Kidd (1960)<br />Billy Liar, Keith Waterhouse (1959)<br />The Leopard, Giuseppe di Lampedusa (1958)<br />On the Road, Jack Kerouac (1957)<br />The Hidden Persuaders, Vance Packard (1957)<br />Room at the Top, John Braine (1957)<br />A Grave for a Dolphin, Alberto Denti di Pirajno (1956)<br />The Outsider, Colin Wilson (1956)<br />Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov (1955)<br />Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell (1949)<br />The Street, Ann Petry (1946)<br />Black Boy, Richard Wright (1945)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418734175|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|37ea906595430817ba5afc96e3331cf7e9054a83 -->",

Robert Smith, 56, who has manned a stall selling pins and badges to raise funds for veterans beside the memorial for the last 26 years, recalled the last shutdown, under President Clinton in 1996. &quot;It wasn't as bad as this,&quot; he said. &quot;They weren't stopping buses coming through as they are now.

We're doing everything we can to stave off the bills. We live check to check like everybody else.&quot;</p> <p>Stanislaus had a clear idea of who to blame for the shutdown.</p> <p>&quot;The Tea Party assholes that put Obamacare on an appropriations bill need to be shot in the head.

It's the first government shutdown in 17 years.</p> <p>The president signed a bill late on Monday defending against one of the most painful effects of a shutdown: the bill ensured there would be no delay in delivering paychecks to active-duty military personnel. The core services of other big government programs, including Medicare and social security, were expected to operate as usual.</p> <p>The House and Senate played ping-pong on Monday with stopgap spending resolutions that would have kept the government open if they were able to agree on one. The last House resolution retained delays in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act that the Senate leadership had made clear would be rejected. The resolution was rejected, and at about 11.40pm ET the office of management of the budget sent out a memo ordering agencies to &quot;execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.&quot; Read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/us-government-shutdown-congress-deadline-live\">Jim Newell's play-by-play of last night's action here</a>, and Graeme Wearden's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/01/us-government-shutdown-world-economy-dollar-live\">early-morning updates here</a>.</p> <p>Just before the shutdown, House Republicans made a significant move on the overall budget issue, electing to join a conference with the Senate to cut an actual budget deal, a step the House leadership had been resisting. Senate majority leader <strong>Harry Reid</strong> said he would not bargain over the current spending measure at a budget conference.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephen_nessen/statuses/385007537638367232\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>PHOTO; It's official, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island closed. <a href=\"http://t.co/vhO8uPLhuQ\">pic.twitter.com/vhO8uPLhuQ</a></p>— Stephen Nessen (@stephen_nessen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephen_nessen/statuses/385007537638367232\">October 1, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T14:43:49.834+01:00\">at 9.43am ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418745126|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|79bea75760d4923d864efd55734b7c288ef27e7a -->",

        "body":"<p>The limitations of the Football Association's newly adopted powers to take retrospective action have been exposed in their first high-profile test after Fernando Torres escaped a violent conduct charge for scratching Jan Vertonghen in the face.</p><p>Chelsea were braced to see Torres banned for a further three matches, ruling him out of all their domestic fixtures in October, after television footage captured the striker apparently clawing at the Belgian centre-half's cheek five minutes into the second half of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/28/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Saturday's 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur</a>.</p><p>The referee, Mike Dean, booked the Spaniard for tripping Vertonghen in the build-up to their altercation but the fact he had not then witnessed Torres raising his hand to his marker potentially meant the FA could refer the incident to its new three-man panel of former referees.</p><p>However, having taken statements from the officials at White Hart Lane, the governing body determined that the assistant referee closest to the incident, Jake Collin, had seen \"the coming together of the two players, albeit not in its entirety\".</p><p>Torres's scratch had been to the left side of Vertonghen's face, with the assistant on the other side of the players and therefore unsighted, but because the linesman had effectively seen the forward raise his hand, the FA concluded it could not refer the matter to its panel. Torres was later sent off after accruing a second yellow card, somewhat harshly after jumping with Vertonghen, but his suspension will extend no further than Sunday's Premier League game at Norwich City.</p><p>Chelsea had been privately concerned the FA might consider the scratch an exceptional incident of violent conduct worthy of more than a standard three-match ban, having seen the body impose heavy sanctions on Luis Suárez for biting Branislav Ivanovic and Eden Hazard for clashing with a ball-boy. If the FA had gone down that road the club would have denied a charge but it is understood they would have been prepared, albeit reluctantly, to accept the standard three-match violent conduct ban.</p><p>The FA's new process on retrospective sanctions is being piloted this season, with a three-man panel of former referees permitted to review incidents and decide if a charge ought to be brought if the match officials had not witnessed the possible offence. That replaced the old system, whereby action was only taken if the referee viewed footage post-match and conceded he would have sent a player off had he witnessed the misdemeanour at the time. But, in both cases, if any match official saw part of the incident – even if not the full detail – the FA would not take further action, a reality that has offered Torres his reprieve.</p><p>An FA statement concluded: \"In these particular circumstances, in line with the FA's policy on when retrospective action may be taken, reviewed this summer by the game's stakeholders [the Premier League, the Football League, the Professional Footballers' Association, the League Managers' Association, Professional Game Match Officials Limited and the National Game], no action may be taken.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418651847|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|50af38936ad10554ad64dfc8052c9d30b658d49e -->",

        "headline":"In slurring Ed Miliband's father, the Mail offends a British sense of fair play",
        "body":"<p>Now a second iron law of British politics has been broken. Last week Ed Miliband broke the rule that says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/ed-milband-new-populism-energy-prices\" title=\"\">a shift leftward can never be popular</a>, with his promise to freeze energy bills. Today he has broken another political rule: the unwritten ordinance that states a politician must never reply to an attack from the Daily Mail, lest it merely stir the paper to inflict further punishment.</p><p>The Labour leader has written <a href=\"http://labourpress.tumblr.com/post/62751616247/ed-miliband-my-dad-was-a-man-who-loved-britain\" title=\"\">a reply in the Mail</a> to a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2435751/GEOFFREY-LEVY-SATURDAY-ESSAY-Red-Eds-pledge-bring-socialism-homage-Marxist-father.html\" title=\"\">long article the paper ran on Saturday</a> about his father, the socialist scholar Ralph Miliband. Its headline: \"The man who hated Britain\". That piece followed the familiar hatchet-job template, scouring Miliband Sr's writings for quotes that could be pulled out of context to show the subject in the worst possible light, in this case as a Marxist extremist. His son's reply states simply: \"My Dad was a man who loved Britain.\"</p><p>Sure enough, by showing the temerity to fight back, Miliband has prompted the Mail to hit him again. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\" title=\"\">Its editorial today – headlined \"An evil legacy and why we won't apologise\" –</a> slams the Labour leader for everything from showing too much public affection for his wife Justine (\"yucky\") to his support for Lord Justice Leveson's proposals on press regulation (perhaps the root cause of the Mail's ire). It closes with a declaration that if Miliband gets his way, he will drive \"a hammer and sickle through the heart of the nation so many of us genuinely love\".</p><p>But the Mail may have miscalculated. For in this battle, as he did last week, Miliband will surely command public sympathy. To put it in language the Mail itself might understand, its continuing campaign against the late Ralph Miliband violates every cherished British notion of fair play. Obviously, it smears the dead who cannot answer back. But it also faults Ed Miliband, not for something he has said or done himself but on account of one of his parents. Even David Cameron had to concede on the Today programme this morning that \"If anyone had a go at my father, I would want to respond very vigorously.\" (Tellingly, the prime minister did not go so far as to criticise the Mail for its attack, insisting he had not read the offending article – thereby staying on the right side of that iron law which has <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/09/milibands-defence-his-father-against-daily-mail-defining-moment\" title=\"\">restrained every British politician until Miliband</a>.)</p><p>The sympathy that will come the Labour leader's way is not mysterious. Most Britons will conclude that whatever else his faults, Miliband cannot be blamed for the actions of his father, any more – in fact, rather less – than the Mail editor Paul Dacre can be held responsible for the Mail's support of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists at around the time Ralph Miliband was a refugee from Nazi persecution. None of us get to choose our parents.</p><p>Ah, but he has not renounced or denounced his socialist father, the Mail might reply. But surely most people understand that a son's love for his father is not contingent, or even related to, ideology. Ralph Miliband was a teacher and theoretician; even if his son thought he was wrong, the father committed no deed in his life that merits the family rupture the Mail is implicitly demanding. Even many Mail readers will surely admire, rather than condemn, Miliband for wanting to defend his father's good name.</p><p>So much for the general ugliness of attacking a man by attacking his parents. But the specific nature of the assault on Miliband Sr also repels. To slam a Jewish refugee from Nazi persecution who within years of his arrival in Britain was serving in the Royal Navy is not only bizarre, it is also directly at odds with the kind of patriotic values the Mail claims to champion. Today's editorial weirdly suggests, on the basis of a diary entry written when Ralph Miliband was 17, that he joined the navy only because he hated the Nazis, not because he loved Britain, which in the Mail's view puts him on a moral par with the Soviet Union. This from a paper which in the 1930s ran the headline <a href=\"http://www.voiceoftheturtle.org/dictionary/dict_h1.php#hurrah\" title=\"\">\"Hurrah for the Blackshirts\"</a>.</p><p>There are plenty on the left who have long believed the Mail to be a dark, brooding presence in British public life, churning out its daily diet of going-to-the-dogs pessimism. Now many others will see why. For attacking Ed Miliband via his late father, that newspaper has revealed its ugliest face.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418723383|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|066ff9f9414863aaa1025dd71f64e37a9b3151b3 -->",

        "headline":"The 10 best quotes from financial insiders",
        "body":"<p>Two years ago this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog\" title=\"\">banking blog</a> offered financial insiders &quot;openness in return for anonymity&quot;. The response was overwhelming, and now that the blog comes to an end, I want to express immense gratitude for all those hundreds of banking staff and financial workers, as well as to the insiders who enriched the comment threads.</p><p>So this is adieu for now, as I go off to write a book. Let me leave you with the banking blog in 10 quotes.</p><p></p><h2>1. Most enlightening<br /></h2><p>A human resources officer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/02/voices-of-finance-employee-relations-manager\" title=\"\">explains what's hanging over people</a> working in high finance:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;When the call comes, people know right away. We may use the most innocent tone of voice when we say: 'Hi, could you pop up to the 20th floor for a moment?' They know better: you never get an unexpected call from that person, except … It is amazing how fast news of a round of redundancies spreads. It's like this tidal wave of panic washes across a trading floor … After our conversation, which typically lasts five minutes, they will be led out of the building by security.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>2. Proudest<br /></h2><p>If you want to know how it feels from the other side, read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2013/jul/19/happy-banker-treasury-1\" title=\"\">this banker in treasury sales</a> before his redundancy at a major bank:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;Insiders on your blog who are so negative about the sector … it's not very kind to say, but they just didn't make it. They get kicked out and then they go complain to the media. It's tough to take, obviously. You had to go while your colleague is still at his desk. Because he was better.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>3. Humblest<br /></h2><p>And after his redundancy:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;Looking back I may have fallen victim to the self-serving idea that we control our fate; as long as you're good nothing bad can happen to you, and since nothing bad has happened to me, it must mean I am good and therefore safe; that sort of thing. In the same way military men tell themselves that they can't die because they don't make mistakes. But the best soldier can drive over a land mine.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>4. All-time favourite comment thread<br /></h2><p>In which a banking equity analyst <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/16611750\" title=\"\">debates with readers</a> whether he deserved his one million pound bonus:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;Do I deserve to be me, rather than some guy in Darfur trying not to starve to death or get murdered. I get paid a lot because I can do things, but if I had been born mentally handicapped I wouldn't. That's life. I do ask to be paid well when I've done good work, but that doesn't mean I feel entitled to anything.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>5. Wisest<br /></h2><p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/23/voices-of-finance-structuring-equity-derivatives\" title=\"\">structurer</a> had worked for one of the most prestigious banks for a decade, building such cleverly complex financial products that his clients failed to understand that they didn't understand them. Looking back, he says:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;It's strange. Bankers are so smart, yet they get this thing wrong. They spend their lives in an office when the only truly valuable thing in life is time. It is the only thing that is not replenishable. You can always make more money, but you can never get more time. Maybe it's because death is such a taboo in our society; that people live in this illusion that their life will go on forever.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>6. Most terrifying<br /></h2><p>So many interviewees on this blog have said that their banks seem too big and complex to even manage, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/jun/25/senior-fsa-regulator\" title=\"\">this regulator</a>:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;We rely upon self-declaration, upon what is presented to us by a bank's internal management. But often they don't know what's going on, because banks today are so vast and hugely complex. I don't think I have ever been deliberately lied to – though obviously I might not know about it. The real threat is not a bank's management hiding things from us: it's the management not knowing themselves what the risks are, either because nobody realises it or because some people are keeping it from their bosses.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>7. Most succinct summary of the draw of it all<br /></h2><p>Investment banks are strictly hierarchical beasts. Managing directors are high up in the tree, expecting to make at least a million in a good year. This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/18/equity-capital-markets-ex-md\" title=\"\">former MD</a> summarises what kept him in banking for so long:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;Investment banking is a trap, a game and an addiction. The reward is big, but uncertain, which makes it exciting and keeps you coming back for more. Once the money starts flowing it's very, very hard to take yourself away from it. Doing a deal is like scoring a goal, or maybe for journalists, getting a scoop. The game element is in the rivalry with other teams, winning the mandate, legging over the competition … Also the emptiness that comes with addiction.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>8. Easiest target <br /></h2><p>For a bit of context, the blog has also interviewed a number of bankers' partners, family members and exes. Howls of outrage reverberated across cyberspace when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2011/dec/30/bankers-wife-financial-work\" title=\"\">a banker's wife</a> said this:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;You want me to estimate a starting teacher's salary? I don't know. Let me think, &pound;45,000? Wow, it's really only &pound;22,000? I had no idea. That really is too low, I could not live on that. Well, obviously this is something that has to change. I mean, these teachers have had to invest in their own education and are now educating the next generation, right? I am rather shocked by this, are you sure?&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>9. Most shocking<br /></h2><p>Investment bankers have happily absorbed the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; epithet. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/apr/05/former-head-structured-credit-voices-finance\" title=\"\">this interview</a> with a banker in charge of an algorithm gone haywire, demonstrates that they may not even be masters of their own bank:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;Those were scary days. You think: we are in a new paradigm. Nothing works any more the way it used to. My department's potential losses were hundreds of millions of pounds and several billions across the whole of the bank. We began to realise: this could sink the bank. In fact, we were bankrupt three or four times; our bank owed more than it owned. We were lucky to have a parent company with very deep pockets. I was struggling to keep it afloat. If the market had crashed further we would have gone down … This was a bomb and I was basically the only one who could defuse it.&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>10. Favourite anthropological insight<br /></h2><p>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2011/sep/15/competition-lawyer-mergers-and-acquisitions\" title=\"\">financial lawyer</a> has a wonderfully sharp eye for dress codes. We met in a restaurant and I asked him to describe what he saw:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>&quot;I'd say, mostly lawyers. There are several big law firms around here, and lawyers need to have lunch. I see no trophy wives or trophy girlfriends, no extravagantly dressed women. I see men who keep their jackets on, which is what we tend to do as lawyers – many would not want to be the first to take it off and most lawyers I know leave it on anyhow, keeping the uniform intact makes you look solid. I see inconspicuous ties, also a lawyer thing. This restaurant serves very good quality food but it is not flashy, I believe only this week the Sunday Times called the interior 'boring'. Boring is good, for lawyers. We sell reliability, solidity and caution. We want our presentation to mirror that. And we often charge hefty fees, so we don't flash our wealth because then clients are going to think: wait, am I not paying too much?&quot;<br /></blockquote><p></p><h2>Read on …</h2><p>Scroll down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joris-luyendijk\" title=\"\">from here</a> for all interviews plus wrap-up pieces on this blog in reverse chronological order.

        "headline":"Telling a racist joke in front of a black friend doesn't make it audacious fun",
        "body":"<p>Racist jokes have a long and sad existence. In the 70s and 80s they provided comic fodder for standups such as Jim Davidson and Bernard Manning and were delivered to an audience of the predominantly converted. More recently they have been adopted by the <a href=\"http://www.racialicious.com/2012/05/02/a-historical-guide-to-hipster-racism/\" title=\"\">\"hipster racist\"</a>, who can, at the expense of black people, \"ironically\" don blackface for cheap laughs yet remain genuinely bemused at being labelled a racist. It has reinvented itself yet again. Now it is acceptable to crack a racist joke in the presence of those it is dehumanising.</p><p>It is a Friday night and I have just boarded the train from a village in West Yorkshire to Leeds. A group of youngsters, out to celebrate their A-level successes, are sitting next to me, huffing and puffing, congratulating themselves on making the 19.18 on time. Passing around the wine they have stowed away in their water bottles, they laugh easily until one member of the group declares that she is \"sweating like a Jew in a shower\". Perhaps I am a little slow because at first I am not fully aware of the meaning behind the statement. Her friends glance around the carriage, giggly but visibly uncomfortable; one of them tells her to \"shush\" and asks whether she has had \"too much\". The penny finally drops. The depravity of the statement is breathtaking.</p><p>While the friends quickly forget the moment, and go back to enjoying their Friday night, disbelief makes me replay her words in my head. Sickened, I wonder if any of the group of friends are themselves Jewish and what they must be feeling if they are. One friend is south Asian, the look in her eyes particularly restless.</p><p>The group on the train were aware their friend had crossed a line yet they felt unable to challenge her. But in not confronting your friends when they make racist jokes, you unwittingly collude in their racism. As a society, we have failed in teaching our young about the ingenuity and flexibility of racism; it is why such jokes remain. Many adults themselves find it difficult to grasp. Racism is not simply a cardboard cut-out of the extreme right – it is more fluid and complex than we give it credit for.</p><p>I am reminded of another incident told to me by my dual heritage 18-year–old neighbour. Out at a pub in Hertfordshire, the only person from an ethnic minority within the group, friendly banter leads a good friend to label her \"a tree ornament\". She too doesn't fully get the joke until she recounts it to her white mother, whose anger and pain makes her explain to her daughter that her friends are dangerous. Through tears, the daughter loyally insists that her friend is not a racist.</p><p>The anachronistic nature of these jokes – one about the terror of lynching, the other about the horror of the Holocaust – seemingly makes their delivery somehow much more acceptable in the eyes of the joke teller. This joke really isn't about you; it is about dead people, dead people from a long time ago, so you don't have to make such a big deal about it. This is especially difficult for young people, black and white and in diverse friendship groups, to tackle.</p><p>\"I am not a racist but…\" has become the prelude to saying something deeply racist. I have heard that phrase far too often. Uttered in my presence, it furtively tells me that I have been given special dispensation as a black person to hear the \"truth\" about another ethnic minority. That it is not specifically about me is somehow proof enough that the speaker isn't a racist who can and should reconsider what they are saying. It asks me to collude.</p><p>Racist jokes, made publicly and in the company of black and minority ethnic friends, operate in much the same way. I am not a racist because you (insert ethnic minority label) are my friend, so how can I be? I am not a racist, so I can share this brutal and brutalising joke with you. I am simply engaging in audacious wordplay, taking part in the postmodern irony that is a sign of our ambivalent times.</p><p>Our society is postracial – or so we are frequently told when racism rears its ugly head. It's a society in which the prejudice many ethnic minorities experience is often <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/black-people-racism-martha-renee-kolleh\" title=\"\">countered with incredulity, minimised and diminished</a>. It is a society with a predominantly two-dimensional understanding of how bigotry operates: racists exist on the margins and are evil; they do not look like you or me but are somehow physically marked as monsters, rather than everyday people. This line of argument does no favours to any of us, least of all people from ethnic minorities. What it serves to do is to create the false idea that racist acts are infrequent, extraordinary and, crucially, committed only by those who self-identify as such.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418725644|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|241959c0a1d31919bc728d5c1426b82daea73d4a -->",

        "trailText":"<strong>Michael Rosen</strong> has a few queries for the education secretary about an article he has written for a magazine …",
        "headline":"Dear Mr Gove: Michael Rosen's letter from a curious parent",
        "body":"<p>I've been reading an <a href=\"http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/5147\" title=\"\">article you wrote</a> in September's issue of Standpoint magazine, where you make many claims for what you're doing to the education system in England. You start by drawing conclusions from your own personal experience by contrasting the secondary school experience of some students at a Merseyside school with your own. Fair enough – except that you forgot to tell us that your secondary education was at a private school. Whatever the virtues of Robert Gordon's college, the two ways to get into the school – by paying or by scholarship – were not available to all. But then isn't that why such schools exist? Precisely in order to bestow something exclusive on a tiny minority, with only a tiny minority of that minority being offered – as you were – admission by exam.</p><p>You imply throughout your article that it is the excellent education you received at Robert Gordon's that you want everyone to get. It's an honourable objective, and in order to explain why England's state schools aren't as good as yours was, you conjure up the image of teachers, unions, local authorities and a Labour government straining to deprive poor children of a good education. By contrast, you say, your government has been \"setting out to prove that every child can succeed\". The problem with this argument is that your government has put in place rock-hard structures and processes that will guarantee that every child can't succeed.</p><p>So, you claim that you've been \"recruiting more highly qualified teachers\", but neglect to remind us that you've \"freed up\" academies and free schools to recruit non-qualified teachers. You say that you've \"restored rigour and honesty to our exams\", but forget to tell us that your interference with <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/a-level-and-gcse-examiners-told-to-ration-top-marks\" title=\"\">exam-grading</a> has, for political reasons, fixed the marks. It has become impossible for pupils at 16 to improve on the scores they got at 11. Rigour? You mean \"rigged\". You say you \"reward schools that teach the traditional subjects\", but neglect to mention that this means by default students are getting less technology, drama, art and music, as if these are less valid or less useful. You say you've \"toughened up inspection\", but I hear from schools that this translates as Ofsted inspectors becoming increasingly unwilling to listen to teachers.</p><p>You talk about wanting every school to be as good as the best, but schools are placed in league tables, which by definition rank all the schools bar the first as not \"being as good as the best\". You claim that the academy programme will bring about school improvement across the board, but you deprive your readers of any stats on how many academies are failing Ofsted, how many you ordered to change their management, how many have called for help from the \"local bureaucratic monopolies\" (your words).</p><p>You conjure up the picture of a \"we\" hoping to \"compete internationally\" and \"providing jobs for all\" being held back by low marks. Perhaps you didn't notice your party choosing to withdraw from international competition in labour-intensive industries, opting instead for financial services. Perhaps you didn't notice that it wasn't low exam marks that blew Britain's productive capacity out of the window, but the greed of those same financial services. Perhaps you didn't notice your own government re-jigging the labour market so that \"jobs for all\" means lower pay, zero-hours contracts, a pool of the unemployed and part-time work for millions. The international competition your government believes in has nothing to do with good exam grades. It's all about low pay.</p><p>In the article you talk of the virtues of a knowledge-rich curriculum as if this is good because it is \"traditional\". It is indeed \"traditional\" in that there was a long tradition of the knowledge-rich curriculum being used as a means of segregating pupils. It proved to be ideal for selecting pupils for different kinds of school, different kinds of course, different streams and different exams. You seem unable or unwilling to explain how a \"knowledge-rich curriculum\" is of itself liberating for all, whilst in my time at school it was so ideal for excluding the majority from its virtues.</p><p>You trumpet the glories of what you call our \"world-class\" A-levels. I've been in an international school this week and their view of the international competition you go on about is that only the International Baccalaureate will do. There's a clue in the name, I guess.</p><p>Of course you tell us that performance-related pay is going to improve teaching. No, it will be an obstacle for improvement because it will inhibit many teachers from sharing their skills, knowhow and knowledge. Surely, it's when we share expertise that we raise standards?</p><p>Your legacy is the near-complete destruction of local democratic running of schools. You adopt a rhetoric in this article and elsewhere that dresses this up in the language of liberty. You cite Tony Blair, who talked of schools being \"freed\" from \"politically correct interference from state or municipality\", but then you forget to tell us that this new freedom is controlled by a political interference from somewhere else: from one person – the education secretary.</p><p>And the sum total of all this is improvement?</p><p>(By the way, according to your criteria – not mine – your own international competitiveness will be held back by the fact that you spelled Massachusetts \"Massachussetts\".)</p><p><strong>Yours, Michael Rosen</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418462594|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|8c5c760146fe632b4478835149c8e42569073293 -->",

        "headline":"Chvrches' Lauren Mayberry: 'I will not accept online misogyny'",
        "body":"<p>I am in a band that was born on the internet.</p><p>Although Chvrches formed and began writing in October 2011, we made our first wobbly steps into the public realm by posting a song on <a href=\"http://neongoldrecords.com/skin-bone/\" title=\"\">Neon Gold music blog</a> in May last year. Since then, the blogosphere and social networks have arguably been the key reasons anyone knows about us at all – labels, media and members of the public included. For that reason, it has always been important to us that we communicate directly with people who care about our band through the social networking sites we run.</p><p>There are, however, downsides to being known on the internet. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CHVRCHES/posts/727633030596626\" title=\"\">I posted a screengrab</a> of one of the many inappropriate messages sent to the band's social networks every day. After making the post, I sat back and watched with an increasingly open mouth as more and more people commented on the statement. At the time of writing, Facebook stats tell me that the post had reached 581,376 people, over five times the number of people who subscribe to the page itself, with almost 1,000 comments underneath the image. Comments range from the disgusted and supportive to the offensively vile. My current favourites from the latter category include:</p><p>\"This isn't rape culture. You'll know rape culture when I'm raping you, bitch\"</p><p>\"I have your address and I will come round to your house and give u anal and you will love it you twat lol\"</p><p>\"Act like a slut, getting treated like a sluy [sic]\"</p><p>\"It's just one of those things you'll need to learn to deal with. If you're easily offended, then maybe the music industry isn't for you\"</p><p>But why should women \"deal\" with this? I am incredibly lucky to be doing the job I am doing at the moment – and painfully aware of the fact that I would not be able to make music for a living without people on the internet caring about our band. But does that mean that I need to accept that it's OK for people to make comments like this, because that's how women in my position are  spoken to?</p><p>I absolutely accept that in this industry there is comment and criticism. There will always be bad reviews: such is the nature of a free press and free speech. When you put your work out there, you are accepting the fact that people will comment on it, but it is your choice whether you read it or not. (Kathleen Hanna sums this sentiment up nicely <a href=\"http://bombsite.com/issues/1000/articles/6583\" title=\"\">in this interview</a>.)</p><p>What I do not accept, however, is that it is all right for people to make comments ranging from \"a bit sexist but generally harmless\" to openly sexually aggressive. That it is something that \"just happens\". Is the casual objectification of women so commonplace that we should all just suck it up, roll over and accept defeat? I hope not. Objectification, whatever its form, is not something anyone should have to \"just deal with\".</p><p>Since we began the Facebook page, I have seen every message – good and bad – that has come into our inbox. Many people involved with our band argued that we should give up maintaining this routine as things got busier and Chvrches' schedule got tighter, but it is important to me that our fans know we value their interest in us by  giving things a personal touch. Perhaps people assume we have a team of fancy PAs who deal with our social networks for us. Maybe the men – and I'm sorry, but they are all men – sending the notifications of impending unsolicited \"anal\" bothering don't realise it will actually be me who reads the emails – or maybe they don't care either way. But in order to get to the messages from people who genuinely wish to share something with the band, I must filter through every condescending and offensive message we receive.</p><p><br />Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/chvrches/gun-music-video/1920411/\">Click here to watc</a>h</p><p>I read them every morning when I get up. I read them after soundcheck. I read them, as we all do with our emails and notifications, on my phone on the bus or when I have a break in the day. And, after a while, despite the positive messages in the majority, the aggressive, intrusive nature of the other kind becomes overwhelming. During this past tour, I am embarrassed to admit that I have had more than one prolonged toilet cry and a \"Come on, get a hold of yourself, you got this\" conversation with myself in a bathroom mirror when particularly exasperated and tired out. But then, after all the sniffling had ceased, I asked myself: why should I cry about this? Why should I feel violated, uncomfortable and demeaned? Why should we all keep quiet?</p><p>Women are spoken to like this every day, and not just those deemed to be in the public eye. The depressing reality is that campaigns like the <a href=\"http://everydaysexism.com/\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism Project</a> would not need to exist were casual sexism not so startlingly commonplace. I should note here that I have never said that men – in the public eye or otherwise – do not receive such comments. I can, however, only speak of what I know, which is that the number of offensive messages directed towards me, \"the girl singer,\" compared to my bandmates is undeniably higher. I should also clarify that this has nothing to do with hating men, as some have suggested. I identify as a feminist but subscribe to the pretty basic definition of a feminist as \"someone who seeks equality between the sexes\". I am now, and have always been, in bands with smart, supportive guys, and have many amazing men in my life as family and friends. For that I am incredibly grateful.</p><p>But maybe it's the personal side to online interaction that these men  fail to grasp.  It seems almost too obvious to ask, \"Would you condone this behaviour if it was directed at your mother/sister/daughter/wife/girlfriend?\" but maybe going back to basics is what the trolls or <a href=\"http://www.4chan.org\" title=\"\">4chan</a> addicts need. To learn a little empathy. To have a little respect for other people. To think before they speak.</p><p>Of my numerous personal failings (perpetual lateness; a tendency towards anxiety; a complete inability to bake anything, ever), naivety is not one. I am often cynical about aspects of the music industry and the media, and was sure from the off that this band would need to avoid doing certain things in order for us to be taken seriously as musicians – myself in particular. We have thus far been lucky enough to do things our own way and make a pretty decent job of our band without conforming to the \"push the girl to the front\" blueprint often relied upon by labels and management in a tragic attempt to sell records which has little to do with the music itself.</p><p>I am almost entirely sure that the comments underneath this article will be as varied as those underneath my original post. I am not a martyr, nor am I attempting to change the world in any revolutionary way. I am only in a band, not one of the many wonderful people in organisations striving for change. My involvement in this discussion is not motivated by a self-righteous or self-pitying urge. My hopes are that if anything good comes out of this, it will start a conversation, or continue the conversation which is already happening, encouraging others to reject an acceptance of the status quo, and that our band can continue to do what we are doing in our own way and on our own terms. For us, this has always been – and hopefully will always be – about the music, and that is what we will be getting back to now.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418655915|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|9a324f28333cdb7cf882a9dc1f4ad3c9bdd67025 -->",

Fantasy blossoms too: in a sensational picture by Hokusai, <a href=\"http://www.mardecortesbaja.com/HokusaiDreamFishermansWife.jpg\" title=\"\">two octopuses make love to a fisherman's wife</a>, their tentacles literally everywhere. Her face is ecstatic.</p><p>The curator of this delve into art's sensual history <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/27/joy-art-japan-sex-passion\" title=\"\">at the British Museum</a> insists that pleasure is mutual in shunga. Early modern Japan was no feminist paradise, and the show does stress the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/women_of_the_pleasure_quarters.aspx\" title=\"\">harsh realities of the sex industry</a>. But in shunga prints, which were looked at by men and women and treasured by married couples, everyone is having a good time. Lovers bask side by side in kimonos and you have to look a moment to see what they're up to under the brightly coloured folds. Or they twist into spectacular conjunctions that create wondrous patterns of white limbs and backs.</p><p>This art is sexy. It's intended to promote what it portrays. But it has very little in common with modern \"pornography\": it would be <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/images/respro_japan_624.jpg\" title=\"\">absurd to see these pictures as objectifying anyone</a>. Men and women alike are shown with a sensual imagination that is <a href=\"http://japan400.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Utamakura.web_.jpg\" title=\"\">disarmingly loving</a>.

Nishikawa Sukenobu, Sexual dalliance between man and geisha, c. 1711-16. Photograph: Copyright of The Trustees of the British Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Shunga was the underground art of samurai Japan. While official culture praised Chinese Confucian values of strict morality, authority and hierarchy, shunga prints laugh at all that and turn the official worldview upside down. A travesty of an advice book for women mocks conventional tips to obey your in-laws and advocates sex as the way to a happy marriage. But beyond jokes and titillation, there is in fact <a href=\"http://www.phaidon.com/resource/420-1-keisai-eisen.jpg\" title=\"\">an ideal that blazes through these images</a>: peace and concord are born out of sexual bliss.</p><p>No wonder this art appealed to westerners like <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec_017.jpg\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a> and <a href=\"http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/aubrey-beardsley/the-climax-1893.jpg\" title=\"\">Aubrey Beardsley</a>, one or two of whose shunga-influenced images are here. Its lush lines and fiery colours are truly the door to alternative wisdom.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418740777|2013-10-01T17:10:04Z|3707a0854fad3e2ca8bcdfc480f6edbd6108722e -->",
