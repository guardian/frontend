        "headline":"Help to Buy: demand may outstrip supply as lenders brace for stampede",
        "body":"<p>More than 600,000 homes on the market are eligible for inclusion in the £12bn second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, according to the latest in a series of surveys leading to predictions that lenders will be flooded by pent-up demand for the government-backed mortgages.</p><p>Details of the 95% mortgages, which are available to existing homeowners as well as first-time buyers, are to be unveiled by the chancellor , with some banks expected to invite loan applications within hours of the Tuesday announcement. The second phase of the flagship scheme to give more first-time buyers and others wider access to the housing market was brought forward by three months, with a report from high street bank Santander claiming that up to 1.7 million people are planning to use the scheme.</p><p>\"It is going to accelerate more people going into the market, so the number of mortgage applications will increase and that will put more pressure on lenders and their [loan] processing,\" said David Hollingsworth of broker London &amp; Country Mortgages. \"But in terms of gross [mortgage] lending we are about less than half where we were in 2007.\"</p><p>Another mortgage broker predicted a surge in demand, stoked by media coverage of the scheme, that could be blunted by stringent eligibility checks from lenders. \"A lot of people want to get on the property ladder and the lenders who come out with these products will be inundated with inquiries,\" said Andrew Montlake of Coreco. \"But lenders are not going to suddenly forget about being prudent, so people are going to have to qualify for the loans.\"</p><p>Under this part of the Help to Buy scheme, buyers will need a minimum deposit of 5%, equivalent to about £10,000 for eligible homes in most regions of England and Wales. The government guarantees the next 15% of the property's value. The scheme is designed to encourage banks and building societies to offer more, and cheaper, mortgages, to people who can only manage relatively small deposits to secure a property.</p><p>Unlike some previous government home-buying initiatives, this one covers existing homes as well as new-build properties. Ministers have claimed it could assist more than 500,000 buyers over three years.</p><p>The level of interest rates that will be offered has yet to emerge, but banks have indicated that would-be buyers should not expect cheaper mortgages.</p><p>The Treasury is also likely to charge more to effectively insure loans to borrowers with the smallest deposits. Assuming the banks pass on the charges it means first-time buyers are still likely to face higher mortgage fees and interest rates than those borrowing to move house. Lenders are expected to charge rates of around 5% for the Help to Buy mortgages. Despite those reservations, mortgage commentators have expressed fears of a stampede for new applications. Research published on Friday found that two-thirds of adults under the age of 30 planned to buy their first home or move house during the three-year lifetime of Help to Buy.</p><p>The data, from the broker called the Mortgage Advice Bureau, also found that 20% of young adults said they were more likely to buy due to the scheme.</p><p>The property website Zoopla.co.uk has estimated that there are about 665,000 properties now on sale that are eligible for the second phase of Help to Buy. The scheme applies to any home up to a value of £600,000. Zoopla said that the average minimum deposit required to buy an eligible property was less than £10,000 in six of 10 regions in England and Wales: north-west and north-east England, the east and west Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and Wales. With the average asking price standing at £222,168, the required 5% deposit would be £11,108. But in London, where prices have been rising the fastest in the country in recent months, the figure would be £16,100.</p><p>Under the second part of Help to Buy, the government is making available £12bn of guarantees to lenders, though just three banking brands have indicated they will be offering the new deals from the outset: these are Royal Bank of Scotland, its NatWest arm, and Halifax.</p><p>RBS and NatWest said that from the launch date of the scheme customers would be able to visit any of their 2,000 branches or phone for advice. They added that opening hours would be extended at more than 740 branches across England, Scotland and Wales \"to help with customer demand\".</p><p>Estate agents and mortgage brokers have reported an increase in inquiries from buyers. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the London-based estate agent Marsh &amp; Parsons, said the new phase of Help to Buy would be \"like a shot of adrenalin\". He said of the London market: \"The capital needs this stimulus to free up mid-ladder buyers who want to become first-time sellers. This will create a much healthier balance between supply and demand.\"</p><p>Many experts have argued that the government should ditch the second phase of Help to Buy, because they fear it will artificially inflate house prices too much by ramping up demand at a faster rate than the supply of homes coming on the UK market. Mortgage availability has become more widespread following the launch of the government's funding for lending scheme in August last year, giving lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers. The first phase of Help to Buy provides equity loans but only applies to purchasers of new-build properties. The government has brought forward the second phase of Help to Buy despite opposition from within the coalition, including from backbench Conservatives.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198803|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|68f5cf5b86994d484ac8e3969bc85d98e5d122cd -->",

I am 29, and after a completing a degree in French and Italian I fell into charity fundraising, which I've been doing for more than six years now.

        "body":"<p><strong>We note your general advice about the potential cost of extended warranties over the cost of individual repairs. However, in the central London congestion zone, where we live, independent traders are reluctant to accept a commission/call-out unless parking is guaranteed (often impossible), and some say that they do not operate in the congestion zone.</strong></p><p><strong>For most appliances, the issue is getting them working again. We always buy an extended warranty from an insurance company. We find that the premiums, divided by the years of operation, provide an annual cost that is little more than one central London call out – which may include only the first half-hour of work. </strong><em>BS, London</em></p><p>You make a fair point, and as ever each person must decide for themselves whether to buy extended warranties/aftermarket insurance after assessing cost versus likely payback. Clearly, boiler insurance is good value if you have a troublesome unit that requires regular visits, and you live in an area such as yours.</p><p>However, buying a £35 three-year plan for a £60 microwave oven that comes with a one-year guarantee does not, to us, make any sense – irrespective of where you live. Buy the microwave from John Lewis and you now automatically receive a two-year guarantee. Or just buy a replacement as required. In our experience, most electrical products fail quite quickly – within the warranty period – or last for several years. Remember, the Sale of Goods Act covers goods for up to six years in England and Wales, although many retail staff have never heard of this legislation, and we accept that enforcing your rights can be tricky.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

For the past two months the car has been at Direct Line's nominated garage waiting for the locks to be replaced.</strong></p><p><strong>It has been hugely inconvenient to be without a car for so long, and nothing seems to be happening to get me back on the road.</strong></p><p><strong>While Direct Line's staff have been pleasant, I have felt that the person managing all this was me, not the insurer. I have had to make numerous 0845 calls to progress matters. Direct Line is blaming a lack of parts from VW. Can this really be the case? </strong><em>TR, Hampton, Middlesex</em></p><p>Direct Line is normally pretty good after a claim, but it could have managed this better. It says it did not get clearance from the police, who wanted to fingerprint the car, until the middle of August, but why it took a month for this to happen is unclear.</p><p>Direct Line says that as soon as it gained access it sent a repairer and that a set of new locks were ordered the following day. The locks have not turned up because of delays at VW, it says.</p><p>One problem you've encountered is that courtesy or replacement cars are not generally offered in the event of a theft. Getting parts for modern cars also seems to be an increasing problem, according to our postbag. We have suggested that between Direct Line and VW it should be possible to find a car to lend you, and VW has now offered you a courtesy car and is tracking the part delivery in an attempt to minimise further delays.</p><p>Direct Line told us: \"While we sympathise with TR, the delays have been out of our control and we are in contact with VW to resolve this matter. However, as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience caused by these delays, we will be sending [TR] a cheque for £75.\" While £75 is better than nothing, all TR wants is his car back.

The same thing had happened to me in August. The only difference was that I applied online rather than over the telephone. I was astonished to receive a message saying I'd been turned down, quoting </strong><a href=\"http://www.experian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Experian</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p><strong>I was quite worried by this as I'd never been refused credit before and knew what a big deal it could be to your credit score. Like HC, when I checked with it, Experian showed my rating to be the highest it could be – with all positive factors and no negative factors.</strong> <em>JF, Ashford, Surrey</em></p><p>It's interesting that your experience mirrors that of last week's reader. Since the card was introduced, we've had a few other letters like these. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2013/mar/30/money-saving-tips-sting\" title=\"\">Money editor Patrick Collinson was also refused a Halifax Clarity card</a> and like you was concerned that there was a problem with his credit score. Halifax later told him it automatically blocks online applicants who have a basic <a href=\"http://www.halifax.co.uk/bankaccounts/basic-bank-account/\" title=\"\">Halifax Easycash</a> account (which he had used to obtain an Electron card to buy cheap Ryanair flights). It turns out that you had one too, possibly explaining why you were declined. Halifax should be making this clear – if that is still its policy – rather than worrying its customers in this unnecessary way.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

His service is particularly important as he has a Lifeline emergency system that he can use in the event of a fall. However, it works via the phone line. </strong></p><p><strong>Another relative has plugged in his own handset to test the line, but it is dead. When we try to call the Post Office, we are left hanging on to the 0845 number. I have emailed, as have others, but we have had no response. I have tried alternative numbers on </strong><a href=\"http://www.saynoto0870.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>saynoto0870.com</strong></a><strong> with the same result. I reported the matter to </strong><a href=\"http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ofcom</strong></a><strong>, which gave me a case number, but my relative still has no phone. </strong></p><p><strong>I understand that the Post Office is having \"technical issues\" in upgrading its system. But surely it has an obligation to answer the telephone and to ensure the safety of vulnerable people. I should appreciate your help in bringing this to the attention of somebody senior in the Post Office, and stressing the urgency of this case. </strong><em>JB, Dunster, Somerset</em></p><p>We, too, tried to phone Post Office HomePhone's customer service line and couldn't get through. The Post Office press office proved more responsive. It sent an engineer round to your relative's street and quickly had him reconnected. You have since been told that the unscheduled disconnection was the result of a BT Openreach engineer carrying out maintenance.</p><p>These things happen, but it should be possible to call your phone provider to report problems. This week, the Post Office website was still reporting: \"As a result of changes to our broadband and phone service we are experiencing technical issues which are resulting in calls to our customer care line taking longer than normal to answer. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience and are working hard to rectify this.\"</p><p>We understand that TalkTalk recently took over the provision of the PO's HomePhone service.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

I had not, but I called Zurich immediately. It sent a mechanic to inspect both cars and it was deemed I had no case to answer. </strong></p><p><strong>Then, in July, I was contacted by Zurich and told that I had reversed into a car in my street on 22 June 2012. Again this was untrue, but this time no inspections were made and in October I received a letter saying that \"the case has been closed\". </strong></p><p><strong>Naturally I thought that was the end of it. But when I renewed my policy in June 2013 the premium had doubled and I was told it was because of the \"accident\". </strong></p><p><strong>Zurich seems to have paid out the claim without consulting me. It has failed to produce any evidence to support the claim and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing yet, tellingly, it has reinstated my lost no-claims bonus.</strong> <em>LC, London</em></p><p>This is a case of staggering incompetence on the part of Zurich. Your no-claims bonus was reinstated as a \"gesture of goodwill\", it says, because it realised it could have done more to investigate the second alleged accident.</p><p>Yet this realisation did not prompt it to probe deeper. Only when you contacted Your Problems did Zurich commence \"further investigation\" and, lo,  it discovered that if it had done its job properly last year it may well not have paid out for this spurious claim.</p><p>It has now removed the record of this incident from the Claims and Underwriting Exchange database – used by all insurers when checking claims history – so that your future premiums are not affected. Your renewal premium has been recalculated to reflect this and you are being sent a refund of the difference plus £200 apology.</p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "headline":"Gazumping returns to housing market in battle of the bidders",
        "body":"<p>Gazumping and other nasties that flourished in the last property boom are making a return, as competition for homes increases with the bringing forward of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/30/help-to-buy-lowdown-government-mortgage-scheme\" title=\"\">second phase of Help to Buy</a>.</p><p>The scheme, which allows buyers to purchase a property under £600,000 with a 5% deposit, was brought forward to last week – three months ahead of schedule. Traffic to <a href=\"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Zoopla</a>, the property search website, immediately jumped 17% compared to a week earlier.</p><p>Yet supply is not matching this surge in demand, with 14% fewer homes for sale than this time last year, according to the property analysts <a href=\"http://www.home.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Home.co.uk</a>, and 19% fewer in London.</p><p>There are fears that buyers could be caught in a bidding frenzy fuelled by bullish sellers and eager estate agents keen to talk up the market. Around 10% of the adult population – 5.1 million people – say they are likely to buy in the next 12 months, up from 8% (or 3.7&nbsp;million) in January 2012, according to Santander Mortgages.</p><p>So how can homebuyers navigate the risks of this buoyant market?</p><h2><strong>Gone in a flash</strong></h2><p>Buyers in stronger markets will have to work harder to find the right properties, especially in hotspots such as London. However, Lisa Green, director of the County Homesearch Company in the north-west, emphasises: \"Buyers outside the south-east and other hotspots should be wary of estate agents talking up the market.\" She says the market is still quite weak in many areas, such as Oldham, Huddersfield, Hartlepool, and Powys in Wales. \"Buyers in these markets are still in a strong position to negotiate on the asking price,\" she says.</p><p>First-time buyer Helena Gibbon, 29, is struggling to find a property in London's overheated market. She has been searching for a one-bed flat in Walthamstow, east London, all year, with her sizeable budget of £200,000. Gibbon, who works in advertising, has saved for years for a 10% deposit, and currently lives with her parents while she scours the market. \"It's tough out there for buyers. I have friends who have viewed 30 or 40 properties but they go so quickly,\" she says.</p><p>If you are searching in a popular location, make sure you have all your paperwork ready if you decide to make an offer, says Camilla Dell at Black Brick buying agency.</p><p>Most serious buyers will be signed up to Zoopla or Rightmove alerts, but sometimes the best properties do not need to be advertised because they are snapped up so quickly. Buyers at the top end of the market – with a budget of £500,000 or more – sometimes employ a buying agent with good contacts to search the market. But what about the rest of us? Tracy Kellett, a buying agent at BDI Home Finders, says that buyers should \"make friends with estate agents\" and emphasise their strong and serious position as a buyer. \"Ask for the first heads-up when a property becomes available,\" she says.</p><h2><strong>Gazumping</strong></h2><p>It's every buyer's nightmare – your offer on a property is accepted and you spend hundreds, or even thousands, on a survey, mortgage and legal fees, only to have another buyer make a higher offer and snatch the place from under your nose.</p><p>While still relatively rare, agents say gazumping is making an unwelcome return in pockets across the country.Vicki Wusche at The Property Sourcers says: \"We recently had an offer accepted for a client on a three-bedroom house in Norwich at the asking price of £122,000. We immediately sent over our paperwork and instructed a solicitor and went to bed thinking it was a done deal. But in the morning a cash investor had made a higher offer that had been accepted.\"</p><p>Have a mortgage agreement in principle and your surveyor and solicitor ready before you make an offer, and request the estate agent in writing to take the property off the market as soon as your offer is accepted.</p><p>Kate Faulkner at advice site <a href=\"http://www.propertychecklists.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Propertychecklists.co.uk</a> says: \"Above all, remember that a seller or agent who gazumps you is not worth doing business with anyway. Have faith that a better property will come along soon.\"</p><h2><strong>Sealed bids</strong></h2><p>Bidding wars – where you compete with other buyers for the same property – can be stressful, but it is vital not to get carried away and pay over the odds.</p><p>Buyer Georgina Janion recently bought a flat in Putney, south-west London. The ground floor Victorian conversion had 83 viewings and 13 offers in just one week. The sale went to \"sealed bids\", where Janion and the other potential buyers had to email their final offer before midday on the same day.</p><p>She says: \"I had been looking for a property for months and viewed about 30 flats, so I knew the local market well. Going to sealed bids is tough and it's impossible to second-guess what other buyers might be willing to pay. I just had to stay calm and offer a fair price that I could afford.\"</p><p>First-time buyers, most of whom will have saved years for a deposit, need to be especially wary of blowing their budget in a bidding war. Check sites such as <a href=\"http://www.nethouseprices.com/\" title=\"\">nethouseprices.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mouseprice.com/\" title=\"\">mouseprice.com</a> for recent sale prices. It's important to retain a pot of savings to buy new furniture or cover unexpected maintenance costs.</p><p>Wusche adds: \"Also remember interest rates will go up and you should use an online mortgage calculator to see how your monthly payments would be affected. Could you afford to pay 8% on your mortgage? It's vital not to overstretch yourself.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419063037|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|67e449034e0f66440a0067329ae38b8d34e29933 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>BT has informed me that from November all business customers will be automatically switched to paperless billing for our \"added convenience\", unless we pay £6 a month to keep the status quo. </strong></p><p><strong>Small businesses have to keep records by law and will now be obliged to spend time and effort navigating the BT website, remembering passwords and downloading a copy of something that BT is obliged by law, under VAT regulations, to provide. </strong></p><p><strong>I believe it is illegal to charge for issuing a VAT receipt. Those, like me, who receive a monthly bill are now to face a price increase of £72 a year, in my case a 10% hike. Obviously BT could have elected to email monthly bills to its business customers, which doesn't cost it a penny. </strong></p><p><strong>I haven't seen one word in the media about this latest example of a rip-off charge being levied to add to someone's bottom line. <em> </em></strong><em>JC, Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p><p>\"BT Business isn't forcing customers to go paper-free,\" says a hurt spokeswoman with impenetrable logic, \"because customers can choose to continue with paper bills at a cost of £2 for each summary bill with a VAT statement.</p><p>\"The £6 fee only applies to itemised bills.\"</p><p>Moreover, she denies that it is charging for VAT statements because although, yes, there are those non-coercive fees, customers are being given the privilege of switching to free online billing.</p><p>As for your email solution: \"We email customers to say their bill is ready and include a link so they don't need to find it themselves,\" says the spokeswoman. \"We can't just email the bill for security reasons.\"</p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses echoes your concerns: \"BT's drive to give business customers their bills online could hinder those firms in areas that suffer from poor broadband provision,\" says a spokesperson. \"For those firms that struggle to get online, the charge for a paper bill, £2 or up to £6, could act as a penalty for something out of their control.\"</p><p>According to the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, companies can charge whatever they like because such fees are a \"commercial decision\" and customers who object can always jump ship. It has, however, contacted BT to ask for an explanation of the new charges and how they were communicated to customers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "body":"<p>Estate agents are not your friends. They work for the seller and are paid by the seller to get the best deal for the seller.</p><p>You wouldn't play poker with all your cards face up on the table, so don't be tempted to explain why you're moving, how much you have to spend (say \"we hope that we won't have to spend more than X\"), or that you need to be in by January. These will all be used against you when you fall in love with the right home. The agent will know how far he can push you, how little time you have to find something, or that you have already lost out on five other houses and you've threatened divorce if you don't get this one. Don't be panicked into buying and most of all, don't be afraid to make an&nbsp;offer.</p><p>Here are my tips for buyers:</p><p>■ <strong>Agents get paid when deals are done.</strong> They are therefore keen to find a buyer who is serious. To make sure you are the first to be called when a new property becomes available, make sure the agent knows you are ready to go. Cash in the bank is better than someone who needs a mortgage. Someone in rented accommodation can move faster than someone with a property to sell.</p><p>■ <strong>Ignore tempting discounts or incentives to buy a new-build property.</strong> If someone is paying your stamp duty or moving costs then it's in the price and you will pay for it over the next 25 years of your mortgage.</p><p>■ <strong>Confirm every conversation you have with an agent.</strong> Viewing appointments, offers made, bids rejected together with the terms of any offer. Agents like people who know what they're doing and you will look like you have bought and sold before.</p><p>■ <strong>Ignore invitations to rush to see a property or to be panicked into bidding.</strong> Fewer than 10% of homes for sale in any one month sell. Proceed in your own time – there are 24m other homes in the UK.</p><p>■ <strong>Don't get your finance from the selling agent's financial services company.</strong> Get a quote, but then discuss it with your own mortgage adviser.</p><p>■<strong> Don't assume that the guide price is anything more than an indication of the owner's greed or the agent's enthusiasm to get the job. </strong>Be confident and make an offer. A house is worth what you and the seller agree, not what the agent thinks it's worth.</p><p>■ <strong>Double-check everything you are told.</strong> Is it quiet on a Friday or Saturday night? Are there neighbours from hell? Is the road a rat-run and does the roof leak?</p><p>■ <strong>Don't be fooled into thinking that a bank valuation is for your benefit. </strong>It's for the lender and you have no comeback on the surveyor.</p><p>■ <strong>Don't expect an agent to send you new properties when they are available.</strong> Keep in touch, go and see possible properties and look serious. You'll be amazed how much you will learn from frequent contact.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419068224|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|27e2c9835e7ac3627a95ba8be2f612b778bdc531 -->",

        "body":"<p>More than 600,000 homes on the market are eligible for inclusion in the £12bn second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, according to the latest in a series of surveys leading to predictions that lenders will be flooded by pent-up demand for the government-backed mortgages.</p><p>Details of the 95% mortgages, which are available to existing homeowners as well as first-time buyers, are to be unveiled by the chancellor , with some banks expected to invite loan applications within hours of the Tuesday announcement. The second phase of the flagship scheme to give more first-time buyers and others wider access to the housing market was brought forward by three months, with a report from high street bank Santander claiming that up to 1.7 million people are planning to use the scheme.</p><p>\"It is going to accelerate more people going into the market, so the number of mortgage applications will increase and that will put more pressure on lenders and their [loan] processing,\" said David Hollingsworth of broker London &amp; Country Mortgages. \"But in terms of gross [mortgage] lending we are about less than half where we were in 2007.\"</p><p>Another mortgage broker predicted a surge in demand, stoked by media coverage of the scheme, that could be blunted by stringent eligibility checks from lenders. \"A lot of people want to get on the property ladder and the lenders who come out with these products will be inundated with inquiries,\" said Andrew Montlake of Coreco. \"But lenders are not going to suddenly forget about being prudent, so people are going to have to qualify for the loans.\"</p><p>Under this part of the Help to Buy scheme, buyers will need a minimum deposit of 5%, equivalent to about £10,000 for eligible homes in most regions of England and Wales. The government guarantees the next 15% of the property's value. The scheme is designed to encourage banks and building societies to offer more, and cheaper, mortgages, to people who can only manage relatively small deposits to secure a property.</p><p>Unlike some previous government home-buying initiatives, this one covers existing homes as well as new-build properties. Ministers have claimed it could assist more than 500,000 buyers over three years.</p><p>The level of interest rates that will be offered has yet to emerge, but banks have indicated that would-be buyers should not expect cheaper mortgages.</p><p>The Treasury is also likely to charge more to effectively insure loans to borrowers with the smallest deposits. Assuming the banks pass on the charges it means first-time buyers are still likely to face higher mortgage fees and interest rates than those borrowing to move house. Lenders are expected to charge rates of around 5% for the Help to Buy mortgages. Despite those reservations, mortgage commentators have expressed fears of a stampede for new applications. Research published on Friday found that two-thirds of adults under the age of 30 planned to buy their first home or move house during the three-year lifetime of Help to Buy.</p><p>The data, from the broker called the Mortgage Advice Bureau, also found that 20% of young adults said they were more likely to buy due to the scheme.</p><p>The property website Zoopla.co.uk has estimated that there are about 665,000 properties now on sale that are eligible for the second phase of Help to Buy. The scheme applies to any home up to a value of £600,000. Zoopla said that the average minimum deposit required to buy an eligible property was less than £10,000 in six of 10 regions in England and Wales: north-west and north-east England, the east and west Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and Wales. With the average asking price standing at £222,168, the required 5% deposit would be £11,108. But in London, where prices have been rising the fastest in the country in recent months, the figure would be £16,100.</p><p>Under the second part of Help to Buy, the government is making available £12bn of guarantees to lenders, though just three banking brands have indicated they will be offering the new deals from the outset: these are Royal Bank of Scotland, its NatWest arm, and Halifax.</p><p>RBS and NatWest said that from the launch date of the scheme customers would be able to visit any of their 2,000 branches or phone for advice. They added that opening hours would be extended at more than 740 branches across England, Scotland and Wales \"to help with customer demand\".</p><p>Estate agents and mortgage brokers have reported an increase in inquiries from buyers. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the London-based estate agent Marsh &amp; Parsons, said the new phase of Help to Buy would be \"like a shot of adrenalin\". He said of the London market: \"The capital needs this stimulus to free up mid-ladder buyers who want to become first-time sellers. This will create a much healthier balance between supply and demand.\"</p><p>Many experts have argued that the government should ditch the second phase of Help to Buy, because they fear it will artificially inflate house prices too much by ramping up demand at a faster rate than the supply of homes coming on the UK market. Mortgage availability has become more widespread following the launch of the government's funding for lending scheme in August last year, giving lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers. The first phase of Help to Buy provides equity loans but only applies to purchasers of new-build properties. The government has brought forward the second phase of Help to Buy despite opposition from within the coalition, including from backbench Conservatives.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198803|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|68f5cf5b86994d484ac8e3969bc85d98e5d122cd -->",

However, Lisa Green, director of the County Homesearch Company in the north-west, emphasises: \"Buyers outside the south-east and other hotspots should be wary of estate agents talking up the market.\" She says the market is still quite weak in many areas, such as Oldham, Huddersfield, Hartlepool, and Powys in Wales. \"Buyers in these markets are still in a strong position to negotiate on the asking price,\" she says.</p><p>First-time buyer Helena Gibbon, 29, is struggling to find a property in London's overheated market. She has been searching for a one-bed flat in Walthamstow, east London, all year, with her sizeable budget of £200,000. Gibbon, who works in advertising, has saved for years for a 10% deposit, and currently lives with her parents while she scours the market. \"It's tough out there for buyers. I have friends who have viewed 30 or 40 properties but they go so quickly,\" she says.</p><p>If you are searching in a popular location, make sure you have all your paperwork ready if you decide to make an offer, says Camilla Dell at Black Brick buying agency.</p><p>Most serious buyers will be signed up to Zoopla or Rightmove alerts, but sometimes the best properties do not need to be advertised because they are snapped up so quickly. Buyers at the top end of the market – with a budget of £500,000 or more – sometimes employ a buying agent with good contacts to search the market. But what about the rest of us? Tracy Kellett, a buying agent at BDI Home Finders, says that buyers should \"make friends with estate agents\" and emphasise their strong and serious position as a buyer. \"Ask for the first heads-up when a property becomes available,\" she says.</p><h2><strong>Gazumping</strong></h2><p>It's every buyer's nightmare – your offer on a property is accepted and you spend hundreds, or even thousands, on a survey, mortgage and legal fees, only to have another buyer make a higher offer and snatch the place from under your nose.</p><p>While still relatively rare, agents say gazumping is making an unwelcome return in pockets across the country.Vicki Wusche at The Property Sourcers says: \"We recently had an offer accepted for a client on a three-bedroom house in Norwich at the asking price of £122,000. We immediately sent over our paperwork and instructed a solicitor and went to bed thinking it was a done deal. But in the morning a cash investor had made a higher offer that had been accepted.\"</p><p>Have a mortgage agreement in principle and your surveyor and solicitor ready before you make an offer, and request the estate agent in writing to take the property off the market as soon as your offer is accepted.</p><p>Kate Faulkner at advice site <a href=\"http://www.propertychecklists.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Propertychecklists.co.uk</a> says: \"Above all, remember that a seller or agent who gazumps you is not worth doing business with anyway. Have faith that a better property will come along soon.\"</p><h2><strong>Sealed bids</strong></h2><p>Bidding wars – where you compete with other buyers for the same property – can be stressful, but it is vital not to get carried away and pay over the odds.</p><p>Buyer Georgina Janion recently bought a flat in Putney, south-west London. The ground floor Victorian conversion had 83 viewings and 13 offers in just one week. The sale went to \"sealed bids\", where Janion and the other potential buyers had to email their final offer before midday on the same day.</p><p>She says: \"I had been looking for a property for months and viewed about 30 flats, so I knew the local market well. Going to sealed bids is tough and it's impossible to second-guess what other buyers might be willing to pay. I just had to stay calm and offer a fair price that I could afford.\"</p><p>First-time buyers, most of whom will have saved years for a deposit, need to be especially wary of blowing their budget in a bidding war. Check sites such as <a href=\"http://www.nethouseprices.com/\" title=\"\">nethouseprices.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mouseprice.com/\" title=\"\">mouseprice.com</a> for recent sale prices. It's important to retain a pot of savings to buy new furniture or cover unexpected maintenance costs.</p><p>Wusche adds: \"Also remember interest rates will go up and you should use an online mortgage calculator to see how your monthly payments would be affected. Could you afford to pay 8% on your mortgage? It's vital not to overstretch yourself.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419063037|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|67e449034e0f66440a0067329ae38b8d34e29933 -->",

        "headline":"As even the higher paid fall into debt trap, charities target money lenders",
        "body":"<p>A major alliance of consumer and anti-poverty charities – including Which?, the Centre for Responsible Credit, StepChange, the debt advice charity, and Church Action on Poverty (CAP), backed by a cross-party group of MPs led by Labour's Paul Blomfield – will launch a charter next week calling on the government to tackle the \"bad products and bad practices\" of the high-cost credit market and avert the growing crisis of \"broke Britain\".</p><p>The industry, which is now worth more than £7.5bn a year, includes payday loan businesses, such as Wonga, issuing almost 10,600 short-term loans a day; doorstep lenders – Provident Financial, for instance, has more than 2.7 million customers; and rent-to-own businesses including BrightHouse and PerfectHome that offer long-term hire purchase for basic goods at high interest rates. Profits have soared as millions have been hit by the cumulative impact of a cut in benefits, wages falling by an average of £1,500 since 2010 and a 25% rise in the cost of living, pushing the poor closer to penury and the previously reasonably well paid into ever deeper debt.</p><p>\"Many people are really feeling the pinch. Irresponsible lending risks pushing them over the edge and causes serious and long-term damage to their finances, families and health,\" the charter says. \"The high-cost lending industry has proved incapable of self-regulation; it is now time for government and regulators to step in and offer consumers real protection [and] a major expansion of affordable alternative sources of credit.\"</p><p>On Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), that in April 2014 takes over the regulation of the 50,000 firms with consumer credit licences, unveiled a two-month consultation on a series of rules to regulate the sector. They include limiting payday loan rollovers that can lead to interest rates in excess of 5,000%; affordability checks on borrowers; and restricting to twice the use of continuous payment authorities (CPAs). Known as \"siphoning\", these allow a lender to take money from a borrower's account, charging for as many as 90 \"dips\", whether successful or not, at £5 a time, leaving an individual with nothing on which to live. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, promises, \"Tougher regulation is coming… the clock is ticking.\" Errol Damelin, chief executive of Wonga, says: \"We want better regulation… we want to keep the bad guys out.\"</p><p>Supporters of the charter say the FCA's proposals don't go far enough fast enough, nor are they tough enough. \"We are pleased that the FCA is planning action to clean up credit,\" says Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director. \"However, the regulator needs to go further. We want it to clamp down on irresponsible lending across the credit market, including capping sky-high penalty charges, freezing charges for people in financial difficulty and ending unsolicited credit increases.\"</p><p>The charter,  which is set to be launched on 15 October at the House of Commons, includes a prohibition on loans to people who realistically are unable to pay them back; allowance for only one rollover; an end to \"hidden\" charges; clear information; independent debt advice; greater encouragement to banks to help 7.8 million people who have no access to mainstream credit, and better support for credit unions that provide low-cost loans. \"This is a once in a generation opportunity, \" says Blomfield, whose high-cost credit private members' bill failed this year. \"It mustn't be lost.\"</p><p>High-cost credit hits two groups particularly badly. The first is the unemployed and those on a low income. A new report, Drowning in Debt, published next week by CAP, the Centre for Responsible Credit (CRC) and Thrive Teesside, a community organisation, all of whom have also worked with Durham University on a two-year project following 24 families in debt, shows the absurdities of the high-cost credit market. Of 7.8m loans given last year, 2.6m were written off. The higher the risk, the greater the cost levied and the bigger the bounce in profits. Defaults produce half the industry's profits.</p><p>A report published by Durham University later this month shows how the seduction of customers is relentless. One woman had 25 loans with seven different doorstep lending companies. \"You never got asked if you could afford it. It was just here, here and here.\"</p><p>\"Doorstep lending is not usually sought by the households, rather it finds its way to them,\" says Professor Sarah Banks, who is in charge of the project. \"What matters for people in financial crisis who are borrowing to live is the speed at which the money arrives, not the rate of interest.\"</p><p>\"High-debt families are particularly targeted,\" agrees Niall Cooper of CAP. He points out that the poor pay \"a poverty premium\" for food, fuel and finance – an extraordinary £4bn extra a year. \"People are on the breadline because of market failure across the board.\" Cooper adds that lenders should have an obligation to ensure families are left with sufficient money to live on. He and Damon Gibbons, of the CRC, argue that real time data sharing, giving details of a person's income and outgoings (which is not proposed by the FCA) is essential, otherwise judging \"affordability\" will be a sham.</p><p>Graham Clarke runs an RTO called Buy as You View. After negotiations with CAP and Thrive, and the introduction of improved technology, \"good\" customers – he reckons 75% of the total of 80,000 – are given lower interest rates and the majority pay by direct debit. The \"good\" customer no longer pays heavily for the bad debts of the minority. Last year Buy as You View made £4m in profit, considerably less than its rivals. Clarke says: \"I'm no white knight, but I want to do it the right way. I have investors who want to do well, but that means by fair profitability, not extortion.</p><p>\"Once we borrowed for the high life, now many borrow to get by. Yet far too many in the industry are in it for the fast buck with a 'one size fits all' approach to the credit impaired that hasn't changed for years.\"</p><p>In addition to fairer terms, Gibbons and Cooper want people to be helped from a £500m fund possibly levied from the industry, if proper checks reveal they are not creditworthy. Debt, they point out, comes at a price for all taxpayers. It significantly increases the chances of relationship breakdown and mental ill health. Stella Creasy, Labour MP, has also called for a cap on total costs. \"The FCA says capping won't work. That's hokum. It works in Canada, Japan and parts of the US. A ripoff is a ripoff.\"</p><p>For the first time, the price of high- cost credit is also having an impact on higher earners, too. \"Many of us are only a salary cheque away from falling into debt,\" says Peter Tutton, of StepChange. \"Things happen, \" he stressed.</p><p>Kenny, 46, earns £40,000 a year working in information technology. Two years ago rising living costs meant that his income stopped matching his outgoings. Three credit cards are maxed out, the bank was unhelpful and he cancelled direct debits to juggle money, followed by three payday loans. Debt management companies took hundreds. Then he went to StepChange. Now he is repaying £18,000, month by month. He is constantly bombarded with new loan offers. He drives 40 miles a day to work; his car is decrepit and he is worried that he might succumb again. \"I never imagined this would happen to me.\"</p><p>Graham, 46, is a manager on £63,000 a year and a mortgage of £1,100 a month After four failed IVF attempts, his wife, a pharmacist, unexpectedly became pregnant, reducing her work to two days a week. \"We were living within our means, then our means went sharply down.\" Graham acquired a loan, credit cards and payday loans from five companies, paying 1,000% interest on one. \"Nine o'clock at night with the laptop, a click, and the money is in the bank in two hours and not a single check. It's so tempting.\" Debts of £14,000 are now being paid off at a hefty £762 a month. \"Potentially, I was going to lose my home, my wife and my baby. I wasn't the kind of person to which this happens.\"</p><p>\"The high-cost credit market is out of control and does not deal with its customers fairly,\" says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \"We need consumers to have real choice and we need remedial steps now, not in 2014, to make good the damage that has already been done.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419141903|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|658d9f647d6466850bc0834a8f8ba081eb68eeda -->",

For the past two months the car has been at Direct Line's nominated garage waiting for the locks to be replaced.</strong></p><p><strong>It has been hugely inconvenient to be without a car for so long, and nothing seems to be happening to get me back on the road.</strong></p><p><strong>While Direct Line's staff have been pleasant, I have felt that the person managing all this was me, not the insurer. I have had to make numerous 0845 calls to progress matters. Direct Line is blaming a lack of parts from VW. Can this really be the case? </strong><em>TR, Hampton, Middlesex</em></p><p>Direct Line is normally pretty good after a claim, but it could have managed this better. It says it did not get clearance from the police, who wanted to fingerprint the car, until the middle of August, but why it took a month for this to happen is unclear.</p><p>Direct Line says that as soon as it gained access it sent a repairer and that a set of new locks were ordered the following day. The locks have not turned up because of delays at VW, it says.</p><p>One problem you've encountered is that courtesy or replacement cars are not generally offered in the event of a theft. Getting parts for modern cars also seems to be an increasing problem, according to our postbag. We have suggested that between Direct Line and VW it should be possible to find a car to lend you, and VW has now offered you a courtesy car and is tracking the part delivery in an attempt to minimise further delays.</p><p>Direct Line told us: \"While we sympathise with TR, the delays have been out of our control and we are in contact with VW to resolve this matter. However, as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience caused by these delays, we will be sending [TR] a cheque for £75.\" While £75 is better than nothing, all TR wants is his car back.

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/27/tory-tax-break-marriage-glue\" title=\"Tories woo married couples with tax break\">recently announced married couple's tax break</a> will benefit few people and may even make some worse off after a pay rise, according to an <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6869\" title=\"IFS analysis\">analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> (IFS).</p><p>Robert Joyce, a senior research economist at the institute, says: &quot;The policy is not a general recognition of marriage in the income tax system … it is difficult to escape the conclusion that an income tax system which makes some people worse off after a pay rise has something wrong with it.&quot;</p><p>So how exactly will the new allowance work, what is it worth to couples – and how could it actually be detrimental to you?</p><p></p><h2><strong>What has the prime minister proposed?</strong></h2><p>The plan is to make up to &pound;1,000 of a person's income tax personal allowance transferable between adults who are married or in a civil partnership, so long as the higher income adult is a basic rate taxpayer.</p><p>For example, let's say a man earns &pound;30,000 and his wife earns &pound;6,000 a year working part time. She has a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates\" title=\"Personal Allowance explained \">personal allowance</a>, expected to be &pound;10,230 in the year the policy is introduced, but is not using it all. She can transfer &pound;1,000 of this to her husband, lowering his tax bill by up to &pound;200 a year because he'll now not have to pay 20% tax on that &pound;1,000. This saving works out at &pound;3.85 per couple per week.</p><p>But the value of the allowance tapers out once the lower earner starts earning more. For example, if the transfer was allowed to take place today when the personal allowance is &pound;9,440, someone earning &pound;9,000 would only be able to transfer the remaining &pound;440 of their allowance to their spouse before they hit the personal tax allowance threshold. This would give the couple a gain of &pound;88 a year, or just &pound;1.69 a week.</p><p>The scheme will come into force in April 2015, a month before the next general election is expected.</p><p>Couples will be able to apply online and will receive the benefit for the 2015-16 tax year in the summer of&nbsp;2016.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Who will gain?</strong></h2><p>Couples who will qualify for this tax break are those in marriages or civil partnerships, which according to the government should be more than 4 million couples, although the IFS suggests the number may be significantly less – about 3.4 million of the UK's 12.4 million couples who are either married or in a civil partnership. This includes 1.2 million of the 7.8 million families with children.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Who won't gain?</strong></h2><p>Three sorts of couples in a marriage or civil partnership will not be eligible for the tax cut:</p><p>• those whose members both have incomes below the &pound;10,230 personal allowance. They would pay no income tax so cannot benefit from any income tax cut.</p><p>• those where both partners have incomes above the personal allowance.</p><p>• those with a higher rate 40% or additional-rate 45% taxpayer, ie those with taxable incomes exceeding &pound;42,285 a year in 2015-16.</p><p>It is also expected that the shrinking number of couples who still receive the old-style married couples allowance (available only where one spouse or civil partner was born before 6 April 1935), which reduces a couple's tax liability by up to &pound;750 a year as opposed to &pound;200 a year under the proposed tax break, will not be able to claim both.</p><p></p><h2>How could some people be worse off?</h2><p>The IFS says that since the new tax break will not be available to higher rate taxpayers, someone who is benefiting from a transferred personal allowance would have a weaker incentive to increase their taxable income beyond &pound;42,285, the threshold above which income tax at&nbsp;40% kicks in.</p><p>Joyce says: &quot;Some could be worse off after a pay rise or better off after a pay cut, because the transferred allowance will be withdrawn in &quot;cliff edge&quot; fashion – withdrawn in its entirety once income rises above a threshold rather than tapered away gradually. Income tax liability would jump by &pound;200 a year when someone's taxable income crossed &pound;42,285, hence post-tax income would be higher if the taxable income were just below this threshold rather than if it was just above it.&quot;</p><p></p><h2><strong>Isn't this &quot;cliff&quot; similar to the child benefit proposals?</strong></h2><p>Yes, at the 2010 Conservative conference the party announced a similar cliff-edge at the higher rate tax threshold as a way of effectively means-testing child benefit payments, but that was eventually removed and replaced with a less egregious taper at the 2012 budget.</p><p>&quot;The amounts involved here are less than in that case, which perhaps explains the willingness to cliff-edge again rather than implement a taper,&quot; Joyce says. &quot;</p><p></p><h2>Will t<strong>his really encourage more people to marry?</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>With a maximum gain of less than &pound;4 per couple per week, the change is not in itself expected to prompt many people to marry rather than live together.</p><p>&quot;The social message sent by the tax break looks more significant than its financial consequences for families, as the prime minister has stated himself,&quot; the IFS says. &quot;But as a structural change to the tax system it may ultimately turn out to be more important.&quot;</p><p>First, the IFS points out, it would reintroduce an incentive to marry into the income tax system, just as the married couple's allowance is being almost entirely phased out.</p><p>Second, the transferral of allowances between spouses would reintroduce an element of joint income taxation, clashing with the move to individual taxation for couples introduced in 1990.</p><p></p><h2><strong>What will all this cost?</strong></h2><p>The IFS estimates that the proposal will cost the exchequer about &pound;700m a year. The precise cost will depend on how many eligible couples use the tax break.</p><p>It is expected that couples will have to make an active claim to take up the offer, so it is therefore likely that take-up will be less than 100% among those who are eligible.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418832553|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|01199fd74aef4542a7843c25fbb0831153cb8344 -->",

        "headline":"Ryanair's customer service promise is subject to delays",
        "body":"<p>I am not a Ryanair-hater. Anyone who faced the drive or train to Holyhead then the ferry to Dublin because of the stranglehold the national flag carriers had on the route, and the ludicrous fares they charged, should be forever thankful that it and CEO Michael O'Leary (right) broke the mould.</p><p>I don't even hate having to untick endless drop-boxes, saying \"No, I don't need to buy some luggage, and yes, I really, really do have my own annual travel insurance\". It's tedious, but if that's the price of a cheap fare then I can live with it.</p><p>What turns the tedium to anger is when some Ryanair stormtrooper at the airport forces you to stuff every pocket of your jacket and jeans with books, socks and belts because the weighing machines says your suitcase has tilted a little over 15kg; or who takes delight at charging an absurd sum for reissuing a boarding pass or changing a mis-spelled name.</p><p>So it made the headlines when, in September, O'Leary said he had woken up to the frustrations so many of his customers experience, promising an end to its \"abrupt culture\". Speaking to shareholders, he said: \"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off.\" My first chance to test his promise came a fortnight ago at Seville Airport. The result? An epic fail.</p><p>While the easyJet plane took off on time, the delay at Ryanair started to mount. No reason was given to passengers, forced to march from one end of the airport to the other after a gate change, unannounced over the PA, flashed up on screen. After two hours, the first formal announcement was made – passengers could have a free food and drink voucher. Just go to the Ryanair desk and collect it.</p><p>But this was when irritation turned to farce. Yes, there was a free €5 voucher, but only if the 200 or so passengers abandoned departures and re-entered the airport – and subsequently went back through the rigmarole of security – through scanners, taking off shoes and belts and so on. A lot of passengers didn't think this legal. Indeed, on re-entering, some passengers who claimed their voucher found the barcode on their boarding pass no longer worked.</p><p>Why, I asked, did Ryanair put their customers through this? Why not distribute the €5 vouchers at the gate? Ah, I was told, the airport operator, Aena, forbids it. Really? I asked four different Ryanair staff in different locations around the airport, all of who parroted the same \"prohibido\" line, specifically blaming Aena. That it meant Ryanair benefited as fewer people bothered to claim their voucher was neither here nor there.</p><p>Except it was complete nonsense. Aena, in a statement, told me there was no prohibition, and indeed it would have preferred Ryanair to distribute vouchers at the gate.</p><p>Eventually, the flight took off more than three hours late. A blind woman boarding the flight next to me complained bitterly about how she had been left abandoned by the lack of announcements, finding the whole experience distressing.</p><p>Still, I thought, at least there would be compensation under EU regulations, which kick in after three hours. The pilot announced that the delay was due to a technical fault with the air-conditioning. But on arrival I was told that the delay was less than three hours, and in any case was due to circumstances beyond Ryanair's control – when every other flight was taking off on time, and when the fault was arguably due to a failure in maintenance.</p><p>Curiously, an email from Ryanair to enable passengers to claim for compensation from the insurers <em>did</em> confirm the flight was three hours delayed.</p><p>I contacted Ryanair's director of customer, Caroline Green, who told me the voucher situation at Seville was \"inexplicable\". She added: \"Our departure times are determined by the time of push back from the gate and not the time of take-off.\" So in Ryanair's world, you are flying even if you are still on the tarmac.</p><p>Oh, and for those who will say, \"You only paid 50p for the flight, what do you expect?\", the return flights for two of us were £365.76. Those £1 Ryanair deals appear to be a thing of the past, easyJet is focusing on service, while Norwegian.com is snapping at Ryanair on price. It is time O'Leary put his service promises into practice.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983656|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e3b4d1787cab0625d5fa2464f455508d6085cc6f -->",

Stores will often try to sell customers lucrative three and five-year extended warranty plans, which can cost £100 a year.</p><p>John Lewis's Ed Connolly says: \"There is a lack of transparency across electricals guarantees. The vast majority of consumers don't understand guarantees and are frustrated by the complexity that surrounds them. Our mission is to bring the John Lewis level of excellence and trust to electricals guarantees, which is why we're introducing a minimum two-year guarantee on all our products at no extra cost.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418989755|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b6c55623b877f0b666014856e6564d172bc61f81 -->",

Also, it can be useful if my child is having bad dreams at night as we can hear them.\"</p><p>Whether you opt for a monitor or not, you might want to download <a href=\"http://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/safer-sleep\" title=\"Lullabny Trust: guide to safe sleeping\">the Lullaby Trust's guides to safer sleep for babies</a>.</p><h2>The choices</h2><p>Monitors tend to consist of two units: one device in the baby's room and one for wherever the parent is, allowing them to listen to or even see the baby. Broadly there are three main types.</p><p><strong>Audio device</strong> This is the most familiar type of monitor. There is a transmitter in the child's room which broadcasts the sound to a receiver, allowing  you to hear your baby.</p><p><strong>Audio with motion sensor pads</strong> As well as the transmitter you get a sensor mat, which you place under the baby and plug into the unit in his or her room. If the baby does not move for a certain period of time an alarm sounds on the receiver.</p><p><strong>Video monitors</strong> These come with a small camera which you put in the child's room and allow you to watch your baby as well as being able to hear them. Many have night vision so work even with the lights off. Some new monitors offer remote access enabling you to watch your baby on a computer, tablet or smartphone when you are away from home.</p><p>Other useful additional features many monitors include are a room temperature gauge, sound-sensitive light display that illuminates more as the baby moves around, a nightlight, the ability to play lullabies, an \"out of range\" warning signal, a battery indicator and a \"talk-back\" facility, allowing you to speak to your baby.</p><p>You also have a choice of how the monitor transmits:</p><p><strong>Analogue</strong> These are becoming a rare breed. They can pick up other signals, sometimes broadcasting sounds from radios and other monitors. However they are generally the cheapest models.</p><p><strong>Digital</strong> These provide clearer sound than analogue, typically with less interference.</p><p><strong>Digitally enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT)</strong> These are designed to make it less likely that you will hear anyone else's baby or neighbours' conversations.</p><h2>Other considerations</h2><p>Although you can buy mains powered-only monitors, it is more useful to have one that also runs on batteries – mains-only restricts you to one room and won't work if there is a power cut.</p><p>After buying, test out the product for suitability. The thickness of your walls and size of your house can affect the sound and range of the device. And beware, advertised ranges often are the maximum possible given perfect conditions. Test the product for interference from radios, phones and other nearby devices as well.</p><p>Weston says if you are buying a monitor \"make sure it is easy to use, chargeable with good battery life, and not too expensive.\"</p><h2>The monitors</h2><p>Below are the best prices for some popular models, but prices can change rapidly so please put any better deals you spot in the comments section below. It is worth noting that if you are spending more than £100, Mothercare is offering online purchasers a further 15% off until Monday 7 October.</p><p><strong>Audio only </strong>The Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature 1082 has an intercom, room temperature monitor and nightlight, and according to the Which? \"best buy\" list \"works exceptionally well as you move around the house\".

        "body":"<p>Marc Brown loves to shop at <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">BrightHouse</a>. Over the past couple of years, he has bought a&nbsp;television, two sofas and a hi-fi from the store, and today he has come in to buy two tablet computers, one for himself and one for his mother. With BrightHouse there is no need to pay straight away; instead, the price is divided into small weekly chunks, repayable over the next few years.</p><p>Since he began shopping with BrightHouse, his weekly payments have gradually notched up. Once the cost of the new tablets is added, Marc, 38, a former Southwark council employee who lost his job in 2007, will be paying BrightHouse &pound;103 a week. He receives about &pound;140 a week in benefits payments, leaving him &pound;37 a week for everything else. &quot;My mum helps with the bills,&quot; he says. His enthusiasm for the model is&nbsp;undented by the steep weekly charge. He likes the system for its &quot;affordability&quot;.</p><p>In the post-recession reshaping of the British high street, there have been several notable winners: the payday lenders, betting shops and BrightHouse, supplier of TVs and sofas on credit, to people who cannot afford upfront payment.</p><p>&quot;I can think of no better marker of social deprivation than having a BrightHouse store open in your area,&quot; writes <a href=\"http://www.salford.ac.uk/nmsw/nursing-academics/karl-dayson\" title=\"\">Karl Dayson</a>, an academic studying affordable finance. If he is right, that deprivation is spreading fast. Last year, the chain opened a new shop a fortnight, and has launched 124 new stores, cheerfully branded in orange, over the past five years, bringing the total to 288. The company has identified another 400 possible locations across the UK where new stores could be opened, as part of an aggressive campaign to bring its unique rent-to-own, high-interest model to more customers.</p><p>Debt charities are dismayed by this expansion, pointing to the high cost of BrightHouse's goods and the 69.9% APR on many of the store's products, which might make a washing machine that costs &pound;399 from <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/household-appliances/laundry-dishwashers/washing-machines/hotpoint-aqualtis-aq113f497iuk-washing-machine-white-11925673-pdt.html?gclid=CKWc5qbD47kCFaKWtAodaCMAyw&amp;srcid=198&amp;cmpid=ppc~gg~~~Exact&amp;mctag=gg_goog_7904&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3391!3!30417854484!!!g!64554954204!&amp;ef_id=UUL6yQAABd7Bsi2J:20130924073718:s\" title=\"\">Currys</a> end up costing almost four times that amount from <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/washers-and-dryers/hotpoint-aqualtis-11kg-washer-silver/\" title=\"\">BrightHouse</a>: &pound;1,560, broken down into seductively affordable &pound;10 weekly instalments. This is known as the poverty premium: the poorer you are, the more you pay.</p><p>&quot;BrightHouse represents a high-cost form of&nbsp;credit which, like payday loans, appears to be thriving in these straitened economic times,&quot; warns a spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.stepchange.org/#\" title=\"\">StepChange</a>, the debt charity.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419113203\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/1/1380641857040/BrightHouse-store-009.jpg\" alt=\"BrightHouse store\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Debt adviser Anne Young: 'These companies are preying on people who can’t afford to go anywhere else.

I do think they are robbing the poor, when you look at their prices. They're charging a&nbsp;ridiculous amount of money for stuff you can get on the high street for a third of the price.&quot;</p><p>She knows of families who have cut down on the amount of food they buy for their children in order to meet BrightHouse payments. When she walks past her local branch, she has to stop herself marching in and hauling customers out. &quot;I want to go in and say, 'No! Don't sign!' I want to go in and shout, 'You robbers! You absolute robbers!'&quot;</p><p>The company's chief executive, Leo McKee, argues that the business gives people who have no access to credit a means of buying essential items that would otherwise be denied them. Buying a sofa or a television or an oven from BrightHouse is, he says, a better option than going to a loan shark, which is probably true, but it isn't a brilliant benchmark. The way McKee describes it, this easy-to-budget model, where purchases are priced in weekly repayments (ranging between &pound;3.50 a week for a table and &pound;26 a week for a sofa), represents a valuable, morally justifiable service to low-income households.</p><p>It is a quiet Tuesday afternoon at BrightHouse in Elephant &amp; Castle, in a rundown south London shopping centre. A&nbsp;few people are browsing, some are sheltering from the rain outside.</p><p>One woman comes in with her six-year-old son and sits on the leather sofas in front of the bank of televisions for 10 minutes, having a rest. She has never bought anything from BrightHouse and isn't planning to. &quot;I would rather buy it at once,&quot; she says, peering at the price tags beneath the televisions and jabbing at the interest rates. &quot;I&nbsp;heard if you don't pay, they can send the bailiffs to your home to remove the product. They do it for their own interest; it's them who is winning, not the customers. It's&nbsp;horrendous how high the prices are.&quot; She sees the shop as&nbsp;a place you might go if you were struggling with your money. &quot;My husband is a market trader; there's money coming in.&quot;</p><p>David Box comes with his wife Jayne and two of their four children (Piper, seven, and Courtney, 13). They want to buy a&nbsp;television for their son, who is about to have his 11th birthday. They are moving to a&nbsp;bigger house and he will be getting his own room for the first time, so they want to let him have a&nbsp;place to watch his DVDs. David, who has worked as a&nbsp;bus driver since 1999, is thinking about getting him a&nbsp;3D television, but Jayne (who also works, delivering prescriptions to people who are unable to leave their homes) insists that this will be bad for his eyes and will not contemplate it.</p><p>&quot;This is fun,&quot; Piper says, and lies down on one of the showroom beds.</p><p>Her mum shoos her off. &quot;It's not a&nbsp;playground.&quot;</p><p>They choose a small Baird (BrightHouse's own brand) that will cost them &pound;606.84 over 156 weeks. &quot;It's affordable for us,&quot; Jayne says. &quot;If&nbsp;something goes wrong in the first three years, you&nbsp;get it fixed or you get another one.&quot;</p><p>It's an odd argument, because even if it did go wrong, repeatedly (which televisions no longer tend to do), for that price you could buy six similar-sized new televisions from Argos (&pound;99.99). Could a television break that many times in three years? &quot;It could. You don't know. If my son knocks it over, we're all covered.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419113204\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/1/1380640823680/BrightHouse-family-009.jpg\" alt=\"BrightHouse family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>‘It’s affordable for us. We’d rather pay over longer’: David and Jayne Box with children Courtney and Piper. Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The family has bought &quot;countless&quot; products from the shop over the past eight years: beds, a&nbsp;washing machine, a freezer, a stereo. Jayne likes the payment model, explaining that with four kids who want dance classes and new school uniforms, &quot;we'd rather pay over longer&quot;. She says the high interest &quot;doesn't bother us… Before you put pen to paper, you talk about it.&quot; She describes the weekly payments as &quot;affordable&quot; and she likes the service cover, with people ready to come out to mend broken appliances. &quot;It means you have money to spare, so if the children come home with a letter for a school trip, you don't have to say no.&quot;</p><p>They are currently paying out &pound;62.25 a week to the company, which David says is considerably less than a day's wages (he earns between &pound;120 and &pound;135 for a day's work). They are careful never to overstretch themselves and have never owed BrightHouse more than &pound;84 a week.</p><p>Leo McKee stands outside the shop, pointing out his company's chief design features: &quot;We show products in a room-style setting; the customer should be able to walk around with a buggy.&quot; As he talks, an elderly woman comes up and asks if he is a security guard and, if so, can he please do something about the three homeless people sitting outside, their belongings loaded up on old prams. &quot;How long have we had dossers here?&quot; she says. &quot;No wonder no one can sit down.&quot; He promises to&nbsp;look into the matter and we move to a back room behind the shop floor to continue talking.</p><p>A few moments into the conversation, I pop out to find the Guardian photographer, leaving my Dictaphone running. When I play the recording back later, I hear silence as I leave the room and a few sighs. Then McKee says in his friendly, Glaswegian voice: &quot;You never know if it's going to be good or bad, do you? They're all the same: as nice as…&quot; and there is a mumbled word, hard to make out, that sounds like knives, nails or needles.</p><p>The man from Brunswick, the PR firm representing BrightHouse, replies soothingly, &quot;That's absolutely right. You know, she could come out with a negative standpoint or she could be fair. Exactly. But, as I keep saying: we're doing the right thing.&quot; Then there is some muttering and rustling of papers, and I hear my own voice returning to the room, apologising and beginning the interview again.</p><p>This is the fundamental difficulty for BrightHouse. Debt campaigners condemn the model for being expensive, confusing and exploitative. Usually when this little-noticed brand gets into the news, it is not for good reasons. But BrightHouse representatives make a valiant attempt at promoting what they do as something akin to a public service.</p><p>Chastened by their scepticism, I'm anxious to be fair. So here is McKee making a powerful case for BrightHouse, describing how it gives families who need a&nbsp;washing machine, for example, a way of getting one immediately and paying for it slowly, over the long term, in payments of &pound;6 or &pound;7 a&nbsp;week. &quot;The customer knows that she can pay that money and get a&nbsp;washing machine. She can plan,&quot; he says. &quot;What you have to appreciate is that, for my customer, it may well be that the alternative to buying the washing machine is they go to the launderette every weekend.&quot;</p><p>More than 50% of his customers will be wholly or partially on benefits; if they work, most will do so part time; the average customer will be aged between 26 and 45, with a household income of &pound;13,000; mostly they are female. The company has recently simplified its payment model, so that the bewildering choice of insurance and protection policies has all been rolled into one understandable price tag.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419113205\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/1/1380641233916/BrightHouse-chief-executi-010.jpg\" alt=\"BrightHouse chief executive Leo McKee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>BrightHouse chief executive, Leo McKee: 'People have always had to buy beds, sofas, washing machines. This format, whereby people need access to credit in order to&nbsp;purchase essentials, has been there for a long, long time.' Photograph: Mimi Mollica for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>&quot;You have to look at what the alternatives for that market are if they don't go to BrightHouse,&quot; McKee says. &quot;People have always had to buy beds, sofas, washing machines. This format, whereby people need access to credit in order to&nbsp;purchase essentials, has been there for a long, long time. I&nbsp;put it to you that it is not so different from the mortgage on the house.&quot;</p><p>BrightHouse is a hybrid of a shop such as Argos and a loan company, aimed at people who might have trouble getting a credit card. &quot;I see myself, first, as selling furniture and electrical products on the UK high street,&quot; McKee says. &quot;These are need products, essential products, not fripperies. Then, second, as providing a&nbsp;financial services mechanism, whereby the customer can afford them.&quot;</p><p>These arguments are less persuasive when they are unpicked. The comparison to a house is not a valid one: a&nbsp;house is an asset you can sell again, whereas the sofa or television is&nbsp;something that will diminish in value to the point of worthlessness. The&nbsp;argument about slowly buying a&nbsp;washing machine, thereby avoiding the cost of launderettes, really applies only to washing machines. Despite what McKee argues, quite a&nbsp;number of the shop's products are closer to fripperies than need products. Take, say, the <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/gaming/x-rocker-suzuka-gaming-chair/\" title=\"\">X-rocker Suzuka Gaming Chair</a> (with built-in vibration, 2.1 audio system with subwoofer, Wi-Fi connectivity to gaming consoles, &pound;2.50 a week, &pound;161.12 flat cost, &pound;260 over 104 weeks, with an APR of 69.9%).</p><p>Considering whether or not these are essentials quickly leads to contentious territory. Not everyone sees televisions as vital products, and it is amazing how politicised the size and flatness of the television screen has become. When he was promoting his latest series last month, Jamie Oliver wrestled with an issue that has preoccupied Daily Mail writers and rightwing politicians for years: the weird debate about poverty and ownership of televisions, and the peculiar idea that no one with a large, flatscreen TV is actually poor. &quot;[You see a poor] mum and the kids eating chips and cheese out of a Styrofoam container,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/27/jamie-oliver-chips-cheese-modern-day-poverty\" title=\"\">Oliver said</a>, &quot;and behind them is a massive TV.&quot; It is an odd, dated argument, because it glosses over the fact that it is now very difficult to buy a non-flatscreen, non-plasma television, and that TVs are actually not that expensive (unless you opt for the BrightHouse <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/televisions/samsung-46-led-smart-3d-tv/\" title=\"\">46-inch Samsung 3D television</a>, which is &pound;1,950.70, and will end up costing &pound;3,744 over 156 weeks of &pound;24 weekly payments).</p><p>On the television and poverty debate, McKee makes an interesting point: &quot;Before you just jump in and make blanket criticisms, you've got to understand lifestyle and the significance of the full-screen television. I would say that in the wealthier echelons of society, they watch a&nbsp;lot less television than the social demographic I'm speaking of. This is why the sofa is so important to them, and the television is so important to them, because their life is home-centric. They socialise with their friends who&nbsp;live in the same street or in the next street. Conspicuous excess is not widespread, as far as I can see.</p><p>&quot;If I look at the products that we sell,&quot; McKee goes on, &quot;they have a utilitarian purpose or in some cases an educational purpose. We are selling products that play a critical role in the home. And&nbsp;if that happens to be an Xbox, then, yes, it's&nbsp;an Xbox. It's&nbsp;not going to the theatre: it's home entertainment. It's cheaper.&quot;</p><p>McKee is frustrated by the prevailing rush to demonise people who receive benefits by scrutinising their spending patterns, and is dismissive of the newspaper articles condemning their lifestyles. &quot;My experience of our customers is that the vast majority are pretty responsible, and there isn't to my knowledge a proliferation of benefit millionaires. Our customers have to budget prudently.&quot;</p><p>Ultimately, this discussion of what constitutes a&nbsp;frippery and what's a need product is a red herring, because concerns about BrightHouse aren't sparked by a desire to judge people on what they choose to buy. The only real issue is the startlingly high price of the goods on offer, and the suspicion that you would choose to shop here only if you had no real choice. Buying things at BrightHouse is just going to make you poorer.</p><p>The company report, illustrated with smiling models with mesmerisingly perfect teeth, highlights the &quot;unambiguous price promise&quot;: &quot;If&nbsp;you find an identical product at a cheaper cash&nbsp;price on the high street, we'll match that price.&quot; It's difficult to find identical products, because a&nbsp;lot of the items are&nbsp;made exclusively for BrightHouse, or bundled up with extra features that rival shops don't throw in, and the pricing structure is so complex that it&nbsp;is hard to tell if the product&nbsp;is actually&nbsp;cheaper.</p><p>Take three products for which the comparison appears easier to make, however, and the contrast is stark. BrightHouse's website offers the <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-3-10-bundle/\" title=\"\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch 16GB</a>, at &pound;580.02, paid for&nbsp;over 104 weeks, at &pound;9 a&nbsp;week, which, with the 69.9% APR, will end up costing &pound;936. You can buy&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/direct/samsung-galaxy-tab-3-101-16gb-white-tablet/421-3183.prd?pageLevel=&amp;skuId=421-3183\" title=\"\">an identical product at Tesco</a> (although possibly without pre-installed apps, of unknown value) for &pound;329, or <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-3-10-1-tablet-intel-atom-android-10-1-wi-fi-16gb-white/p583919\" title=\"\">from John Lewis</a> for &pound;329.95.</p><p>Or you can buy an <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/printers/hp-envy-120-all-in-one-printer/\" title=\"\">HP Envy 120 All-In-One Printer</a> from BrightHouse for &pound;322.23, which, with 69.9% interest, and paying &pound;5&nbsp;a&nbsp;week over 104 weeks, will cost you &pound;520. <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/hp-envy-120-e-all-in-one-wireless-printer/p231901338?kpid=231901338&amp;s_kenid=1ff91937-4d66-aaa9-ba2f-000064a0eaa7&amp;s_kwcid=ppc_pla&amp;tmad=c&amp;tmcampid=73\" title=\"\">John Lewis has the same product for &pound;149.99</a>, <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/product/HA580ZM/A/hp-envy-120-e-all-in-one-airprint-printer?afid=p219%7CGOUK&amp;cid=AOS-UK-KWG-PLA-PLA_UK_BTB\" title=\"\">Apple for &pound;199.95</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling very extravagant, you can buy that <a href=\"http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/televisions/samsung-46-led-smart-3d-tv/\" title=\"\">46-inch Samsung 3D TV for &pound;1,950.70</a>, which is already &pound;450 more expensive than Samsung's own recommended retail price of &pound;1,499.99, and&nbsp;which will, after the three years of payments, end up costing you &pound;3,744.</p><p>&quot;Prices differ because, unlike other retailers, our prices include an unrivalled package of services covering delivery, installation, repair of faulty goods and cover against fire, theft and accidental damage,&quot; a&nbsp;BrightHouse spokesman says.</p><p>Debt adviser Young thinks there is a reluctance among customers to look at the small print, combined with very seductive sales techniques. &quot;Temptation is a massive part of it,&quot; she says. &quot;You get a call saying, 'There are some lovely sofas in, would you like to come and have a look?' They tell you you're a valued customer; you think, 'Well, if they think I can afford it, it's probably OK.' But mostly they're on benefits. If they had enough money, they'd be shopping somewhere else. I don't judge people for going there. I might do the same if I didn't have any choice.&quot;</p><p>It isn't hard to find customers who have discovered that they cannot afford to keep up the&nbsp;payments on the expensive things they have&nbsp;begun to buy. People such as Freda, from Middlesbrough, who is so embarrassed about not&nbsp;being able to complete the payments on her&nbsp;fridge freezer that she does not want to give her real name. She committed herself to paying about &pound;1,800 over three years for a product she thinks would have cost about &pound;900 if she had been able to buy it outright, but three months before she finished paying for it, she lost her job and was unable to make the final payments of about &pound;55 a month. She called to see if she could reduce the payments, but was told that wouldn't be possible, and two men came in a van to remove the item from her kitchen. &quot;There was no&nbsp;empathy whatsoever,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn't complain. I&nbsp;was so embarrassed. But I was devastated. I&nbsp;had wasted all this money and got nothing&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;end. I felt like I'd been robbed.&quot;</p><p>But she understands why she chose to buy something she knew would work out very expensive in the end. &quot;When you're desperate, you don't think about it. You go into the shop, everything is shiny, they tell you that you can have it in your home in three days.&quot;</p><p>Aside from the fridge freezer, she also bought (and managed to pay for) a television for her grandson. She thinks she paid a &quot;couple of thousand&quot; pounds for it, in &pound;29.99 weekly chunks. &quot;I knew it shouldn't cost that much, but I didn't have anything for him for Christmas. There was no problem, they said: I&nbsp;could just take it away and they'd add the extra payments to my account. I was over the moon. I&nbsp;wasn't thinking about how much it would cost, just how happy he would be.&quot;</p><p>She found the removal of her fridge freezer a&nbsp;&quot;degrading&quot; experience, and will not be shopping with the company again. The charity Christians Against Poverty bought her a new fridge. A&nbsp;BrightHouse spokesman said it was impossible to comment on Freda's case because she did not want to be identified, but added, &quot;We are surprised and disappointed by her complaint… Customer surrender of goods is always a&nbsp;last resort.&quot;</p><p>But &quot;<a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Citizens Advice</a> have helped with over 14,000 problems with hire purchase arrears in the past year,&quot; says Gillian Guy, chief executive of the national charity. &quot;If&nbsp;payment problems can't be resolved, then families face having the items taken away, even though they may already have paid far more than the products are worth.&quot;</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/forum/index.php\" title=\"\">Consumer Action Group</a> website, a free advice site run by volunteers, has a permanent section devoted to BrightHouse-related problems. A&nbsp;typical thread from September reveals that <a href=\"http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?402593-Fallen-behind-with-Brighthouse/page3\" title=\"\">a poster</a> has fallen behind &quot;as we're really struggling at the moment financially&quot;. The problems were sparked by the arrival of a new baby. &quot;Last week we had two choices: pay BrightHouse what was left in the bank (not enough to cover payment anyhow) or buy bits we needed for the house (milk, bread, toilet rolls, etc), so obviously BrightHouse never got paid.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere, an anonymous adviser on the site expresses despondency at BrightHouse's enduring popularity. &quot;It's not CAG's way to be judgmental, but I become quite frustrated when I&nbsp;see that people have pretty much furnished their homes and bought computers, phones and TVs as well from this company. If they could only&nbsp;do without for a few months, they could probably get a far better deal from a decent store and save themselves a whole bushel of grief.&quot;</p><p>This is also the conclusion of a former BrightHouse salesman, who emails to say that he now feels ashamed of having both worked and shopped there. &quot;I would strongly advise people not to go to BrightHouse,&quot; he says. &quot;But the problem with society today is that we like to have things now; I&nbsp;like to have things yesterday. A lot of people feel like that, especially where technology is concerned. BrightHouse makes it easier for people who maybe can't afford it, who want to look as though they are doing better than they are, to show their friends, and make them think, 'Oh well, he's not doing so badly.' But you are just piling up on credit and pushing the problems into the future.&quot; He asks not to be named, because he lives in the community where he worked and is uncomfortable about causing trouble. &quot;The biggest problem is the inflated prices. You find yourself in a vicious circle.&quot;</p><p>Like 30% of BrightHouse's 3,300 employees, he is a&nbsp;former customer. He was also on disability benefits before he took the BrightHouse job and, when he looks through his old credit statements, he cannot comprehend how at times he was paying BrightHouse &pound;75 of his weekly income of &pound;100. &quot;I was a customer for four years before I joined them. My fridge broke at a time when I&nbsp;didn't have much money and it was a convenient way of paying. But when I&nbsp;look back at the statements, the amount I&nbsp;paid is astronomical, especially when I was getting incapacity benefit of around &pound;100 a week. There was one stage when I was paying back &pound;75 a&nbsp;week. I have no idea how I&nbsp;was surviving.&quot;</p><p>Staff are under pressure to meet monthly targets to get the bonus element of their pay, he says, and will even work on customers' children, saying, &quot;Get your dad to buy you this; tell your mum to get you that.&quot; Goods that have been seized back from customers, for nonpayment, are cleaned, repaired and rebranded as &quot;quality refurbished products&quot;, at still high prices, he says, which staff are expected to sell to earn their bonus. &quot;We&nbsp;weren't supposed to sell to people who had missed a payment in the past 12 weeks, but that went by the wayside in the runup to Christmas, when they needed to boost the number of agreements signed.&quot;</p><p>From around now until Christmas, BrightHouse staff will be pushing new games and technology to customers when they come in to make their weekly payments, he says. He feels particularly uneasy about his role in encouraging an unemployed, disabled customer gradually to notch up the number of things he bought, so that eventually he was paying back &pound;300 a week. &quot;He was a&nbsp;great guy, with a weak spot for technology. He was on disability benefits and I was selling him technology, consoles, mobile phones, knowing that he was struggling. But then, that&nbsp;was my job.&quot; The man came into the shop, visibly distressed, on a number of occasions, to&nbsp;renegotiate his contract. &quot;I'm ashamed of what I&nbsp;was party to. He was exploited.&quot;</p><p>The salesman left BrightHouse because his own health deteriorated again, but he was already disaffected with the company and his managers' constant requests that he should be more aggressive in his sales pitch. He goes out of his way now to advise people not to shop there.</p><p>There is no sign of aggressive selling techniques during my highly supervised visit to the Elephant &amp; Castle branch, but by encouraging people to return to the shop every week to make their payments in cash, the shop has a potent system for parading its wares and subtly instilling new desire. There's no need to resort to the hard sell.</p><p>Marc Brown, like around 50% of BrightHouse's customers, makes weekly cash payments. &quot;You&nbsp;come in and see friendly faces,&quot; he says. &quot;You look at the products you would like to buy next time around. I'd like a new fridge freezer, because ours is on the way out.&quot;</p><p>His description of paying BrightHouse &pound;103 a&nbsp;week out of his &pound;140 income dismays Andy Smith, director of marketing, who is hovering nearby. McKee has made much of his commitment to affordability and to credit checks. &quot;We assess affordability,&quot; Smith says. &quot;A normal ratio for us is 10% of a customer's income. An average customer will spend &pound;25 a week.&quot; The company's annual report promises: &quot;Our aim is to be the best in the rent-to-own retail market, offering the best products at the best prices in order to bring value into our customers' lives. We recognise that we have a responsibility to our customers to lend them only what they can afford to repay.&quot; But Brown appears to be making payments equivalent to 73% of his income.</p><p>Some days later, I receive an email from a&nbsp;partner at PR firm Brunswick, commenting that the company has looked into the case further. &quot;While you'll appreciate I cannot go into customers' finances with you without their permission,&quot; it states, &quot;can I assure you that, as with all our customers, credit checks were undertaken and BrightHouse is comfortable it is not lending Mr Brown more than he can afford.&quot;</p><p>As he makes his way to collect the two tablets that staff have reserved for him, Brown insists he feels upbeat about the service BrightHouse offers. Though, as he also points out, &quot;If you haven't got the money upfront, you don't have&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418753319|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|cc9c10fbb556374f340502bfc384184308d98ae0 -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/\" title=\"Ikea website\">Ikea</a> is shining a fresh light on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/30/ikea-sell-solar-panels-uk-stores\" title=\"Ikea to sell solar panels in UK stores\">UK's domestic solar panel market</a>, offering customers a fully installed, decent-sized system for £5,700.</p><p>Following a <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/store/thurrock/solar_panels\" title=\"Ikea's solar offer at Thurrock\">successful pilot project at its Lakeside store in Essex</a>, which it says has been selling one photovoltaic system almost every day, the Swedish retailer is to offer a range of solar panel packages at all 17 of its British stores within the next 10 months.</p><p>The good news is that you won't have to get out the Allen keys and struggle to put the solar system together yourself. The company providing the service on Ikea's behalf, <a href=\"http://www.hanergy.co.uk/go-solar\" title=\"Hanergy website\">Hanergy</a>, will survey your home and install the panels on your roof.</p><p>Will the investment be worth it financially as well as environmentally? Since the coalition government slashed the feed-in tariffs (Fits) – the amount that those with solar panels installed are paid – the financial returns have been less generous than they were. Many installers have quit the industry after demand for systems dropped off.</p><p>Solar panels are, however, still worth considering from a financial perspective now that the upfront costs have come down.</p><p>Ikea claims that an average semi-detached house with a south-facing roof in Southampton would make as much as £770 a year through the Fits and savings on energy bills, suggesting that a £5,700 3.36kW system would pay for itself in a little more than seven years.</p><p>While those figures are achievable in theory, the <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Getting-money-back/Solar-Energy-Calculator\" title=\"EST solar energy calculator\">Energy Saving Trust's solar calculator</a> suggests that such a system in southern England would generate closer to £600 a year in tariffs and savings – delaying the expected payback threshold, but still worth considering.</p><p>The income your solar panels will produce will depend on several factors – roof direction and pitch, whether there is any shading, and where in the country you live. The further south the&nbsp;better.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419049499'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/20/1353415639802/Energy-bill-006.jpg' alt='Energy bill' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Any bill savings will depend on whether you are in to use the electricity being generated during the day. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Energy bill savings will depend on how much you are able to use the power as it is being generated during the day, and the extent to which electricity prices rise over the next 20 years. There is also one other very important factor to take into account – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/green-your-home+energyefficiency\" title=\"The Guardian: Green your home\">your home's energy efficiency</a>.</p><p>When the government cut Fits, it introduced a two-tier payments scheme depending on the home's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/02/homebuyers-energy-labels\" title=\"\">energy performance certificate</a> (EPC). Those living in a band A-D home now get twice as much in payments (14.9p/kWh) as those living in poorly insulated homes (bands E-G), who receive the lower rate of 6.85p/kWh.</p><p>If you live in a home rated below band D, solar schemes are generally not worth bothering with – at least if you want a financial return.</p><p>Those signing up to the Ikea/Hanergy scheme after an in-store consultation must pay a £250 deposit. A surveyor will then visit to check the house and do an EPC test to establish its energy rating, and whether the roof will require any additional work before installation. A spokesman for Hanergy says customers will be advised of any additional costs, at which point they can go ahead or withdraw with their deposit refunded.</p><p>Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability at Ikea, says: \"We know that our customers want to live more sustainably and we hope working with Hanergy to make solar panels affordable and easily available helps them do just that. Evidence shows that installing solar panels enables homeowners to cut their energy bills by up to 50%.\"</p><p>So is it a good deal? Cathy Debenham, who runs the independent renewables website <a href=\"http://www.yougen.co.uk/\" title=\"youGen website\">YouGen</a>, says the Ikea prices are at the lower end of the spectrum, but are not hugely cheaper than you could pay elsewhere.</p><p>However, she welcomes the initiative, and hopes it will stimulate renewed interest in the solar sector.</p><p>\"Since the cuts to the Fit the domestic solar market has been struggling. Thanks to all the publicity around the cuts there is a widespread, and utterly incorrect, belief that solar PV is no longer worth bothering with,\" she says. \"However, because the cost of solar panels has fallen significantly, solar PV can still be a financial as well as environmental winner. The fact that Ikea has come into the market, and all the publicity that surrounds it, will certainly raise awareness of that fact, which has got to be a good thing.\"</p><p>• If you are interested in solar panels, the <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Getting-money-back/Solar-Energy-Calculator\" title=\"EST calculator\">excellent calculator on the Energy Savings Trust website</a> will show the income you can expect from installing them on your roof. YouGen will supply the address of a good local independent installer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418882533|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2544cb51cdc63055ee494fb6a53409982186ab2a -->",

        "headline":"Payday lenders: FCA proposes tougher controls on adverts and rollovers",
        "body":"<p>Payday lenders will be forced to make tougher affordability checks under a crackdown by the City regulator that could stop borrowers being given loans within minutes of applying.</p><p>New rules to protect borrowers recommended by the Financial Conduct Authority are designed to ensure that only people who can afford to repay a loan will be granted one – proposals that ministers said would have a profound effect on the sector.</p><p>Lenders will be prevented from rolling over loans more than twice to stop charges escalating, and there will be restrictions on how many times they can try to take cash from a borrower's bank account.</p><p>However, the FCA held back from capping interest charges on an industry whose biggest lender, Wonga, has been castigated by politicians, charities and the Archbishop of Canterbury for charging an APR of 5,800%. The consumer minister, Jo Swinson, said the changes would have &quot;a profound impact on the industry's risk model&quot;, while the head of the FCA said 30% of lenders could leave the market as result. It added that up to 30% of consumers who were currently offered loans would lose access to them, and lending could be reduced by up to &pound;750m.</p><p>The announcement came as research from the government showed lenders were not meeting voluntary codes of conduct, leaving customers under pressure to take on more borrowing.</p><p>However, the Labour MP Stella Creasy, a leading critic of the payday industry and vocal supporter of interest rate caps, said the new rules did not go far enough. Creasy, who has campaigned against what she calls &quot;legal loan sharks&quot;, said the industry had &quot;slipped through the net again&quot;.</p><p>&quot;While I welcome the focus of the FCA on legal loan sharks and their research into capping, the lack of real action again today on the actual cost of credit itself will be a blow for many caught in a spiral of debt due to payday lenders,&quot; she said. &quot;The FCA's hands are being tied by a government that consistently speaks out against what most other countries have done to tackle legal loan sharks by opposing capping what these companies can charge.&quot;</p><p>The FCA will take over regulation of the consumer credit market, including payday loans, in April 2014 and has outlined how it plans to govern all types of lenders, with new payday lender restrictions to be introduced next July.</p><p>The FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said: &quot;We believe payday lending has a place; many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don't want to stop that happening. But this type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it and payday lenders must not be allowed to drain money from a borrower's account.&quot;</p><p>Its plans for tackling the payday loans industry include limiting the number of times a loan can be extended – or rolled over – to two, and preventing lenders from making repeated use of continuous payment authorities (CPAs) to reclaim repayments from consumers' bank accounts.</p><p>Currently some lenders hit accounts multiple times in a day, often clawing back whatever they can if there is not enough for the full amount owed.</p><p>They are preferred creditors, which means they are able to take money from customers before they pay their housing costs or other bills. In future they will have to stop after two unsuccessful attempts and will be banned from trying to collect just part of the planned repayment.</p><p>Lenders will also have to publish risk warnings on adverts and provide information on free debt advice to anyone who wants to roll over a loan. Current guidance on checking whether a borrower can afford a loan before making it will become binding rules.</p><p>However, the FCA said lenders needed time to change their practices, so although it wanted to introduce the reforms from 1 April 2014, rules on CPAs and rollovers would not come into effect until 1 July.The new rules were published alongside the results of a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills survey of 4,000 borrowers undertaken over the summer, which showed nearly a quarter of borrowers were put under pressure to extend the repayment period.</p><p>About two-thirds said the lender did not appear to check their financial position before offering a rollover, almost a third said they had not had the CPA clearly explained to them and nearly two-thirds were not told how to cancel them.</p><p>Swinson, said the new rules addressed the concerns raised by the research. &quot;People are concerned about the business profiting out of people who take out loans they cannot afford to repay and the FCA rules should stop that – alongside the better affordability checks, if someone can only roll over the loan a limited number of times, the costs will be limited,&quot; she said.added that without lenders sharing real-time data on what loans people had taken, the rules would probably force &quot;some element of slowing down&quot;. Wheatley agreed, telling Radio 4: &quot;The fact you can get a loan in 10 minutes means the person lending to you isn't really doing the proper affordability checking. It will be a lengthier process and arguably 10 minutes to get money for people who may not have the ability to repay is too short in any case.&quot;The chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Citizens Advice</a>, Gillian Guy, said: &quot;The new rules from the FCA are essential to stem the tide of predatory payday lenders and protect consumers from unacceptable behaviour from the credit industry.&quot;</p><p>Guy said borrowers had been loaned money without proper checks, and some had been left without cash for food after having their bank accounts drained using CPAs. &quot;The squeeze on living standards means people sometimes need a short-term loan to cover unexpected expenses. It's really important that there is a responsible short-term loan market and it's about time traditional lenders, like banks, became part of it,&quot; she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418930480|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7b8da5dfc84fb649f61724559bba50417aef5a2a -->",

In this short time, 320 hours-worth of conference calls were made leaving me with a bill of £4,356.11. </strong></p><p><strong>Orange never alerted me to this blatantly suspicious activity, but it initially promised in writing that I would not have to pay because the charges were \"obvious results of crime\". Two weeks later it attempted to debit my account for the full amount and told me I was liable. I am 23 and have no savings, an entry-level job, a large student loan and I am suffering some serious health problems as a result of this. </strong><em>CM, Ilkeston, Derbyshire</em></p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Orange backs down when its press office gets involved and it has now refunded the charges as \"a gesture of goodwill\".</p><p>The question remains why such frenetic, uncharacteristic activity was not flagged up by its security systems. According to Orange, unusual usage is monitored, but when calls are made abroad there can be a time lag before the foreign network operator reports it.</p><p>Currently mobile phone customers can be held liable for all charges fraudulently incurred before a phone is reported stolen unlike bank customers who are only liable for the first £50 – although Orange was unforgivably heartless to insist on such a huge sum.</p><p>The government and its telecoms regulator, Ofcom, are working on a code of practice to bring greater protection to fraud victims, including the possibility of a maximum liability when large bills are run up by thieves. In the meantime, initiate pin protection on your handset.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"your.problems@observer.co.uk\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "headline":"Dear Jeremy – your work issues solved",
        "body":"<h2><strong>How does a grown-up teen mum step into the&nbsp;workplace at 35?</strong></h2><p><strong>I am 35 and having trouble finding a job in the arts. I know it is hard, but I have an extra problem: I was one of those teen mums. You know the ones that skulked off mid-A-levels to give birth and never returned? I did, however, do a degree in fine art when my son was a bit older, and got a first.</strong></p><p><strong>The trouble is, since then I have been through a disgusting divorce and lost my house, although I did get some money to go travelling for a year from the proceeds, from which I have just returned.</strong></p><p><strong>My son is now grown up, and  with the emotional scars healed  and everything back in place I am for  the first time able to concentrate on my career.</strong></p><p><strong>I would like to work in arts education in a gallery setting. But how do I go about applying for jobs when my CV looks erratic and sketchy?</strong></p><p><strong>How do I construct a CV or explain all this to potential bosses, and show that my skill set is way beyond the written document presented before them? How do teen mums who are now grown up find their value in the workplace?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>There is a great deal to like about your letter. It is self-aware but wholly without self-pity. You know that jobs in the arts are fiendishly difficult to find, and that a great many conventional employers are going to look at your CV without much enthusiasm. But at the same time you have shown admirable resilience – and the dedication and intelligence to knuckle down and get yourself an excellent degree.</p><p>In the kind of job you're hoping to find, personality should count for as much as formal qualifications. The difficulty, as you clearly realise, is that qualifications speak for themselves while personality – at least until you get to interview stage – doesn't.</p><p>Shrewd potential bosses will know that someone with your sort of background, looking to start a career for the first time at the age of 35, is likely to be unusually grateful for a job, and unusually determined to make a go of it. This has its own appeal.</p><p>So don't be tempted, in your written applications and in constructing your CV, to try to gloss over your personal history; don't try to make yourself sound like everyone else. In the first place, you wouldn't succeed – you'd only come across as evasive; in the second place, an absolutely honest declaration of your past and your present determination is much the best way for your personality to shine through.</p><p>Don't be deterred by the fact that such an approach won't work for everyone; you don't need to appeal to everyone. You just need to intrigue enough people to win yourself a few interviews.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• I am the director of an arts organisation working with children and young people. Gallery education is an incredibly competitive field, but there are lots of ways to get started. Arts Council England has funded a number of \"Bridge\" organisations to help children, young people and children's settings to work together effectively. You could also ask to talk to the education lead in your local public arts gallery or museum to help you get a sense of how to get on the road to this sort of career. Volunteering or running your own workshops is also good; just make sure you're insured and have safeguarding checks in place. <strong>EffervescentAlchemy</strong></p><p></p><p>• I recently came back from eight months travelling but was able to talk up skills like negotiating, getting on with different groups of people, budgeting, long-term planning and being able to adapt to changing situations etc. If you dig deep enough you'll be able to turn up things you may not have thought applied to the workplace. <strong>tyorkshiretealass</strong></p><h2><strong>Is age 55 too late&nbsp;to swap drudgery for a job inspiring passion?</strong></h2><p><strong>Until recently I was a successful 55-year-old professional. I am financially comfortable, but I've always despised my work to the extent that a few months ago I resigned to write a book. The book is now finished and I really ought to get back to work, but I am determined not to go back to the loathsome drudgery of the rat race. </strong></p><p><strong>I know I should find a job for which I have a passion; my problem is I've spent decades looking for a passion from which I could make a living and still haven't found one.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you have any advice as to where I might get help to find a meaningful role for the last decade of my career? I want to leap out of bed every morning, excited to go to work. I don't need a handsome salary.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>I am always been a bit leery about applying the word \"passion\" to jobs. You say you've spent decades looking for one, but the thing about real passions is that you don't have to go looking for them; like it or not, they take you over.</p><p>There are certainly some who are genuinely consumed by a very strong vocational drive, who find particular subjects irresistibly fascinating. But millions of other people have enjoyable, rewarding, socially useful jobs that they would never claim to be passions.</p><p>I am not suggesting you should lower your sights and settle for another role you despise, just that between \"the loathsome drudgery of the rat race\" and those rare true passions is a whole range of occupations that you could well find stimulating. If a passion hasn't taken hold of you by now, it probably never will – and there's no tragedy in that.</p><p>You've written a book. I wish you'd told me what it was about. Writing a book demands time, persistence and self-discipline. Something must have held your interest for long enough for you to finish it.</p><p>And your interests are exactly what you should be exploring right now. Is there nothing in the subject of this book that might lead, however indirectly, to a possible new role? My guess is that anything that engaged your mind and your imagination, that presented you with challenging problems that demanded intelligent solutions, would very soon satisfy you.</p><p>You might never develop a passion for it; you might never leap out of bed every morning, excited to go to work (who does, I wonder?). But the chances are, as is true for most people, that as your experience deepened so would your interest. And with that comes satisfaction.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• If you managed to write a book within a few months, you must have loved doing that. So why not write another one or become a ghostwriter for others? <strong>Aranzazu</strong></p><p></p><p>• List everything you've done recently that has made your heart sing (whether work-related or not) on a huge piece of paper. Then look at your list and see whether different combinations of activities could form a job. <strong>CareersPartnershipUK</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

        "body":"<p><strong>Q</strong> Can you get the government's Help to Buy scheme if you have a rental property already?</p><p>We have a family home in Cleethorpes and need to move to Leicester for work. Our home in Cleethorpes is valued at around £250,000 and we have around £140,000 left to pay on our repayment mortgage. My husband also has a house from before we met which is also on a repayment mortgage. This house is valued at around £200,000 and we have around £130,000 left to pay on that one. We rent this one out and we don't want to sell it.</p><p>If we sold the house in Cleethorpes, could we (with scraping together around about £50,000 in savings) pay off the mortgage on the rental house and then apply for the Help to Buy scheme to buy another house in Leicester which would be our family home. This would leave us with the rental house as our pension plan and just the one mortgage.</p><p>I would be really grateful if you could answer this question as I can't find any advice on the web about it at all. <strong>AB</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> You'll find a lot of information about the government's current Help to Buy scheme in the <a href=\"http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2013/06/Help-to-Buy-equity-loan-buyers-guide.pdf\" title=\"\">Help to Buy Buyer's Guide (pdf)</a> published on the <a href=\"http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Help to Buy website</a>. This categorically states that \"the property purchased [using the Help to Buy scheme] must be your only residence. Help to Buy is not available to assist buy-to-let investors or those who will own any property other than their Help to Buy property after completing their purchase\". More seriously, \"applicants who make fraudulent claims for Help to Buy assistance will be liable to criminal prosecution\" so just not mentioning your rental property is not an option.</p><p>The first part of Help to Buy, which came into place in April, can only be used on new-build properties. Had you been eligible, you would have been expected to put down a cash deposit of 5% on your new home in Leicester, take out a Help to Buy mortgage of 75% with the remaining 20% of the purchase price being funded by an equity loan from government. The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme which will apply to both newly built and existing homes will be available from 1 January 2014. However, the fact you plan to own more than one property means you will not qualify to use it.</p><p>Given that you can't get government help with buying your new home, and you don't want to sell the rental property, your options are limited. One option would be to keep the current mortgage on the rental property and use the £110,000 from selling your home (assuming you sell for £250,000 and pay off the outstanding mortgage of £140,000) to put towards buying your new home in Leicester. Alternatively, if you are determined to clear the mortgage on the rental property, you could use the proceeds from selling your home together with some of your £50,000 in savings to do just that.</p><p>However, that would leave you with only £30,000 of your savings to put down as a deposit on the Leicester house. Assuming you would get a mortgage of 80% of the value on your new home, this would buy you a property costing £150,000.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417533454|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e1306459d60311b333e76170b691d91c369d0547 -->",
