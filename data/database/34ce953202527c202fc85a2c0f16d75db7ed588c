It is the 37-year-old's first senior coaching appointment.</p><p>Simpson has a strong record – a 306-game playing career at North Melbourne that featured two premierships and five years as captain, following by four years as an assistant under the widely-respected Hawthorn senior coach Alastair Clarkson.</p><p>He won the job ahead of a strong field that featured current Eagles assistant Scott Burns, Fremantle deputy Peter Sumich and Sydney assistant Leigh Tudor.<br />Simpson and Sumich were considered the frontrunners. Sumich was a star forward at West Coast and also served there as an assistant coach before going to the Dockers two years ago, and like Simpson,he has been considered a senior coach in waiting.</p><p>Simpson will have a three-year deal and he takes over from John Worsfold, who coached the Eagles for 12 years before leaving the job early last month.</p><p>\"I am grateful for this opportunity and I look forward to moving across to Perth with my family and settling in to the challenge ahead,\" Simpson said in a club statement. \"I have always admired West Coast from afar and I believe the list has an exciting mix of senior and emerging young players.\"</p><p>Simpson worked at Hawthorn as their stoppages coach from 2010-12 and this year was in charge of their forwards.</p><p>He singled out Clarkson and Hawks football manager Chris Fagan for the help they gave him. \"Hawthorn have been fantastic for me in the last four years and it was certainly a great experience to be a part of the coaching group as the club achieved the ultimate success last Saturday,\" he said.</p><p>\"Being so closely involved from a coaching perspective has provided me with a sense of the hard work which has to be done to achieve a premiership. I obviously enjoyed that feeling as a player, but it is different as a coach.</p><p>\"I will move across to Perth as soon as possible and I look forward to meeting the players and working with them from the start of pre-season.\"</p><p>The Hawks coach, Alastair Clarkson, said in a club statement that Simpson was ready for the senior coaching hot seat.</p><p>\"In his four years at Hawthorn, Adam has fostered a terrific relationship with the playing group and displayed a high level of excellence across all facets of his coaching duties,\" Clarkson said. \"He is well-placed for the transition into senior coaching, which is thoroughly deserved on the back of an impressive coaching apprenticeship and a distinguished playing career.\"<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419017067|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|c034f73555795e2105052f7f04a4b8b2bc3dabe0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Does anyone know what the hell the Sydney Swans are thinking? I thought I knew them, but they've changed, man. They've changed.</p><p>All season we were comfortably assuming that Lance Franklin would be heading to Greater Western Sydney at the end of 2013 to roll around in a huge pile of money and smear it in a disgustingly sensual fashion against his sweaty skin. The image seemed to fit, the maths added up, and at least orange jumpers weren't any worse than Hawthorn's sewerage medley.</p><p>Yet today, out of nowhere, like a spontaneous tornado of sporting news, we learned that Buddy is going to wear red and white instead. Not us, said GWS, the other Sydney. The cross-town rivals. The Swans. </p><p>I'm not the only one to whom this makes as much sense as a David Lynch film dubbed into Khmer. The puzzlement isn't about the last minute change of heart or display of complete disdain – your call which – shown by Mount Franklin. It's that Sydney would be the club who wanted to climb him next.</p><p>When they started out, the Swans were a laughable mess. Over the past couple of decades, the club developed one of the most respected cultures in the AFL. Instilled in the lead-up up to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpCf1h6LLt0\">their 2005 premiership</a>, the Bloods ethos demanded a fanatical team spirit, a commitment to always do the hard work and to put the team first. </p><p>The abrogation of ego was more colloquially distilled as the 'no dickheads' policy. Sydney recruited based on personality as much as ability. Perhaps, as sportswriter Trent Slatter suggested, the Swans are now channelling The Simpsons: if it's no <em>dickheads</em>, they're allowed to have one. But Franklin, at least on the football field, displays precisely the characteristics this policy sought to exclude. </p><p>Sure, he can nail a 55-metre left-foot snap through a tackle, and he relishes the physical contest. But even if we ignore that early-season haircut that looked like he'd stapled roadkill to his scalp, Franklin's game involves too many cheap shots, too many grabs for glory, too much waiting to star based on the work of others. Remove Mitchell, Sewell and Lewis, and Franklin would have a far sparser Hawthorn career. His signature move was not trying to dribble through a goal from 40 metres out on wet turf with a few minutes left in another nailbiter against Geelong. His signature move was missing, getting another shot a minute later, and doing the exact same thing. Yes, he can bag 33 against GWS in Burnie when no one's watching, but the big games too often provoke an MIA report. Three grand finals and two premierships have passed with comparatively little Franklin influence. </p><p>If Franklin's attitude jars with Sydney's playing ethos, it also jars with their recruitment style. Their tremendous record of recycling players means half the contributors to their last premiership side came from other teams or codes. But Sydney's converts were players who were frustrated or overlooked at home, not existing stars lured with pots of gold. The first incongruous approach was last season, <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/sydney-swans-reportedly-offer-key-forward-kurt-tippett-a-contract-worth-35-million-over-four-years/story-e6frf3e3-1226521114469\">when Sydney offered big money to Kurt Tippett</a>. Franklin's contract makes even less sense, because… well, now the Swans have Kurt Tippett.</p><p>Perhaps Franklin is seen as a potential replacement for Adam Goodes, as a tall and highly mobile player, but his game would have to evolve a long way to match Sydney's great champion. Presuming it doesn't, another marquee forward is hardly what Sydney needs, especially if it means they lose one of the best ruckmen in the competition in Shane Mumford. </p><p>In a footballing and a cultural sense, Franklin would have made sense at GWS. The Giants have room for egos. Jeremy Cameron may be the one kid at the grown-ups table, but aside from that the rest are youthfully anonymous, disposed of by other sides like henchmen in Commando. They need a big point of focus, they need some attention, and they need a player who frightens the opposition. It would be worth putting up with Franklin's attitude for that. He makes no sense, though, at Sydney. Especially if <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/buddys-nineyear-deal-could-be-worth-10m-20131001-2uqhz.html\">the reports of a seemingly insane nine-year deal turn out to be true</a>, which will see Franklin hobbling out of Sydney on replacement knees carved out of Styrofoam. This trade could backfire harder than a dozen Brendan Fevolas. </p><p>Of course sports writers exist to be proved wrong, and perhaps when Buddy is shining his ninth premiership medallion with Brett Kirk's bottled sweat while Barry Hall ceremonially punches the statue raised in his honour, I will quietly assemble my words into a neat pile and consume them with a trendy chipotle sauce. But in making an exception for talent over personality, the Swans may not have just kicked a hole in the Giants' future planning. They may have booted one in their own culture as well.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418711824|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|624696b70acd06ce4ee26d7b4953bcccc5eaf5fd -->",

Contrary to media reports, that offer was $1.2m a year over six years,\" said the Giants CEO David Matthews. </p><p>\"It appears he has a significantly higher financial offer which we would not have been prepared to make based on our due diligence.  We have every confidence in our list management strategy but we cannot compromise it for the sake of one individual.</p><p>\"We have been patient and shown a lot of respect through the process.  This decision now allows us to pursue other options during the forthcoming trade period.\"</p><p>There is already controversy surrounding any move for Franklin to Sydney. The Collingwood president, Eddie McGuire, and former Western Bulldogs player Luke Darcy have suggested there will be outrage from other clubs if Franklin joins the Swans.</p><p>Both the Swans and Greater Western Sydney are given a 9.8% cost-of-living allowance above the league-wide salary cap. That arrangement was questioned by rival clubs after the Swans signed the ex-Adelaide forward Kurt Tippett after winning last year's premiership.</p><p>But that unease will reach new levels if the Swans thwart GWS's efforts to poach Franklin with their own reported $7m, five-year offer.</p><p>\"I think there would be a riot. There would actually be a riot in AFL football,\" Darcy predicted on Melbourne's Triple-M radio on Tuesday.</p><p>McGuire, a long-time critic of the Sydney clubs' allowances, agreed, saying: \"I think so.\"</p><p>Adrian Anderson, the former AFL general manager of football, said the AFL allowance for the Sydney clubs meant an argument could be mounted that if Franklin does go to the Swans, the league is helping to recruit him.</p><p>\"You could look at it that way,\" Anderson told 3AW radio. \"There's a very vigorous debate. Sydney will say that the cost of living up there is higher and they spread it across all the players on the list and it doesn't enable them to fund a player like that.</p><p>\"But at the end of the day, the simple fact is they've got 10% more.<br />He added there were aspects of the Sydney lifestyle that in many players' minds meant the higher cost-of-living would be offset anyway, without the extra allowance.</p><p>\"You look at a place like Adelaide. You could argue as a young player that it's a more attractive, exciting environment to go to a place like Sydney, where it is more expensive, [but] it is exciting and fun, compared with Adelaide.</p><p>\"I don't want to throw any aspersions on Adelaide as a city, but it doesn't have all the appeal and attractions for a young fella like Sydney does.\"</p><p>Asked whether that meant the Swans didn't need the AFL subsidy to recruit players, Anderson said: \"Potentially.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418695688|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|87c20c466ef80b104f1384e5c90892077512ceeb -->",

        "body":"<h2>The Gary Ablett(s) Award for best player in the league</h2><p>Err… it's Gary Ablett Jr isn't it? We might have been unsure of Gaz pulling off a three-vote game as the final Brownlow votes were read out this year, but he's been at the peak of his powers. Even at 75% he's better than almost anyone in the league so if anyone has a problem with this, see me in the comments section.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXapmPH3a30\"></p><h2>The Tony Modra Award for mark of the year</h2><p></a><br />I'm going to agree with the judges on this one and give it to Jamie Elliott for two reasons: 1) Jay Schulz was so far over the goal line when he took his that he could have dismounted onto Jolimont Street, and 2) Nic Naitanui's grab resulted in the entire populace of Paterson's Stadium going home happy, so it just won't do. </p><p>So the Pies get this one by default; a hollow victory to cap a forgettable season.</p><h2>The Peter Daicos award for goal of the year</h2><p>I disqualify Andrew Walker because his running effort was more a case of St Kilda players acting as witches' hats than competitive footballers. Don't get me wrong, Buddy's hurdle made me jump off the couch but it's Ablett again for this one. Watch this goal and tell me how many times out of 100 any other player in the league could nail that goal. The best I can come up with is Steve Johnson at about a 10% probability. </p><h2>The 'Swooper' Northey award for best non premiership-winning coach</h2><p>It's getting a bit old hat to lionise Ken Hinkley now, but I'm going to give it another quick go as I was on #TeamKen from the minute he was being spoken of as \"not the last man standing but the best man standing.\" I thought it might be a debacle but I was still barracking for him like hell. But it wasn't a debacle, was it? He took a group of players who looked like they'd merely won a competition to be an AFL player for a year and transformed them into a semi-final side. Some A-grade youngsters in Ollie Wines and Chad Wingard helped, but we must doff our caps to Hinkley. Other coaches have inherited better lists and not performed so admirably straight out of the gates.</p><h2>The Peter Filandia award for least popular scragger</h2><p>Here's a question for you; if you had one man tagging an opposition midfielder and your life depended on the midfielder being kept to fewer than 20 possessions, would you go with Tony Liberatore or Ryan Crowley? </p><p>I'm going with Crowley. I don't care if he bites or pinches or gives his opponent a wet willy, he is better at his specific job than almost any player in the AFL. When Crowley was brought down running into goal in the final minutes of this year's grand final, the loud cheer was a case of Hawthorn supporters saying, \"we hate you, we fear you, and we're really glad you didn't totally ruin our day.\" Ross Lyon couldn't ask for much more from this guy; a league villain par excellence.</p><h2>The Ralph Hutter and Florian Schneider award for mechanical efficiency</h2><p>Lyon walks a bit like a Thunderbird, laughs a bit like a serial killer and strategises like a mirthless dictator. He's basically the perfect modern football coach, unless you enjoy anachronisms like goals or midfielders setting off down the wing without having their eyeballs gouged. He's tough, he's ruthless and he almost got that flag he's after. Almost.   </p><h2>The Allan McAlister Award for permanently lodging your foot in your mouth</h2><p>Whether or not you consider Eddie McGuire a racist, and he certainly doesn't himself as we were reminded ad infinitum, you cannot deny the man developed an uncanny knack for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time this year. Can't imagine he'll be embarking on a quick dash into the Swans change rooms anytime soon.</p><h2>The Russell Robertson award for most screamers in a hopeless team</h2><p>At the Jackson Awards, we have a philosophy in line with the AFL's own competitive balance strategies and owing to this, had to find something positive to say about Melbourne Football Club. At least Jeremy Howe has given Melbourne fans a plausible reason to show up over the past two years. Stay at home and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2r7a8eG0jA\">you might miss a potential mark of the century</a>. He'll take them on the opposition, he'll take them on his own team-mates, I actually wouldn't put it past him to take one over an umpire one day. There you go Dees supporters – ample reason to renew the membership.</p><h2>The Silvio Foschini Award for the biggest scandal in the league</h2><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKaCoTycjk\">Yo Melbourne, I'm really happy for you and your tanking enquiry</a>, imma let you finish, but James Hird and Essendon had one of the best scandals of all time… one of the best scandals of ALL TIME.\"</p><p>Actually, that brings me to another debate - who is a more divisive figure; Kanye West or James Hird? I'm pretty sure that only one of them drives a Kia.</p><p>In a season plagued by scandal and shrouded in infamy, the Essendon supplements imbroglio was a story that left a stadium-sized stain on the league's image. Cloaked in layer upon layer of rumour, innuendo and conspiracy, it was the tabloid gift that kept giving. I'd like to say we can all move on from it now, but that's just not true now is it?</p><h2>The Peter Jess Award for least popular player manager</h2><p>Here's a simple equation for Ralph Carr: if you're the second most popular player manager to negotiate a contract for Dustin Martin when the only other person in that race is Ricky Nixon, you're DOING IT WRONG.  </p><p>Dusty, I actually like you but you need someone with a decent poker face to be doing this deal for you. This guy is less convincing than the investment offers I get emailed from members of the Nigerian royal family.</p><h2>The Brendan Fevola Award for most unsavoury Mad Monday incident</h2><p>Finally St Kilda win something for the year. Cometh the hour, cometh the Clinton Jones. \"<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-03/dwarf-entertainer-allegedly-set-on-fire-in-st-kilda-27mad-mond/4930858\">Football player sets dwarf on fire</a>\" is an amusing headline for about five or six seconds until you come to your senses and admit that it's actually awful in every conceivable way. </p><p>You're the club most notorious for bad player behavior, what are you even doing hiring a dwarf entertainer? But yes,  definitely apologise to the club, the sponsors, your family and anyone who you may have offended by acting like you're enjoying a particularly shambolic Schoolies week on the Gold Coast.</p><h2>The Bob Dylan Award for repeatedly stomping on the hearts of your fans</h2><p>Richmond may have finally broken through for a finals appearance this year, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/carlton-beat-richmond-afl-elimination-final\">their elimination final loss to Carlton</a> in front of a near-capacity crowd at the MCG was genuinely gut-wrenching and I was only there as a neutral. Richmond supporters should get counseling vouchers as part of their membership package, it's just no way to treat such a faithful bunch of people.</p><p><strong>Honourable mention: </strong>North Melbourne for having four players deemed near enough to All-Australian selection and not even managing to make it into the finals when one team in the eight had been disqualified. Given the thrilling way they played sometimes, it was quite a task to flame out so spectacularly.</p><h2>The Ben Holland Award for commanding a king's ransom with a jester's resume</h2><p>I know you have it in you, Stewart Crameri, I really do. I'm not saying he's a total dud so don't attack me, but his Wikipedia profile photo is a shot of him playing in the VFL. That doesn't say everything but it says something. </p><p>And c'mon Doggies, did you not learn anything from the Jade Rawlings years? You're on the way back up and you're going to have to take care of some of those kids pretty soon. Don't blow the budget too badly on this guy, no matter how badly Liam Jones needs a hand.</p><h2>The Jackson Awards not-entirely-logical team of the year</h2><p>The key is in the title. I will offer no justifications for these selections except to say that this is a collection of my favourite players of the year, picked roughly \"in position\". </p><p>And yes, I think Steven Morris and Jack Steven are that good.</p><p><strong>Backs:</strong> Alex Rance, Scott Thompson, Steven Morris<br /><strong>Half-Backs:</strong> Corey Enright, Harry Taylor, Sam Mitchell<br /><strong>Centre: </strong>Nathan Fyfe, Joel Selwood, Kieren Jack<br /><strong>Half-Forwards:</strong> Daniel Hannebery, Jarryd Roughead, Steve Johnson<br /><strong>Forwards:</strong> Michael Walters, Jeremy Cameron, Lindsay Thomas<br /><strong>Followers:</strong> Will Minson, Gary Ablett Jr (c), Patrick Dangerfield<br /><strong>Interchange:</strong> Ryan Crowley, Scott Pendlebury, Jarrad McVeigh, Jack Steven<br /><strong>Coach:</strong> Ken Hinkley</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418695031|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|a4ef2880fbbadedf01f1efd1b2291b95b3c1c6a1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Fremantle defender Luke McPharlin admits his team-mates are still numb following Saturday's grand final defeat to Hawthorn.</p><p>The Dockers returned to a heroes' welcome in Perth on Sunday, with around 2,000 fans turning up to the club's family day at Patersons Stadium.</p><p>However, McPharlin and skipper Matthew Pavlich will both be 32 by the start of next season, while ruckman Aaron Sandilands will be 31. All three will play on in 2014, but it might be their final shot at a premiership.</p><p>Although Fremantle have already been installed as premiership favourites for next year, McPharlin said it didn't mean too much.</p><p>\"Unfortunately it's such a ruthless game, there's no guarantees. There's no guarantee we'll be there next year,\" McPharlin said on Monday. \"To participate in a grand final was a tremendous effort by this football club. But to not come away with the ultimate prize was disappointing.</p><p>\"Guys were pretty exhausted from the weekend and all the emotion that surrounds participating in a grand final.Overwhelmingly, it's just a sense of numbness and disappointment.\"</p><p>The Dockers were left to rue a wasteful first half in which they kicked 1.6 and had several other shots sail out on the full.</p><p>Fremantle closed to within three points in the third quarter, but Hawthorn stepped up a gear in the final term to secure their 11th premiership.</p><p>\"A lot of the basics went wrong for us – dropped marks, missed shots etc,\" McPharlin said of the 15-point loss. \"We'll rue a lot of those missed opportunities, particularly in front of goal. I'm sure they'll haunt us a bit over the summer but we'll come back in pre-season, get to work, and work to improve and grow.\"</p><p>Fremantle have emerged as an AFL heavyweight under coach Ross Lyon. And although the club managed to reach their first grand final this season, McPharlin said there was a strong resolve amongst the group to improve even further.</p><p>\"Nothing to celebrate here. We'll get together and reflect on a season where we worked very hard, but ultimately missed out,\" he said. \"Over the year and even in the grand final, our effort to continually fight, never give in - that's been a hallmark of this football club for 18 months to two years but we need to work on some skills under pressure.\"</p><p>McPharlin said it was nice to see a defender win the Norm Smith medal, but he wished it hadn't have been a player from a rival team.<br />\"I'm thrilled for Brian Lake. It's great to see a defender get up and win,\" McPharlin said. \"He played a tremendous game, but I wish he hadn't. He was stopping a lot of our thrusts forward, and rolling off and taking those contested marks, particularly late in the game.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418599936|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|b47115a9d0a9aa3b71d3fe05ae5d4043381f5676 -->",

He spoke to other clubs, but his last option fell through on Sunday when Brisbane announced they would not consider signing him.</p><p>\"We have always considered Dustin a required player at Richmond, and we are pleased he has re-committed to the club,\" Richmond's football manager Dan Richardson said on Monday. \"We have been encouraged by the way Dustin has developed as a footballer, and a person, in his time at Richmond.</p><p>\"We now look forward to Dustin having another strong pre-season and continuing his improvement in 2014 and beyond.\"</p><p>Martin has played 86 games since his 2010 debut and polled 16 votes in this year's Brownlow Medal.</p><p>\"I want to thank Richmond and our supporters for being so patient during these negotiations,\" Martin said in the club statement. \"My family and I are grateful for the manner in which [manager] Ralph Carr has represented me.</p><p>\"I am now looking forward to doing everything possible to help the club and my teammates have the success we all crave.\"</p><p>Martin was ranked second in the AFL for score involvement behind Collingwood star Dane Swan.</p><p>He was first at Richmond for kicks and uncontested possessions and second for total disposals. Martin kicked 23 goals, his third-straight season of 20 or more.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418597401|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|c1119b5fcf7f3ff6bfa665a21b2d12420beb64c3 -->",

We think that is outrageous,\" he said. \"It sounds a bit hollow to us to come along and say we need a bit more time.\"</p><p>Mr Dunn said the material was important because the officers under investigation for the initial handling of the case would be witnesses in the case.<br />Magistrate Peter Reardon gave police more time to go through the material, with the matter to return to court on 21 October.</p><p>He also ordered that copies of a never-aired interview the complainant did in 2004 with Fairfax Radio, shortly after the alleged rape, be distributed to the defence and prosecution, after the woman gave her consent.</p><p>Milne, 33, is charged with four counts of rape for allegedly raping a woman at a Highett home, in Melbourne's south-east, on 15 March 2004, two days after St Kilda won the AFL pre-season grand final.</p><p>He retired from the AFL when St Kilda's season ended at the start of this month.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418596566|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|2ff6103424bbe9dfc8f55e971117819a4e44658d -->",

        "headline":"AFL grand final: Hawthorn jubilant after downing Fremantle Dockers",
        "body":"<p>Hawthorn overcame a spirited fightback from Fremantle to win their 11th Premiership in front of 100,007 spectators at the MCG. The Hawks led all day in the low-scoring game but could only breathe easy in the final moments as Ross Lyon's men continued to claw their way back into the contest. The Dockers had never played in front of such an imposing crowd before and the novelty didn't prove a pleasant one, going down by 15 points.</p><p>In contrast to their surprise win in 2008, which came on the back of a homegrown crop of youngsters come good, the Hawks brigade of recycled veterans and big-name recruits pushed them over the line this time. Former Bulldog Brian Lake won the Norm Smith for the best player on field for his stoic performance in defence, repelling and rebounding Fremantle forward thrusts. Alongside him David Hale and Josh Gibson repaid the faith the Hawks had given them in spades, also tasting premiership success for the first time. Gibson led the club in one-percenters this year and between he and Lake, so many of those acts added up to something significant on the day. </p><p>The Hawks jumped to an early lead when Jack Gunston got on the end of a Bradley Hill pass to open Hawthorn's account, one of four goals for the Crow turned Hawk. With respect to Jarryd Roughead who roamed all over, Gunston proved to be the only consistently threatening forward on the day as Lance Franklin was kept quiet.</p><p> It was a jittery start for the Dockers with midfield star Nat Fyfe spraying two early chances out on the full and turnovers occurring with even greater regularity. Fyfe was not alone, Hayden Ballantyne spurning plenty of gettable chances throughout the day. Much like the Hawks a year prior, Freo's wastefulness in front of goal proved costly in the end.</p><p>And that was when they could get their hands on it. The Hawks two-goal quarter time lead was perhaps less than they would have wished given their early dominance. Franklin's only goal came as a result of Luke McPharlin overstepping the Hawk's mark from outside 50, a gift that was symptomatic of Freo's day; a failure to exert their normal stifling pressure had them playing catch-up for the entire match. By the end of the first term the Hawks had racked up 71 uncontested possessions and led the tackle count 18-11, a far cry from Freo's clamp-down on Sydney in the first half of last week's preliminary final.</p><p>When liverwire forward Cyril Rioli brought Lee Spurr down in a desperate tackle and converted from 15 metres out at the seven minute mark of the third term, the standard had been set for the Hawks. Rioli's rabid intensity never let up all day, and his performance led a string of redemption tales from Hawthorn's heartbreak of 2012. In contrast to the sure-footed Hawks, the first-time grand finalists fumbled and turned the ball over regularly. It was less a case of big-game nerves and more a case of failing to execute the basics they had got so right otherwise in 2013. The Hawks led by 22 at the main break.</p><p>When the Fremantle skipper Matthew Pavlich (three goals) opened the second half scoring barely a minute in, he had cut the Hawks buffer back to 17 points, but as was often the case throughout, Hawthorn immediately countered through Roughead, who was in the thick of the action throughout. The Dockers remained hungry though and one couldn't fault their application in pegging the lead back as close as three points before the Hawks took a 10-point safety net to the final break.</p><p>In that final term Lyon's team remained a distant threat as late as the last five minutes, but Hawthorn were served well by the late run of Isaac Smith, whose booming goal from outside 50 was the first blow of an absorbing, if not thrilling final stanza. Like Rioli, Smith made up for an anonymous showing in last year's decider. For the Dockers, David Mundy was tireless but for everything that he and his team-mates threw at the Hawks, there was always an answer. Hawthorn were more desperate, more precise and in the final analysis, able to hit the scoreboard when it mattered.</p><p>The Dockers may have been miserly in defence this year, but it was Lyon's failure again to produce a winning score in a grand final that proved their downfall. Doubts will remain as to whether his methods are premiership-winning ones, as harsh as that assessment may be for the hard-nosed tactician. </p><p>For the Hawks, success this year was built on the ability to spread the load. Besides Lake's heart-warming best-on-ground showing, the honours were spread evenly amongst a mature, consistent line-up. Captain Luke Hodge was as stout as ever and Sam Mitchell did well for a nil-all draw with super-tagger Ryan Crowley. The day's biggest jeer was reserved for the pantomime villain when he was brought down from behind running into goal in the final minutes. It was that kind of day for Fremantle.</p><p>Fremantle is a city that rests on hills of limestone, but this football team has not reached its current form through the mere shifting of tides and seasons. It has been chiseled into a bold and fearsome shape, created in the image of its coach. Today they were washed away and Lyon could only look on as Alastair Clarkson embraced fellow Hawks premiership coach John Kennedy in a moment only the two of them could truly grasp in significance. Lyon now heads back to the drawing board to find another way to edge over the line and understand that sweet feeling. Close enough has not been good enough thus far.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418515195|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|b7291aee8973706de22ef972a4bf481324fcc87e -->",

From my point of view, it's disappointing not to be coaching next year.</p><p>\"But I should've known what was going on. I should've done more and I'm very disappointed that I didn't.\"</p><p>Hird denied that by accepting the penalties, he conceded that he did break the rules.</p><p>\"I didn't break the rules that I was charged with. Those charges have been dropped,\" he said.</p><p>Asked what he was guilty of, Hird replied: \"There's a level of responsibility you have as a senior coach. A senior coach is responsible for a lot of things at a football club.</p><p>\"There's things that went on at our football club that shouldn't have happened last year and as senior coach I have to take some responsibility for what happened and not doing more to stop it.\"</p><p>Hird confirmed he had dropped his supreme court action against the AFL – launched last week after the AFL released its charge sheet against Essendon and four club officials, including him – because he believed it was \"time to move on\".</p><p>\"I think it wasn't good for anyone in our game, particularly our players and our club,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our players need to be able to go and play football and move on. Fighting a battle in the supreme court against the AFL on a matter of principle, I think, was probably not the right thing to do for our players and even for myself and my family. It's time to move on.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415962619|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|830d947afb14a7cb3006d45312e0f7258333c95e -->",
