The issue at a glance</h2><p>The cardinals of the Catholic church are gathering in Rome this month to select a successor to Benedict XVI as leader of the world's 1.2bn Catholics.</p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"102\"></a></p><h2>2. A brief history<br /></h2><p>Last month Pope Benedict stunned the world when he became the first pope to resign voluntarily from the job after he had freely accepted it eight years ago. Before him, Pope Celestine IV had resigned in 1294 after five months – but he had never wanted the job and had to be forced into accepting it. </p><p>In 1415, Pope Gregory XII resigned to end a schism, at the same time as the anti-pope, John XXIII, so that a new candidate could be elected to replace them both. But all the other 261 popes died in office, so far as we know, and it was widely believed that no pope could resign.</p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"103\"></a></p><h2>3. What happens next?</h2><p>The cardinals assemble in Rome and formally discuss when to hold the conclave: the gathering of cardinals aged under 80 who will elect the next pope from among their number. Informally, this week is spent sounding out opinion and deciding what  are the most urgent tasks facing the candidates. This is one of the most important parts of the process and although it is surrounded by rumour, it is nearly as secretive as the election itself.</p><p>The election place in the Sistine chapel, beneath Michelangelo's glorious frescoes. It is in fact one of the most democratic forms of election known, however authoritarian and undemocratic the organisation is otherwise. <br />The 115 cardinals who will vote this time are locked in (the word conclave comes from the Latin <em>cum clave</em>, meaning \"with a key\") until they reach a decision. They are allowed to sleep in special apartments, and to shower but these are modern innovations.</p><p>The cardinals ballot repeatedly and secretly – each cardinal writes the name of his favoured candidate on a slip of paper, preferably in a disguised hand, and folds it so it is invisible before the votes are reckoned. The winning candidate must get two-thirds of the votes – 77 cardinals this time around – and the process continues until this majority is attained. After each round of voting, the ballots are burned, and additives are put in with the smoke to ensure it comes up black (no agreement has been reached) or white (we have a pope!).</p><p>The winner is asked if he will accept the post. If he does he is taken to a side room where three different sizes of vestments have already been prepared, for small, medium and large pontiffs. He is then taken out on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica and presented to the waiting crowds under a name he has chosen. </p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"104\"></a></p><h2>4. The options – and key arguments<br /></h2><p>Although all of the cardinal electors have been chosen under the last two popes, and are therefore regarded as conservatives, there is real doubt as to whether the conservative line of the last two papacies can continue. Key decisions must be made about clerical celibacy, about the reform and cleanup of the Vatican culture, about how to reach the cultures of the developed world from which the church seems increasingly estranged, and about how to manage relations with other religions, especially Islam. The first three of these are generally agreed to be the most urgent but whether there is any wish for real change is not at all clear.</p><p>The obvious question is whether the pope should once more be a European, after a Pole and a German interrupted a sequence of Italians that had lasted 455 years. There are Italian candidates this time around, too, but much of the excitement comes from the idea of a pope from the developing world.</p><p><strong>Should he be an African?</strong> The two lead candidates from that continent, Cardinal Turkson of Ghana and Cardinal Sarah of Guinea, lack experience. Turkson is further handicapped by the appearance of having campaigned for the post. But there is a lot of excitement about him among the bookmakers.</p><p><strong>Should the next pope be a native Spanish speaker?</strong> There are some impressive candidates from Latin America and the Philippines and the church is growing in both these parts of the world, as it is in Africa. The names to watch here are Cardinal Sandri of Argentina, Cardinal Maradiaga of Honduras and Cardinal Scherer of Brazil (Portuguese is close enough, in this context).</p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"105\"></a></p><h2>5. What does it mean for me?<br /></h2><p><strong>If you're a cardinal:</strong> This is almost certainly your last chance at the really big job. It is generally agreed that the new pope must be a man of remarkable energy and is for that reason likely to be relatively young – under 70 at least. That would give him five to 10 years in office at full strength, and by that time almost all the present electors will be over 70 themselves.</p><p><strong>If you're a priest:</strong> The man who is chosen will have huge power over your life, should he choose to exercise it. His policies will determine who your bishop is, what your chances are of promotion, and whether you may marry or be open about your sexuality. He will determine just what you can hope to say in public and keep your job or be promoted.</p><p><strong>If you're a lay Catholic:</strong> Surprisingly little will change. The pope may inspire or disappoint you, but he will have very little power over your life unless you live in the Vatican city. But you will still see him as one of the most significant of all world leaders.</p><p><strong>If you're not a Catholic:</strong> There are 80 countries around the world with Catholic populations of more than a million, so the pope will have some influence almost everywhere in the world. Certainly, in an age of global celebrity, there is no one who can draw crowds as a pope does. That is not to say that his teachings are widely followed</p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"106\"></a></p><h2>6.

Now 85, he served as a Vatican diplomat for many years, and then as secretary of state (essentially the pope's chief of staff) under John Paul II and Benedict XVI until his retirement at 80. He was implicated as one of the protectors of the disgraced founder of a religious order, Fr Marciel Maciel, whose voracious sexual appetites went unnoticed in the Vatican during all the years his order, the Legionnaries of Christ, were major fundraisers; and accused by Cardinal Schönborn of Vienna of protecting the disgraced Austrian archbishop Hans Hermann Groër.</p><p><strong>The papabile</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513290'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503994403/Cardinal-for-Pope-Italian-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Italian Cardinal Scola' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Max Rossi/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Angelo Scola:</strong> The son of a truck driver, Scola holds doctorates in philosophy and theology and was professor of theological anthropology at the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family. He was appointed bishop of Grosseto in 1991, patriarch of Venice in 2002, created a cardinal in 2003, and appointed archbishop of Milan in 2011. In spite of his place at the top of the Vatican hierarchy and his academic pedigree, he has urged the church to do more to appeal to the modern world, arguing it needs to build on the second Vatican Council of the 1960s, which proved a landmark moment in Roman Catholic history. An ardent believer in the church's role at the centre of society, Scola has publicly bemoaned its inability to clearly communicate its message on matters such as marriage. He is strongly tipped to replace Benedict.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513291'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503967583/Cardinal-for-Pope-Ghanean-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Ghanean cardinal Peter Turkson' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Peter Turkson:</strong> The archbishop emeritus of Cape Coast is seen by many as a strong contender to be the next pope. However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/13/catholic-church-pope-ghanaian-cardinal\">some feel he has been a little too keen to signal his willingness to serve</a>. A few days after Benedict announced his resignation, Turkson said: \"I think in a way the church is always and has forever been ready for a non-European pope\". Asked about speculation that he could himself emerge from the conclave as Benedict's successor, he said: \"I've always answered, 'If it's the will of God.'\"</p><p>He has alienated himself from more liberal Catholics by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/peter-turkson-gay-priests-to-blame-for-child-sex-abuse_n_2724241.html\" title=\"\">suggesting that the African church has been spared the sexual abuse scandals</a> that have afflicted its European and US counterparts because of the strong African cultural taboos against homosexuality. Turkson was at the centre of controversy in October 2012 for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/vatican-distance-muslim-demographics-video\">showing an alarmist film at a synod, which claimed that France would be an Islamic republic in 39 years</a>. He was created a cardinal by John Paul II on 21 October 2003.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513292'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503840004/Cardinal-for-Pope-Brazili-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Brazilian cardinal Odilo Scherer arrives' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Odilo Scherer: </strong> Appointed archbishop of São Paulo in March 2007, Scherer was created a cardinal by Benedict just eight months later. Although he is tipped as a possible papal candidate, his low profile among other cardinals may be problematic. Leading the archdiocese of São Paulo (one of the largest with 6 million members) means Scherer has had to demonstrate his strengths and skills. He claimed in February 2013 that \"it's time to have someone from a different culture, someone with new ideas\". The cardinal is outspoken on abortion: when Brazil's supreme court voted in 2012 to legalise the termination of foetuses with malformed brains, Scherer asked which group \"incompatible with life\" would be eliminated next.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513293'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362504269341/Cardinal-for-Pope--Cardin-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: : Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga</strong><br />The multilingual cardinal holds a doctorate in theology and a diploma in clinical psychology and psychotherapy. He has taught chemistry, physics and music and was professor of moral theology and ecclesiology at the Salesian Theological Institute. He became archbishop of Tegucigalpa in January 1993. Regarded as a moderate, Rodríguez Maradiaga is viewed as a rising star of the church. An ardent defender of human rights and a powerful voice in the global fight against poverty, he was the Vatican's spokesman with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the issue of third world debt. He was created a cardinal by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513294'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503869446/Cardinal-for-Pope-Argenti-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Leonardo Sandri:</strong> Like many Argentinians, the grand chancellor of the Pontifical Oriental Institute is of Italian descent (his parents emigrated to South America from Trentino) – a fact that is unlikely to harm his chances of succeeding Benedict. Sandri, who speaks five languages and has represented the Vatican in the US, Venezuela and Mexico, served as the voice of John Paul II when Parkinson's disease left the pontiff unable to do so. He also announced John Paul's death in 2005. But despite being head of the congregation of Oriental churches – which makes him responsible for Catholics in Bethlehem and elsewhere in the Holy Land – some have noted that Sandri's star has been waning and his current role is less influential than the positions he occupied under John Paul. He was created a cardinal by Benedict XVI on 24 November 2007.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513295'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362504088807/Cardinal-for-Pope-Filipin-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Filipino cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Galazka/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle:</strong> Appointed as archbishop of Manila in 2011, Tagle has been hailed by some as a worthy successor. The cardinal's youth – he is the second youngest of the cardinals after Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal – coupled with his detailed knowledge of Vatican history, his charisma and his progressive outlook, make him a strong candidate. If successful, he would be the first Asian pope. Tagle, however, has been outspoken at times. In Rome in October 2012, he told a gathering of bishops that the church should be more ready to admit its mistakes and has been connected to the \"Bologna xchool\" of progressive academics who have taken a liberal view of the second Vatican Council. He was created a cardinal by Benedict XVI on 24 November 2012.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513296'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503911411/Cardinal-for-Pope--Cardin-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope:  Cardinal Christoph Schonborn' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Massimo Valicchia/Demotix/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Christoph Schönborn:</strong> The archbishop of Vienna is considered one of the forerunners for the papacy. In addition to being a polyglot (as well as German he speaks French, Italian, English, Spanish and Latin fluently) his education in theology, philosophy and psychology may stand him in good stead for success. His public stance has been more moderate on issues such as HIV/Aids than some of the other candidates. The cardinal has also gained respect for his handling of the sex abuse scandal, stating: \"The days of cover-up are over. For a long while the church's principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims\". He was created a cardinal by John Paul II on 21 February 1998.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405513297'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/5/1362503707164/Cardinal-for-Pope-Cardina-002.jpg' alt='Cardinal for Pope: Cardinal Marc Ouellet' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Marc Ouellet:</strong> Ouellet was named titular bishop of Agropoli and secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in March 2001 and was ordained a bishop by John Paul II in the same month. A year later he was appointed metropolitan archbishop of Quebec and in 2010 he was nominated prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Tipped as a strong candidate for pope, the cardinal caused controversy when, in 2010, he told an anti-abortion conference that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/30/pope-abortion-cardinal-marc-ouellet\">terminating a pregnancy was a \"moral crime\" even in rape cases</a>. He has also testified before the Canadian senate, urging legislators to vote against legalising gay unions, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/15/marc-ouellet-pope-prospect\">which he described as \"pseudo-marriage, a fiction\"</a>.

The cardinal, who studied in Guinea, Ivory Coast and Rome, is the president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, which oversees the church's humanitarian aid. In 2010, he dismissed Muammar Gaddafi's call for Europe to convert to Islam, describing it as an \"unsolicited provocation lacking seriousness\", but adding that the true danger for Europeans was \"relativism, the lack of attention to faith, the weakness of religion, indifference to the sacred\".

The documents showed that Mahony and his former top aide, Thomas Curry, both worked to send priests accused of abuse out of the state to shield them from scrutiny. He has ignored demands not to attend the conclave, tweeting last week: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CardinalMahony/status/305080799634526208\" title=\"\">\"Just a few short hours before my departure for Rome.

Glossary</h2><p><strong>Papabile:</strong> Literally \"pope-able\", this is the Italian word used to describe serious candidates for the job, who might last through the first five ballots at least.</p><p><strong>Conclave:</strong> The gathering of cardinals which will actually elect the pope.

FAQ</h2><p><strong>Could they choose a woman?</strong><br />No, but it is a little known fact that a woman could be appointed a cardinal. Although Pope John Paul II did his best to define as almost infallible his opinion that a woman could never become a priest, there is no requirement for a cardinal to be a bishop, a priest or even a deacon, although they have in practice always been. So a thoroughly reformist pope could always make a few nuns cardinals in time to help choose his successor.</p><p><strong>Could he end the celibate priesthood?<br /></strong>In a word, yes. But it would require widespread consultation, and the results would be messy. The reform most often proposed is to allow the ordination of already married men, but not to allow priests already ordained to marry. This has caused tensions in England and Wales, where married Anglicans have been taken into the Catholic priesthood.</p><p><strong>Is the pope really infallible?<br /></strong>Hardly ever: popes have made infallible pronouncements twice since the doctrine was defined in 1870, and both times on questions that have no earthly answer, concerning the eternal nature of the Virgin Mary. On all other questions, popes may turn out to be wrong, after several centuries of consideration, which is probably just as well.</p><p><strong>Who is going to win, then?<br /></strong>No one knows, the bookies probably least of all. Even the opinion of the Guardian is not infallible in this context, but it would be surprising if the name were not one of those on our list.</p><p><a href=\"#Study the\">• Back to the top</a></p><p><a name=\"109\"></a></p><h2>9.

        "body":"<h2><strong>Raymond Anoliefo, a priest in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos</strong></h2><p>I would expect the new Holy Father to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors and hold on to the basic doctrines of the church. I would like to see the him look into the church in Africa properly, because it's very vibrant and growing.</p><p>I doubt any pope will want to make any doctrinal changes in the core issues like gay marriage, abortion and contraception. Of course, he shouldn't. Personally I believe the stricter the better so that we all can sit up. Liberalism in the secular world is gradually eating into the church.</p><p>The church shouldn't be trying to follow what's trending in the world, but rather should lead the world. Things like abortion: of course women have a choice but some fail to realise any child given to a woman by God has to be protected. Instead [those who abort] are killing the child.</p><p>In Africa homosexuality is becoming a problem because of cultural contact. We need the same gospel with a fresh outlook so that the 21st-century Christian can better appreciate God without distorting the original message of Christ. There is talk that priests should start getting married – these aren't the solutions. Marriage can't be seen as a leeway because even marrying one woman isn't a guarantee you will be faithful. It is about faith.</p><p>It's a delicate issue but in the final analysis, condoms are against life. In our parents' days people were proud to be virgins, to be pure and chaste. If you start debating condoms then people will start talking about sterilisation next. Masturbation, lesbianism, homosexuality, extramarital sex is bad enough. Using condoms is to double the sin on top of that. Jesus didn't find everything easy, we ourselves should be willing to make sacrifices.</p><p>I think the new Holy Father also needs to bring fresh emphasis to the gospel's words on the downtrodden. The Catholic church says we are all children of God and you have to talk about morality, corruption and poverty.</p><h2><br /><strong>Sister Florence Deacon, president of the US-based Leadership Conference of Women Religious and director of the Congregation Sisters of St Francis of Assisi </strong><br /></h2><p>We hope that the new pope has personal experience with a variety of women religious [nuns and sisters] and understands that out of their deep love of the church they faithfully took the mandate of the Second Vatican council to renew consecrated life in response to the prompting of the spirit, the gospel of Jesus and lived experience.</p><p>During Pope Benedict's term there have been two investigations of women religious in the United States. We hope that the new pope will be open to dialogue with women religious, and will seek out the counsel of women, including women religious, both informally and by creating new structures to ensure it happens. Perhaps the pope could meet with representative leaders of women's congregations in small groups on a rotating basis according to geographic regions so they could get to know each other and build a climate of trust, then to share common concerns, hopes and dreams for the church.</p><p>For the first time in the United States and possibly other countries, more young women than young men are leaving the Catholic church. Although many report that they value spirituality, they don't see a place for themselves in Catholicism. Listening to the voices of women and appointing significant numbers of qualified women to responsible positions in the universal church would give them hope.</p><p>In his teaching, Jesus drew on the lived experiences of lepers, breadmakers, Samaritans, farmers, widows, tax collectors and housewives. He counted a very diverse group among his close friends and disciples. Who are the marginalised that the church needs to reach out to today? By walking in these footprints of Jesus, church leaders would begin to bridge the disconnect many faithful feel with the church.</p><h2><br /><strong>Father Franklin d'Souza, national youth director for the Indian Catholic Youth Movement, New Delhi </strong><br /></h2><p>I hope we get a pope who can lead the church. What I feel is that the church has its own duties and all the cardinals are waiting for the intervention of the holy spirit. We are all from different nationalities, cultures, languages, traditions but united in fate. What I also feel is that for 2000 years the church has stood not on human strength but on the strength of God. And it is clear that Jesus himself is the supreme pastor who leads the church. I hope in the conclave God will bless a pope after his heart. One who can uphold the divine law.</p><p>These are modern times and there are various challenges, like technology, communications, that the old guard faces. We need to communicate to everybody and have dialogue with every other religion and we can't be isolated, but must maintain a relationship with the statesmen of various countries and keep up the human values which are preached by Jesus: love, peace, truth, joy.</p><p>From whichever nationality or country the pope comes, really doesn't matter, whether he is European, or from the developing or developed world. He should just be one who understands the hearts and minds of people, nations.</p><p>Always the church reads the signs of the times and reacts accordingly.</p><p>But it should not be labelled under conservative or liberal. This doesn't matter. As long as he [the new pope] reads the signs of the times and leads the church with truth.</p><h2>Father Dominic d'Breo, spokesman, Catholic Bishops Conference of India.</h2><p>This is one of the most important events to be held by the church for a very long time. One-hundred-and-fifteen cardinals have gathered in the Vatican. We are very happy and eagerly await the new pope. The pope who has just resigned as head has so beautifully mentioned that he resigned because of his advanced age and the demands of the world, which he found difficult to cope with. He felt the need for a new and younger pope to take over. Surely he has given this as an opportunity to appoint a new and more dynamic pope.</p><p>One important tradition that the church has been following is the intervention of the holy spirit to guide the cardinals at the conclave to appoint a pope who is fit for the coming years. So the cardinals are having a congregation meeting, discussing the challenges and the state of the church, and so it is sure they will be guided by the holy spirit to choose an apt candidate.</p><p>There are so many problems in present times, of the secular world and otherwise, we cannot just say we want a conservative or a liberal for a pope. We require a pope who is just the right mix of all – liberal, conservative and so on – someone who can follow the traditions but also be able to put in perspective the modern and make sense of it. We have all been trained to take up the challenges of the real world and blend it with the traditional.</p><h2><br /><strong>Theresa Lang, 22, Chinese documentary film-maker </strong><br /></h2><p>In China, this type of thing is pretty sensitive. In general, other countries' bishops are approved by the pope, but in China, the Communist party appoints its own bishops.</p><p>[The Chinese government] doesn't want to have any interference from the Vatican, so in official churches, people don't talk about this much. Chinese priests will say let's pray for the pope, things like that, but they don't say very much about him.</p><p>In my church, there are two different groups. One is older people – they're usually more influenced by the country. Like my grandma and grandpa, they don't think that the Communist party is harmful for Catholics in China. Younger Catholics, though, we think that this is unacceptable. We don't accept the bishops that China appoints.</p><p>We all hope that the new pope can improve relations with China, but the Chinese government definitely won't change any of its policies about Catholic things – I don't think they will ever change them, though I wish they would.</p><p>Personally, I hope the next pope can be more transparent, that he'll improve corruption in the church and change what the church is doing in Africa. Most Chinese people don't have much faith, and they think the church is a very dark organisation, that it's very mysterious. I hope the pope can fix that, too.</p><h2><br /><strong>Jesús Sánchez, 86, priest and professor of canon law at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro </strong><br /></h2><p>First and foremost the pope should be a man of faith. Someone who lives united with God through the power of prayer. With this spiritual experience he should have the strength to face the many problems that he will have to deal with.</p><p>But at the same time, he must be a man with a wide cultural knowledge who is able to speak to the world about contemporary issues. To handle the administration of the Catholic church, which is very complex and unique, he needs to have not only pastoral experience, but also administrative skills. Beyond everything, he should be a man with a compassionate heart, with the capability to offer mercy and forgiveness.</p><p>The region is absolutely secondary. To be Catholic is to encompass the whole of humanity. As St Paul said, there is no distinction between people by their origins.</p><p>There isn't an ideal age. I would say that he should be between 70 and 75 years old.</p><p>It would be good if he had the communication capability of João Paulo II and the deeper theological skills of Bento XVI. It would also be good if he had the energy of the first and the sweetness of the second.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it is necessary to show the nation that religion is not disconnected from everyday life. In the mist of growing secularisation, the church should advertise and defend Christian values in the family, at work, at school, in factories or workshops.</p><p>Bento XVI broached this issue by creating the Pontifical Council for Evangelisation. The new pope should encourage and support these initiatives.</p><h2><strong>Analia Canessa, 49, a bank clerk in Buenos Aires, who visits the Metropolitan cathedral every day</strong><br /></h2><p>I'd like to see a pope like Mother Teresa, someone who lives in the real world and can connect with people. We need a pope who sees what is going on and feels a profound concern for social issues. Pope Jean Paul II was like that, but in recent years there has been some distance. That is why I appeal for a pope with a humanistic view of the world.</p><p>If we don't have that then more people will leave the church. In Argentina that is already happening. Many of my friends have recently given up Catholicism and taken up other religions.</p><p>Some people say that the next pope might be from South America. With Europe in the midst of an economic and social crisis, I think they are looking for alternatives for many things, but I don't know the candidates they mention. That's the problem. So I think they will pay more attention to other parts of the world.</p><p>There is even talk that he might come from Argentina, from this cathedral even, but I do not know the candidates that they mention from here. That is the problem. I have great faith and I come to this cathedral every day, but people high up in the church do not connect with the people.</p><p>In the end, the important thing is not where the pope is from or how old he is, but what he thinks and what he does.</p><h2><strong>Oscar Cruz, former archbishop of Lingayen-Dagupan in Pangasinan, Philippines</strong><br /></h2><p><em>Was a member of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) with Luis Antonio Tagle, the most senior Fillipino cardinal.</em></p><p>I personally would want the new pope to bring the Catholic church back to the people who have abandoned her and who have also become cold in their Catholic faith. In other words, a pope who would be able to enliven the Catholic faith again and to make more people appreciate the Catholic church. This problem of sexual misbehaviour by some priests and brothers should be addressed – and addressed fast and addressed well.</p><p>From my personal knowledge of Tagle, and I would like to think I know him rather well because we were together for more than five years working together in different concentrations, I can say without an iota of doubt that he is intelligent, humble and kind. But do I think he will be elected pope? Human intervention is not [that] which eventually triumphs in this exercise: the hand of God is there too – it is unexplainable but it is there.</p><p>Before he resigned from office, Benedict XVI issued an apostolic letter calling for the \"year of faith\". The time has come when it is not the sheep that go to the shepherd, but the shepherd who goes to the sheep. Every time Pope John Paul II came to this country – and he came to the Philippines twice – he left more Catholic than before. So it is my thinking that a younger father will be elected pope, someone similar to John Paul II, who will go around the world, like the shepherd meeting the sheep, to enliven the faith once again.\"</p><p><strong>What are your hopes for the new pope?

        "headline":"Cardinals to begin papal conclave with no obvious favourite",
        "body":"<p>The cardinals of the Roman Catholic church held their last meeting on Monday before the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/feb/19/pope-election-cardinals-sistine-vatican-interactive?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">conclave to elect the next pope</a> and used it to try to agree on the qualities they sought in the next leader of the world's 1.2 billion baptised Catholics.</p><p>Though two of their number – cardinals Angelo Scola of Italy and Odilo Scherer from Brazil –<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"> began as favourites</a>, all the signs were that the field was exceptionally open, and that the conclave could go on for longer than usual in recent times.</p><p>Pope Benedict, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/feb/11/pope-benedict-xvi-resigns-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">who resigned last month</a>, was chosen in 2005 in just four ballots. But the cardinals had had months, if not years, to discuss the succession during the protracted illness that led to the death of his predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/santopadre_biografie/giovanni_paolo_ii_biografia_breve_en.html\" title=\"\">John Paul II</a>.</p><p>This time, the leadership of the church has been caught off guard by Benedict's sensational departure – the first voluntary resignation of a pope for more than seven centuries.</p><p>The archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, pointed to another factor: \"Last time around, there was a man of stature three or four times that of any other cardinal.</p><p>\"That is not the case this time around. Therefore, the choice has to be made among one, two, three, four, a dozen candidates. We still don't really know anything. We will have to wait for the results of the first ballot.\"</p><p>Not all the cardinals who wanted to speak at Monday morning's 10th and final session of the preliminary discussions were able to do so, and a vote was taken on whether to hold a further session in the afternoon. It was decided to go straight to the conclave instead, but the episode highlighted the uncertainty that persists among many of the 115 cardinal-electors.</p><p>A Vatican spokesman said: \"The expectations of the new pope and his profile was a recurring theme\" in Monday's speeches. But the cardinals were also said to have discussed the Vatican bank whose president was <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-24/vatican-bank-chief-ousted-after-money-laundering-scandal.html\" title=\"\">sensationally dismissed</a> last year.</p><p>His removal was one in a long succession of controversies, scandals and gaffes that marked Benedict's troubled papacy. Some of the cardinals put the blame on the Roman Curia, the central administration of the church, and want a pope who can take a much firmer grip on its officials.</p><p>Scola, the archbishop of Milan, is seen by many as the man for the job, according to sources close to the deliberations. The same sources indicate Scherer, a Brazilian and member of the commission that oversees the Vatican bank, as the initial choice of the curial insiders.</p><p>If he were to be elected, he would be the first non-European pope for well over 1,000 years. Scola would be the first Italian pope since John Paul I who reigned for only 33 days in 1978.</p><p>Both factions, however, will have thought of substitutes in case neither man gains momentum in the early stages. Traditionally, favourites who fail to attract a substantial number of votes in the first couple of ballots are swiftly abandoned.</p><p>At that point, their backers can either transfer their support to a cardinal of similar outlook or, as happened in 2005, back a less controversial figure of deep spirituality.</p><p>Eight years ago, and lacking a fall-back, the liberals who had supported Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, are thought to have switched their allegiances to an Argentinian cardinal, Jorge Bergoglio.</p><p>On this occasion, various second-tier contenders have attracted attention. Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo, has been mentioned as an option for the curial faction. Péter Erdo, the archbishop of Budapest, would be an appealing alternative for the other side. The Vatican's chief theological watchdog, Marc Ouellet, remains a potential compromise candidate.</p><p>There are plenty of others to choose from. Some cardinals have signalled they are looking for someone to cut through the Catholic church's many problems with the offer of a vigorous, optimistic Christianity such as that radiated by New York's Timothy Dolan.</p><p>But a senior church source said: \"Dolan is just too brash to be acceptable to the Europeans.\" The traditional wisdom is that no US cardinal is <em>papabile</em> (literally pope-able) because it would mean aligning the world's biggest Christian denomination with its only superpower.</p><p>On this occasion, however, the virtues of Sean O'Malley, the bearded Capuchin friar who is archbishop of Boston, have been widely discussed. They include prodigious language skills and an impressively thorough approach to tackling the issue of clerical sex abuse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405393083|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|8d6d6d06e705879965aba60eda6c0490c29aeba7 -->",

        "headline":"Papal conclave: eight reasons why it's just like Big Brother",
        "body":"<p>If you're starting to feel as if this whole papal conclave thing seems a bit familiar, then relax. You have definitely seen it before. No, not in any of the previous papal conclaves that have taken place with the same rigid formality over the course of 800 years, but in an episode of Big Brother. They're basically the same thing.</p><p>Stick with me here. The similarities between the selection of the new pope and an average series of Big Brother are endless. In fact, without wanting to sound disrespectful in any way, there's a pretty good chance that, as we speak, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe of Naples is angrily interrupting a tops-off hot-tub party between Cardinal Telesphore Placidus Toppo of Ranchi and Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz of Warsaw to find out who put a fried egg in his knicker drawer. Need proof of these similarities?</p><h2>1 The format</h2><p>The key to the long-running success of both the papal conclave and Big Brother is the fascination with what happens to strangers when they spend long periods of time cooped up with each other. Admittedly the three months of Big Brother is a lot longer than the conclave, but the themes are roughly the same. Will they get along? Who will form alliances? Who'll be the first to get drunk and embarrass themselves? Will anyone fall in love?</p><h2>2 Outside communication</h2><p>Both Big Brother and the papal conclave are incredibly sensitive about contact with the outside world. As with Big Brother, the conclave attendees will be regularly checked for mobile phones and recording equipment. And little wonder. Nobody wants a repeat of that time Nasty Nick snuck a pencil in behind everyone's back. Talk about a nightmare.</p><h2>3 Contestants<br /></h2><p>Like the conclave, the Big Brother house tends to attract a certain type of person. In fact, if you're a slightly sinister eccentric with a fondness for silly clothes and an aggravated sense of self-worth, then you should get in touch with the Big Brother production team or the Roman Catholic church.</p><h2>4 Likely winners<br /></h2><p>As with Big Brother, guessing who'll win is a mug's game. Presumably the cardinals are all following the traditional Big Brother voting tactics – first getting rid of the mad ones, then the loud ones, then the ones who seem a bit slutty, then the ones who keep using too much margarine – before finally deciding to settle for the quiet one who nobody noticed until right before the end and doesn't really seem like they'd upset the apple cart very much.</p><h2>5 Set design<br /></h2><p>Admittedly the conclave has it a little grander here. The cardinals are being put up in comfortable guesthouse quarters inside the Vatican, with voting taking place beneath Michelangelo's fresco of the Last Judgment, whereas the Big Brother house basically tends to be a manky chipboard showhome that someone's daubed a load of eyes over – but at least the Big Brother housemates get to confess their sins in a diary room. Who are the cardinals going to confess to? The only person more important than them has just quit his job.</p><h2>6 Spin-off shows<br /></h2><p>Big Brother has Big Brother's Bit on the Side, presented by Emma Willis, while the conclave has every single news organisation on the face of the planet running an endless stream of interviews and speculation that could last up to a month. None of these organisations are thought to have signed up John McCririck to appear as a recurring pundit, though. This is undoubtedly their loss.</p><h2>7 Live streaming<br /></h2><p>Big Brother hasn't had round-the-clock streaming for years now, which is a disappointment for everyone who liked falling asleep watching night-vision footage of strangers falling asleep in real time. But in an act of unbelievable generosity, the conclave has a livestream this year. Admittedly it's a livestream of a chimney, and the most that's ever going to happen is that some smoke will eventually come out of it, but it's a start.</p><h2>8 The prize<br /></h2><p>And, of course, there are the riches afforded to the winner. Whoever becomes the new pope will find himself in a position of almost limitless power as the earthly head of the Roman Catholic church. He'll get to see the whole world, albeit behind a sheet of bulletproof glass, and 1.2 billion believers will hang upon his every word until the day he dies. But then again, the winner of Big Brother will probably release a fitness DVD and have a ghostwritten column in New magazine. It's hard to say which of these we should be more envious of.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405449985|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|1615d25cb24f7472194a5f46d3d55cb50879ec3c -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p>Roman Catholic cardinals have been urged to overcome divisions at a special mass ahead of the papal conclave, just hours after anti-mafia investigators carried out a string of raids in the diocese of the leading candidate.</p><p></p><p>In a homily before thousands of pilgrims and the most senior figures in the church, Angelo Sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, made a last-ditch attempt to banish infighting, as he extolled the virtues of unity amid diversity.</p><p>But even as preparations for the mass were being made, Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan – and reportedly the hot favourite to be the next pope – suffered a blow.</p><p></p><p>Anti-mafia detectives swooped on homes, offices, clinics and hospitals in Lombardy, the region around Milan, and elsewhere. A statement said the dawn raids were part of an investigation into \"corruption linked to tenders by, and supplies to, hospitals\".</p><p></p><p>Healthcare in Lombardy is the principal responsibility of the regional administration, which for the past 18 years has been run by Roberto Formigoni, a childhood friend of Scola and the leading political representative of the Communion and Liberation fellowship. Until recently, Scola was seen as the conservative group's most distinguished ecclesiastical spokesman.</p><p></p><p>But he has progressively loosened his ties to Communion and Liberation, and in early 2012 publicly rebuked the movement after its leader was found to have written to Pope Benedict, implicitly criticising the cardinal's liberal predecessors in the Milan archdiocese.</p><p></p><p>The regional administration headed by Formigoni – a member of Silvio Berlusconi's party – collapsed last October amid a welter of accusations regarding alleged corruption and misconduct. The final blow came when one of his regional ministers was arrested, accused of buying votes from the 'Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia.</p><p></p><p>Formigoni himself is a formal suspect in an investigation into corruption and conspiracy. He denies the accusations.</p><p></p><p>Among those arrested on Tuesday was Massimo Guarischi, who in 2009 was given a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of conspiracy and auction-rigging. Guarischi is said to have organised expensive holidays for Formigoni that are central to the investigation into the former governor's affairs.</p><p></p><p>Scola, who has headed the Milan archdiocese since 2011, is regarded as the champion of a largely non-Italian faction that is challenging the entrenched power of the Vatican cardinals. He was close to the last pope, whose household was run by women members of Communion and Liberation.</p><p>He entered the conclave as  favourite after the Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported that his supporters were confident he had the support of up to 50 of the 115 cardinal-electors.</p><p></p><p>But Scola's candidacy has been overshadowed by his past links to a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324096404578354741017241014.html\" title=\"\">movement that has been linked with pervasive sleaze in Lombardy</a>. By the time Formigoni dissolved the regional assembly last year, 13 members of the governing majority were under investigation, suspected of offences ranging from taking bribes to incitement to violence.</p><p></p><p>Formigoni belongs to the Memores Domini, a core group of Communion and Liberation members pledged to live by the values of fraternal love, obedience and poverty.</p><p></p><p>At the pre-conclave mass in St Peter's basilica in Rome, Sodano called on the faithful and electors to overcome divisions and unite behind the next pope.</p><p></p><p>\"Each of us is&nbsp;… called to co-operate with the successor of Peter, the visible foundation of such an ecclesial unity,\" he said, quoting St Paul's letter to the Ephesians.</p><p></p><p>The basilica erupted in applause when Sodano, who is 85 and therefore not eligible to vote in the conclave, paid tribute to the \"brilliant\" leadership of Benedict XVI.</p><p></p><p>\"At the same time today, we implore the Lord, that through the pastoral solicitude of the cardinal fathers, he may soon grant another good shepherd to his holy church,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>In his homily, Sodano, who is seen as representing the \"old guard\" of the Vatican, stressed the pastoral and charitable role of the papacy, amid warnings from many that Benedict's successor should primarily be a good manager capable of reforming the troubled Roman curia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405427341|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|ccee4e27594cf56f9d79fdd7caa5b0a42e12a547 -->",

        "headline":"Cardinal candidates: how we scored the men who would be pope",
        "body":"<p>Judgments such as \"conservative\", \"moderate\" and ultra-conservative\" are not very nuanced. It's safe to assume that an \"ultra-conservative\" would change nothing if he had the choice, and that a \"conservative\" will change as little as possible. But these categories do not map easily onto the secular world. A Cardinal may be conservative in matters of sexual morality and radical economically. Or he could be ferocious in pursuit of gay people  but committed to the protection of migrant rights. So they have been used roughly as a measure of how much a candidate has distinguished himself from the party line, rather than where he fits into the secular left/right division. The question of allowing greater autonomy to national churches, which is very important in terms of internal Catholic debate, does not correspond to anything in the secular world.</p><p>One particular difficulty arises with the line on condoms. Catholics everywhere largely disregard the official prohibition against artificial birth control but condoms, because of their role in disease prevention, are a special case. The official position is that condoms are not the best answer to HIV/Aids and may tend to help its spread by encouraging promiscuity, whereas the best defence is abstinence and monogamy. But if one party in a marriage has the virus, the pope Benedict XVI made clear that it is legitimate to use condoms to prevent disease transmission. So that is assumed to be the default position now.</p><p>The \"Priorities\" category is a similar simplification. The four categories we have offered are not meant to be mutually exclusive. Obviously any serious candidate will have policies for all four of these problems. But it is an attempt to show which issue is the top priority. In Catholic jargon, the problem we have labelled \"Recovering lost believers\" is known as \"the New Evangelism\".  There is no official term for the shortage of priests because the Vatican policy has been for many years to ignore the problem. Relations with Islam is a proxy for relations with other faiths as well, but there is no question that islam is the most pressing external problem.</p><p>Some of the judgments are large and crude, and some will be wrong. The Catholic church is a global organisation, and there are things we do not know about many of its cardinals. There are bound to be things omitted from the official Vatican biographies which have often been our main sources. So if you live in the countries affected, please <a href=\"mailto:andrew.brown@guardian.co.uk\">write in with your views</a> on how we have scored them.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405344022|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|f0a0616652c532f4b82e8da90ae1096d627102cf -->",

In 2010, he reacted dismissed General Gaddafi’s call for Europe to convert to Islam, describing it as an “unsolicited provocation lacking seriousness”, but adding that the true danger for Europeans was “relativism, the lack of attention to faith, the weakness of religion, indifference to the sacred”.

If successful, he would be the first Asian pope. Tagle, however, has been outspoken at times.

Although Scherer is tipped as a possible papal candidate, his low profile among other cardinals may be problematic. Leading the archdiocese of Sao Paulo (one of the largest with 6 million members) means that Scherer has had to demonstrate his strengths and skills. He claimed in February 2013 that “it’s time to have someone from a different culture, someone with new ideas”.

The crisis, which lasted from December 1996 to April 1997, ended with the storming of the building and the killing of all 14 militants. He also called for the death penalty for the leader of the Shining Path terrorist group following his capture in 1992. “We cannot allow the fears, worries and cowardice of a few people in the country to stop us approving the death penalty,” he said. “We can’t shake with fear.” Considered papabile in the 2005 conclave, he was created a cardinal by John Paul II on 21 February 2001. </td><td class=\"centre\">ultra-Conservative </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Leonardo Sandri </td><td class=\"left\">69 </td><td class=\"left\">Buenos Aires, Argentina </td><td class=\"left\">Argentina </td><td class=\"left\">Like many Argentinians, the grand chancellor of the Pontifical Oriental Institute is of Italian descent (his parents emigrated to South America from Trentino) - a fact that is unlikely to harm his chances of succeeding Benedict.

He also announced John Paul’s death in 2005. But despite being head of the congregation of Oriental churches - which makes him responsible for Catholics in Bethlehem and elsewhere in the Holy Land - some have noted that Sandri’s star has been waning in recent years and his current role is less influential than the positions he occupied under John Paul.

They will now retire to the isolation of St Martha’s House, within the Vatican walls, and reconvene tomorrow morning at 8.30am GMT for more deliberations. They are expected to choose a new pope within the next couple of days.</p><p>•&nbsp;<strong>The favourite remains Cardinal Angelo Scola of Milan, with Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer in second place.</strong> But in truth no figure goes into the conclave with the kind of strong prospects Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had when he became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.</p></div></div><div id=\"block-513f781e95cb3037f5c824d7\" class=\"block\"><p class=\"block-time published-time\"><time datetime=\"2013-03-12T18:46:55.027Z\">6.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time></p><div class=\"block-elements\"><p>That's black smoke, all right ...</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9aea8cbf-bd8e-4c71-ac15-474b2068c954\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/12/1363113986285/Black-smoke-from-the-Sist-010.jpg\" alt=\"Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney indicates no pope has been chosen today on 12 March 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney indicates no pope has been chosen today.

She told me:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It’s a slightly strange scene in St Peter’s Square at the moment, where I am, where St Peter’s Basilica is being upstaged by a chimney which is being focused in on by at least four big screens in the piazza. Everyone’s training their eyes on that, ignoring everything else, people are chatting excitedly …</p></blockquote><p>I asked Lizzy if the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of devout Catholics or simply interested tourists.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>People fall into three camps. There are tourists who have absolutely no shame in saying: we have booked a holiday and this is a historic moment; we don’t believe at all, we’re not religious, but we wanted to be here nonetheless. There are devout Catholics who have come a very long way purely to be here … And then there are the very lucky Catholic tourists who happen to be in Rome and happen to be here at a moment of astonishing importance for their religion, so they’re very happy.</p></blockquote></div><p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-12T18:34:45.212Z\">at 6.34pm GMT</time></p></div><div id=\"block-513f7005b5799f28f712f3dd\" class=\"block\"><p class=\"block-time published-time\"><time datetime=\"2013-03-12T18:12:22.285Z\">6.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time></p><div class=\"block-elements\"><p>From the Vatican, Lizzy Davies tweets:</p><figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lizzy_davies/status/311539703646154752\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>St peters is a sea of umbrellas.

Until recently, Scola was seen as the conservative group's most distinguished ecclesiastical spokesman.</p><p>But anyone wanting to circumvent the 115 cardinals and chose their own pope can now do so, thanks to the Guardian’s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/mar/12/choose-your-own-pope-pontifficator\">Pontifficator</a>.

It’s fair to say that either would be a surprise pick.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/10/new-pope-curia-secret-report-cardinals\">John Hooper explains in this piece</a>, the cardinals are split into two factions known as “Romans” and “Barbarians”:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The first group includes the power-brokers in the Vatican and their allies, many of whom are Italians; the second faction, bent on shaking the Curia to its foundations, is led by cardinals from the United States and Germany.</p><p>But to see it as a contest between conservatives and liberals would be a mistake: after eight years of Benedict XVI and 27 of John Paul II, there are precious few liberals among the cardinals.</p></blockquote><p>The Barbarians, who favour greater transparency within the church, are coalescing around Angelo Scola. The Romans seem to be backing Odilo Scherer, archbishop of&nbsp;S&atilde;o Paulo.</p><p>Here <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/08/papal-conclave-fault-lines-emerge\">Sam Jones runs through</a> the views of many of the 115 cardinals taking part in the conclave, one of whom will walk out of the Sistine Chapel wearing a new cassock and going by a new name, and lists <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/08/papal-conclave-fault-lines-emerge\">five to watch</a>:</p><p><strong>Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer, 63 (Brazil)</strong></p><p>Appointed archbishop of S&atilde;o Paulo in March 2007, he was created a cardinal by<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi\"> Pope Benedict XVI</a> eight months later. Although tipped as a possible candidate, his low profile among other cardinals may be problematic. Leading the archdiocese of S&atilde;o Paulo (one of the largest with 6 million members) means that he has had to demonstrate his strengths and skills. He said in February 2013 that it was &quot;time to have someone from a different culture, someone with new ideas&quot;. The cardinal is outspoken on abortion: when Brazil's supreme court voted in 2012 to legalise the termination of foetuses with malformed brains, Scherer asked which group &quot;incompatible with life&quot; would be eliminated next.</p><p><strong>Cardinal Angelo Scola, 71 (Italy)</strong></p><p>The son of a truck driver, he holds doctorates in philosophy and theology and was professor of theological anthropology at the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family. He was appointed bishop of Grosseto in 1991, patriarch of Venice in 2002, created a cardinal in 2003, and appointed archbishop of Milan in 2011. In spite of his place at the top of the Vatican hierarchy and his academic pedigree, he He has urged the church to do more to appeal to the modern world, arguing it needs to build on the second Vatican council of the 1960s, which proved a landmark moment in Roman Catholic history. An ardent believer in the church's role at the centre of society, he has publicly bemoaned its inability to clearly communicate its message on matters such as marriage. A strong favourite.</p><figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-07f04058-0960-4517-b502-0840404c45e1\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/11/1363031359030/Cardinal-Angelo-Scola-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cardinal Angelo Scola\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Cardinal Christoph Sch&ouml;nborn, 68 (Austria)</strong></p><p>The archbishop of Vienna is considered one of the favourites for the papacy. In addition to being a polyglot (he speaks German, French, Italian, English, Spanish and Latin fluently), his education in theology, philosophy and psychology may stand him in good stead. His public stance has been more moderate on issues such as HIV/Aids than some of the other candidates. The cardinal has also gained respect for his handling of the sex abuse scandal stating: &quot;The days of cover-up are over. For a long while the church's principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims.&quot; He was created a cardinal by John Paul II on 21 February 1998.</p><p><strong>Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 69 (Argentina)</strong></p><p>Like many Argentinians, the grand chancellor of the Pontifical Oriental Institute is of Italian descent (his parents emigrated to South America from Trentino) – a fact that is unlikely to harm his chances of succeeding Benedict. Sandri, who speaks five languages and has represented the Vatican in the US, Venezuela and Mexico, served as the voice of John Paul II when he was ill with Parkinson's disease. He also announced John Paul's death in 2005. But despite being head of the congregation of Oriental churches – which makes him responsible for Catholics in Bethlehem and elsewhere in the Holy Land – some have noted that his star has been waning in recent years and his current role is less influential than the positions he occupied under John Paul. He was created a cardinal by Benedict on 24 November 2007.</p><p><strong>Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, 55 (Philippines)</strong></p><p>Appointed as archbishop of Manila in 2011, he has been hailed by some as a worthy successor to Pope Benedict XVI. The cardinal's youth – he is the second youngest of the cardinals after Cardinal Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal – coupled with his detailed knowledge of Vatican history, his charisma and his progressive outlook make him a strong candidate. If successful, he would be the first Asian pope. Tagle, however, has been outspoken at times. In Rome in October 2012, he told a gathering of bishops that the church should be more ready to admit its mistakes and has been connected to the &quot;Bologna School&quot; of progressive academics who have taken a liberal view of the second Vatican council. He was created a cardinal by Benedict on 24 November 2012.</p><p>Andrew Brown also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/05/how-will-next-pope-be-chosen\">profiles a number of other cardinals here</a>.</p></div><p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-12T14:17:07.471Z\">at 2.17pm GMT</time></p></div><div id=\"block-513f1f8e95cb3037f5c82469\" class=\"block\"><p class=\"block-time published-time\"><time datetime=\"2013-03-12T12:29:02.310Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time></p><div class=\"block-elements\"><p>Good afternoon. As 115 cardinals gather in the Vatican to decide which of them will become the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics, welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conclave that will choose the next pope.</p><p>Tonight, some time between 6.15pm and 7pm, the cardinals are expected to hold their first ballot (although they may hold off until tomorrow). A chimney attached to the roof of the Sistine chapel, where the cardinals are meeting, will emit black smoke if no decision has been reached, or white smoke if a pope has been chosen.</p><p>If they fail to make a decision this evening, which is highly likely, they will then hold four ballots a day tomorrow and on subsequent days – two in the morning, two in the afternoon – until they have chosen a pope. The smoke will billow up once after the morning ballots and once after the afternoon ones. A two-thirds majority – 77 votes – is needed for outright victory.</p><p>My colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/05/how-will-next-pope-be-chosen%20\">Andrew Brown explains how the ballot works</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The cardinals ballot repeatedly and secretly – each cardinal writes the name of his favoured candidate on a slip of paper, preferably in a disguised hand, and folds it so it is invisible before the votes are reckoned.</p></blockquote><p>If the pope is not chosen after 33 ballots, from that point on the contest becomes a run-off between the two frontrunners.</p><p>The cardinals burn their ballot papers after each ballot. But the stove used to burn the ballot papers is no longer the same one that produces the black or white smoke – it was too often too difficult to tell what colour smoke the ballots had produced. So a new device was put in place specifically to produce discernible colours, and the basilica’s bell is rung if the smoke is white, for added clarity.</p><p>Once a candidate has been chosen, the Cardinal Dean asks him if he is willing to accept, and what his papal name will be. In Saturday’s Guardian, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the former leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/08/choosing-the-pope-cardinal-oconnor\">recalled the moment when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was asked if he would become pontiff</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I remember the senior cardinal going up to Cardinal Ratzinger and saying: 'Your Eminence, will you accept to be the supreme pontiff of the Catholic church?' And we all waited. He said: 'No. I can't.' And then he said: 'I accept as the will of God.' And then the cardinal said: 'What name will you take?' And he said: 'Benedict.' He must have thought about it the night before.</p></blockquote><p>Once a new pope has been chosen, the news will then be announced to the crowd in St Peter’s Square with the words “habemus papam” – we have a pope – and the new pope will then be brought out to greet the crowd.</p><p>As my colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/28/pope-resigns-and-then-what\">Sam Jones explains in this excellent piece about the conclave process</a>, although all cardinals are entitled to have their say in the general congregations, only 117 cardinal electors – those cardinals aged under 80 – have the final vote in conclave on who will be the next pope. This year, only 115 of them are attending the conclave as<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/28/www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/25/pope-forces-out-keith-obrien\"> Cardinal Keith O'Brien</a> resigned as archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh following allegations of inappropriate behaviour and Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja of Indonesia said his eyesight was too poor to permit him to go to Rome.</p><p>The cardinals are confined to their Vatican guesthouse when not deliberating in the Sistine chapel – and any leaks are punishable by excommunication.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_election,_1268%E2%80%931271\">election of one pope in the 13th century</a> lasted two years, nine months and two days, leading Catholics to board up the cardinals in their chamber and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/07/world/europe/vatican-pope-selection/?hpt=hp_t2%20%20\">tear the roof off</a>, and then try to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Pope/story?id=681429\">starve them out</a>, to try to prompt them to reach a decision. They eventually chose Gregory X.</p><p>Your correspondent is happy to report that the current conclave is not expected to last quite as long as that, and should be wrapped up within two or three days. The one that picked Benedict XVI in 2005 ran over two days – although the then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger went into that conclave in a stronger position than any of today’s contenders.</p><p>Here’s a timetable of what we know so far:</p><h2>Today</h2><p><strong>6am GMT:</strong> The 115 “cardinal electors” moved into the St Martha’s House residence inside the Vatican walls where they will eat and sleep cut off from the outside world for the duration of the conclave.</p><p><strong>9am GMT:</strong> Cardinals took part in a special “Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice” (“For the Election of the Roman Pontiff”) mass in St Peter’s Basilica.</p><p><strong>2.45pm GMT:</strong> Cardinals either walk or take a minibus in strict isolation through the Vatican gardens from St Martha’s House to the Apostolic Palace.</p><p><strong>3.30pm GMT:</strong> Cardinals hold a procession through the Apostolic Palace from the Pauline Chapel to the Sistine Chapel as they chant the Litany of Saints.</p><p><strong>3.45pm GMT:</strong> Cardinals swear not to reveal details of their deliberations on pain of excommunication. Any staff are ordered to leave the chapel with the Latin phrase “extra omnes” and a prayer is read before the first vote is expected to be taken.</p><p><strong>6.15pm GMT:</strong> Smoke is expected if a vote has been taken. Cardinals recite vespers to conclude their first session.</p><p><strong>6.30pm GMT:</strong> Cardinals return to St Martha’s House.</p><p><strong>7pm GMT:</strong> Cardinals have their first conclave dinner.</p><h2>Tomorrow and successive days until the conclave concludes</h2><p><strong>5.30am GMT-6.30am GMT:</strong> Breakfast at St Martha’s.</p><p><strong>6.45am GMT:</strong> Departure for Apostolic Palace.</p><p><strong>7.15am GMT:</strong> Mass in the Pauline Chapel.</p><p><strong>8.30am GMT:</strong> Prayers and voting in Sistine Chapel.</p><p><strong>11.30am GMT:</strong> Departure for St Martha’s.</p><p><strong>Midday GMT:</strong> Lunch.

        "body":"<p>When the smoke came, billowing out in clouds from the Sistine chapel chimney, it was unquestionably black. But that didn't seem to matter greatly to the thousands who had waited in the cold and drizzle. \"Look at the people; look at the excitement,\" said Erik Paulson, a martial arts teacher from Orange County, California. Shortly after the cheer went up, Paulson and his wife received a blessing from a passing priest in a floodlit, expectant, umbrella-spotted St Peter's square. \"It's a big show of faith,\" he said. \"Look at everyone's face: they're hopeful.\"</p><p>While the smoke wasn't white on Tuesday night, the pilgrims did not care: they knew it would be only a matter of time before it was. More than two hours earlier, after a ceremonial procession that had taken them through the Apostolic Palace, past the Swiss guards and past the lavishly frescoed walls, the 115 cardinal electors of the Roman Catholic church had been shut inside the Sistine Chapel for a conclave to choose the 265th successor to St Peter and the 266th pope. The first ballot had, unsurprisingly, proved inconclusive. But, at some point in the coming days, the world will find out just who will be Benedict XVI's successor at the helm of a troubled and beleaguered church.</p><p>\"One of the biggest deals with the new pope is restoring the hope for everyone in the church and getting everyone back on track with their faith and belief. Faith in the church; faith in the fathers and the priests, and faith in God,\" said Paulson, next to one of the big television screens showing the chimney. Nuns shivered in clusters; teenagers tested each other on the saints.</p><p>\"I think the people are ready and the vibration and the energy of the earth has changed. People need that and want that.\"</p><p>Quite what the world's 1.2 billion Catholics want from their new leader may or may not have been on the minds of the cardinal electors as, chanting the Litany of Saints, they entered the Sistine Chapel and bowed before the altar wall bearing Michelangelo's Last Judgment.</p><p>At the end of 10 general congregations – or meetings – designed to establish what they themselves were looking for from the new pope, the cardinals still had more to say. But their time was up. In a Latin oath accented according to their native countries, they stepped up one by one to swear a pledge of secrecy on the gospel.</p><p>Then, a simple two-word command brought an end to the torrent of words and chants and prayers. \"Extra omnes,\" declared Guido Marini, the master of ceremonies: \"All out.\" The assistants, priests, nuns, bishops and Swiss guards who had been helping left. At 5.34pm, the doors were shut. After one last sermon, the cardinals were left to themselves.</p><p>As they stood in the chapel, they may have had the words of Angelo Sodano ringing in their ears. The dean of the college of cardinals – a curial stalwart who, at 85, was too old to vote in conclave but not too old to exert his influence – led a spectacular <em>pro eligendo Romano Pontefice</em> mass in St Peter's basilica in the morning at which the electors prayed for divine help with their decision.</p><p>As the thunder rumbled and the rain began to fall on the hundreds of pilgrims outside, the cardinals had appeared solemn as they made their way down the aisle in their scarlet vestments. In their final audience with him last month, the so-called \"princes\" of the church had been urged by the emeritus pope to \"work like an orchestra\", overcoming their divisions to achieve harmony. In his last Ash Wednesday mass, also in St Peter's, Benedict had hit out at the \"individualism and rivalry\" that \"disfigured\" the face of the church.</p><p>Now, though, it was the turn of Sodano to speak, and while he gave few clues to what kind of pope he wanted to see, he did return once more to the question of unity, quoting St Paul's letter to the Ephesians in a thinly-veiled appeal to his fellow cardinals to unite behind the next pontiff.</p><p>\"Each of us,\" he said, \"is therefore called to cooperate with the successor of Peter, the visible foundation of such an ecclesial unity.\"</p><p>For many of the thousands-strong congregation, however, the allusion to battling cardinals was of secondary importance. What mattered was which one of them would become pope.</p><p>\"It was so beautiful to be there, praying for something we know in our hearts is true: that the Holy Spirit will help them pick the right person,\" said Nina Fisher, who had flown in from Philadelphia to witness the conclave for herself.</p><p>Fisher acknowledged that the church had been through \"troubling\" times in recent years, but had high hopes for whoever will take on its fraught leadership. \"I have a couple of favourites- [Marc] Ouellet, from Canada, and [Luis Antonio] Tagle, from the Philippines,\" she said. \"But anyway, whether he's young or old, wherever he's from, we know he'll be the right person.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405474880|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|8ac8b4e62d4f45de0fcb87f4684189c6001bc2ad -->",

        "body":"<p>Roman Catholic cardinals will continue to search on Wednesday for a new spiritual leader for the world's 1.2 billion baptised Catholics after black smoke poured from the chimney above the Sistine Chapel tonight, signalling they had failed to elect a new pope on the first day.</p><p>Shortly after 5.30pm in Rome the papal master of ceremonies, Guido Marini, had drawn shut the doors of the Sistine Chapel, locking inside the \"princes of the church\" whose task is to elect a pope great enough to lead his church out of the maze of scandal and controversy into which it stumbled during the strife-torn reign of former Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned last month.</p><p>After listening to a homily by one of their number, the Maltese Augustinian, Prosper Grech, the cardinals voted. But black smoke issuing from the chimney above the chapel two hours later showed that none of the cardinals had obtained the necessary two-thirds majority to be Pope. The cardinals now return  to the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel for the night and will return to the Apostolic Palace for Mass on Wednesday morning for a new round of voting.</p><p>The 115 men taking part in the ballot started on Tuesday  by filing into the chapel in two long columns as they chanted <em>Ora pro nobis </em>(Pray for us) in response to the names of the litany of saints and prophets. Dressed mostly in vivid scarlet, the cardinals advanced down the chapel towards Michelangelo's intimidating depiction of the Last Judgement where they bowed their heads before the altar and took their places in the stalls on either side.The decision the cardinals will have to make in their assembly, or conclave, is among the most difficult in recent times. Benedict's abdication has robbed them of the chance that most of their predecessors had to swap opinions on a likely successor as the pope of the day advanced in age and infirmity.</p><p>According to a report in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, one of the two frontrunners, Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, had secured the backing of up to 50 electors. But in the run-up to the conclave several cardinals warned that an early result was unlikely because of the lack of a clear favourite.</p><p>The traditional wisdom has it that he who starts the election as the likely pope emerges a cardinal. But Scola is also handicapped by his close association with the controversial Communion and Liberation movement, and just hours before the start of the ballot there was a reminder of the scandals in which it has been entangled.</p><p>Anti-mafia investigators carried out dawn raids in Scola's diocese in an investigation into corruption linked to hospital supplies. Healthcare in Lombardy is the principal responsibility of the regional administration, which for the past 18 years has been run by Roberto Formigoni, a childhood friend of Scola and the leading political representative of the Communion and Liberation fellowship.</p><p>Among those arrested was a local politician said to have organised expensive holidays for Formigoni that are central to an investigation into the former governor's affairs. Formigoni, who has been accused of, but not charged with, conspiracy and corruption, denies all wrongdoing.</p><p>Until recently, Scola was seen as the conservative group's most distinguished ecclesiastical spokesman, but he has progressively loosened his ties to Communion and Liberation, and in early 2012 publicly rebuked the movement's leadership.</p><p>According to sources close to the cardinals' preliminary deliberations, Scola was the champion of a largely non-Italian faction that is challenging the entrenched power of the Vatican cardinals. His chief rival as the voting began was said to be the archbishop of Sao Paolo, Odilo Scherer.</p><p>The management of the Roman Curia, the central administration of the church, appeared to be foremost among the issues dividing the electors. Reports in the Italian media indicated that the final meeting of the cardinals before the Conclave witnessed a clash between the Vatican's top official, secretary of state Tarcisio Bertone, and a Brazilian cardinal, João Cardinal Bráz de Aviz.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405471454|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|b57c2f8927a936bfa6bd9e1f8b881b4ea2042a22 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two child abuse cases involving a cover-up by one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/12/black-smoke-no-pope-papal-conclave\">cardinals electing the next pope</a> have been settled as part of a $10m (£6.6m) out-of-court deal in Los Angeles.</p><p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles will make the payouts to victims of a now-defrocked priest who told Cardinal Roger Mahony nearly 30 years ago that he had molested children.</p><p>The cases involving ex-priest Michael Baker span 26 years, from 1974 to 2000. Two were set for trial next month. The cases were settled this week.</p><p>Two of the claims alleged Mahony didn't do enough to stop Baker from abusing children, said the plaintiffs' attorney John Manly.</p><p>Mahony retired as Los Angeles archbishop in 2011 and was rebuked by his successor, Archbishop Jose Gomez, in February after confidential church files showed the cardinal worked behind the scenes to shield molesting priests and protect the church from scandal.</p><p>Mahony, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/mar/12/list-cardinals-select-pope\">one of the cardinals in Rome</a> helping select the next pope, was aware of the settlement, said J Michael Hennigan, an archdiocese attorney. \"We have for a long, long time said that we made serious mistakes with Michael Baker and we had always taken the position in these cases that whatever Baker did we were responsible for,\" he said.</p><p>Baker could not be reached for comment. Mahony has apologised repeatedly for his handling of clergy abuse cases. The cardinal was sequestered for the papal conclave and could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.</p><p>Manly said: \"The person who could have stopped this in its tracks and prevented three out of four of these children from being sexually assaulted is now sitting in Rome voting for the next vicar of Christ,\" said Manly. \"I find that terribly troubling.\"</p><p>Two of the plaintiffs, a pair of brothers, will get $4m each and the two others will get nearly $1m each, Manly said.</p><p>Confidential files show that Baker met with Mahony in 1986 and confessed to molesting two boys over a nearly seven-year period. Mahony removed Baker from ministry and sent him for psychological treatment but the priest returned to ministry the following year with a doctor's recommendation that he be defrocked immediately if he spent any time with minors.</p><p>Despite several documented instances of being alone with boys the priest wasn't removed from ministry until 2000 after serving in nine parishes.</p><p>Baker was convicted of child molestation in 2007 and paroled in 2011. Baker was charged in 2002 with 34 counts of molestation involving six victims but those charges were dismissed because they fell outside the criminal statute of limitations.</p><p>Authorities believe Baker may have abused more than 20 children in his 26-year career.</p><p>The archdiocese settled more than 500 clergy abuse lawsuits in 2007 for a record-breaking $660m.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405482133|2013-07-02T13:00:09Z|d6575e99c27ce249a0c9aa18c621a1e3b47ba0fc -->",
