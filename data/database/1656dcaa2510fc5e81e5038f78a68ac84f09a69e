From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, 'Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody'.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\" title=\"\">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a> would recognise this moment. Now it is not the land his impostors are enclosing, but the rest of the natural world. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, nature is being valued and commodified so that it can be exchanged for cash.</p><p>The effort began in earnest under the last government. At a cost of £100,000, it commissioned a research company to produce a total annual price for England's ecosystems. After taking the money, the company reported – with a certain understatement – that this exercise was \"theoretically challenging to complete, and considered by some not to be a theoretically sound endeavour\". Some of the services provided by England's ecosystems, it pointed out, \"may in fact be infinite in value\".</p><p>This rare flash of common sense did nothing to discourage the current government from seeking first to put a price on nature, then to create a market in its disposal. The UK now has a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/\" title=\"\">natural capital committee</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a> and an inspiring new lexicon. We don't call it nature any more: now the proper term is \"natural capital\". Natural processes have become \"ecosystem services\", as they exist only to serve us. Hills, forests and river catchments are now \"green infrastructure\", while biodiversity and habitats are \"asset classes\" within an \"ecosystem market\". All of them will be assigned a price, all of them will become exchangeable.</p><p>The argument in favour of this approach is coherent and plausible. Business currently treats the natural world as if it is worth nothing. Pricing nature and incorporating that price into the cost of goods and services creates an economic incentive for its protection. It certainly appeals to both business and the self-hating state. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force speaks of \"substantial potential growth in nature-related markets – in the order of billions of pounds globally\".</p><p>Commodification, economic growth, financial abstractions, corporate power: aren't these the processes driving the world's environmental crisis? Now we are told that to save the biosphere we need more of them.</p><p>Payments for ecosystem services look to me like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since Rousseau's encloser first made an exclusive claim to the land. The government has already begun describing land owners as the \"providers\" of ecosystem services, as if they had created the rain and the hills and the rivers and the wildlife that inhabits them. They are to be paid for these services, either by the government or by \"users\". It sounds like the plan for the NHS.</p><p>Land ownership since the time of the first impostor has involved the gradual accumulation of exclusive rights, which were seized from commoners. Payments for ecosystem services extend this encroachment by appointing the landlord as the owner and instigator of the wildlife, the water flow, the carbon cycle, the natural processes that were previously deemed to belong to everyone and no one.</p><p>But it doesn't end there. Once a resource has been commodified, speculators and traders step in. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force now talks of \"harnessing City financial expertise to assess the ways that these blended revenue streams and securitisations enhance the ROI [return on investment] of an environmental bond\". This gives you an idea of how far this process has gone – and of the gobbledegook it has begun to generate.</p><p>Already the government is developing the market for trading wildlife, by experimenting with what it calls biodiversity offsets. If a quarry company wants to destroy a rare meadow, for example, it can buy absolution by paying someone to create another somewhere else. The government warns that these offsets should be used only to compensate for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" and \"must not become a licence to destroy\". But once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold? Nature, under this system, will become as fungible as everything else.</p><p>Like other aspects of neoliberalism, the commodification of nature forestalls democratic choice. No longer will we be able to argue that an ecosystem or a landscape should be protected because it affords us wonder and delight; we'll be told that its intrinsic value has already been calculated and, doubtless, that it  turns out to be worth less than the other uses to which the land could be put. The market has spoken: end of debate.</p><p></p><p>All those messy, subjective matters, the motivating forces of democracy, will be resolved in a column of figures. Governments won't need to regulate; the market will make the decisions that politicians have ducked. But trade is a fickle master, and unresponsive to anyone except those with the money. The costing and sale of nature represents another transfer of power to corporations and the very rich.</p><p>It diminishes us, it diminishes nature. By turning the natural world into a subsidiary of the corporate economy, it reasserts the biblical doctrine of dominion. It slices the biosphere into component commodities: already the government's task force is talking of \"unbundling\" ecosystem services, a term borrowed from previous privatisations. This might make financial sense; it makes no ecological sense. The more we learn about the natural world, the more we discover that its functions cannot be safely disaggregated.</p><p>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value – from love to greed – we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. Pull up the stakes, fill in the ditch, we're being conned again.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p>","headline":"Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all","trailText":"<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> Payments for 'ecosystem services' look like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since enclosure","newspaperPageNumber":"25","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/39haa","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344274678245/Gunnerside-village-Swaled-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344274678245/Gunnerside-village-Swaled-004.jpg","wordcount":"1018","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"394265264","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6511159","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Monbiot","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1784143","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-09T19:30:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","references":[],"type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree"},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/privatisation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/privatisation"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment"},{"id":"uk/ruralaffairs","webTitle":"Rural affairs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ruralaffairs","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ruralaffairs"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics"},{"id":"environment/rivers","webTitle":"Rivers","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/rivers","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/rivers"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife"},{"id":"environment/land-rights","webTitle":"Land rights","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/land-rights","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/land-rights"},{"id":"environment/water","webTitle":"Water","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/water"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk"},{"id":"profile/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot","rcsId":"GNL055772","r2ContributorId":"15660","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/2/1288723986430/George-Monbiot.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>George Monbiot is the author of the bestselling books The Age of Consent: A Manifesto for a New World Order and Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain, as well as the investigative travel books Poisoned Arrows, Amazon Watershed and No Man's Land.

The idea is called biodiversity offsetting. It involves trading places: allowing people to destroy wildlife and habitats if, in return, they pay someone to create new habitats elsewhere. In April, the UK government <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/natural/biodiversity/uk/offsetting/pilots/\" title=\"\">launched six pilot projects</a> to test the idea, which would run for two years.</p><p></p><p>Four months ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">I wrote this</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/biodiversity/offsetting/documents/110714offsetting-guiding-principles.pdf\" title=\"\">government warns</a> that these offsets should be used only to compensate for 'genuinely unavoidable damage' and 'must not become a licence to destroy'; but once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold?\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The answer, it seems, is \"not very long\". A year and a half before the pilot projects have been completed, the new spirit of destruction is roaming the land. A place of outstanding wildlife value is now being considered for demolition, and biodiversity offsetting is being mooted as the means by which it can be justified. It's hard to believe that this scheme would still be receiving serious consideration if the mother of all excuses had not been proposed by the government.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/environmentandplanning/developmentplan/localdevelopmentframework/ldfevidencebase/lodgehill.aspx\" title=\"\">Lodge Hill, close to Gillingham in north Kent</a>, contains what could be the UK's highest concentration of nightingales. The species has suffered an astonishing decline in this country – over 90% in just 40 years – partly as a result of the destruction of its habitat. This site – of just 325 hectares – <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/Nightingale%20habitat%20compensation%20report%20FINAL%20_18%2010%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">contains roughly 1% of the remaining population</a>. It is one of the very few places where, on a summer's night, you can still hear the full nightingale orchestra, a sound that would once have been familiar to people across much of the country.</p><p></p><p>Medway council has proposed that the land at Lodge Hill be turned into a development of 5,000 houses. This, according to a <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/Nightingale%20habitat%20compensation%20report%20FINAL%20_18%2010%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the British Trust for Ornithology</a>, could destroy the area's entire population of nightingales. Even if some birds continue to use the adjoining woods, they are extremely vulnerable to cats, as they nest close to the ground. The pets arriving with the new homes are likely to snuff out what John Clare called \"<a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-nightingale-s-nest/\" title=\"\">the old woodland's legacy of song</a>.\"</p><p></p><p>So how do you justify the unjustifiable? You commission a consultancy (the Environment Bank) to investigate the potential for offsetting: in effect moving the habitat and its nightingales somewhere else. <a href=\"http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/EBL%20Lodge%20Hill%20report%20final%20draft%2013%20nov%2012.pdf\" title=\"\">It reported that</a>:</p><p></p><p>\"Offsetting could work in principle for nightingales in Kent – it is technically feasible but it is neither straightforward nor guaranteed\"</p><p></p><p>If a site of around 500 hectares were found and stocked with suitable habitat, a similar number of nightingales might establish itself there. But no one can be sure it will work. If it doesn't, by the time we find out it will be too late: the new habitat will take at least a decade to establish, while the existing habitat will be destroyed and the houses built in just two or three years. If the experiment fails it cannot be reversed.</p><p></p><p>The report suggests two principal means by which new nightingale habitat could be created in Kent. One is to coppice existing woodland: cutting the trees at ground level so that they resprout to create the shrubby growth that nightingales use. The other is to take an area of agricultural land and either plant it with scrub or allow scrub to regenerate naturally.</p><p></p><p>This invites two obvious responses. If woods are chosen, the offsetting process would not be creating wildlife habitat, but merely changing an existing habitat into something different. Coppicing favours some species at the expense of others, particularly those which require large trees, dead wood and an undisturbed understorey. What's good for nightingales may be bad for woodpeckers.</p><p></p><p>If 500 hectares of fields – a bigger site than Lodge Hill – can be taken out of agricultural use to compensate for the destruction of the nightingales' homes, why not spare Lodge Hill and build the houses in the fields?</p><p></p><p>The prospect of offsetting in this case looks to me like the \"licence to destroy\" that the government warned against. Rather than compensating for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" it looks as if it could be used to justify avoidable destruction: trashing a remarkable place for an unremarkable project which could be built elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>This case illustrates the danger inherent in the principle of offsetting. It makes nature as fungible as everything else. No place is valued as a place: it is broken down into a list of habitats and animals and plants, which could, in theory, be shifted somewhere else. It subjects our landscape and wildlife to the same process of commodification that has blighted everything else the corporate economy touches.</p><p></p><p>The notion of a \"like for like\" replacement is bogus. No two places are the same. No place that has been planned and measured and designed and planted as a wildlife habitat is the same as one that has arisen spontaneously, or that has always been there. Much of the delight of nature is that it is unscripted, spontaneous, unofficial, that it owes little or nothing to human design.</p><p></p><p>Accept the principle of biodiversity offsetting and you accept the idea that place means nothing. That nowhere is to be valued in its own right any more, that everything is exchangeable for everything else, and nothing can be allowed to stand in the way of the graders and degraders. That is not an idea I find easy to swallow.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">Monbiot.com</a></p>","headline":"Biodiversity offsetting will unleash a new spirit of destruction on the land","trailText":"<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> A place of outstanding wildlife value may be destroyed if in return someone is paid to create a habitat elsewhere","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3cc7h","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/12/7/1354885628454/Monbiot-blog--Common-Nigh-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/12/7/1354885628454/Monbiot-blog--Common-Nigh-003.jpg","wordcount":"907","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"400689370","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6996832","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"George Monbiot","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-12-08T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1839473","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-14T13:25:10Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/dec/07/biodiversity-offsetting-unleash-wildlife-destruction","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/dec/07/biodiversity-offsetting-unleash-wildlife-destruction","tags":[{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot's blog","references":[],"type":"blog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot"},{"id":"environment/biodiversity","webTitle":"Biodiversity","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biodiversity","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/biodiversity"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/wildlife"},{"id":"environment/conservation","webTitle":"Conservation","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/environment/conservation"},{"id":"politics/planning","webTitle":"Planning policy","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/planning","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/planning"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics"},{"id":"profile/georgemonbiot","webTitle":"George Monbiot","rcsId":"GNL055772","r2ContributorId":"15660","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/2/1288723986430/George-Monbiot.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>George Monbiot is the author of the bestselling books The Age of Consent: A Manifesto for a New World Order and Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain, as well as the investigative travel books Poisoned Arrows, Amazon Watershed and No Man's Land.

Why? Because of the lobbying power of big business","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2013-07-03T21:41:04Z","body":"<p>In other ages, states sought to seize as much power as they could. Today, the self-hating state renounces its powers. Governments anathematise governance. They declare their role redundant and illegitimate. They launch furious assaults on their own branches, seeking wherever possible to lop them off.</p><p>This self-mutilation is a response to the fact that power has shifted. States now operate at the behest of others. Deregulation, privatisation, the shrinking of the scope, scale and spending of the state: these are now seen as the only legitimate policies. The corporations and billionaires to whom governments defer will have it no other way.</p><p>Just as taxation tends to redistribute wealth, regulation tends to redistribute power. A democratic state controls and contains powerful interests on behalf of the powerless. This is why billionaires and corporations hate regulation, and – through their newspapers, thinktanks and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/dec/13/astroturf-libertarians-internet-democracy\" title=\"\">astroturf</a> campaigns – mobilise people against it. State power is tyranny, state power is freedom.</p><p>But the interchangeable middle managers who call themselves ministers cannot wholly dismiss the wishes of the electorate. They must show that they are doing something to protect what people value. They resolve the contradiction between the demands of the electorate and the demands of big business by shifting their responsibilities to something they call \"the market\". This term is often used as a euphemism for corporations and the very rich.</p><p>To justify the policy of marketisation, they invest the market with magical capabilities. It can reach the parts that the ordinary scope of government can't reach; it can achieve political miracles. I don't believe that market mechanisms are always wrong. I do believe that they fail to solve the problem of power. In fact they tend to compound it.</p><p>Last week the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/17/europe-climate-chief-vow-save-emissions-trading\" title=\"\">European emissions trading system</a> died. It was supposed to create a market for carbon, whose escalating price would force companies to abandon fossil fuels and replace them with less polluting alternatives. In principle it was as good a mechanism as any other. What it did not offer was a magical alternative to political intervention.</p><p>The scheme collapsed on Tuesday after the European parliament voted against an emergency withdrawal of some of the carbon permits whose over-supply had swamped the market. Why were too many permits issued? Because of the lobbying power of big business. Why did MEPs refuse to withdraw them? Because of the lobbying power of big business.</p><p>If a market is to serve a wider social goal than simply maximising corporate profits it must operate within a tight regulatory framework. Pricing mechanisms do not magic away the need for regulation – if anything, they enhance it. To make them work, politicians still have to confront and overcome powerful interests. They still need to govern and decide. Yet everywhere markets are invoked as an alternative to dirigiste and decisive government.</p><p>To make a significant impact, the price of carbon needs to be in the region of €30 or €40 per tonne. It needs to be incapable of falling far, and likely to rise. At the time of writing the price is <a href=\"http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/eu-emissions-trading-scheme-faces-existential-crisis/#.UXVc078rCIY\" title=\"\">€2.8 per tonne</a>, and it's going nowhere. The Economist reports that this puts European carbon permits \"below the level of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_debt\" title=\"\">junk bonds</a>\".</p><p>In an important respect the scheme has been worse than useless. New airports and roads and power stations have been justified with the claim they they will not raise emissions, as the greenhouse gases they produce will be absorbed by cuts made elsewhere. The one lasting impact of the European carbon market has been to rationalise polluting projects which might not otherwise have been built.</p><p>But even as this scheme collapses, governments are launching new ones, creating markets that are far less appropriate – even in theory – than the trade in carbon. Last month, the UK's <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a>, a body set up by the government but largely composed of company executives, . It invokes the magic of the markets to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of democratic governance.</p><p>Not everything it proposes is dangerous and wrong. Creating incentives to reforest the hills from which our rivers flow, or for farmers to use anaerobic digesters to process waste makes sense: as long as it redeploys rather than augments farm subsidies. But in other respects an attempt to reconcile the protection of the living planet with commerce simply turns the biosphere into another corporate asset.</p><p>For instance, the taskforce revives the&nbsp;old myth that nature is best served by harvesting timber. As long ago as 1995, <a href=\"http://www.britishwildlife.com/classic_articles/BW%206-137-147%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20in%20Britain.pdf\">a paper</a> by the biologists Clive Hambler and Martin Speight showed that of the woodland insect species listed as threatened in Britain, 65% are&nbsp;threatened by the removal of old and&nbsp;dead wood, while just 2% are threatened by a reduction in this management. But the taskforce maintains that bringing \"unmanaged woodlands into active, sustainable management for wood fuel … is a win-win for business and nature.\" Just as the myth was at last being laid to rest, it has been revived by the need to make nature and markets appear compatible.</p><p>This is an example of what&nbsp;happens in a market-based system: any clash between generating profit and protecting the natural world is resolved in favour of business, often&nbsp;with the help of junk science. Only&nbsp;those components of the ecosystem that can be commodified and sold are defended. Nature is worthy of protection when it is profitable to business. The moment it ceases to be so, it loses its social value and can be trashed. As prices fluctuate or crash, so&nbsp;do the fortunes of the ecosystems they are supposed to protect. As financial markets move in, with the help&nbsp;of the environmental bonds and securitisations the taskforce champions,&nbsp;the defence of nature becomes ever more volatile and uncertain. The living&nbsp;planet is reduced to a subsidiary&nbsp;of the human economy.</p><p>When governments pretend they no longer need to govern, when they pretend that a world regulated by bankers, corporations and the profit motive is a better world than one regulated by voters and their representatives, nothing is safe. All systems of government are flawed. But few are as flawed as those controlled by private money.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em>.
