He said: &quot;There is a correspondence between the reality and the projection, and we note this with satisfaction.&quot;</p> <p>• Sergio Girotto, the project manager,&nbsp;said that when they started exerting force on the wreck they immediately saw a response in terms of movement. But they couldn't see it becoming dislodged from the rock on which it has been moulded. However, when the force reached 6,000 tonness, the much-anticipated &quot;distacco&quot; – detachment – took place.</p> <p>• The team has noticed &quot;large deformations&quot; on the starboard side, Girotto said. He did not elaborate, but the extent of the damage on that side of the ship will determine how the salvage attempt proceeds.</p> <p>• From an environmental point of view, for the moment things are looking good, said Gabrielli: &quot;The water is clear at the moment; there are no significant or visible spills. There are no problems but we are absolutely aware that we are really at the beginning.&quot; </p> <p>So, all seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion. But the team is clearly trying to avoid raising expectations. Quizzed by one journalist, Gabrielli joked that &quot;the first 12 hours are the most dangerous&quot;. And &quot;hitches&quot; were still possible, he added.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236e2aee4b087760a08a719\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:51:26.493+01:00\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>AP also reports the news that the salvage engineers say the ship has been removed from the rocks, adding that there has been no sign yet of any bodies.</p> <p>Two people remain missing after the ship collided with the rocks: Russel Rebello, a 33-year-old waiter from India, and Grazia Trecarichi, from Sicily, who was on board to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:54:44.681+01:00\">at 11.54am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5236ddcbe4b0bdcddbf1fc57\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:30:35.157+01:00\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lizzy_davies/statuses/379552334612660224\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The Concordia has been dislodged from the rock it was on says Sergio Girotto</p>— Lizzy Davies (@lizzy_davies) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizzy_davies/statuses/379552334612660224\">September 16, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>Big news: the salvage project manager says the ship has been dislodged from the rock on which it has rested for for 20 months.</p> <p>Officials add that there are &quot;large deformations&quot; on the starboard side of the ship, Lizzy adds.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:55:00.693+01:00\">at 11.55am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5236db64e4b0bdcddbf1fc53\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:20:21.287+01:00\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>If you were not yet convinced that the ship is very slowly moving upright, <a href=\"http://live.lastampa.it/Event/Costa_Concordia_le_operazioni_di_raddrizzamento/89436360?ss=1\">this series of photos from La Stampa should persuade you</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236db1be4b0bdcddbf1fc52\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:19:08.393+01:00\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>We now have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/sep/16/costa-concordia-salvage-operation-in-pictures\">full gallery of photographs of the salvage operation, up here</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236da6de4b0bdcddbf1fc50\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:16:13.570+01:00\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The new main photograph, at the top of the page, also shows the apparent titling of the boat as it moves, with a small section discoloured by immersion in the sea clearly visible.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236da14e4b0a1b6b45de15d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:14:44.632+01:00\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3bc257e0-8d64-44b9-9292-0106118e3a1c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379326198079/562cb252-cbc5-40bc-9541-93152baa0133-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Costa Concordia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Franco Gabrielli, head of the civil protection agency, talks to reporters on Giglio Photograph: Rex/Olycom SPA</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236d801e4b0706f2d49f100\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T11:05:53.541+01:00\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The photo in this link, from the Ansa news agency, <a href=\"http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2013/09/16/Raising-Concordia-becomes-visible-_9306309.html?idPhoto=1\">purports to show the evidence that the Costa Concordia is slowly righting</a>.

That would be increased by 200 tons and after each rise engineers would check for movement, he said.</p> <p>“Everything is going smoothly,” added Girotto. But he cautioned: “You will have to wait some time before you can see some change with the naked eye.”</p> <p>The Italian civil protection agency gave the final go-ahead for the parbuckling on Sunday, saying wind and sea conditions had fallen “within the range of operating feasibility”. Initial testing, said senior salvage master Nick Sloane, had shown that “she [the ship] is ready to move”.</p> <p>The project, which is expected to take between eight and 12 hours, will be nail-biting. Parbuckling is a common means of salvaging wrecked vessels, but it has never been used on one of the Concordia’s size – the cruise ship is 290 metres (950ft) long – let alone one balancing precariously on two rock pinnacles on a steep slope.</p> <p>Speaking on Sunday to the hundreds of journalists who have descended on the small Tuscan island, the head of the civil protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, said he was “100%” sure of the operation ending in success. Last week the engineers said there was no plan B.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5236bb9fe4b00fa1bc127c72\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T09:04:47.814+01:00\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>You can now watch a live video stream of the painstaking operation.

        "body":"<p>The Miss America pageant has crowned its first winner from an Indian background – an aspiring doctor who plans to use the $50,000 (£31,000) prize money to fund her studies – sparking a flood of racist criticism on social media.</p><p>\"I'm so happy this organisation has embraced diversity,\" 24-year-old Nina Davuluri said in her first press conference, moments after winning the crown in Atlantic City. \"I'm thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new Miss America.\"</p><p>But within minutes of winning the title, Davuluri, whose talent routine was a Bollywood fusion dance, was the target of racist social media comments.</p><p>If you're #Miss America you should have to be American,\" said one on Twitter.</p><p>\"WHEN WILL A WHITE WOMAN WIN #MISSAMERICA? Ever??!!\" asked another.</p><p>Davuluri, however, brushed aside the negative comments.</p><p>\"I have to rise above that,\" she said. \"I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.\"</p><p>Her grandmother told the Associated Press that she cried when she saw the news on television.</p><p>\"I am very, very, happy for the girl. It was her dream and it was fulfilled,\" 89-year-old V Koteshwaramma said by phone from her home in the city of Vijaywada, in southern India.</p><p></p><p>In the run-up to the pageant, much attention was given to Miss Kansas, Theresa Vail, an army sergeant believed to have been the first contestant ever to openly display tattoos. She has the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer\" title=\"\">Serenity Prayer</a> on her rib cage, and a smaller military insignia on the back of one shoulder.</p><p>Vail won a nationwide \"America's choice\" vote to advance as a semi-finalist, but failed to make it into the top 10.</p><p>In a Twitter message on Sunday before the finals began, Vail wrote: \"Win or not tonight, I have accomplished what I set out to do. I have empowered women. I have opened eyes.\"</p><p>The pageant pitted 53 contestants – one from each state, plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands – in swimming wear, evening gown, talent and interview competitions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417380150|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|f38d5b8371e686991ac4a25b0c64195dc4f05d62 -->",

It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, <em>hints</em> at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.</p><p>Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.</p><p>This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.</p><p>The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychotic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.</p><h2>On a mission</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417415917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379335926701/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Trevor feels the Heat</figcaption></figure><p>GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.</p><p>To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent Havok physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.</p><h2>Satirical scope</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417415918'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336812314/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: sharp-suited Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises \"the realistic art of contemporary killing\".</p><p>This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is psychotic, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.</p><p>Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.</p><h2>Forgivable flaws</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417415919'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379334561650/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: there's a lot of driving</figcaption></figure><p>This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a <em>lot</em> of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think \"Ugh, not another car ride\". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call \"the exposition expedition\": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.</p><p>Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.</p><p>Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.</p><h2>Seductive vision</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417415920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336519788/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Los Santos is glitzily superficial</figcaption></figure><p>Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.</p><p>The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout, Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.</p><p>The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your sports car spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.</p><h2>Complicity and culpability</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417415921'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336675892/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: explosive action</figcaption></figure><p>And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. [Spoilers] Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim [spoiler ends]. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.</p><p>Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.</p><p>And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, \"you all live in Los Santos now\". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.</p><p><em>Tested on Xbox 360</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417398226|2013-09-16T15:48:00Z|c6d1dd598cc6e050e55d90ef6115fc63a5bd4f61 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Last week, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/sep/05/russell-brand-nazi-hugo-boss-charles-moore\" title=\"\"><strong>Russell Brand was in hot water again after cracking a Nazi joke</strong></a><strong> at the expense of GQ award sponsors, Hugo Boss. Here, he gives his side of the story:</strong></p><p>I have had the privilege of scuba diving. I did it once on holiday, and I'm aware that it's one of those subjects that people can get pretty boring and sincere about, and sincerity, for we British, is no state in which to dwell, so I'll be brief. The scuba dive itself was nuministic enough, a drenched heaven; coastal shelves and their staggering, sub-aquatic architecture, like spilt cathedrals, gormless, ghostly fish gliding by like Jackson Pollock's pets. Silent miracles. What got me, though, was when I came up for air, at the end. As my head came above water after even a paltry 15 minutes in Davy Jones's Locker, there was something absurd about the surface. How we, the creatures of the land, live our lives, obliviously trundling, flat feet slapping against the dust.</p><p>It must have been a while since I've attended a fancy, glitzy event, because as soon as I got to the GQ awards I felt like something was up. The usual visual grammar was in place – a carpet in the street, people in paddocks awaiting a brush with something glamorous, blokes with earpieces, birds in frocks of colliding colours that if sighted in nature would indicate the presence of poison. I'm not trying to pass myself off as some kind of Francis of Assisi, Yusuf Islam, man of the people, but I just wasn't feeling it. I ambled into the Opera House across yet more outdoor carpets, boards bearing branding, in this case Hugo Boss, past paparazzi, and began to queue up at the line of journalists and presenters, in a slightly nicer paddock who offer up mics and say stuff like:</p><p>\"Who are you wearing?\"</p><p>\"I'm not wearing anyone. I went with clobber, I'm not Buffalo Bill.\"</p><p>Noel Gallagher was immediately ahead of me in the press line and he's actually a mate. I mean, I love him: sometimes I forget he wrote Supersonic and played to 400,000 people at Knebworth because he's such a laugh. He laid right into me, the usual gear: \"What the fook you wearing? Does Rod Stewart know you're going through his jumble?\" I try to remain composed and give as good as I get, even though the paddock-side banter is accompanied by looming foam-tipped eavesdroppers, hanging like insidious mistletoe.</p><p>In case you don't know, these parties aren't like real parties. It's fabricated fun, imposed from the outside. A vision of what squares imagine cool people might do set on a spaceship. Or in Moloko. As we come out of the lift there's a bloody great long corridor flanked by gorgeous birds in black dresses, paid to be there, motionless, left hand on hip, teeth tacked to lips with scarlet glue. The intention, I suppose, is to contrive some Ian Fleming super-uterus of well fit mannequins to midwife you into the shindig, but me and my mate Matt just felt self-conscious, jigging through Robert Palmer's oestrogen passage like aspirational Morris dancers. Matt stared at their necks and I made small talk as I hot stepped towards the pre-show drinks. Now, I'm not typically immune to the allure of objectified women, but I am presently beleaguered by a nerdish, whirling dervish, and am eschewing all others. Perhaps the clarity of this elation has awakened me. A friend of mine said: \"Being in love is like discovering a concealed ballroom in a house you've long inhabited.\" I also don't drink, so these affairs where most people rinse away their Britishness and twitishness with booze are for me a face-first log flume of backslaps, chitchat, eyewash and gak.</p><p>After a load of photos and what-not, we descend the world's longest escalator, which are called that even as they de-escalate, and in we go to the main forum, a high ceilinged hall, full of circular cloth-draped, numbered tables, a stage at the front, the letters GQ, 12-foot high in neon at the back; this aside, though, neon forever the moniker of trash, this is a posh do, in an opera house full of folk in tuxes.</p><p>Everywhere you look there's someone off the telly; Stephen Fry, Pharrell, Sir Bobby Charlton, Samuel L Jackson, Rio Ferdinand, Justin Timberlake, foreign secretary William Hague and mayor of London Boris Johnson. My table is a sanctuary of sorts; Noel and his missus Sara, John Bishop and his wife Mel, my mates Matt Morgan, Mick and Gee. Noel and I are both there to get awards and decide to use our speeches to dig each other out. This makes me feel a little grounded in the unreal glare, normal.</p><p>Noel's award is for being an \"icon\" and mine for being an \"oracle\". My knowledge of the classics is limited, but includes awareness that an oracle is a spiritual medium through whom prophecies from the gods were sought in ancient Greece. Thankfully, I have a sense of humour that prevents me from taking accolades of that nature on face value, or I'd've been in the tricky position of receiving the GQ award for being \"best portal to a mystical dimension\", which is a lot of pressure. Me, Matt and Noel conclude it's probably best to treat the whole event as a bit of a laugh and, as if to confirm this as the correct attitude, Boris Johnson – a man perpetually in pajamas regardless of what he's wearing – bounds to the stage to accept the award for \"best politician\". Yes, we agree: this is definitely a joke.</p><p>Boris, it seems, is taking it in this spirit, joshing beneath his ever-redeeming barnet that Labour's opposition to military action in Syria is a fey stance that he, as GQ politician of the year, would never be guilty of.</p><p>Matt is momentarily focused. \"He's making light of gassed Syrian children,\" he says. We watch, slightly aghast, then return to goading Noel.</p><p>Before long, John Bishop is on stage giving me a lovely introduction, so I get up as Noel hurls down a few gauntlets, daring me to \"do my worst\".</p><p>I thanked John, said the \"oracle award\" sounds like a made-up prize you'd give a fat kid on sports day – I should know, I used to get them – then that it's barmy that Hugo Boss can trade under the same name they flogged uniforms to the Nazis under and the ludicrous necessity for an event such as this one to banish such a lurid piece of information from our collective consciousness.</p><p>I could see the room dividing as I spoke. I could hear the laughter of some and louder still silence of others. I realised that for some people this was regarded as an event with import. The magazine, the sponsors and some of those in attendance saw it as a kind of ceremony that warranted respect. In effect, it is a corporate ritual, an alliance between a media organisation, GQ, and a commercial entity, Hugo Boss. What dawned on me as the night went on is that even in apparently frivolous conditions the establishment asserts control, and won't tolerate having that assertion challenged, even flippantly, by that most beautifully adept tool: comedy.</p><p>The jokes about Hugo Boss were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them. They're not Monsanto or Halliburton, the contemporary corporate allies of modern-day fascism; they are, I thought, an irrelevant menswear supplier with a double-dodgy history. The evening, though, provided an interesting opportunity to see how power structures preserve their agenda, even in a chintzy microcosm.</p><p>Subsequent to my jokes, the evening took a peculiar turn. Like the illusion of sophistication had been inadvertently disrupted by the exposure. It had the vibe of a wedding dinner where the best man's speech had revealed the groom's infidelity. With Hitler.</p><p>Foreign secretary William Hague gave an award to former Telegraph editor Charles Moore, for writing a hagiography of Margaret Thatcher, who used his acceptance speech to build a precarious connection between my comments about the sponsors, my foolish answerphone scandal at the BBC and the Sachs family's flight, 70 years earlier, from Nazi-occupied Europe. It was a confusing tapestry that Moore spun but he seemed to be saying that a) the calls were as bad as the Holocaust and b) the Sachs family may not've sought refuge in Britain had they known what awaited them. Even for a man whose former job was editing the Telegraph this is an extraordinary way to manipulate information.</p><p>Noel, who is not one to sit quietly on his feelings, literally booed while Charles Moore was talking, and others joined in. Booing! When do you hear booing in this day and age other than pantomimes and parliament? Hague and Johnson are equally at home in either (Widow Twanky and Buttons, obviously) so were not unduly ruffled, but I thought it was nuts. The room by now had a distinct feel of \"us and them\" and if there is a line drawn in the sand I don't ever want to find myself on the same side as Hague and Johnson. Up went Noel to garner his gong and he did not disappoint: \"Always nice to be invited to the Tory party conference,\" he began, \"Good to see the foreign secretary present when there's shit kicking off in Syria.\"</p><p>Noel once expressed his disgust at seeing a politician at Glastonbury. \"What are you doing here? This ain't for you,\" he'd said. He explained to me: \"You used to know where you were with politicians in the 70s and 80s cos they all looked like nutters: Thatcher, Heseltine, Cyril Smith. Now they look normal, they're more dangerous.\" Then, with dreadful foreboding: \"They move among us.\" I agree with Noel. What are politicians doing at Glastonbury and the GQ awards? I feel guilty going, and I'm a comedian. Why are public officials, paid by us, turning up at events for fashion magazines? Well, the reason I was there was because I have a tour on and I was advised it would be good publicity. What are the politicians selling? How are they managing our perception of them with their attendance of these sequin-encrusted corporate balls?</p><p>We witness that there is a relationship between government, media and industry that is evident even at this most spurious and superficial level. These three institutions support one another. We know that however cool a media outlet may purport to be, their primary loyalty is to their corporate backers. We know also that you cannot criticise the corporate backers openly without censorship and subsequent manipulation of this information.</p><p>Now I'm aware that this was really no big deal; I'm not saying I'm an estuary Che Guevara. It was a daft joke by a daft comic at a daft event. It makes me wonder, though, how the relationships and power dynamics I witnessed on this relatively inconsequential context are replicated on a more significant scale.</p><p>For example, if you can't criticise Hugo Boss at the GQ awards because they own the event, do you think it is significant that energy companies donate to the Tory party? Will that affect government policy? Will the relationships that \"politician of the year\" Boris Johnson has with City bankers – he took many more meetings with them than public servants in his first term as mayor – influence the way he runs our capital?</p><p>Is it any wonder that Amazon, Vodafone and Starbucks avoid paying tax when they enjoy such cosy relationships with members of our government?</p><p>Ought we be concerned that our rights to protest are being continually eroded under the guise of enhancing our safety? Is there a relationship between proposed fracking in the UK, new laws that prohibit protest and the relationships between energy companies and our government?</p><p>I don't know. I do have some good principles picked up that night that are generally applicable: the glamour and the glitz isn't real, the party isn't real, you have a much better time mucking around trying to make your mates laugh. I suppose that's obvious. We all know it, we already know all the important stuff, like: don't trust politicians, don't trust big business and don't trust the media. Trust your own heart and each other. When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417226011|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|e7f65aedcfed448847d311c94460d4fc284789b7 -->",

Sweet, wonderful, fast, scary, difficult-to-play saviour of English cricket Boyd Rankin. The run rate is an ominous 6.66, but that's a beauty of a delivery, rising from a length and leaving Clarke's prod. Four dot balls then, before a late cut brings a single. Another dot finishes the over and that was a world away from everything else England have done today.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52372624e4b087760a08a750\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:39:16.723+01:00\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">30th over: Australia 202-3 (Watson 90, Clarke 71)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Remember when England were rampant and Australia were 48/3? That's ancient history now, as Australia are confident enough to take the powerplay in the 30th over.</p> <p>Clarke hammers the first delivery from Stokes through mid-on for four as the sun comes out again, but then misses out as he can only work a full toss for three. He then eases a gorgeous off-drive back down the ground off the back foot which just races away from Rankin to the rope. That's the 150 partnership and Clarke gets a single to keep the strike.</p> <p>&quot;Hi again&quot; says misery's Robin Hazelhurst. &quot;You know that thing about how you double the score after 30 overs to predict the score after 50, and you know that thing about how rubbish England are at chasing... By the by, what are the odds on glorious playing weather and nary a drop of wet stuff for the rest of the day?&quot; Slim I'd say looking at the forecast, and as someone who quite likes these England bowlers that's possibly a good thing.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-523724e2e4b0a1b6b45de190\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:33:54.740+01:00\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Any views on whether Samit should be in the team?&quot; asks Nick Butler. Um, I'm mixed on this one, as I like Samit and think he's a good batsman who never really lets England down, and has proved capable of batting very, very well. I'm not sure he's done it consistently enough though to merit being considered one of the best seven batsmen available, and he does still strike me as a little bit too much of the &quot;bits and pieces&quot; kind of cricketer I'd rather teams left behind.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5237242fe4b087760a08a74d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:30:55.810+01:00\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">29th over: Australia 189-3 (Watson 89, Clarke 59)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Two boundaries from the first three balls of the over for Clarke: the first crunched through square leg and the second (sigh) tickled to fine leg. Watson looks like he might have another with a crunching cut to backward point but Stokes makes another good diving stop. Nine from the overs and with umbrellas going up the players take drinks.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52372373e4b087760a08a74b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:27:47.622+01:00\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">28th over: Australia 180-3 (Watson 89, Clarke 50)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Joe Root is the answer to all England's problems. Possibly. He certainly bowls it a bit quicker and flatter than Tredwell, so may be harder to hit in the same kind of way as Samit Patel and Michael Yardy used to be. Clarke works a single into the on-side to bring up a good 50 from 58 balls, before Watson rocks back and muscles the ball to cow corner, where Stokes can't quite fling it back in play before landing his foot on the grass two yards beyond the rope.</p> <p>&quot;Given England have a spinner who's been tonked throughout the series, a batsman being picked as first choice seamer, a guy making his ODI debut and another making his series debut&quot; muses Kevin Wilson, &quot;why on earth was Wright picked to replace Trott. They should've picked a proper bowler and played Stokes at 7. This is going to be utter carnage.&quot;</p> <p>Also for those worried about potential pop culture spoilers cropping up, I promise I'm being careful.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52372223e4b0bdcddbf1fc95\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:22:11.181+01:00\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">27th over: Australia 171-3 (Watson 82, Clarke 49)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>I can't imagine the helplessness that Eoin Morgan must be feeling, with these two batsmen playing beautifully, and nowhere to turn away from these two bowlers. Lovely drive to extra cover for four more from Clarke makes this a record 4th wicket ODI partnership at this ground. Leg-side filth from Bopara off the penultimate ball and it's another four to the vacant fine leg.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:31:20.202+01:00\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52372171e4b087760a08a748\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:19:13.863+01:00\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">26th over: Australia 162-3 (Watson 81, Clarke 41)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Very neat from Clarke, stepping to the leg-side and flicking an inside-out drive to the cover boundary that's well stopped to keep it for two. Then he swings it away for four more over square leg, and I'm not sure I like cricket any more. This is horrible for the likeable Tredwell; why can't we be watching this happen to, oh let's say, Graeme Swann? Just ten from this over, which is exactly par for the last five.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-523720c1e4b0bdcddbf1fc94\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:16:17.944+01:00\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">25th over: Australia 152-3 (Watson 79, Clarke 33)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Bopara, England's equivalent of Australia's James Faulkner, curbs Australia's enthusiasm with an over that yields just three runs.</p> <p>&quot;Chris Jordan is known to the team as 'CJ'&quot; elaborates John Starbuck. &quot;It could be you are too young to be very much aware of The Fall &amp; Rise of Reginald Perrin. 'I didn't get where I am today by ....' was the catch-phrase of CJ, Perrin's boss.&quot; Ah, yep sorry. I'm of the Arrested Development era I'm afraid, although John Ashdown did suggest this may have been the case.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371ffbe4b087760a08a747\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:12:59.384+01:00\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">24th over: Australia 149-3 (Watson 78, Clarke 31)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>With each match in this series the talk of Graeme Swann's potentially forthcoming retirement from ODI cricket grows gradually quieter. This isn't a slight on Tredwell, a player I like a lot, but more reflection on the way Australia have decided to have a go at him. Joe Root watches the ball sail over his head from mid-on as Watson launches another six to bring up the hundred partnership from just 85 balls.</p> <p>After Breaking Bad earlier, I can't bear to see this happening to James Tredwell.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371f2ce4b087760a08a745\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:09:32.951+01:00\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">23rd over: Australia 141-3 (Watson 71, Clarke 30)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OOOOOOOH what an effort from Chris Jordan! Watson smashes a short one from Bopara flat over mid-wicket, and the leaping Jordan is probably less than a foot from reaching it for what would have been a quite sensational catch. As it, it's another six runs from the rapidly-accelerating Watson. Bopara then finds Watson's edge, but with no slip Carberry does well to cute it off at third man. He's now on to 71 from just 58 balls.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371e50e4b0a1b6b45de18c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:05:52.748+01:00\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">22nd over: Australia 129-3 (Watson 60, Clarke 29)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Clarke goes after Tredwell with a hack but can only get one. Watson shows his captain how to play prettily with a dab later than Ned Stark, which Kevin Pietersen can't keep from going for four. He then brings up his 50 with a single, his 30th century coming from 49 balls with half a dozen fours. Oof and then it's a very hard, fairly flat six over long-on. And then a slog sweep for four to cow corner means 17 from the over.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371d5ae4b0a1b6b45de18b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T16:01:46.445+01:00\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">21st over: Australia 112-3 (Watson 45, Clarke 27)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Again Australia have put together a strong partnership after losing a bunch of early wickets. It's almost as if Ravi Bopara isn't the man to keep the wicket-taking pressure up. If only I could think of a way England could improve that aspect of their game. &quot;Binary over&quot; says Michael Holding: 1-0-1-0-1-0.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371cb9e4b0a1b6b45de18a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:59:05.391+01:00\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">20th over: Australia 109-3 (Watson 44, Clarke 25)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here comes James Tredwell, who is wise enough to start around the wicket to Clarke. He's become something of a punchbag for the Australian batsmen so far, taking especially brutal punishment when coming over the wicket... which he now does to Watson after Clarke works him for a single. Watson paddles for the same result, before Clarke clones his previous scoring shot. With the final ball Tredwell pushes one through and beats Watson, who was looking to dab it down to third man. Good over though for England, with the run rate up to 6.60 for the last ten overs.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371bd9e4b087760a08a741\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:55:21.718+01:00\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">19th over: Australia 106-3 (Watson 43, Clarke 23)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>With Tredwell having been targetted so far in this series Ravi Bopara has been England's go-to containing bowler. It's tight stuff until he strays on to Watson's pads with the penultimate ball of the over and it's (I'm tired of typing this now) tickled down to fine leg for four.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371b19e4b0706f2d49f137\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:52:10.070+01:00\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">18th over: Australia 100-3 (Watson 38, Clarke 22)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Dragged short by Stokes and, not for the first time today, it's helped around the corner for four by Watson. Stokes then overcompensates with a length ball and Clarke George Baileys it straight back down the ground for a sweet six, his 50th in ODI cricket, and one which brings up 100. 11 from the over in just 18 overs. Ominous.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52371a36e4b0a1b6b45de188\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:48:22.508+01:00\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">17th over: Australia 89-3 (Watson 33, Clarke 16)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Morgan brings Ravi Bopara on. Six an over from here gets 290, which is the average score at this ground, and with these two settling in this could all go a bit Red Wedding. Sedate middle over here though, just three from it.</p> <p>&quot;Chris Jordan didn't get where he is today by not being heard about by cricket commentators&quot; huffs John Starbuck. I didn't say I hadn't heard of him, just that I hadn't seen much of him. I'm a Northants fan who spends a lot of time in North, so my chances to get to Sussex have been minimal. I did do a bit of research before starting this job though, you know?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5237195fe4b0a1b6b45de187\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:44:47.797+01:00\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">16th over: Australia 86-3 (Watson 32, Clarke 14)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Overpitched by Stokes, four more to long on for Watson. The Durham bowler's pitch map suggests that my earlier assertion that full is the way to go is way out, with a fair percentage of his full-length deliveries having been put away for four. Dropping it just slightly back is certainly more effective and he only concedes one more from the over.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5237186ce4b0706f2d49f134\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:40:45.004+01:00\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">15th over: Australia 81-3 (Watson 27, Clarke 14)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Jordan's gone for 7.20 an over so far, but this is far from the Dernbach-esque horror show that economy rate suggests. Another short loose one though and Clarke misses out thanks to a good stop from Stokes at backward point. The Sussex man improves things as he goes fuller and all Australia can get from the over is a worked single and a leg-bye before Jordan sends down his 4th and England's 6th wide.</p> <p>Gary Naylor's back: &quot;If Clarke's back means that he backs out of a match, the story becomes 'When's Clarke back?' and no cricket team's backers want to go back to the days of Michael Atherton, who was only ever one back spasm away from being left back at the team hotel. Though you wouldn't want to back a side whose skipper skips matches backing out with chronic back pain (even if you wouldn't back him to deal with back of a length deliveries from bowlers prepared to bend their backs and back their skills), the Aussies have to pick their men and back them all the way. And, as his deputy, Watson does not have many backers, so I guess Clarke simply has to put his back into it again and back his batsmen to score the runs and his fielders to back up his bowlers.&quot;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-523716e6e4b0706f2d49f132\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T15:34:14.235+01:00\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">14th over: Australia 78-3 (Watson 26, Clarke 14)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Stokes strays on to Watson's pads and it's more work on the boundary for Carberry to keep them to three.

The pacey Carberry goes after it and is inches away from brilliantly saving the boundary, alas his effort is for nought. I feel as though good length bowling is the way forward here, but Stokes is understandably keeping it back of a length after the Wade wicket and with Clarke's back being Clarke's back.

Round the decay<br /> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br /> The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p> </blockquote> <p>Afternoon folks. The good news first: what could easily have been a damp soggy wreck of a pointless series has actually shaped up quite nicely: a short, sharp, three match contest between two sides vying for second place in the ODI rankings (with a runaway leader a mile out of sight) boiling down to a decider on the picturesque south coast.</p> <p>A win for England would complete one of the most miserable tours in Australian memory. Failure to get out of the group, or even win a game, in the ICC Champions Trophy, nilled in the Ashes and now the prospect of losing an ODI series to what has widely been regarded as England's second string. The once great empire could turn to rubble, the shining monolith that is Michael Clarke headed out on a metaphorical dusty highway leaving only the wasteland of Australian cricket behind him, as England stand as conquerors of all.</p> <p>Alternatively an Australian win, although probably not enough to make up for the ignominy of all that has gone before this summer, would at least give them hope come November, and probably set up the next Ashes as a far more mouthwatering prospect than the one just gone. Their prospects won't be helped by an injury to Shaun Marsh nor doubts over the fitness of Clarke. They will however be boosted by the current good form of Mitchell Johnson and George Bailey, so this is a far more interesting match than any of us might have predicted.</p> <p>On the negative side though, rain is forecast from around 4pm. Ah well, we'll see how we go until then.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T13:22:37.913+01:00\">at 1.22pm BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417379632|2013-09-16T15:48:00Z|6c638775e178827d706f2b64823599e7e60bcbb0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The prime minister elect, Tony Abbott, has revealed a cabinet heavy on experience &ndash; 15 of his senior ministers served under John Howard &ndash; but light on female representation, with the deputy prime minister elect, Julie Bishop, the only woman in the 19-strong cabinet.</p> <p>Abbott said he was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; there were not &ldquo;at least two&rdquo; women in the cabinet, but said he expected women to be promoted over time, with &ldquo;good and talented&rdquo; women in the outer ministry &ldquo;knocking on the door&rdquo; of cabinet and more women &ldquo;knocking on the door&rdquo; of the outer ministry.</p> <p>But of the 11 members of the outer ministry only four are women and the only woman among the 12 parliamentary secretaries is Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who has been demoted from the outer ministry.</p> <p>Labor immediately targeted the absence of women in Abbott&rsquo;s frontbench line-up, with acting leader Chris Bowen pointing out &ldquo;the cabinet of Afghanistan now has more women in it than the cabinet of Australia&rdquo; and that the outgoing Labor government had had six women in cabinet.</p> <p>One of the biggest winners in Abbott&rsquo;s new ministry &ndash; which is largely unchanged from his shadow ministry &ndash; is Senator Mathias Cormann, promoted from shadow assistant treasurer to the important cabinet portfolio of finance after dogged work pursuing Labor&rsquo;s mining tax and explaining the Coalition&rsquo;s election costings.</p> <p>John Howard&rsquo;s former chief of staff, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, had been tipped for the job but is instead in the outer ministry as assistant treasurer.</p> <p>Abbott categorically denied this had anything to do with there being a &ldquo;cloud over Arthur&rdquo; because he may have to appear at a New South Wales corruption inquiry because of a directorship he once held. He said it was because he believed in stable and orderly succession. Cormann was previously shadow assistant treasurer and Sinodinos was shadow parliamentary secretary to Abbott.</p> <p>The shadow finance minister, Andrew Robb, has been shifted to the new portfolio of trade and investment. The Nationals normally take the trade portfolio but in the Abbott ministry, the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, takes on infrastructure and regional development.</p> <p>The Deputy Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, takes the agriculture portfolio, held in opposition by John Cobb, who has been dropped from the frontbench.</p> <p>Abbott said he had been very determined to reduce the length of ministerial titles because under Labor, titles had become so long that ministers may have needed &ldquo;oversize business cards&rdquo;.</p> <p>But he then had to spend much of his first press conference as prime minister elect explaining which ministers had responsibility for portfolios that no longer appear in any ministerial title.</p> <p>For example Kevin Andrews, as minister for social services, also has overall responsibility for aged care, but both aged care and disability services will be primarily handled by his assistant minister, Senator Mitch Fifield.</p> <p>Peter Dutton is minister for health and sport &ndash; the first time the sport portfolio has cabinet representation &ndash; and is also responsible for mental health.</p> <p>And although science, energy and resources are not mentioned in any ministerial title, all three will be the responsibility of industry minister Ian MacFarlane. He will also preside over domestic tourism, with international tourism becoming the responsibility of Bishop as minister for foreign affairs. Science policy &ldquo;as it pertains to universities&rdquo; will be the responsibility of education minister Christopher Pyne, a spokesman for Abbott said.</p> <p>Building on his &ldquo;slow and steady&rdquo; approach to assuming government, Abbott said he would not recall parliament until there was legislation for it to consider because he did not want to use it as &ldquo;a giant and expensive photo opportunity&rdquo;.</p> <p>And he confirmed that despite the coalition&rsquo;s dire pre-election warnings of a &ldquo;budget emergency&rdquo;, the mid-year budget review &ndash; traditionally released before the end of the year &ndash; could be deferred until January. Bowen accused the Coalition of trying to escape scrutiny by releasing the budget update during the Christmas holiday season.</p> <p>But Abbott said &ldquo;operation sovereign borders&rdquo; &ndash; aimed at &ldquo;stopping the boats&rdquo; would start as soon as the new government was sworn in on Wednesday.</p> <p>It was a &ldquo;stand or fall issue&rdquo; for his administration, Abbott said, and &ldquo;interdiction operations will change and become more forthright&rdquo; immediately.</p> <p>He confirmed he was strongly backing long-serving MP Bronwyn Bishop as speaker &ndash; a position that is elected by the party room.</p> <p>Winners in the new line-up include the Nationals senator Fiona Nash who is the new assistant health minister, the West Australian Liberal senator Michaelia Cash who becomes assistant immigration minister, and the South Australian MP Jamie Briggs who is the new assistant minister for regional development and infrastructure.</p> <p>Capable female backbenchers, including the Victorian MP Kelly O&rsquo;Dwyer, did not get a position.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417369495|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|29d36dbd373a23ad47a8331d924b9a8611e3ee31 -->",

        "headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action",
        "body":"<h2>Cleverley has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford</h2><p>Tom Cleverley's fight to keep his place in the Manchester United midfield began on Saturday when he was named a substitute for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league\" title=\"\">the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace</a>. Anderson, who took Cleverley's usual starting berth alongside Michael Carrick, offers no serious competition. But when the Brazilian's number was held up on 62 minutes Cleverley had to watch as United's new £27.5m acquisition, Marouane Fellaini, ambled on as the replacement. For Cleverley, also dropped by Roy Hodgson for England's recent World Cup qualifiers, the sight of the Belgian lining up ahead of him in David Moyes' strongest XI is one he may have to get used to. Unless, that is, Cleverley, now 24, can begin to convince his manager he can take hold of games for United. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><h2>Jol must balance his beauty</h2><p>If Fulham were ugly, Martin Jol might get a little less flak. Instead they are nearly beautiful, which is surely a most frustrating state of play. Dimitar Berbatov, Bryan Ruiz, Alexander Kacaniklic, Pajtim Dejagah, Ashgan Dejagah, Adel Taarabt ... so many players who tease fans with glimpses of perfection and appal them with lapses into incoherence. The clutch of fans who chanted \"Jol Out\" at the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/fulham-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league\" title=\"\">Saturday's draw with West Bromwich Albion</a> clearly believe the manager should have developed a system by now that wrings consistency and dynamism from his charges. The ones who did not may believe that will come – and when it does, Fulham will be a joy to behold. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p><h2>Barry and Osman instrumental in stalling Chelsea's chase</h2><p>Poor finishing and a lack of physicality up front appeared to be Chelsea's main problems <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/everton-premier-league-chelsea\" title=\"\">in defeat at Goodison Park</a>. Roberto Martínez, however, identified a different problem for the London side, albeit a nicer problem to have: their inexperience in chasing a game after Steven Naismith's header put Everton ahead on the stroke of half-time. The Everton manager said: \"Their quality behind that front man is as good as it gets and an incredible strength. They are very good at what they do but clearly they are a team that needs to keep a clean sheet to impose themselves. They had to push and that is not something they are used to doing. They don't chase score-lines very often so that worked in our favour, but it is easy to say it, very difficult to do it. I thought Gareth Barry and Leon Osman were magnificent in controlling that.\" Martínez was right on his midfield shield, who were able to train together for 10 days before the game having been overlooked for England's World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine. Their rapport was immediate, a reflection of two intelligent players. Ahead of them, however, John Terry and David Luiz gave the distinct impression they have yet to be introduced. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><h2>Rodwell fails to take his chance</h2><p>On a day when Gareth Barry excelled on his debut for Everton it felt rather poignant that Jack Rodwell should deliver a practically anonymous performance for Manchester City <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/stoke-city-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">in their goalless draw with Stoke</a>. The two players have indirectly swapped clubs and, as things stand, it appears Everton have got the better deal. Such a claim would have raised eyebrows six years ago when Rodwell became the youngest player in the Merseyside club's history to feature in a Europe fixture when, aged 16 years and 284 days, he came on as a substitute against AZ Alkmaar. Soon David Moyes was hailing him as the next Rio Ferdinand and the future seemed bright for a player blessed with athleticism and technique. But Rodwell's career had stalled and even gone backwards since his £12m move to City in August 2012 – in part, it has to be said, due to injury – and if Saturday represented his chance to get things back on track, then the 22-year-old did not seize the moment. Fernandinho is likely to replace him for Tuesday's Champions League visit to Viktoria Plzen and the feeling grows that, if Rodwell is ever to fulfil his potential, he will first have to leave Manchester. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p><h2>The dying art of tradition</h2><p>The latest protest against the plan of Hull City AFC's owner, Assem Allam, to change the club's name to Hull Tigers took place before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/hull-city-cardiff-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">the game against Cardiff City on Saturday</a> but, while clearly heartfelt, cannot be said to have attracted huge support. The sight of many Cardiff fans wearing the club's new red strip – despite the fact the 'Bluebirds' were playing in blue – was similarly depressing. The modern supporter, it seems, really does care more about which division the club is playing in, or the size of the transfer fund made available to the manager, than about tradition. <strong>Richard Rae</strong></p><h2>Aston Villa lacking goals and guile in midfield</h2><p>These are early days and it should not be overlooked that Aston Villa played Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool in their first three matches but it was still alarming to see Paul Lambert's side put on such a poor performance <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/aston-villa-newcastle-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Newcastle United</a>. Short of ideas going forward and fragile at the back, Villa were booed off. Take Christian Benteke out of the team and it is hard to imagine where the goals will come from. Certainly not midfield. Karim El Ahmadi, Fabian Delph and Ashley Westwood – the midfield three on Saturday – have played a combined 112 Premier League games. They have one goal (El Ahmadi) between them and seven assists (all Westwood). It would not be so bad if their presence gave Villa a more solid look defensively but the Midlands club have failed to keep a clean sheet in 26 league matches. The defence must take a large share of the blame for that record – the full-backs Matthew Lowton and Antonio Luna will not want to review footage of Newcastle's goals while there is always an air of vulnerability about central defence whatever pairing Lambert picks. At the same time it is hard to see how El Ahmadi, Delph and Westwood work as a midfield trio. El Ahmadi is the obvious fall guy. The replacement – a midfielder who is capable of breaking into the penalty area and has an eye for a killer pass – is harder to spot in the Villa squad. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p><h2>Sunderland fans should keep the faith</h2><p>One point from four games is a poor return for a Sunderland side approaching a formidable run of home fixtures and right now Paolo Di Canio's revolution looks fragile. It would be easy to hype next weekend's trip to West Brom as win or bust. But gelling 14 new summer signings and re-programming the club's entire mindset was never going to be easy; revolutions are rarely painless. Moreover <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/sunderland-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">Saturday's second half against Arsenal</a> saw a newly attack-minded Sunderland play some of their best quality football in a very long time. Significantly they drew praise from Arsène Wenger – a manager always somewhat keen on highlighting the Wearsiders' limitations in recent seasons under Martin O'Neill and Steve Bruce. Di Canio's strategy is courageous and he is clever enough to make it work. Sunderland fans should keep the faith. For the moment the manager and his players need time, patience and a psychologically important win at The Hawthorns. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p><h2>Lamela showed a professionalism above and beyond the call of duty</h2><p>Erik Lamela featured for eight minutes in Tottenham's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-norwich-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">2-0 victory over Norwich</a> on what was his home debut for the London club but it was remarkable the Argentina winger played at all given he went into the game having heard that his younger brother Axel had been kidnapped by armed carjackers in Buenos Aires. Fortunately the 18-year-old has been released without harm after a ransom of 5,000 pesos (£550) was paid to the criminals but that Lamela was able to commit to Spurs at all, given the circumstances, suggests the club's £30m summer signing is in possession of mental toughness as well as high-level technique. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p><h2>Osvaldo or Lambert?</h2><p>Mauricio Pochettino might have been being economical with the truth when he said he was happy with Rickie Lambert's partnership with Dani Osvaldo. In truth the pair rarely seemed to be in sync with each other during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/15/southampton-west-ham-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">goalless draw with West Ham</a>. It is true that both strikers could have scored with a bit more finesse and luck. Yet ultimately James Collins and Winston Reid were mostly unflustered in West Ham's defence. The problem for Pochettino is finding a way to accommodate the fans' favourite, Lambert, and the club's record signing, Osvaldo, while ensuring that Southampton's attack does not lose its balance. Pochettino might have to accept there is not room for both. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><h2>Chelsea signings may yet prove detrimental to their fluidity</h2><p>There was a sense last season that Chelsea were over-reliant on the talents of Juan Mata, Eden Hazard and Oscar to sparkle, deviously sneaking through gaps and picking locks as a conniving trio in their 4-2-3-1 system. Indeed, all three played more than 60 matches in the last campaign, developing an inevitable cohesion in the process. The club have made strides over the summer to alleviate this heavy workload with the signings of André Schürrle and Willian, as well as the return of Kevin De Bruyne from Werder Bremen on loan, but now José Mourinho has a new problem – getting the best from such similar attacking styles. Schürrle shone for Bayer Leverkusen cutting in from the left on to his right foot but Eden Hazard <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/14/everton-premier-league-chelsea\" title=\"\">played this role against Everton</a>, as he did in the previous three games, forcing the German to play unnaturally as a more orthodox right winger and blunting his effectiveness in the process. Willian is of much the same ilk, leaving Mourinho with three applicants and only one post. To compound the issue, Mata, Oscar and De Bruyne all prefer to operate in the middle. With no naturally right-sided player, Mourinho faces the bizarre situation of regularly playing someone in an unfamiliar role this season, despite the array of talent at his disposal. It appears unlikely the Premier League will see the Bundesliga-best of Schürrle any time soon and begs the question of whether Willian is a necessity or an unnecessary luxury. <strong>Lawrence Ostlere </strong></p><h2>Team of the week and stats of the week infographic</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417384101'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379325423772/Premier-League-infographi-001.jpg' alt='Premier League infographic' width='460' height='765' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Infographic courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\">WhoScored.com</a>, where you can find more stats, including live in-game data and unique player and team ratings  Photograph: WhoScored.com</figcaption></figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417346288|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|0a7e492b83511ac224ba41b70c949e246776a14e -->",

        "headline":"Inside the mind of NSA chief Gen Keith Alexander",
        "body":"<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p><p>It has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/crux-nsa-collect-it-all\">been previously reported</a> that the mentality of NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander is captured by his motto \"Collect it All\". It's a get-everything approach he pioneered first when aimed at an enemy population in the middle of a war zone in Iraq, one he has now imported onto US soil, aimed at the domestic population and everyone else.</p><p>But a perhaps even more disturbing and revealing vignette into the spy chief's mind comes from <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/09/08/the_cowboy_of_the_nsa_keith_alexander?page=full\">a new Foreign Policy article</a> describing what the journal calls his \"all-out, barely-legal drive to build the ultimate spy machine\". The article describes how even his NSA peers see him as a \"cowboy\" willing to play fast and loose with legal limits in order to construct a system of ubiquitous surveillance. But the personality driving all of this - not just Alexander's but much of Washington's - is perhaps best captured by this one passage, highlighted by PBS' News Hour in <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/09/nsa-director-modelled-war-room-after-star-treks-enterprise.html\">a post entitled</a>: \"NSA director modeled war room after Star Trek's Enterprise\". The room was christened as part of the \"Information Dominance Center\":</p><blockquote><p>\"When he was running the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Alexander brought many of his future allies down to Fort Belvoir for a tour of his base of operations, a facility known as the Information Dominance Center. It had been designed by a Hollywood set designer to mimic the bridge of the starship Enterprise from Star Trek, complete with chrome panels, computer stations, a huge TV monitor on the forward wall, and doors that made a 'whoosh' sound when they slid open and closed. Lawmakers and other important officials took turns sitting in a leather 'captain's chair' in the center of the room and watched as Alexander, a lover of science-fiction movies, showed off his data tools on the big screen.</p><p>\"'Everybody wanted to sit in the chair at least once to pretend he was Jean-Luc Picard,' says a retired officer in charge of VIP visits.\"</p></blockquote><p>Numerous commentators remarked yesterday on the meaning of all that (note, too, how \"Total Information Awareness\" was a major scandal in the Bush years, but \"Information Dominance Center\" - along with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining\">things like \"Boundless Informant\"</a> - are treated as benign or even noble programs in the age of Obama). </p><p>But now, on the <a href=\"http://www.dbia.com/\">website of DBI Architects, Inc.</a> of Washington and Reston, Virginia, there are what purports to be <a href=\"http://www.dbia.com/projectpage/LIWA.pdf\">photographs of the actual Star-Trek-like headquarters</a> commissioned by Gen. Alexander that so impressed his Congressional overseers. It's a 10,740 square foot labyrinth in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The brochure touts how \"the prominently positioned chair provides the commanding officer an uninterrupted field of vision to a 22'-0\" wide projection screen\":</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417346165'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379247148112/dbi.png' alt='DBI' width='460' height='333' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The glossy display further describes how \"this project involved the renovation of standard office space into a highly classified, ultramodern operations center.\" Its \"primary function is to enable 24-hour worldwide <br />visualization, planning, and execution of coordinated information operations for the US Army and other federal agencies.\" It gushes: \"The <br />futuristic, yet distinctly military, setting is further reinforced by the Commander's console, which gives the illusion that one has boarded <br />a star ship\":</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417346166'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379247182946/dbi2.png' alt='DBI' width='460' height='343' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Other photographs of Gen. Alexander's personal Star Trek Captain fantasy come-to-life (courtesy of public funds) are <a href=\"http://www.dbia.com/projectpage/LIWA.pdf\">here</a>. Any casual review of human history proves how deeply irrational it is to believe that powerful factions can be trusted to exercise vast surveillance power with little accountability or transparency. But the more they proudly flaunt their warped imperial hubris, the more irrational it becomes.</p><h2>Related issues</h2><p><strong>(1)</strong> Harvard Law Professor Yochai Benkler has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/13/nsa-behemoth-trampling-rights\">an excellent Op-Ed in the Guardian</a> arguing that the NSA is so far out-of-control that radical measures, rather than incremental legislative reform, are necessary to rein it in.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> The Federation of American Scientists' Steven Aftergood, usually a reform-minded transparency advocate somewhat hostile to massive leaks, <a href=\"http://blogs.fas.org/secrecy/2013/09/snowden-fisc/\">examines the serious reform</a> which Snowden's disclosures are enabling, as reluctantly acknowledged even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/edward-snowden-nsa-disclosures-judge\">by the FISA court</a> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-clapper-snowden-disclosures-20130912,0,7438979.story\">James Clapper himself</a>.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> British comedian Russell Brand attended an event sponsored by GQ and Hugo Boss and gave a speech, while accepting an award, which offended almost everyone in the room (that speech is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inB-6R1-4ng&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">here</a>).

She pleaded not guilty to a charge of witness intimidation last week while wearing a veil.</p><p>Directions for the trial, due to take place in November, will also prohibit courtroom artists from making any sketch or drawing of the defendant without her niqab. Only the judge, jury and legal counsel will be able to see D's face when she gives evidence.</p><p>Murphy, who received submissions from both prosecution and defence, said there was no clear legal authority to resolve the problem. It had consequently \"resulted in widespread judicial anxiety and uncertainty and a reluctance to address the issue\". The niqab, he said, had become \"the elephant in the courtroom\".</p><p>He continued: \"Whether or not there is an obligation to wear the niqab is not a subject of universal agreement within Islam; rather, it is a choice made by individual women on a personal basis.\" That choice, nonetheless, should be \"respected as a manifestation of religion or belief\".</p><p>The issue, the judge said, was how to balance the defendant's right to manifest her religion or belief, as set out by article 9 of the European convention on human rights, against the public interest in the courts conducting criminal proceedings \"in accordance with the rule of law, open justice, and the adversarial trial process\".</p><p>Necessary and proportionate restrictions could be imposed on religious freedoms, <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/The%20Queen%20-v-%20D%20%28R%29.pdf\" title=\"\">the judgment said</a>. The European court of human rights, it noted, has recently upheld a ban on a nurse wearing a cross at work on safety grounds.</p><p>Murphy added: \"The ability of the jury to see the defendant for the purposes of evaluating her evidence is crucial … The right to give evidence involves a corresponding duty to submit that evidence to the scrutiny of the jury.\"</p><p>Similar compromises have been established at airport security checks or when obtaining a passport, he said. The judge had earlier warned that she would have to show her face to be properly identified. However, he backed down last Thursday and permitted her to enter the dock after she had been identified in a private room by a female police officer.</p><p>The Metropolitan police constable, who was present when the defendant was photographed following her arrest in June, then swore on oath that she was in the dock.</p><p>A niqab covers the face, with a slit for the eyes. It is commonly worn in the Saudi Arabian peninsula and many other Muslim countries.</p><p>The National Secular Society objected to Murphy's ruling and said it would lodge an official complaint. \"It is vital that defendants' faces are visible at all times, including while others are giving evidence, so we regret the judge's decision not to require this,\" said the organisation's executive director, Keith Porteous Wood. \"We will be complaining to the Office of Judicial Complaints and also be asking senior legal officers to make visibility throughout court hearings mandatory, and not subject to judges' discretion.\"</p><p>The defendant's barrister, Susan Meek, had argued it would breach her client's human rights and be counter to Britain's tolerance of Islamic dress if she had to remove her veil against her wishes during the trial.</p><p>\"She is entitled to wear it in private and in public,\" Meek said last week. \"That right to wear the niqab also extends to the courtroom. There is no legislation in the UK in respect of the wearing of the niqab. There is no law in this country banning it.</p><p>\"The jury will be able to determine her demeanour while wearing the veil. Demeanour is not just how their mouth moves, it is how their head moves, their eyes move, their hands move. That will be fully visible to the jury and no bar to her giving evidence.\"</p><p>The judgment came on the day that the deputy prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/16/veils-classrooms-airport-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg, said he did not believe it was \"appropriate\" for students to wear a full veil in the classroom</a> or for people to go through airport security with their faces covered.</p><p>Clegg told the BBC: \"I think it is very un-British to start telling people what pieces of clothing they should wear. I think there are exceptions to that as far as the full veil is concerned – security at airports, for instance. It is perfectly reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate there.</p><p>\"And I think in the classroom, there is an issue of course about teachers being able to address their students in a way where they can address them face to face. I think it is quite difficult in the classroom to be able to do that.\"</p><p>The Home Office minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/16/debate-muslim-veil-lib-dem-minister\" title=\"\">Jeremy Browne earlier called for a national debate</a>  on whether the state should step in to prevent young women having the veil imposed on them.</p><p>That intervention was sparked by a row over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/birmingham-college-muslim-veils\" title=\"\">the decision by Birmingham Metropolitan College to drop a ban on the wearing of full-face veils</a>. Browne said he was \"instinctively uneasy\" about restricting religious freedoms, but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417398573|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|7934e8fbbe30c71ba8fc70f5407fea9b190ad1c5 -->",

Russia did agree in Geneva that chapter 7 is mentioned specifically as the route for compliance if there is non-compliance or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria.

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for viewers who have seen Breaking Bad season five, episode 14 – Ozymandias.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/09/breaking-bad-recap-season-five-episode-13-tohajiilee\" title=\"\">Click here to read Richard's episode 13 blogpost</a></p><h2>'I've still got things left to do'</h2><p>It's not often the bad guy gets to ride off into the sunset. But that's what it felt like as Walt sat waiting for Saul's guy in the same roadside extraction point where Jesse sat a few weeks ago, and then climbed into an innocuous people carrier. Behind him, the concrete looked like a mountain graveyard; in front of him, three bags and a barrel full of cash: the high price for all the bodies he has left behind.</p><p>If Breaking Bad has been about watching Mr Chips transform into Scarface, as creator Vince Gilligan has often said, this episode seemed in part to be about Walt acknowledging it – but also recognising that he has come to the end of his \"empire business\", as suggested by the title's reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias\" title=\"\">the Shelley poem Ozymandias</a>. At every turn, as he wrestled with his two halves, the right and wrong, the White and the Heisenberg, he seemed to choose to be the danger, the one who knocks, psyching himself up after Hank's murder to sell out Jesse (\"found him\"); being out-played by the meth Nazis; abducting Holly after realising that Skyler and Junior have turned against him; finally abandoning everyone to make a run for it by himself.</p><p>Before we return to last week's excruciating cliffhanger, there's time to reflect: a flashback to the first time we were out here in the desert. We're back in the RV – and it's almost like a dream playing out in Walt's head, as we're reminded of a time when Skyler was happy to be making \"nine bucks\" on eBay, when Walt could still get away with a lie about pulling overtime in the car wash, and when a knife block could sit innocently on the kitchen counter. Then, as Walt's impromptu chemistry lesson fades (remember when he was a teacher?), it's time to return to the brutal present: \"the reaction has begun\" indeed.</p><p>Walt pleads with Uncle Jack for Hank's life: \"He's family.\" Seasoned pros Jack and Hank both seem to be on the same page, and know even $80m isn't enough to buy his way out. As Hank points out, \"You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see – he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.\" Not only has Walt's gambit to save Hank failed, but he has also just given up the location of his DIY desert bank (\"pretty specific instructions\").</p><p>Then he sells Jesse out, with a \"found him.\" Even in that terrible moment, was there a flicker of Mr White there? Did he try to run the angles, come up with some final \"yeah, science!\" moment to save Jesse before deciding that it was all over? Instead, it's Todd who comes to the rescue, pointing out that it might be wise to interrogate Jesse first. \"I mean, he might have told them some stuff that might not be too good for us.\" (His \"aw shucks\" blankness may actually hide a shrewd operator.) Then, the first of tonight's bombshells, as Walt seems to tip headfirst into the darkness: \"I watched Jane die. I was there and I watched her die. I watched her overdose and choke to death. I could have saved her. But I didn't.\" For all his ambiguity over the series, his wavering on the line, this was so cruel – sending Jesse off to die with this final revelation to break him. It's unlikely to be the \"fast and painless\" hit Walt ordered, but at least it will be out of his sight, unlike Hank.</p><p>That shot of Walt catching his breath, glimpsing himself in the rear view mirror, seemed to say it all as he took stock – he's alive, there's cash in the car, and blood on his hands – as he turned to look at the fresh marks in the dust, the hole he dug to hide the money now a ready-made grave for Hank and Gomez. Time for another twist in the desert: a bullet hole in Walt's fuel tank means he's out of petrol, leaving him with one option, to walk. Walt rolled his last barrel through the sand, like Donkey Kong unleashed from the top of his ladders (it's lucky he didn't hide it in boxes).</p><p>Elsewhere, a whirlwind of emotion and chaos: Marie still thinks Hank has arrested Walt, and finds it in her heart to try to save Skyler, restraining her tendency to overdramatise with a simple: \"I will support you through this.\" Her condition is tonight's second revelation, as Skyler's hand is forced. Walt Jnr has to be told – before he finds out from someone else. And in turn, Junior's clear logic cuts through to Skyler (\"If all this is true and you knew about it, you're as bad as him\"), and she sees Walt again as the monster she has to protect her children from.</p><p>Back at the White house there's more panic. Walt is ready to run, to get Skyler and Junior to chuck a few things in a bag and get out – \"I will discuss all of this later\" – but they refuse. Walt's left alone again, alienated from the family he has used for so long to justify his actions. Breaking Bad has had more of its fair share of violent scenes that linger in the memory – Gus adjusting his tie with half his face blown off, Danny Trejo's head on a tortoise, the kid assassin who shot Combo and cycled off. But this fight was especially painful to watch. The stakes seemed so high with Junior and Holly in the room, the knife flailing around – it looked at one point as if he might get stabbed. Instead, Junior protects his mother. \"I need the police – my dad, he pulled a knife on my mom. He attacked her, he's dangerous.\" It's a cold reminder of the \"domestic situation\" distress call Skyler made to have Walt removed from the premises back when they were both keeping the truth from Junior.</p><h2>'You're always whining and complaining while I do everything'</h2><p>Walt runs off with Holly, his blood staining her pink and white jacket, Skyler left distraught in the middle of the street. He calls to unleash a tirade of abuse – \"This is your fault. I warned you for a solid year – you cross me, there will be consequences. You never believed in me, you were never grateful …\" After his demolition job on Jesse, it's like he has been possessed as he mimics her \"whining\" (\"It's immoral! It's illegal!\"). But is there more to the conversation than just his ego being unleashed? Is he giving her a way out, calculating that there would be a trace on the line, the police listening as he took full responsibility for everything, absolving her as he says: \"I built this – <em>me</em>. Me alone, nobody else. You mark my words, Skyler, toe the line. Or you will wind up just like Hank.\" What is it that he has left to do? Save Jesse? Get the money back? Get them all out of there? Just two episodes left now. It's going to be a long week.</p><h2>Notes, observations and best lines</h2><p>• \"My name is ASAC Schrader and you can go fuck yourself\". Adios, Hank.</p><p>• \"Yo! So what's next?\" If only you knew, Season-One Jesse.</p><p>• \"What's with all the greed here? It's unattractive.\" Maybe it's because he reminds me of Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future, but Uncle Jack does seem like a pretty fair sort of guy if you're in his good books – $11m is not a bad pay-off. Even his \"Woah, simmer down there, Sparky\" had a certain wit.</p><p>• \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" Todd … emotes … again.</p><p>• \"Good to go?\" Colder than a trip to Belize.</p><p>• \"Mama\" – was this Holly's first dialogue on the show?</p><p>• \"I will support you through this.\" Sisters, doing it for themselves.</p><p>• A word on Jesse's face: did Uncle Jack's crew bust up the other eye to mirror the one Hank pulped? How long does Todd plan on keeping him around, chained like a \"rabid dog\"?</p><p>• \"Found him.\" \"Let's cook.\" \"I negotiated.\" You really know you're in the endgame when a show can pull out so many meaningful two-word sentences.</p><p>• \"You stupid bitch.\" Was this the first time Walt has used Jesse's catchphrase?</p><p>• \"Flynn? Could you put your seatbelt on? Please, it's not safe.\" Breaking Bad really is doing its bit for seatbelt awareness, isn't it? (Somehow, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader\" title=\"\">I could see Walt voting for Ralph Nader</a>, the independent presidential candidate who campaigned for car safety in the 1960s.)</p><p>• This episode was directed by Brick and Looper director <a href=\"http://www.rcjohnso.com\" title=\"\">Rian Johnson</a>, who also directed the great \"bottle\" episode Fly back in season three, and Fifty-One at the start of season five (when Walt splashed out on a swanky new car for Walt Jnr).</p><p>• Anyone in need of a little light relief? How about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duKL2dAJN6I\" title=\"\">Jimmy Fallon's Joking Bad</a> or the adventures of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSERsmbOdM\" title=\"\">Heisenberg and Pinkman</a>?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417393525|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|807cab7406703ebe75214c9897c84a34a167efeb -->",

        "headline":"Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool's new signings signify promising future",
        "body":"<p>Brendan Rodgers has claimed the deadline day signings of Mamadou Sakho and Tiago Ilori can protect Liverpool in central defence for the next decade, as he prepares to take a \"more pragmatic\" team back to Swansea City on Monday night.</p><p>The Liverpool manager returns to his former club with a wealth of options in central defence having spent £16m on Sakho and £7m on Ilori on the final day of the transfer window. Kolo Touré is also in contention having recovered quicker than expected from a groin injury but faces a fight to dislodge Martin Skrtel following his outstanding display alongside Daniel Agger in Liverpool's last outing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/01/liverpool-manchester-united-matchreport\" title=\"\">a victory against Manchester United</a> that maintained their 100% start to the new season.</p><p>While the 20-year-old Ilori falls into the \"one for the future\" bracket at Liverpool, the France international Sakho is pressing for inclusion following his move from Paris Saint-Germain. The 23-year-old is one of the most expensive defensive signings in Liverpool's history, despite having only 12 months remaining on his PSG contract, but Rodgers believes the Anfield club had to address their long-term needs and improve competition in central defence.</p><p>\"I wanted to try and protect the present and the future of the club,\" said Rodgers, who will be without the injured Glen Johnson at Swansea. \"Good centre-halves are so hard to find. You look at some teams and they have ageing centre-halves because it is a struggle to get a really good one.</p><p>\"We were fortunate in that two became available. One we had been tracking for a year in Tiago Ilori, a young talent who can be a big talent. He is 6ft 3in, super quick, powerful, can jump. He just needs to adapt to the pace and physicality of the Premier League. He is one for the future but he can be a really big talent.</p><p>\"Sakho is 23 but he is an experienced player, he has senior international caps and looks an absolute monster in training. He is one who is ready for now and that is what we want. We had a chance to protect the club for maybe the next 10 years and that is what we have done.\"</p><p>Liverpool are yet to concede a goal in the Premier League this season and the dilemma over whether to field Touré, impressive before his injury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/27/liverpool-notts-county-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">in the Capital One Cup</a>, Skrtel on the back of his dominant United display, Ilori, Sakho or Agger does not concern Rodgers. \"What we are doing here means we will never be reliant on one player, the whole make up is about the team so that we can take one in and put one in and still be strong,\" he said. \"They will get their chance. Martin Skrtel took his chance and that is their job. Every day in training I assess who is on form and who has the desire to be in the team. It is not a problem.\"</p><p>Liverpool have won all their league games 1-0 this season and, in the second half of matches especially, have shown a resilience not always evident during Rodgers's first campaign in charge. \"We have been more pragmatic and that is part of the growth of the team,\" he said. \"It doesn't just happen. I think sometimes when you come in as a coach and you have a certain philosophy about the way you want to play, people think it is only about the ball. They just concentrate on the football, but it is not that. Of course you have to have courage to play and pass, but you have to have the steel and that will and desire to win games.</p><p>\"Over the period of time that message has got through. Over the last six or seven months that is being proven on the field. In each of the three games this season we have shown that. Hopefully we will continue to show all those fighting qualities. I said last year that we would get better and better in the second half of the season and I think it will be the same this&nbsp;season.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417324548|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|9c6325684c860729a140a8942047eed7de43283e -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>1\tGoing for gold</strong></h2><p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2013/sep/10/apple-unveils-iphone-5s-iphone-5c-video\" title=\"\"> iPhone 5s is the true next-generation iPhone</a>, in a choice of gold, white and black. It is more expensive at a SIM-free price of £549, £629 and £709 for the 16GB, 32GB and 64GB models, with the leather case costing £35. But it's the 5s that has all the new hardware features.</p><h2><strong>2 \tC is for Colourful</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 5c is essentially last year's iPhone 5 in more colourful clothing. It has a larger battery and better front-camera than the iPhone 5, and its SIM-free price will be £469 for the 16GB model and £549 for the 32GB model when it goes on sale on 20 September.</p><h2><strong>3\tWhen I'm 64-bit</strong></h2><p>Apple is shouting about its A7 processor and its \"desktop-class\" 64-bit computing capabilities. The company claims it's twice as fast at CPU and graphics tasks, with an emphasis on bigger, richer games. Expect overuse of the phrase \"console-quality\" from developers.</p><h2><strong>4\tWhirled in motion</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 5's innards also include an M7 \"motion coprocessor\" designed to collect data from its accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. This is big news for health apps tracking your activity throughout the day, although possibly not-so-good news for companies like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/feb/19/fitbit-fitness-apps\" title=\"\">Fitbit</a> who make external gadgets to measure it.</p><h2><strong>5\tPrints charming</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 5s has a fingerprint sensor built into its Home button. It scans your fingerprint and stores it, so you can unlock the phone and authorise iTunes/App Store purchases with a touch.</p><h2><strong>6\tPicture this</strong></h2><p>Apple has improved the camera in the 5s, but not with more megapixels. Instead, it sports a better lens and sensor to let in more light, better colour and less noise. The flash is smarter too.</p><h2><strong>7\tBuy one, get five apps free</strong></h2><p>Apple has traditionally charged for its flagship Keynote, Pages, Numbers, iPhoto and iMovie iOS apps. Now it's making them all free for people buying any new iOS device – iPad and iPod touch included.</p><h2><strong>8\tDeadly 7</strong></h2><p>Hardware is good, but it's Apple's new software that holds the most changes. <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/ios/\" title=\"\">iOS 7</a> debuts on 18 September with a new look and new features. More battery-efficient multitasking; a much better Photos app; AirDrop to ping photos, videos and contacts to nearby iOS devices; and a smarter Siri that can now access Twitter.</p><h2><strong>9\tApps for that…</strong></h2><p>Developers got their hands on an early version of iOS 7 in June, and have been working on their apps accordingly. Expect a flurry of updates around the 18th making use of the software's new features.</p><h2><strong>10\tRadio rocks</strong></h2><p>One of iOS 7's other big features is iTunes Radio, a music app that serves up radio-like streams of songs based on artists or genres. It'll be free but for now it'll only be available in the US.</p><p>• The headline and intro on this article were amended on 15 September<br />to reflect that this article is not a review</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417249068|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|9a9bbcd93f21b5c6e2a51d4ea4e4924c83f4f091 -->",

        "body":"<p>Billy Connolly has undergone surgery for prostate cancer and is being treated for the \"initial symptoms\" of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>The 70-year-old comedian and actor, who rose to fame on the Scottish folk music scene, will continue to work in TV and on stage.</p><p>His spokeswoman said: \"Billy Connolly recently underwent minor surgery in America after being diagnosed with the very early stages of prostate cancer. The operation was a total success, and Billy is fully recovered.</p><p>\"In addition, Billy has been assessed as having the initial symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for which he is receiving the appropriate treatment.</p><p>\"Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.\"</p><p>The Glasgow-born star, affectionately known as the Big Yin, began his working life in the Clyde shipyards but soon moved into entertainment with folk singing and comedy performances.</p><p>A string of appearances on Michael Parkinson's chatshow made him a household name and helped launch a career that saw him perform sellout stand-up shows around the world, present a series of documentaries and become an in-demand character actor.</p><p>He is married to the New Zealand-born actor and psychologist Pamela Stephenson, whose biography of her husband, simply called Billy, was a bestseller.</p><p></p><p>He is one of around 127,000 Britons with Parkinson's, which is caused by a loss of brain cells that produce a chemical messenger called dopamine.</p><p>Symptoms differ from case to case but often include a tremor or fine shake while the person is at rest, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement and unsteady balance. Other symptoms can include memory loss.</p><p>Earlier this year Connolly said he had started to forget his lines during performances. He said: \"This is fucking terrifying. I feel like I'm going out of my mind.\"</p><p>There is no cure for Parkinson's and scientists have been unable to work out why people get the condition. Symptoms can be controlled using a combination of drugs, therapies and occasionally surgery, but often more care and support may be needed as they progress.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/08/bob-hoskins-retire-parkinsons\" title=\"\">The actor Bob Hoskins announced his retirement last year after being diagnosed with the disease</a>.</p><p>The disease was identified by – and named after – Dr James Parkinson, who wrote An Essay on the Shaking Palsy in 1817, which established it as a recognised medical condition.</p><p>Connolly was made a CBE in the 2003 Queen's birthday honours and awarded the freedom of his home city in 2010.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417383118|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|834544601c03de9252a7c15f04db83d78af0a341 -->",

        "headline":"What are the best non-alcoholic drinks to have with food?",
        "body":"<p>For non-drinkers, eating out can be a depressing experience. As friends deliberate over a heavy wine menu and the sommelier makes recommendations that promise an ambrosial marriage between food and drink, deciding whether to opt for still or sparkling water feels a touch boring.</p><p>But despite the soft drinks market growing 3.3% last year, and a bewildering array of smoothies, energy drinks and, most recently, coconut waters flooding supermarket shelves, few are food friendly. \"There's this implicit idea when you go for a meal that there's nothing good that goes with food,\" says <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/my-life-in-food-tony-conigliaro-mixologist-8609764.html\" title=\"\">award-winning mixologist Tony Conigliaro</a>, designer of the drinks menu at the recently opened <a href=\"http://www.grainstore.com/?gclid=CMii5vPpwLkCFS3HtAoddnYAVg\" title=\"\">Grain Store</a>, who created a bespoke nonalcoholic range that offers the same food-matching flavours as wine. \"Soft drinks and fruit juices are full of sugar,\" he says, \"but you can have savoury flavours that actually complement what's going on in the food.\" Take his hay and grass water, designed to match a dish flavoured with smoked hay: \"It's had a great reception, and people have opted out of drinking alcohol because they've got these options.\"</p><p>Alcohol consumption outside the home fell by 30% between 2006 and 2011, and as many as 15% of the UK population describe themselves as teetotal. For Jameel Lalani, founder of boutique tea company Lalani &amp; Co, it's part of a wider trend towards towards lighter dining embodied by restaurants like Gauthier, which focuses on vegetables and puts calorie counts on the menu. \"People are looking at food and health as one and the same, instead of being separate,\" Lalani says. \"They're moving from having just alcohol all the time to half bottles, lighter styles of wine, and now away from wine to nonalcoholic offerings.\"</p><p>But pairing nonalcoholic drinks and food brings its own challenges. \"Alcoholic drinks have a length, they have a structure and a texture,\" says Conigliaro. \"Other drinks don't have that, even the ones supposedly designed for the nonalcoholic market.\" His response was to bring the same molecular techniques from cocktail making – his bar, <a href=\"http://69colebrookerow.com/\" title=\"\">69 Colebrooke Row</a>, boasts an in-house laboratory – to fashion nonalcoholic drinks that approach the complexity of wine: \"By adding bitter notes, tannic notes, polyphenols, you can create these natural structures that stretch the flavour out. It's like you're trying to entertain the brain for longer.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://hkklondon.com/\" title=\"\">HKK</a>, the latest offering from the Hakkasan group, has also launched a nonalcoholic range, a decision born out of what head sommelier Serdar Balkaya sees as a responsibility to its customers: \"We should provide options to anybody. To Hindus, if they don't eat beef, or non-pork dishes if they're Muslim. And we should provide drinks to people who don't drink alcohol as well.\" Like Grain Store, HKK's nonalcoholic Orchard drinks are made from fruit and vegetable blends, but restaurants like <a href=\"http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gauthier Soho</a> are also experimenting with teas. Lalani, who designed Gauthier's tea flight, argues that tea's 5,000-year history, and the impact of soils, altitude and ageing methods, give it a similar complexity to wine that's only starting to be explored for food pairings.</p><p>\"The fundamentals are the same,\" he says. \"You want to match intensity, strength, you either want to complement flavours or contrast. But beyond the rules – like how you'd have a particular wine with a particular dish – it's largely a blank state.\" Lalani's tea sommelier training programme, which they've been running for the past two years, has seen an upsurge in interest from sommeliers looking to expand their knowledge, and who are especially intrigued by how different brewing methods and temperatures impact on an individual tea's taste. \"It's an extra skill for really ambitious sommeliers to take on, and adds another level to their role. There's more than just selection and storage.\"</p><p>But even if you have neither a tea sommelier nor a cocktail laboratory to hand, making drinks at home to complement food isn't tricky. \"Say you're having a bolognese, you can make a basil water,\" says Conigliaro. \"Two or three basil leaves, stir them into iced water, and you'll get that beautiful perfume. All you need to do is release some of the essential oils, and herbs are great for that because they've got a quick release.\" As with food, it's about experimenting. If you aren't going to reach for a ready meal, why settle for a Coke? \"People need to be more adventurous,\" agrees Balkaya. \"Try things. Get some orange peel, cinammon, cloves. Just boil them up into syrups, mix them up and see what happens.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417066492|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|0f0cd01d895f31963266611da3a540486ab490a1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Do we really want a \"national debate\" about veiling? A Home Office minister, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lib-dem-minister-jeremy-browne-2276761\" title=\"\">Jeremy Browne, thinks so</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/french-veil-ban-woman-niqab-fined\" title=\"\">France banned</a> the wearing of the full-face veil in public in 2010 with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/22/belgium-burqa-ban\" title=\"\">Belgium following</a> not long after. Their debates have been bitter and divisive.</p><p></p><p>Browne is reflecting a swirl of conflicting pressures. Some women's groups want liberation from social authoritarianism. Others want to be left to express their religion as they see fit. Many institutions, schools, colleges, hospitals, the courts, the police need to be able to identify their clients and the public.</p><p></p><p>Many Britons clearly resent what they perceive as newcomers eager to benefit from British public services yet refusing to accept even a minimum of conformity. Others cherish freedom in all its forms, including sometimes the freedom to behave in what might be considered by others an illiberal fashion.</p><p></p><p>Certainly, the predicament of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5411954.stm\" title=\"\">Jack Straw MP, who stated publicly </a>that he asks the women who visit him in his constituency if they would mind removing the niqab, is understandable. If the police can ban hoodies in parts of town centres because they obscure their cameras, why not other forms of dress? Teachers must be able to distinguished between pupils in class. Those who wish to make use of public services must expect to identify themselves somehow.</p><p></p><p>Yet the point of a national debate is to yield a national decision. In this case it is not clear whether such a decision is really needed. The sight of totally hooded people wandering the streets may spook some people and can sometimes pose a security threat to police but it is hardly widespread or a menace to the state and society. Blind people manage without being able to see the people with whom they deal.</p><p></p><p>The calm answer has to be to deny this as a national crisis. Individuals and institutions should be able to make their own decisions <em>ad hoc</em>. Some authorities, possibly schools and colleges in populated Muslim areas and certainly the justice system, clearly regard obscured faces as a practical problem. They should make their own decisions, consulting and defending them in their local circumstances.</p><p></p><p>The state, and the law, must stand behind such decisions and, where appropriate, support them. But a national debate, a national decision, another France? The game is not worth the candle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417377801|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|d666a023c106e6561e9bb029f554f411340e0083 -->",

        "headline":"Iran's Rouhani may meet Obama at UN after American president reaches out",
        "body":"<p>An exchange of letters between Barack Obama and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has set the stage for a possible meeting between the two men at the UN next week in what would be the first face-to-face encounter between a US and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution.</p><p>Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, is also due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at the UN general assembly meeting in New York, adding to guarded optimism that the June election of Rouhani, a Glasgow-educated moderate, and his appointment of a largely pragmatic cabinet, has opened the door to a diplomatic solution to the 11-year international standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.</p><p>Tehran took the Foreign Office by surprise, tweeting on Rouhani's English-language feed that the president would also be prepared to meet Hague, something the UK had not even requested.</p><p>\"Tehran has responded positively to UK's request. President Rouhani's meeting w/WilliamJHague on the sidelines of UNGA has been confirmed,\" the tweet said.</p><p>\"We would be happy to meet,\" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said, \"but we have had nothing formal from Tehran about it.\"</p><p>Diplomats said that the tweet reflected the new Iranian government's eagerness to make diplomatic headway on the nuclear issue, which has been at an impasse for several years. A Hague meeting with either Rouhani or Zarif could clear the way to restoring full diplomatic ties, which have not existed since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011.</p><p>In a television interview aired on Sunday, Obama made clear that there was a diplomatic opening with Iran, not only over the nuclear question but also over Syria. He confirmed earlier reports that he and Rouhani had \"reached out\" to each other, exchanging letters.</p><p>US officials were sceptical about a Rouhani meeting, but some observers said the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons has opened new space for global diplomacy.</p><p>Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and an expert on US-Iran diplomacy, said \"I think there is a chance [of a meeting]. It would be a strong political push for movement. If Obama got involved, it would be the infusion of political will needed to reach an agreement.</p><p>\"Tehran is already claiming some of the credit for the Syria deal. Rouhani needs to show that through his diplomatic efforts he has already avoided a war. He is desperate in his first six months to show his approach has paid more dividends than the hardline approach of his predecessor.\"</p><p>Parsi added that if Obama was to meet Rouhani it was likely to be an orchestrated encounter in a corridor, rather than a sit-down talk, \"to give both sides deniability\". The last encounter between an American and Iranian leader was when Jimmy Carter met the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1977.</p><p>Speaking on ABC's This Week, Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region\". He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict\".</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged Iran's leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests. That a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilising,\" Obama said in the ABC interview, which was recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p><p>\"My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn't draw a lesson that [because] we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran,\" Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p><p>After meeting John Kerry, US secretary of state, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point. \"The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron – Iran,\" Netanyahu said. \"Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,\" he added.</p><p>However, Obama insisted: \"What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically. You know, negotiations with the Iranians are always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that … if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can strike a deal.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417344382|2013-09-16T15:48:01Z|489e7bfcab6920de51d88954bbdc7248a30c1c4e -->",
