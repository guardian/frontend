This contributed to the death of between 400 and 1,200 mainly elderly patients.</p><p>&quot;The events at Stafford hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind,&quot; he told MPs. &quot;A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.&quot;</p><p>Hunt, who was presenting the government's initial response to the appalling care catalogued in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">last month's landmark report by Robert Francis</a>, had trailed some changes in advance. These included a requirement for nurses to spend up to a year getting hands-on experience on hospital wards at the start of their training and the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals. But there was disappointment that the duty of candour would be a legal requirement for NHS organisations rather than staff and managers.</p><p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn't already in place.</p><p>&quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p><p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p><p>Hunt's proposals failed to impress Patient Concern, a patient campaign group. Roger Goss, its co-director, criticised the minister's refusal to implement what he called a core recommendation of the Francis inquiry – mandatory minimum staffing levels for hospitals. &quot;Hunt's refusal to implement this, claiming that there is no relationship between nurse numbers per ward and quality of care or patient safety, is preposterous. 'Not the government's problem or responsibility' appears his attitude.&quot;</p><p>Goss added: &quot;Whether nurses will retain an interest in tender loving care when they graduate after a mandatory year as healthcare assistants seems questionable. But the requirement is worth a try.&quot; Making nursing a degree-based profession already excluded many potential candidates who could be excellent caring and compassionate nurses, he said.</p><p>The health service ombudsman, Dame Julie Mellor, while welcoming Hunt's statement, called it a &quot;first step&quot;. She said: &quot;Complaints are key to learning and improving … Ensuring that hospital trust boards receive and take action from meaningful complaint information to identify patterns, trends and themes will be central to making this change happen.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Hunt is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a new ratings system for hospitals closely based on the way Ofsted assesses the performance and quality of schools in England. Hospitals could be rated &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;requiring improvement&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; by a newly created chief inspector of hospitals, who Hunt said would become the NHS's new whistleblower-in-chief. Individual departments, such as cancer care and maternity services, would be rated separately and the hospital given an overall score.</p><p>In addition, senior doctors will be brought from other hospitals to join beefed-up inspections and help assess the quality of care in certain departments. Tougher inspections could last for a month, Hunt said, in a new drive to identify and stop poor care emerging.</p><p>Hunt also said nurses would have their performance subjected to regular review known as &quot;revalidation&quot;, along the lines of the same system that has recently been agreed for doctors, and that NHS pay would include an element related to their performance and how well they treated patients. NHS managers who have been responsible for failures will be barred from working in the service again. Gagging clauses on staff who leave the service will be banned.</p><p>The healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will in future be responsible for the toughened inspection regime but not for putting right failures. This will be the responsibility of Monitor, the body that at present regulates the NHS's foundation trusts.</p><p>The CQC chief executive, David Behan, said it would inspect acute hospitals and mental health trusts by focusing &quot;on the four key areas that are most important to people: safety, caring, effectiveness and how well they are led.&quot;</p><p>The NHS Employers organisation was lukewarm about the new duty of candour. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don't improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p><p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service organisations, said Hunt had found &quot;the right balance between external assurance measures and internal changes focused on transforming the NHS culture&quot; but added this would not happen overnight.</p><p>Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer at NHS England, formerly called the NHS commissioning board in the runup to next month's structural change to the health service, said: &quot;There are so many NHS staff doing brilliant work for their patients. But we all know there is a serious job to be done to rebuild public confidence. The NHS must grasp this positively and seize the opportunity to drive change.&quot;</p><p>A final decision on new legal sanctions against staff will depend on the outcome of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Don Berwick, a global expert in patient safety who has advised the US president, Barack Obama. Berwick will report before parliament's summer recess in July. Many medical organisations have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p><p>Regulation of the 500,000-600,000 healthcare assistants working in both the NHS and social care would result in &quot;a bureaucratic quagmire&quot;, Hunt said. Instead, there will be a new code of practice governing their behaviour and new minimum training standards.</p><p>Hunt again defended Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS in England, who has been under growing pressure from MPs and relatives of the patients who died to resign for failing to do more to stop the poor care unfolding when he headed the NHS's regional strategic health authority in 2005-06.</p><p>Nicholson was responsible for 50 hospitals in the West Midlands at the time and no one in the NHS system at the time flagged major concerns to him about the emerging problems at Stafford hospital, Hunt said.</p><p>Although the NHS's overall boss bears &quot;some responsibility&quot; for the NHS's failure to spot the poor care sooner, Nicholson had also ensured that the NHS met key waiting times targets and brought levels of healthcare-acquired infections down very dramatically.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406241989|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|7ec2e464b775c9ad5f1c4cd3cf558c870619d052 -->",

This contributed to the death of between 400 and 1,200 mainly elderly patients.</p><p>&quot;The events at Stafford hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind,&quot; he told MPs. &quot;A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.&quot;</p><p>Hunt, who was presenting the government's initial response to the appalling care catalogued in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">last month's landmark report by Robert Francis</a>, had trailed some changes in advance. These included a requirement for nurses to spend up to a year getting hands-on experience on hospital wards at the start of their training and the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals. But there was disappointment that the duty of candour would be a legal requirement for NHS organisations rather than staff and managers.</p><p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn't already in place.</p><p>&quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p><p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p><p>Hunt's proposals failed to impress Patient Concern, a patient campaign group. Roger Goss, its co-director, criticised the minister's refusal to implement what he called a core recommendation of the Francis inquiry – mandatory minimum staffing levels for hospitals. &quot;Hunt's refusal to implement this, claiming that there is no relationship between nurse numbers per ward and quality of care or patient safety, is preposterous. 'Not the government's problem or responsibility' appears his attitude.&quot;</p><p>Goss added: &quot;Whether nurses will retain an interest in tender loving care when they graduate after a mandatory year as healthcare assistants seems questionable. But the requirement is worth a try.&quot; Making nursing a degree-based profession already excluded many potential candidates who could be excellent caring and compassionate nurses, he said.</p><p>The health service ombudsman, Dame Julie Mellor, while welcoming Hunt's statement, called it a &quot;first step&quot;. She said: &quot;Complaints are key to learning and improving … Ensuring that hospital trust boards receive and take action from meaningful complaint information to identify patterns, trends and themes will be central to making this change happen.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Hunt is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a new ratings system for hospitals closely based on the way Ofsted assesses the performance and quality of schools in England. Hospitals could be rated &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;requiring improvement&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; by a newly created chief inspector of hospitals, who Hunt said would become the NHS's new whistleblower-in-chief. Individual departments, such as cancer care and maternity services, would be rated separately and the hospital given an overall score.</p><p>In addition, senior doctors will be brought from other hospitals to join beefed-up inspections and help assess the quality of care in certain departments. Tougher inspections could last for a month, Hunt said, in a new drive to identify and stop poor care emerging.</p><p>Hunt also said nurses would have their performance subjected to regular review known as &quot;revalidation&quot;, along the lines of the same system that has recently been agreed for doctors, and that NHS pay would include an element related to their performance and how well they treated patients. NHS managers who have been responsible for failures will be barred from working in the service again. Gagging clauses on staff who leave the service will be banned.</p><p>The healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will in future be responsible for the toughened inspection regime but not for putting right failures. This will be the responsibility of Monitor, the body that at present regulates the NHS's foundation trusts.</p><p>The CQC chief executive, David Behan, said it would inspect acute hospitals and mental health trusts by focusing &quot;on the four key areas that are most important to people: safety, caring, effectiveness and how well they are led.&quot;</p><p>The NHS Employers organisation was lukewarm about the new duty of candour. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don't improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p><p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service organisations, said Hunt had found &quot;the right balance between external assurance measures and internal changes focused on transforming the NHS culture&quot; but added this would not happen overnight.</p><p>Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer at NHS England, formerly called the NHS commissioning board in the runup to next month's structural change to the health service, said: &quot;There are so many NHS staff doing brilliant work for their patients. But we all know there is a serious job to be done to rebuild public confidence. The NHS must grasp this positively and seize the opportunity to drive change.&quot;</p><p>A final decision on new legal sanctions against staff will depend on the outcome of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Don Berwick, a global expert in patient safety who has advised the US president, Barack Obama. Berwick will report before parliament's summer recess in July. Many medical organisations have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p><p>Regulation of the 500,000-600,000 healthcare assistants working in both the NHS and social care would result in &quot;a bureaucratic quagmire&quot;, Hunt said. Instead, there will be a new code of practice governing their behaviour and new minimum training standards.</p><p>Hunt again defended Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS in England, who has been under growing pressure from MPs and relatives of the patients who died to resign for failing to do more to stop the poor care unfolding when he headed the NHS's regional strategic health authority in 2005-06.</p><p>Nicholson was responsible for 50 hospitals in the West Midlands at the time and no one in the NHS system at the time flagged major concerns to him about the emerging problems at Stafford hospital, Hunt said.</p><p>Although the NHS's overall boss bears &quot;some responsibility&quot; for the NHS's failure to spot the poor care sooner, Nicholson had also ensured that the NHS met key waiting times targets and brought levels of healthcare-acquired infections down very dramatically.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406241989|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|7ec2e464b775c9ad5f1c4cd3cf558c870619d052 -->",

        "headline":"Jeremy Hunt's response to Mid Staffs report is just beginning",
        "body":"<p>Jeremy Hunt has had just seven weeks to consider no fewer than 290 recommendations from the Francis inquiry, which itself was the product of a 31-month public inquiry featuring more than 250 witnesses and a million pages of evidence.</p><p>So he can be forgiven for giving what he acknowledged was an initial – rather than full or final – response. Pretending to have finalised a view on so much in so short a time would not have yielded practical and beneficial changes – to safety of care, NHS culture, the service's accountability and, especially, boosting the role of patients – that the scale of the horror at Mid Staffs requires. They will take time.</p><p>The key objective is safe care for every patient every time – a culture of zero avoidable harm. It is an understandable but also arguably unrealistic goal, as healthcare everywhere inevitably involves risk. It is naive to think a service that serves so many patients each year can completely eradicate the possibility that a nurse, looking after too many for her comfort, will misread a doctor's scrawled handwriting and give the patient the wrong drug. The review of patient safety being led by Don Berwick, an internationally recognised authority, may prompt ministers to temper their expectations of zero harm being achievable.</p><p>More realistic is the coalition's response to several of Francis's more far-reaching suggestions, such as regulation of healthcare assistants and criminal prosecutions for NHS staff who harm or kill patients. The latter is on hold until Berwick reports in July. He will also form a view on whether the promised new statutory duty of candour, requiring NHS organisations to tell patients and relatives when mistakes are made, should be extended to their staff too, as the Mid Staffs relatives and patient safety groups such as Action against Medical Accidents want.</p><p>The same principle applies to the planned disclosure of data showing what outcomes patients experience when receiving 10 types of common and important surgery. Until now such information has been available only for heart surgery, but this is accepted to have helped reduce the unacceptable variation that means patients seeking vital care face a postcode lottery. Revealing more of the contents of the NHS's treasure trove of performance data – some of which is not yet collected – will happen slowly and prove painful for hospitals where patients have the lowest chance of success.</p><p>Other Hunt plans – banning gagging orders and the fiddling of mortality data, and blacklisting failed NHS managers like the former Mid Staffs chief executive Martin Yeates – will help plug obvious gaps in NHS practice, as judged against the strict new requirement for accountability. But the most important figure in all the change is the planned new chief inspector of hospitals, who is to be unforgiving in demanding high standards in all units, exposing poor care and deciding whether a hospital should be rated as poor, good or whatever. His or her identity, like so many of the key elements of the government's plan to overhaul the NHS, is still not known. Hunt's response to Francis, therefore, is just beginning. .</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406282164|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|8e7de8b6d6a0b116c6b4ffdfbb125814da214d72 -->",

        "body":"<p>Failing hospitals will be named and shamed and NHS managers responsible for failures will be barred from working in the health service under government plans to ensure a Mid Staffs-style care scandal never happens again – but the health secretary's proposals were nevertheless criticised by patient groups for not going far enough.</p><p>Jeremy Hunt said on Tuesday he was laying the foundations for a culture \"of zero harm and compassionate care\" – but doubts surfaced over his failure to endorse post-Mid Staffs recommendations over minimum staffing levels in hospitals and whether NHS organisations would respond to a \"duty of candour\" to tell the truth when things go wrong.</p><p>The cabinet minister was responding to Robert Francis QC's report last month on the failings at Stafford hospital, part of the Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust, in 2005-2009, which contributed to the deaths of between 400 and 1,200 patients, mostly elderly.</p><p>The health secretary told MPs there had been \"unacceptable and, in some cases, inhumane treatment\" at Stafford, where there had been \"a betrayal of the worst kind\" of patients, their families and \"the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.\"</p><p>Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing said that Hunt was wrong not to insist on specific levels of minimum staffing as recommended by Francis. He said greater numbers of staff result in better healthcare: \"Simply leaving the setting of staffing levels to local discretion clearly isn't working and the time has come for mandatory, legally enforceable safe staffing levels.\"</p><p>Action against Medical Accidents (Avma), which has campaigned for years for a duty of candour, was concerned ministers had apparently not been convinced by the recommendation from Francis that individual NHS employees should be made liable for mistakes – and urged the Department of Health not to discount it.</p><p>But the department's 82-page response to Francis's 290 recommendations warned that there was a risk of \"unintentionally create[ing] a culture of fear. This in turn could prevent lessons being learned and could make services less safe\".</p><p>Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Avma, said Hunt's statement was \"vague\" – but welcomed the statutory duty on NHS organisations to tell the truth when patients have been harmed or killed as tougher measures would \"help change the culture of cover-up and denial that has been eating away at the NHS like a cancer\" and be \"the biggest advance in patient safety and patients' rights in the history of the NHS.</p><p>A final decision on the proposal of personal accountability will not be made until later, subject to the findings of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Professor Don Berwick, a global expert in safe care who has advised President Barack Obama, who will report by July. Many medical organisations, including the British Medical Association, have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p><p>Many of Hunt's proposals had been carefully trailed in the past few days. Failing hospitals would be monitored with a system of performance ratings based on Ofsted's existing assessments of schools in England. Meanwhile, managers responsible for failures will be barred from working elsewhere in the health service, while clauses gagging ex-NHS staff from raising concerns publicly will be banned.</p><p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn't already in place. \"Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,\" she said.</p><p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained \"as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes\".</p><p>Emma Jones, from the law firm Leigh Day, who represented over 120 victims of abuse at Stafford hospital in successful claims for compensation, called Hunt's measures \"a small step in the right direction to keep the NHS true to its founding principles and the envy of the world.\" She said the duty of candour \"needs to apply to individual hospital employees as well as the hospital itself. The majority of my clients complained about their treatment and care but either received a very bland or misleading response or no response at all.\"</p><p>But the NHS Employers organisation however was lukewarm about the new obligation. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement \"makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don't improve culture by creating a climate of fear.\"</p><p>Francis said that although ministers had not accepted all his 290 recommendations, \"the government's statement indicates its determination to make positive changes to the culture of the NHS, in part by adopting some of my recommendations and in part through other initiatives.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406286539|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|868a71ec8a8a8db1462fe8cdcde2b1e40f34b298 -->",

        "body":"<p>Imagine if you lived in a world in which there was a single metric that defined the \"truth\" about the \"good quality\" of a car. Imagine if the career progression of car designers depended on how well they scored on this miraculous metric. It is hard to picture exactly what mode of transport we would all be using but it would, without doubt, be a worse world to live in.</p><p>This is not an attack on Which? or What Car? that regularly line up cars on various league tables of quality. They are very useful publications. It is an illustration of what was probably the most absurd part of Jeremy Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">statement</a> in response to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">Francis report </a>on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p>He promised us that \"in the future the chief inspector will ensure that there is a single version of the truth about how their hospitals are performing, not just on finance and targets, but on a single assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients\".</p><p>In itself, having a single official assessment of how well hospitals are performing is a perfectly sensible idea and should be welcomed. Indeed, most of what Hunt proposed was welcome and should, if executed effectively, go a long way to addressing the problems that occurred in Mid Staffordshire</p><p>But there was a problem in the way he presented this particular aspect of his plans – one that risks repeating the failures of the past, one that reeks of the old NHS culture: the culture that led to the tragedies at Mid Staffordshire.</p><p>A single assessment can be a useful tool. But not if you begin to believe it is the \"truth\" about quality or that you have made \"an assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients\". After all, there are roughly 50 million NHS patients in England, ranging from infants to old people with dementia. You might be able to fully reflect what matters to some of them; or partially reflect what matters to all of them. But, as Abraham Lincoln would have said, had he worked in the NHS, you are never going to assess all of what matters to all of them.</p><p>Hunt has identified quite rightly that we need more expert inspectors, more detailed information on quality, and regulators that exercise real judgments about where care is being provided to a good standard. But if quality in healthcare is not to be reduced once again to a tick-box exercise, we must avoid a world in which large central government agencies are tasked with identifying the \"single version of the truth\" when it comes to quality in healthcare.</p><p>In Hunt's statement, most of the proposed changes related to increasing accountability upwards to regulators and government. Relatively few – such as the duty of candour – related to accountability directly to patients. This is pragmatic, in that it will have the biggest immediate effect. But it ignores the essential longer-term goal of increasing accountability directly to patients.</p><p>Francis had some good ideas on how to achieve this. Unfortunately, they appear rather late in the report. That may be why they seem to have been ignored. It is a shame because they point towards a much more radical rebalancing of power and accountability in healthcare.</p><p>Recommendation 244 says: \"Patients need to be granted user-friendly, real-time and retrospective access to read their records, and a facility to enter comments. They should be enabled to have a copy of records in a form usable by them, if they wish to have one.\" And: \"Systems should be designed to include prompts and defaults where these will contribute to safe and effective care, and to accurate recording of information on first entry.\"</p><p>I want an NHS in which information about the standards of care I receive come to me first and regulators second. Currently we are building an NHS that does this the other way round. This needs to be reversed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406270678|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|be8a07304c74ef5d0ec3bef2572c12fb682ac2f0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Jeremy Hunt has outlined an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">initial package of measures that the NHS will have to implement</a> in order to respond to Robert Francis QC's damning evidence of what the health secretary told MPs was the service's \"darkest day\" – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust\" title=\"\">the Mid Staffs scandal</a>.</p><p>Each is vital to help change the NHS's culture by pursuing the hugely ambitious, but possibly unrealistic, twin goals of zero harm to patients and routinely excellent care for all patients at all times. For that to have a chance, all Hunt's plans need to work – and others too.</p><p>The litmus test of all these new policies, initiatives and laws will be whether they, individually and collectively, provide an answer to the key question that underpinned Robert Francis QC's mammoth public inquiry: will they mean that the appalling care seen at Mid Staffs never happens again?</p><p>Only the most ardent optimist would answer unequivocally yes. But while they cannot realistically prevent any individual member of staff being cruel, callous or recklessly incompetent, they should greatly reduce the chances of Mid-Staffs-type failings recurring, given they were uniquely sustained and widespread.</p><p></p><p>A beefed-up inspection regime involving month-long poking around for the biggest trusts and inclusion of medical experts among the inspectors will help put hospitals under the sort of pressure that the unique responsibilities of publicly funded healthcare demand, and embrace the need for constant improvement, especially if Hunt's intention of the public being able to see ratings for individual departments proves viable.</p><p>He wants something akin to Ofsted's simple, parent-friendly ratings – an at-a-glance signal that a hospital is \"good\", \"outstanding\" or something less. But, as the Nuffield Trust health thinktank told him just last week, the complexity and range of what hospitals do – providing many different types of care, potentially – makes one overall score, which he also wants, very hard to give.</p><p>The yet-to-be appointed first-ever chief inspector of hospitals will have to resolve this, and other tricky issues about how new key processes will actually work.</p><p>Hunt's ideas combine an admirable amount of practicality as well as pragmatism. He has wisely resisted pledging to implement all of Francis's 290 recommendations. Instead, he said, ministers are following the spirit of them.</p><p>Some of Francis's key recommendations are the subject of various ongoing reviews, such as whether individual NHS staff should become liable to prosecution if they harm or kill a patient. The American patient safety expert Prof Don Berwick is looking into that, though the Department of Health already has well-developed and well-grounded concerns about it, as do organisations representing doctors and other health professionals.</p><p>The fear is that such sanctions could deter staff from reporting that they have seen risky things being done by mistake to patients, and thus undermine the culture of openness which is central to the post-Francis-report NHS that ministers, NHS organisations and patients' representatives all want to see.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406254373|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|2931b8cfa8706373af26b9607a945524eaad66db -->",

        "headline":"Nurses already do hands-on work and of course we care about patients",
        "body":"<p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/26/nurses-basic-care-training\" title=\"\">nurses must spend up to a year helping patients with basic care</a>. As a student nurse, I already do this. My alarm goes off at 5.30am and I am in my ward for 7am. For the next 13 hours I work alongside my mentor who teaches me the responsibilities of nursing. These will include, feeding, washing, dressing, performing observations, administering drugs, preparing IV drugs, wound dressing, admission and discharging of patients, pre- and post-operation care, working with deteriorating patients, catheterisation and preparing and giving injections. Not to mention dealing with the emotional needs of individual patients.</p><p>Most of these duties used to be performed by doctors, but because of people living longer and the growing complexity of medicine, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nursing\" title=\"\">nurses</a> have taken some of these responsibilities. In turn, healthcare assistants (HCAs) have been employed to perform some of the tasks of nurses. I have never had such a \"hands-on\" learning experience in any of my previous jobs.</p><p>At university we've had many lectures about care and how we care for patients but the subject always come back to this: can we teach how to care? Can we teach how to deal with emotional and stressful situations? How do we teach about death, pain, anger, anxiety? Is this something you can teach, or something you are born with, or something you gain from life experience? I don't know the answer but if we didn't care, why would we go into a profession that every day deals with life and death at its most core, with pain, with long shifts, with pay packets that barely pay our rent?</p><p>I care and all my fellow students care but with high demands on the NHS, HCAs have been employed to perform these tasks because nurses simply don't have the capacity to perform these duties alongside the complexity of patients' healthcare needs and ward procedures. If you want nurses to perform more of these \"caring\" tasks then employ more nurses. Six to eight patients to one nurse is too much and makes it impossible for that nurse to attend to every patient's individual care needs.</p><p>I love being a student because I have the time to perform all the fundamentals of nursing care, to comb patients' hair, to talk to them about their personal lives while I help feed them their lunch, as well as learning from qualified nurses about other duties and responsibilities. But while I am reading a book to a patient, my mentor nurse is running around making sure that these patients stay alive and keep well.</p><p>This time next year I will be nearly qualified and will be out on the wards. It is vital that HCAs, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and all the other ward staff work together to give the patient the best level of care and also to support each other as colleagues. There is a hierarchy in the NHS but everybody on the ward is responsible for life and death, for care, for recognising risk and acting accordingly. So why are HCAs paid £9 an hour and made to work 13-hour shifts? If this is fundamental to care then why aren't HCAs valued more and why isn't money given to train HCAs and improve standards? Instead, the government wants to put more untrained workers on to wards to perform these tasks. This will surely add to the problems rather than solve them.</p><p>As I write, I'm eating into my revision schedule for a bioscience exam for which I have to learn about the cardiovascular system, cells, renal system, homoeostasis, central nervous system, genetics and reproduction, applied pharmacology pain and inflammation, gastrointestinal system, antibiotics, bones and muscle, renal system, respiratory system … \"gasp\" – yes that's your respiratory system working overtime, and it's what happens to student nurses on a daily basis. After all, I'm sure you want the nurse looking after your relative to be knowledgeable and to care. It upsets me greatly that the government thinks that nursing equates to wiping arses all day long. Perhaps the government should wake up to the fact that about 80% of the student nurses I know actually work as HCAs as a part-time job to fund their way through studying.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406274463|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|623528c810abff55583719c6d0354025446cd83d -->",

        "headline":"Nurses must spend a year on basic care",
        "body":"<p>Nurses will have to spend up to a year helping patients eat, wash and get dressed – work usually done by healthcare assistants – under government plans to shake up NHS care in response to the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal that left between 400 and 1,200 to die as a result of poor care.</p><p>Any would-be nurse who refuses to undertake such hands-on work will be denied NHS funding for their degree, which is worth about £40,000 over three years and relied upon by almost all the 20,000 new student nurses a year. In effect they will be debarred from training.</p><p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is expected to announce the move on Tuesday when he sets out the government's response to Robert Francis QC's report into the scandal.</p><p>At the moment the basic tasks of caring for patients, which also include helping them get out of bed and going to the toilet, are mainly done by healthcare assistants or health support workers, who are paid much less than nurses and do not have their status.</p><p>Ministers see the move as essential to ensuring the nursing profession rediscovers the values of compassionate care which critics claim has been lost amid pressure to meet NHS targets, rising numbers of patients and some nurses displaying appalling behaviour towards some patients. Critics also fear that too many nurses have become too detached from the fundamentals of patient care and avoid too much routine contact with patients, such as help with feeding and moving around for those who need it.</p><p>Hunt will tell parliament on Tuesday what the coalition intends to do to overhaul many aspects of NHS care given Francis's damning criticisms of the \"NHS system\" and its self-interested \"culture\" which did not give enough priority to giving patients the best possible care.</p><p>Ministers, civil servants and NHS chiefs have spent seven weeks studying the 290 recommendations made by Francis following his 31-month public inquiry into why such inadequate care at Stafford hospital was allowed to continue for so long.</p><p>\"Frontline, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training. These measures are about recruiting all staff with the right values and giving them the training they need to do their job properly, so that patients are treated with compassion,\" Hunt said.</p><p>In a speech last November he castigated some NHS staff for their involvement in cases of patient care which he said had included \"contempt\" and \"a kind of normalisation of cruelty\".</p><p>The Royal College of Nursing, which represents most nurses and student nurses, may not welcome new entrants to the profession having to perform tasks usually done by colleagues who are less well-trained and not strictly part of the clinical workforce, either before or during their training. They may see it as an unwanted blurring of the dividing lines between two groups of NHS staff and even as demeaning to nurses.</p><p>Hunt's initiative follows an almost identical suggestion made by Francis. Recommendation 187 in his report said: \"There should be a national entry level requirement that student nurses spend a minimum period of time, at least three months, working on the direct care of patients under the supervision of a registered nurse. Such experience should include direct care of patients, ideally including the elderly, and involve hands-on physical care.\"</p><p>He recommended: \"Satisfactory completion of this direct care experience should be a pre-condition to continuation in nurse training. Supervised work of this type as a healthcare support worker should be allowed to count as an equivalent.\"</p><p>The change will be piloted before being made routine in England, Department of Health (DoH) sources said. Ministers will consider making other health professionals, notably health professionals such as physiotherapists, but not doctors, do the same as student nurses, depending on what those trials show.</p><p>Hunt will on Tuesday also publish new minimum training standards and a code of conduct for support workers in health and social care, following concerns that some lack the skills needed. They will include what DoH sources described as \"clear requirements on behaviour and attitude\". The standards will include training them in handling complaints from patients and relatives, reporting errors they have made or seen, recognising when a patient is undernourished or dehydrated, and talking properly to patients.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406211763|2014-05-14T16:53:42Z|21f6ea6f0a1d0763154aed379081e921aff04326 -->",
