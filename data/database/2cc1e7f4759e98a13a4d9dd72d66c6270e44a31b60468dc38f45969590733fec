Moment of madness, but you know how it is, they ask you every year. Oh, they don’t ask you? They totally should! That’s ridiculous. When you think of some of the C-listers who’ve been on. Anyway, every single year it’s, oh, go on, please, we’ll double the fee, you’ll be the star, look how everyone loved <a href=\"http://\">John Sergeant</a>, and every year I say, sorry, you’re absolutely asking the wrong guy, no, I don’t even dance at weddings yadda yadda yadda. Seriously, my agent is in <em>tears</em> – hilarious. Then this year I just thought, wait, lighten up, why the hell <em>not</em>?</p> <p>Why? Well, and this probably sounds weird coming from someone as famously driven as me, but beneath all the professional stuff, I’ve always been a very fun and zany person. When I was a kid, all I wanted was a set of bongo drums. Have you ever been to Africa? Listen, “A-wimo-weh, a-wimo-weh, a-wimo-weh, a-wimo-weh, in the jungle, the mighty jungle”. I truly and deeply love love love groovin’ to da beat! Sorry if that’s a bit of a shock coming from a so-called household name-stroke-apprentice national treasure. All I can say is, hey, get used to it guys!</p> <p>And I couldn’t have faced the kids. Oh, they’re thrilled their old dad is finally doing something unbelievably “hip”, if that’s the right lingo. My eldest kept saying, face it, Dad, the world is changing: you’re ancient, you can’t bank on the licence fee keeping us all at school for the next five years, so just shut up and do it. But of course it’s not about the money, or the exposure – dear old Sargie – you know me, it’s always been about the work. No, the way I see it, it’s just a chance for eight million people to watch me finding the real me.</p> <p>Of course, now that I’ve started, I realise this is going to be the toughest thing I’ve ever done. What people like me never get about Strictly is it’s actually a very serious creative art form and I’m beyond humbled that they think I’m worthy.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"12","wordcount":"374","commentCloseDate":"2015-09-01T05:00:08Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2015-08-25T09:49:21Z","firstPublicationDate":"2015-08-29T05:00:08Z","internalComposerCode":"55dc3a21e4b066a0c2408fc5","internalOctopusCode":"10712652","internalPageCode":"2359672","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2015-08-29T05:00:08Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-29T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4bnn7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eaddd88cf7fb36bd343e757b32a564afec62988/0_182_1016_610/500.jpg","lang":"en","internalRevision":"32","internalShortId":"/p/4bnn7"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/strictly-come-dancing-contestant-modern-tribe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/strictly-come-dancing-contestant-modern-tribe","webTitle":"Modern tribes: the Strictly Come Dancing contestant","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-29T05:00:08Z","sectionName":"Life and style","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/strictly-come-dancing-contestant-modern-tribe","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle","editions":[{"id":"lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle","code":"default"},{"id":"au/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/lifeandstyle","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/lifeandstyle","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/lifeandstyle","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2362099","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-35a5164c-70f9-4edd-ba5b-eb9b8d7fb22b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/28/1440755540959/05cb1783-dca5-49d1-b35d-8f1c460dcf9f-620x372.jpeg","typeData":{"altText":"ITV needs The X Factor to do well this autumn, said Chennel 4’s Jay Hunt","caption":"ITV needs The X Factor to do well this autumn, said Chennel 4’s Jay Hunt.

It’s a very expensive show for them. <br /></p> <p>“I don’t think the BBC should duck out of that head to head but I think aggressively trying to clip it is something they at least need to pause for a moment and think about it before they do it because it has an impact.”</p> <p>The Channel 4 boss said the BBC was a £1bn broadcaster and there were “no consequences” for them if a programme didn’t work. “For Peter [Fincham, ITV director of television] as a commercial channel there is a real consequence and it’s about being aware of that impact.”</p> <p>Hunt defended the decision to bring back TFI Friday for a full series, nearly 20 years after it first aired.</p> <p>She said she had no plans to bring back another 90s Channel 4 classic, The Word.</p> <p>Describing Chris Evans as a “dangerous broadcaster. I have been a huge fan of his for years, you never know what he is going to do”, she said the TFI revival had appealed to young viewers as well as old.</p> <p>Of TV’s burgeoning appetite for nostalgia, Hunt said: “We have to be careful in this space. We think very carefully before we do it. We are there to innovate and change things.”</p>","wordcount":"305","creationDate":"2015-08-28T14:00:24Z","firstPublicationDate":"2015-08-28T15:49:11Z","internalComposerCode":"55e06978e4b013fcea292468","internalPageCode":"2362099","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2015-08-28T15:49:11Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4cv54","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"229","internalShortId":"/p/4cv54"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2015/aug/28/bbc-x-factor-strictly-channel-4s-hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/28/bbc-x-factor-strictly-channel-4s-hunt","webTitle":"BBC

Dancing, joking about the BBC’s lack of a star-studded line-up. </p> <p>The TV mogul has reprised his role as a judge on this year’s series of the ITV singing competition alongside Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, with Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw joining the panel, while celebrities such as Peter Andre, Jamelia and Daniel O’Donnell will be showing off their moves on the Strictly dancefloor. </p> <p>The two shows are set to coincide during their live stages, with Cowell describing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/26/itv-seeks-to-avoid-x-factor-and-strictly-clashes-by-publishing-episode-times\">scheduling conflict</a>s as “avoidable clashes”. </p> <p>Cowellsaid X Factor could easily beat Strictly in the ratings war: “I’d hate to say yes, because I know what will happen if I say yes, it will come back and haunt me. </p> <p>“This show does feel better, the talent’s great, they’re interesting, so if it’s us versus Peter Andre, I’m going to put my money on us.” </p> <p>He added: “I have really had a good time this year. You want judges who want to judge the talent and actually want to find an artist - that’s what I noticed when I was working with these guys, and with Olly and Caroline. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/26/itv-seeks-to-avoid-x-factor-and-strictly-clashes-by-publishing-episode-times\">ITV seeks to avoid X Factor and Strictly clashes by publishing episode times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is like being on a new show. It’s been fun. I have had my moments with Madame (Fernandez-Versini), but overall I’ve had a really good time this year. It’s been unpredictable.”</p> <p>The 12th series of X Factor, which begins on ITV on August 29, also sees former Xtra Factor presenters Caroline Flack and Olly Murs taking over hosting duties on the main show from Dermot O’Leary, and Louis Walsh stepping down from thejudge’s seat he has occupied since the show started in 2004. </p> <p>“The good thing about Louis is he’s going to be able to go to bed earlier. He can watch the show in bed in his PJs and he can call me after the show,” Cowell joked. </p> <p>“We’ve got a couple of seats in the live shows - restricted viewing - but I’m looking after him. Maybe we’ll make him Judge of the Week one week or something.” </p> <p>Fernandez-Versini said: “He’s a really good sport. He came down to our promo and he did a bit to show he’s a good sport about it. He’s happier, actually, not being on it.” </p> <p>Grimshaw added: “He came into the dressing room that me and Rita had and he was the happiest he’s ever been. He was like, ‘You two do not know what you have got yourself into’. He was really happy. But he did want there to be a fifth judge.” <br

We’re going to tell the world the start times of all X Factor broadcasts this autumn,” he said.</p> <p>“Our audience tell us they don’t want those two shows to overlap.” </p> <p>Fincham continued: “What happens with billings is we have a number of exchanges [of draft schedules]. So on Saturday week there’s a Strictly Come Dancing launch show and a third X Factor audition show. We had a first exchange which had the X Factor show starting exactly when the Strictly show ended. </p> <p>“That revealed to each broadcaster what we were doing. In the second exchange, they moved Strictly 20 minutes later. I don’t know why they did that, no reason for doing that but that feels to me like an avoidable clash. It feels to me a bit like ‘let’s clip the X Factor’s wings’.”</p> <p>“This really matters to us, because we’re a commercial business, this is business to us. I know from my own time at the BBC; it’s a bit of a game to be honest,” he said.</p> <p>“What we’re going to do is literally publish the X Factor start times [for] this autumn … because all the evidence we have is that our audiences don’t want the two to overlap.</p> <p>“Our audience then know when the X Factor will start, whether or not the BBC responds to that is another matter,” said Fincham pointedly.</p> <p>However, BBC director of television, Danny Cohen, said: “We notice this happens all the time; Emmerdale will find itself in a double bill against EastEnders with astonishing regularity.</p> <p>“I’m sure there’s no reason for that. There’s to-ing and fro-ing. We don’t look for it.” </p> <p>Asked by host, Sky News presenter Kay Burley, if he would guarantee that Strictly and X Factor would not clash, Cohen said: “No, some of our start times are affected around when live sport happens.”</p> <p>Burley asked: “When there’s no live sport, will you guarantee it?”</p> <p>Cohen responded: “No. In the same way Peter won’t guarantee he won’t have an Emmerdale double bill up against EastEnders … these clashes happen sometimes.”</p> <p>That was reiterated later by BBC1 controller, Charlotte Moore, in a different session, who said she would schedule Strictly where BBC1 viewers wanted to see it and accused ITV of scheduling its own biggest shows against BBC1.</p> <p>She said if Fincham wanted to move X Factor later, that would be “fantastic”.</p> <p>“I have to think about what’s right for our audience,” she said. “The licence fee payers, these are the shows they love, of course that’s my priority. Emmerdale quite often goes against EastEnders, soap against soap, I would say that’s not great for the audience. We do our very best to avoid clashes.”<br

<br />The former teenage star, signed to a major record label aged 15, said: “My girls are huge fans of Strictly, but when I told them I was doing it they laughed as they know that dancing is not my forte.</p> <p>“The girls are amazing dancers, though, so I definitely want to learn a new skill so that I’ll be able to give them a run for their money, and end them teasing me once and for all.” </p>
