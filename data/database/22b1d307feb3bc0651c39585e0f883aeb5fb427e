        "body":"<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.])</strong></p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-senate-committee?CMP=twt_gu\">held a hearing</a>, ostensibly to investigate various issues raised about the NSA's activities. What the hearing primarily achieved instead was to underscore what a farce the notion of Congressional oversight over the NSA is. </p><p>In particular, the current chair of the Senate Committee created in the mid-1970s to oversee the intelligence community just so happens to be one of the nation's most steadfast and blind loyalists of and apologists for the National Security State: Dianne Feinstein. For years she has abused her position to shield and defend the NSA and related agencies rather than provide any meaningful oversight over it, which is a primary reason why it has grown into such an out-of-control and totally unaccountable behemoth.</p><p>Underscoring the purpose of yesterday's hearing (and the purpose of Feinstein's Committee more broadly): the witnesses the Committee first heard from were all Obama officials - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander, Deputy Attorney James Cole - who vehemently defended every aspect of the NSA. At the conclusion of their testimony, Feinstein announced that it was very, very important to hear from the two non-governmental witnesses the Committee had invited: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-26-at-5.01.04-PM.png\">virulent NSA defender</a> <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/08/the-nsa-the-washington-post-and-the-administration/\">Ben Wittes</a> of the Brooking Institution and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323309404578617463152440542.html\">virulent NSA defender Timothy Edgar</a>, a former Obama national security official. Hearing only from dedicated NSA apologists as witnesses: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/09/26/dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden\">that's \"oversight\" for Dianne Feinstein</a> and her oversight Committee. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Mark Warner stated the obvious to Gen. Alexander: \"a lot of Americans have lost trust in what you're doing.\" But of course they all spent the entire afternoon blaming Snowden and \"the media\" for this development rather than taking any responsibility themselves. The very idea that meaningful reform of the NSA will come out of this annexed, captured, corrupted Committee is ludicrous on its face.</p><p>But there are two members of that Committee who actually do take seriously its oversight mandate: Democrats Ron Wyden and Mark Udall. Those two <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/us/politics/democratic-senators-warn-about-use-of-patriot-act.html?_r=0\">spent years publicly winking and hinting that the NSA</a> under President Obama was engaged in all sorts of radical and abusive domestic surveillance (although - despite the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/1/breach_or_debate_congress_snowden_prism%20\">absolute immunity protection they enjoy as Senators under the Constitution</a> - they took no action, and instead waited for Edward Snowden (who had no such immunity) to bravely step up and reveal to the American people specifically what these two Senators kept hinting at). </p><p>Wyden spoke yesterday for 6 minutes - part of of it as monologue and part of it questioning Gen. Alexander - and it's really worth watching the video, embedded below. The Oregon Democrat condemned what he called \"the intrusive, constitutionally flawed surveillance system\" the NSA built. About Snowden's whistleblowing, he said that NSA officials should have known from \"a quick read of history, in America, the truth always managed to come out.\" And his primary point was this: \"<strong>the leadership of NSA built an intelligence collection system that repeatedly deceived the American people</strong>.\"</p><p>Indeed, if I had to pick the single most revealing aspect of this entire NSA scandal - and there are many revealing ones about many different realms - it would be that James Clapper <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/11/sen-wyden-clapper-didnt-give-straight-answer-on-nsa-programs/\">lied to the faces of the Senate Intelligence Committee about core NSA matters</a>, and not only was he not prosecuted <a href=\"http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/47/1001\">for that felony</a>, but he did not even lose his job, and continues to be treated with great reverence by the very Committee which he deliberately deceived. That one fact tells you all you need to know about how official Washington functions.</p><h2>Related issues</h2><p>This is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/opinion/have-a-nice-day-nsa.html?hp\">an insightful, and quite hilarious, Op-ed</a> in the New York Times this morning by the Brazilian journalist Vanessa Barbara about how Brazilians are using humor to mock and subvert the NSA's surveillance schemes.</p><p>Finally, in case there are any people left who thought that exploiting Terrorism and fear-mongering over it for power was a unique by-product of the Bush era (and really: could there <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/harry-reid-rand-paul-spar-over-patriot-act-on-senate-floor/2011/05/25/AGcgWRBH_blog.html\">really be any people left who believe that at this point?</a>), <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/324499-nsa-chief-pleads-for-publics-help-as-congress-eyes-restrictions#ixzz2g5cAVyzd\">Gen. Alexander this week</a> \"warned that if Congress hampers the NSA's ability to gather information, it could allow for terrorist attacks in the United States similar to last week's massacre in a mall in Nairobi, Kenya\", while Feinstein's deputy Chair, GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss (who revealingly sounds like every Democratic NSA defender I ever hear) said that the recent NSA disclosures \"caused huge damage to the US\" and \"would ultimately claim lives.\"</p><h2>UPDATE</h2><p>Anyone who has any interest in understanding how the US media works: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/sep/27/seymour-hersh-obama-nsa-american-media\">please read this article about what Seymour Hersh said in a speech yesterday</a> regarding government-subservient, \"chicken shit\" US journalists. editors and media outlets. It is hard to put into words just how comprehensively accurate his remarks are.</p><h2>UPDATE II [Sat.]</h2><p>On Twitter, Wittes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/383914571926220800\">objects</a> to my description of him as a \"virulent NSA defender\", saying: \"I am certainly an NSA defender, but curious what I have said that strikes you as 'virulent'. I try to keep virulence out of it.\" It's a fair point, and was a bad word choice on my part. I meant to convey that he's steadfast, relentless and intense in his defense of the NSA - I probably was thinking of \"vehement\". \"Virulent\" connotes poisonous or spiteful rhetoric and Wittes generally avoids that. In my view, he's certainly a hard-core apologist for NSA abuses and more generally a highly loyal US government defender, but he usually employs a Brookings-type civil tone when engaging in all that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418448049|2013-10-16T18:19:24Z|11723a7435df85a622ca7cc9664cab9a10d16884 -->",

        "body":"<p>The NSA has lied to the Congress, the courts, and perhaps even to the president himself, but no one seems to care.</p><p>The Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper admitted he lied to Congress about the NSA metadata collection program. He said the NSA had no such program – and then added that that was the <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-13/opinions/39950057_1_oversight-national-intelligence-national-security-agency\">least \"untruthful\" remark</a> he could make. General Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/06/nsa-collecting-phone-records-for-millions-verizon-customers-report-says/\">lied in 2012 that the NSA does not hold data on US citizens</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/seanlawson/2013/06/06/did-intelligence-officials-lie-to-congress-about-nsa-domestic-spying/\">repeated similar misstatements, under oath, to Congress</a> about the program:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We're not authorized to do it [data collection on US citizens], nor do we do it.</p></blockquote><p>NSA lawyers lied to secret Fisa court Judges John D Bates and Reggie B Walton. In recently released opinions, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/21/politics/nsa-fisa-court/index.html\">Bates said</a> he had been lied to on three separate occasions and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/us/court-upbraided-nsa-on-its-use-of-call-log-data.html?pagewanted=all\">Walton said</a> he had been lied to several times also.</p><p>But Clapper and Alexander have not been held in contempt of Congress. Nor have the Justice Department attorneys, who lied to Judges Walton and Bates, been disciplined. Part of the answer as to why this is so came out last week.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/19/nsa-surveillance-justice-opr-investigation/2805867/\">Justice Department told USA Today</a> that it had no intention of investigating the attorneys who lied to those judges. In the ordinary course, the Justice Department's office of professional responsibility investigates the behavior of lawyers who have been subject to accusations such as those made by Judges Bates and Walton.</p><p>That office, for example, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/us/politics/20justice.html\">investigated opinions</a> given by the Office of Legal Council that torture was legal. But in the case of NSA lies, the Justice Department doesn't seem to care.</p><p>The big fish, of course, are Alexander and Clapper. Congress usually comes down hard on those it suspects of lying to it. In this case, Generals Clapper and Alexander were not merely suspected of lying: Clapper <em>admitted</em> he lied to Congress and Alexander effectively said the same thing. Yet, nothing has happened. There should be accountability for their behavior.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/10/us/politics/obama-news-conference.html?pagewanted=all\">In an address to the nation on 9 August 2013</a>, President Barack Obama said he had five reforms in mind with respect to dealing with the NSA \"problem\": he would provide that the Fisa court have adversarial representation (sorely needed); the NSA would expose to the public what it was doing on its website (laughable); the NSA hire a civil rights advocate (inconsequential); and Congress should amend section 215 of the Patriot Act (good idea); and lastly, he would appoint experts to examine NSA practices.</p><p>The latter idea on its face would seem to be a reasonable one. In practice, though, it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/obama-nsa-review-surveillance-changes\">does not seem to be going anywhere</a> thus far. The group of experts consist of former OMB Director Peter Swire, former Deputy CIA Director Richard Morell, counter-terrorism expert Richard Clark, and two some-time University of Chicago law professors, Cass Sunstein and Geoffrey Stone.</p><p>The committee does not have a promising name: the review group on intelligence and communications technology. It's not communications technology that needs to be reviewed, but the culture of lying at the NSA. This needs to be changed without delay. Perhaps the only way to do this is to fire Alexander (and Clapper, too) and start all over again.</p><p>The committee has been criticized as being too pro-national security and too pro-Obama. The criticism may be justified. Sunstein and Stone, as distinguished as they may be, taught with Obama at the University of Chicago law school; and Clark and Morell have pro-national security credentials.</p><p>The committee has had one reported meeting. It dealt with complaints from internet companies, technical in nature, which covered their relationship with the NSA. Other meetings, if any, have not been reported.</p><p>As noted, the real issue before the committee is the deceptions of the NSA. We expect the NSA to have a culture that lies to and deceives the enemy. But the American public is not the enemy.</p><p>The NSA's culture of lying to the public and its courts is not a new phenomenon. This has been a part of an ingrained culture that goes back for years. For example, in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971, the NSA was doing the same thing. As secret records in the case show, the NSA made an entirely bogus claim that publication of the papers would disclose the secret that the US had broken the North Vietnamese communications code.</p><p>It was proven to the lower courts that this \"secret\" had already been published in the Congressional Record; it was not a secret at all. Nonetheless, the NSA persuaded Erwin Griswold, the former dean of Harvard law school, the then solicitor general of the United States, to knowingly lie to the United States supreme court that it was still a secret. The court ignored this false assertion and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/papers-final.html\">permitted the information to be published anyway</a>.</p><p>It is too late now to attack the NSA for destroying the reputation of the dean of one of the great law schools in this country. It is not too late, however, to force the NSA to change its culture.</p><p>Obviously, if this culture seeps into popular culture, lies and deceits will be easily tolerated – and we will all be the worse for it. President Obama should focus on this issue before it is too late. But it is not at all clear that he cares about it any more than Congress or the Justice Department do.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418143258|2013-10-16T18:19:24Z|720d62f7b6d7e7de0680f83b0a071601526c482f -->",

        "headline":"Edward Snowden's leaks are misguided – they risk exposing us to cyber-attacks",
        "body":"<p>Is Edward Snowden a hero or a criminal guilty of the most damaging espionage? It appears he is seen as both. Some will say he is a whistleblower who has fuelled the debate around the intercept of communications in cyberspace. But it was be no surprise to those who study the subject that a powerful search tool like Prism – and buffering software – is needed to find the communications of the terrorist or criminal among the billions of others.</p><p>But is revealing intelligence capabilities the way to conduct this debate, or is it gratuitously damaging? For Britain, Snowden's public interest justification is thin since subsequent investigation has shown conclusively the British intelligence agency concerned, GCHQ, has at all times acted lawfully.</p><p>I do not detect that the British public was much shaken, let alone stirred by these misguided allegations of wrongdoing. Nor do I know anyone who would say we should legislate to prevent the police from being able to track down terrorists, drug traffickers, kidnappers and paedophiles through their use of the internet. I know the public does not want to make the internet a safe space for those who wish to harm us. It is not the existence and power of systems like Prism and the links from NSA and GCHQ to the internet companies that is the problem: that capability is what it takes to do the job society has asked them to do in an internet age.</p><p>The real debate we should be having on the back of the Snowden case is about what privacy in a cyber-connected world can realistically mean given the volumes of personal data we hand over to the private sector in return for our everyday convenience, and the continued need for warranted access for security and law enforcement.</p><p>Whatever view we take on where as a society we want the balance between our right to privacy against our right to live in security, we all need to have confidence that in the hands of our authorities these powerful tools of interception are not being abused.</p><p>We have to have trust in those we ask to verify the activities of the state on our behalf: in particular we need to have confidence the senior judges and parliamentarians (the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, or ISC) can enter deep inside the ring of secrecy around police and intelligence work to satisfy themselves that all is well, and have the clout to get things put right if not. The senior judges who check on the lawfulness of intelligence work already exercise that legal power.</p><p>The ISC has recently been given enhanced powers to do its oversight job, including ensuring there is the right ethical culture throughout the intelligence community. The ISC now has to show it can understand the issues advanced intercept technology poses and must be given the expert help to do that. My feeling is that staff in the intelligence agencies would welcome deeper but more informed oversight, not least to protect their reputation.</p><p>Verification by so-called whistleblowers is certainly not the answer, as the Snowden case is dramatically revealing. When David Miranda, the partner of the Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – who has led on the Snowden story – was stopped by the police at Heathrow airport he was found to have on his hard drive 58,000 top secret British intelligence documents that had been shared with the NSA and stolen by Snowden (along with no doubt hundreds of thousands of comparable American intelligence documents). The British material covers in detail all aspects of the intelligence work we conduct alongside the US from detecting cyber-attacks to uncovering terrorist plots, to supporting our forces in Afghanistan.</p><p>And this material, British and American (and of other co-operating states), might now to be in the hands of the intelligence services of Russia and China. Not even the KGB in its 1950s heyday could have dreamed of being in a position to do so much damage to western intelligence. It will be like watching a slow motion car crash as lines of intelligence dry up, intelligence officers are exposed and cyber-attackers learn to avoid our defences. The Guardian sensibly agreed to have their copies in London destroyed under supervision so that other aggressive intelligence services would not be tempted to come after the stash, and the newspaper at least been selective in what it has published.</p><p>Even so, some damage to our security could still inadvertently have been done, since journalists are not best placed to know exactly what detail may complete the jigsaw puzzles of our adversaries. Instead of more revelations the Guardian should focus on a principled debate on how to allow intelligence agencies and law enforcement to do their job in keeping us from harm whilst preventing unjustified snooping by public or commercial sectors.</p><p><em>Professor Sir David Omand is a former director of GCHQ and a former intelligence and security co-ordinator for the prime minister</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418379177|2013-10-16T18:19:24Z|1e050aa4423882d8ff21645f3e6e68c7a64dcea7 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Pulitzer Prize winner explains how to fix journalism, saying press should 'fire 90% of editors and promote ones you can't control'. By <strong>Lisa O'Carroll</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Seymour Hersh on Obama, NSA and the 'pathetic' American media",
        "body":"<p>Seymour Hersh has got some extreme ideas on how to fix journalism – close down the news bureaus of NBC and ABC, sack 90% of editors in publishing and get back to the fundamental job of journalists which, he says, is to be an outsider.</p><p>It doesn't take much to fire up Hersh, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh\" title=\"\">the investigative journalist who has been the nemesis of US presidents since the 1960s</a> and who was once described by the Republican party as \"the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist\".</p><p>He is angry about the timidity of journalists in America, their failure to challenge the White House and be an unpopular messenger of truth.</p><p>Don't even get him started on the New York Times which, he says, spends \"so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would\" – or the death of Osama bin Laden. \"Nothing's been done about that story, it's one big lie, not one word of it is true,\" he says of the dramatic US Navy Seals raid in 2011 [see footnote].</p><p>Hersh is writing a book about national security and has devoted a chapter to the bin Laden killing. He says a recent report put out by an \"independent\" Pakistani commission about life in the Abottabad compound in which Bin Laden was holed up would not stand up to scrutiny. \"The Pakistanis put out a report, don't get me going on it. Let's put it this way, it was done with considerable American input. It's a bullshit report,\" he says hinting of revelations to come in his book.</p><p>The Obama administration lies systematically, he claims, yet none of the leviathans of American media, the TV networks or big print titles, challenge him.</p><p>\"It's pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama],\" he declares in an interview with the Guardian.</p><p>\"It used to be when you were in a situation when something very dramatic happened, the president and the minions around the president had control of the narrative, you would pretty much know they would do the best they could to tell the story straight. Now that doesn't happen any more. Now they take advantage of something like that and they work out how to re-elect the president.</p><p>He isn't even sure if the recent revelations about the depth and breadth of surveillance by the National Security Agency will have a lasting effect.</p><h2>Snowden changed the debate on surveillance<br /></h2><p>He is certain that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden \"changed the whole nature of the debate\" about surveillance. Hersh says he and other journalists had written about surveillance, but Snowden was significant because he provided documentary evidence – although he is sceptical about whether the revelations will change the US government's policy.</p><p>\"Duncan Campbell [the British investigative journalist who broke the Zircon cover-up story], James Bamford [US journalist] and Julian Assange and me and the New Yorker, we've all written the notion there's constant surveillance, but he [Snowden] produced a document and that changed the whole nature of the debate, it's real now,\" Hersh says.</p><p>\"Editors love documents. Chicken-shit editors who wouldn't touch stories like that, they love documents, so he changed the whole ball game,\" he adds, before qualifying his remarks.</p><p>\"But I don't know if it's going to mean anything in the long [run] because the polls I see in America – the president can still say to voters 'al-Qaida, al-Qaida' and the public will vote two to one for this kind of surveillance, which is so idiotic,\" he says.</p><p>Holding court to a packed audience at City University in London's summer school on investigative journalism, 76-year-old Hersh is on full throttle, a whirlwind of amazing stories of how journalism used to be; how he exposed the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, how he got the Abu Ghraib pictures of American soldiers brutalising Iraqi prisoners, and what he thinks of Edward Snowden.</p><h2>Hope of redemption<br /></h2><p>Despite his concern about the timidity of journalism he believes the trade still offers hope of redemption.</p><p>\"I have this sort of heuristic view that journalism, we possibly offer hope because the world is clearly run by total nincompoops more than ever … Not that journalism is always wonderful, it's not, but at least we offer some way out, some integrity.\"</p><p>His story of how he uncovered the My Lai atrocity is one of old-fashioned shoe-leather journalism and doggedness. Back in 1969, he got a tip about a 26-year-old platoon leader, William Calley, who had been charged by the army with alleged mass murder.</p><p>Instead of picking up the phone to a press officer, he got into his car and started looking for him in the army camp of Fort Benning in Georgia, where he heard he had been detained. From door to door he searched the vast compound, sometimes blagging his way, marching up to the reception, slamming his fist on the table and shouting: \"Sergeant, I want Calley out now.\"</p><p>Eventually his efforts paid off <a href=\"http://pierretristam.com/Bobst/library/wf-200.htm\" title=\"\">with his first story appearing in the St Louis Post-Despatch</a>, which was then syndicated across America and eventually earned him the Pulitzer Prize. \"I did five stories. I charged $100 for the first, by the end the [London] Times were paying $5,000.\"</p><p>He was hired by the New York Times to follow up the Watergate scandal and ended up hounding Nixon over Cambodia. Almost 30 years later, Hersh made global headlines all over again with his exposure of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.</p><h2>Put in the hours<br /></h2><p>For students of journalism his message is put the miles and the hours in. He knew about Abu Ghraib five months before he could write about it, having been tipped off by a senior Iraqi army officer who risked his own life by coming out of Baghdad to Damascus to tell him how prisoners had been writing to their families asking them to come and kill them because they had been \"despoiled\".</p><p>\"I went five months looking for a document, because without a document, there's nothing there, it doesn't go anywhere.\"</p><p>Hersh returns to US president Barack Obama. He has said before that the confidence of the US press to challenge the US government collapsed post 9/11, but he is adamant that Obama is worse than Bush.</p><p>\"Do you think Obama's been judged by any rational standards? Has Guantanamo closed? Is a war over? Is anyone paying any attention to Iraq? Is he seriously talking about going into Syria? We are not doing so well in the 80 wars we are in right now, what the hell does he want to go into another one for. What's going on [with journalists]?\" he asks.</p><p>He says investigative journalism in the US is being killed by the crisis of confidence, lack of resources and a misguided notion of what the job entails.</p><p>\"Too much of it seems to me is looking for prizes. It's journalism looking for the Pulitzer Prize,\" he adds. \"It's a packaged journalism, so you pick a target like – I don't mean to diminish because anyone who does it works hard – but are railway crossings safe and stuff like that, that's a serious issue but there are other issues too.</p><p>\"Like killing people, how does [Obama] get away with the drone programme, why aren't we doing more? How does he justify it? What's the intelligence? Why don't we find out how good or bad this policy is? Why do newspapers constantly cite the two or three groups that monitor drone killings. Why don't we do our own work?</p><p>\"Our job is to find out ourselves, our job is not just to say – here's a debate' our job is to go beyond the debate and find out who's right and who's wrong about issues. That doesn't happen enough. It costs money, it costs time, it jeopardises, it raises risks. There are some people – the New York Times still has investigative journalists but they do much more of carrying water for the president than I ever thought they would … it's like you don't dare be an outsider any more.\"</p><p>He says in some ways President George Bush's administration was easier to write about. \"The Bush era, I felt it was much easier to be critical than it is [of] Obama. Much more difficult in the Obama era,\" he said.</p><p>Asked what the solution is Hersh warms to his theme that most editors are pusillanimous and should be fired.</p><p>\"I'll tell you the solution, get rid of 90% of the editors that now exist and start promoting editors that you can't control,\" he says. I saw it in the New York Times, I see people who get promoted are the ones on the desk who are more amenable to the publisher and what the senior editors want and the trouble makers don't get promoted. Start promoting better people who look you in the eye and say 'I don't care what you say'.</p><p>Nor does he understand why the Washington Post held back on the Snowden files until it learned the Guardian was about to publish.</p><p>If Hersh was in charge of US Media Inc, his scorched earth policy wouldn't stop with newspapers.</p><p>\"I would close down the news bureaus of the networks and let's start all over, tabula rasa. The majors, NBCs, ABCs, they won't like this – just do something different, do something that gets people mad at you, that's what we're supposed to be doing,\" he says.</p><p>Hersh is currently on a break from reporting, working on a book which undoubtedly will make for uncomfortable reading for both Bush and Obama.</p><p>\"The republic's in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple.\" And he implores journalists to do something about it.</p><p>• This article was amended on 1 October 2013. The original text stated that Hersh sold a story about the My Lai massacre to the New York Times for $5,000 when in fact it was the Times of London. Hersh has pointed out that he was in no way suggesting that Osama bin Laden was not killed in Pakistan, as reported, upon the president's authority: he was saying that it was in the aftermath that the lying began. Finally, the interview took place in the month of July, 2013.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418419963|2013-10-16T18:19:24Z|c0972abd4261ca46f0d5943dd0e43aadbaf8d966 -->",

        "headline":"Sen. Ron Wyden: NSA 'repeatedly deceived the American people'",
        "body":"<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.])</strong></p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-senate-committee?CMP=twt_gu\">held a hearing</a>, ostensibly to investigate various issues raised about the NSA's activities. What the hearing primarily achieved instead was to underscore what a farce the notion of Congressional oversight over the NSA is. </p><p>In particular, the current chair of the Senate Committee created in the mid-1970s to oversee the intelligence community just so happens to be one of the nation's most steadfast and blind loyalists of and apologists for the National Security State: Dianne Feinstein. For years she has abused her position to shield and defend the NSA and related agencies rather than provide any meaningful oversight over it, which is a primary reason why it has grown into such an out-of-control and totally unaccountable behemoth.</p><p>Underscoring the purpose of yesterday's hearing (and the purpose of Feinstein's Committee more broadly): the witnesses the Committee first heard from were all Obama officials - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander, Deputy Attorney James Cole - who vehemently defended every aspect of the NSA. At the conclusion of their testimony, Feinstein announced that it was very, very important to hear from the two non-governmental witnesses the Committee had invited: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-26-at-5.01.04-PM.png\">virulent NSA defender</a> <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/08/the-nsa-the-washington-post-and-the-administration/\">Ben Wittes</a> of the Brooking Institution and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323309404578617463152440542.html\">virulent NSA defender Timothy Edgar</a>, a former Obama national security official. Hearing only from dedicated NSA apologists as witnesses: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/09/26/dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden\">that's \"oversight\" for Dianne Feinstein</a> and her oversight Committee. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Mark Warner stated the obvious to Gen. Alexander: \"a lot of Americans have lost trust in what you're doing.\" But of course they all spent the entire afternoon blaming Snowden and \"the media\" for this development rather than taking any responsibility themselves. The very idea that meaningful reform of the NSA will come out of this annexed, captured, corrupted Committee is ludicrous on its face.</p><p>But there are two members of that Committee who actually do take seriously its oversight mandate: Democrats Ron Wyden and Mark Udall. Those two <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/us/politics/democratic-senators-warn-about-use-of-patriot-act.html?_r=0\">spent years publicly winking and hinting that the NSA</a> under President Obama was engaged in all sorts of radical and abusive domestic surveillance (although - despite the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/1/breach_or_debate_congress_snowden_prism%20\">absolute immunity protection they enjoy as Senators under the Constitution</a> - they took no action, and instead waited for Edward Snowden (who had no such immunity) to bravely step up and reveal to the American people specifically what these two Senators kept hinting at). </p><p>Wyden spoke yesterday for 6 minutes - part of of it as monologue and part of it questioning Gen. Alexander - and it's really worth watching the video, embedded below. The Oregon Democrat condemned what he called \"the intrusive, constitutionally flawed surveillance system\" the NSA built. About Snowden's whistleblowing, he said that NSA officials should have known from \"a quick read of history, in America, the truth always managed to come out.\" And his primary point was this: \"<strong>the leadership of NSA built an intelligence collection system that repeatedly deceived the American people</strong>.\"</p><p>Indeed, if I had to pick the single most revealing aspect of this entire NSA scandal - and there are many revealing ones about many different realms - it would be that James Clapper <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/11/sen-wyden-clapper-didnt-give-straight-answer-on-nsa-programs/\">lied to the faces of the Senate Intelligence Committee about core NSA matters</a>, and not only was he not prosecuted <a href=\"http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/47/1001\">for that felony</a>, but he did not even lose his job, and continues to be treated with great reverence by the very Committee which he deliberately deceived. That one fact tells you all you need to know about how official Washington functions.</p><h2>Related issues</h2><p>This is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/opinion/have-a-nice-day-nsa.html?hp\">an insightful, and quite hilarious, Op-ed</a> in the New York Times this morning by the Brazilian journalist Vanessa Barbara about how Brazilians are using humor to mock and subvert the NSA's surveillance schemes.</p><p>Finally, in case there are any people left who thought that exploiting Terrorism and fear-mongering over it for power was a unique by-product of the Bush era (and really: could there <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/harry-reid-rand-paul-spar-over-patriot-act-on-senate-floor/2011/05/25/AGcgWRBH_blog.html\">really be any people left who believe that at this point?</a>), <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/324499-nsa-chief-pleads-for-publics-help-as-congress-eyes-restrictions#ixzz2g5cAVyzd\">Gen. Alexander this week</a> \"warned that if Congress hampers the NSA's ability to gather information, it could allow for terrorist attacks in the United States similar to last week's massacre in a mall in Nairobi, Kenya\", while Feinstein's deputy Chair, GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss (who revealingly sounds like every Democratic NSA defender I ever hear) said that the recent NSA disclosures \"caused huge damage to the US\" and \"would ultimately claim lives.\"</p><h2>UPDATE</h2><p>Anyone who has any interest in understanding how the US media works: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/sep/27/seymour-hersh-obama-nsa-american-media\">please read this article about what Seymour Hersh said in a speech yesterday</a> regarding government-subservient, \"chicken shit\" US journalists. editors and media outlets. It is hard to put into words just how comprehensively accurate his remarks are.</p><h2>UPDATE II [Sat.]</h2><p>On Twitter, Wittes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/383914571926220800\">objects</a> to my description of him as a \"virulent NSA defender\", saying: \"I am certainly an NSA defender, but curious what I have said that strikes you as 'virulent'. I try to keep virulence out of it.\" It's a fair point, and was a bad word choice on my part. I meant to convey that he's steadfast, relentless and intense in his defense of the NSA - I probably was thinking of \"vehement\". \"Virulent\" connotes poisonous or spiteful rhetoric and Wittes generally avoids that. In my view, he's certainly a hard-core apologist for NSA abuses and more generally a highly loyal US government defender, but he usually employs a Brookings-type civil tone when engaging in all that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418448049|2013-10-16T18:19:24Z|11723a7435df85a622ca7cc9664cab9a10d16884 -->",
