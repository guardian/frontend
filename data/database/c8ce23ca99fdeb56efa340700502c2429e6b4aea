Please post your comments below.</p> <p>Here's a roundup of the latest developments and analysis:</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46174&amp;Cr=Syria&amp;Cr1=#.Uk0B3XEaC3U\"><strong>The UN's security council unanimously agreed a new statement calling for unfettered humanitarian access to Syria.</strong></a> The UN's&nbsp;aid chief Valerie Amos said that if the statement's requests on aid access were implemented fully then humanitarian groups could help some 2 million people in Syria who have for many months been unreachable.&nbsp;Syria's UN ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said his government would study the council statement before responding.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46174&amp;Cr=Syria&amp;Cr1=#.Uk0B3XEaC3U\" data-alt=\"un-aid-chief-valerie-amos\"> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1722935254001?bctid=2714326484001&amp;autoStart=false&amp;width=460&amp;height=276\"></iframe> </figure> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/PRST/2013/15\"><strong>The full text of the statement begins:</strong></a>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria and all other States affected by the Syrian conflict, and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p> <p> The Security Council calls on all parties to respect the UN guiding principles of humanitarian emergency assistance and stresses the importance of such assistance being delivered on the basis of need, devoid of any political prejudices and aims.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/02/uk-extra-87m-food-syria-children\">British ministers have allocated an extra &pound;87m to the UN World Food Programme to reach a 230,000 more Syrian children and their families over the next six months.</a>&nbsp;</strong>Officials said the Syrian humanitarian crisis has reached catastrophic proportions, even though there has been diplomatic progress on chemical weapons and, in principle, humanitarian access.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.opcw.org/media-corner/daily-bulletins-on-syria/chemical-weapons-team-gets-down-to-work-in-syria/\"><strong>International inspectors have completed their day's work of an ambitious programme to disarm Syria of chemical weapons while fighting in the country continues.</strong></a> In a statement the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said the team's first task was to secure sties where it will operate.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/uk-syria-crisis-russia-idUKBRE9910KN20131002\"><strong>Russia's&nbsp;President, Vladimir Putin, said the international community is &quot;on the right track&quot; with a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons as it could avert military intervention.</strong></a> Reuters quoted him saying:&nbsp;&quot;I believe that if we continue to act in such a coordinated way, it will not be necessary to use force and increase the number of people wounded and killed in the long-suffering land of Syria.&quot;</p> <h2>Qatar</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/qatar-workers-deaths-fifa-world-cup-2022\"><strong>International pressure on Qatar to prevent exploitation of migrant workers in the buildup to the 2022 football World Cup has escalated as victims' groups and the United Nations urged the game's governing body to act to halt a death toll that is already in the hundreds.</strong></a> The&nbsp;Uefa president, Michel Platini, said he was &quot;much more concerned&quot; with allegations over the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf state than with discussions over whether to move the tournament to winter. And Britain's sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said it should be &quot;a precondition of the delivery of every major sports event that the very highest standards of health and safety are applied&quot;.</p> <h2>&nbsp;Iraq</h2> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/exclusive-iraq-still-using-bogus-bomb-detectors--and-thousands-pay-the-price-8854567.html\">Bogus bomb detectors are still being used in Iraq five months after a British businessman who supplied the devices was found guilty of fraud, the Independent reports.</a>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;More than 4,500 people are estimated to have been killed in Iraq – 979 of them in September alone – since James McCormick, a former policeman, was convicted at the Old Bailey in April. His trial heard that the devices he was selling, called ADE-651, were based on novelty golf-ball finders and had no scientific means of detecting explosives.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/gunmen-attack-russian-embassy-tripoli\"><strong>Gunmen have attacked the Russian embassy in the Libyan capital Tripoli hours after news broke that a Russian woman had been arrested and accused of killing a senior military official.</strong></a>&nbsp;The Russian foreign ministry said diplomats were safe and had been evacuated after unknown attackers attempted to break into the embassy grounds. Four Libyans were wounded in the attack, local media reported.</p> <h2>&nbsp;Iran</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/oct/02/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-internet-online-censorship\"><strong>President Hassan Rouhani hinted he will reduce online censorship in an exchange with Twitter's co-founder, Jack Dorsey.</strong></a>&nbsp;Dorsey started the conversation on Tuesday, asking the internet-savvy leader if people of his country could read tweets posted by their own president, implicitly referring to the filtering of social networking websites in the Islamic republic. Rouhani's replied that he would make sure Iranians had access to information globally.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418930525|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|1e8be792866f17cd5e7f1aa0bda93e675ae6b753 -->",
