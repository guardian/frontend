Robin Lustig, a judge for the journalism prize, said of Freedland: &quot;He has been on the shortlist of the Orwell prize seven times now. His writing has a lucidity and elegance of style that deserves reward.&quot;</p> <p>Guardian foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad won the Orwell prize for journalism for his work on the Syrian conflict, including a special report on a jihadist group effort to take control in the country. Lustig said: &quot;He has shown great personal courage and a rare depth of understanding. He writes with deep compassion for those whose lives have been shattered by the conflict.&quot;</p> <p>The winners were chosen from 235 entries to the book prize and 167 entries to the journalism prize.</p> <p>The books category was won by former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson for his memoir, This Boy, which also won the Ondaatje literary prize.</p> <p>Sue MacGregor, a judge for the books award, said: &quot;This is a tale told without a trace of self-pity, but with great grace and good humour, of what it was like growing up poor in a single- parent family in post-war Britain. It is at once deeply personal and nationally significant, and a highly engaging read.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9072206","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2096785","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>Foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad praised for work on Syria while Jonathan Freedland awarded special prize for 'lucidity and elegance' of his writing</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Two Guardian journalists win Orwell prize for journalism","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Williams","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698418276/Jonathan-Freedland-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3pe6j","wordcount":"242","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698418276/Jonathan-Freedland-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5699e5dce4b02dca51f5ad35","newspaperPageNumber":"2","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-24T18:55:31Z","standfirst":"Foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad praised for work on Syria while Jonathan Freedland awarded special prize for 'lucidity and elegance' of his writing<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/alan-johnson-wins-2014-orwell-prize\">Alan Johnson wins Orwell political writing prize for This Boy</a>","linkText":"Two Guardian journalists win Orwell prize for journalism","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-16T06:41:02.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"437480645"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-437484026","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698424922/Jonathan-Freedland-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"PD*8176351","altText":"Jonathan Freedland","caption":"Jonathan Freedland has been shortlisted for the Orwell prize seven times.
