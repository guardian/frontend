        "headline":"Anthony Joshua relishes professional debut by knocking out Emanuele Leo",
        "body":"<p>It says something about the destructive force of Anthony Joshua's fists, as well as the popularity of Britain's likeable Olympic super-heavyweight champion, that the walk back to his dressing room took rather longer than his professional debut. There were people to greet, random hands to shake, a late-night victory to revel in.</p><p>One onlooker kept shouting: \"You're the future! You are going to shake it all up!\" It was delirious and premature and yet somehow fitting: Joshua's power and potential was obvious as he bludgeoned the Italian Emanuele Leo repeatedly with right hands before knocking him out two minutes and 47 seconds into the first round.</p><p>The plan now is for Joshua to undergo the boxing equivalent of an accelerated-learning course. He will fight three more times in 2013, starting this month on the undercard of the Kell Brook bill in Sheffield, and a further eight times in 2014. He also plans to speak again to Lennox Lewis and contact the Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir, to mine further advice.</p><p>Joshua says he is determined to do things the right way; he knows that past performance is no guarantee of future success. But for the next few days he wants to revel in his first professional victory.</p><p>\"The key was to relax and enjoy what I was doing,\" explained Joshua. \"When I hit him I could see I was hurting him but I always had to remember what could come back. But I'm looking forward to getting back into the gym and learning again.\"</p><p>Asked what he had learned, he replied: \"Not to get mixed up in a tear-up. I was surprised he took what he took. I saw I hurt him a few times but as my trainer told me, 'it's six rounds, break him down'.\"</p><p>Joshua said the 30 minutes it took to get his hands bandaged was when he realised this was \"the real deal\".</p><p>\"Normally you wrap your bandages yourself or have someone quickly do it for you but this time I was going into battle. One layer. Two layers. Three layers. I thought: this is the pros now, you have to step up. I know I have a lot to give. Leo isn't a world-beater but I want to earn respect.\"</p><p>The World Boxing Association super-bantamweight world champion, Scott Quigg, meanwhile, retained his title with a majority draw over the Miami-based Cuban Yoandris Salinas on the co-headliner of Saturday's bill. Quigg plans to fight again on the undercard of Carl Froch v George Groves at the end of November before a possible a reunification fight with the International Boxing Federation champion Kiko Martínez next spring.</p><p>It was a strange, slow-slow-fast fight, with the Cuban dominating a torpid first six rounds with his jab before Quigg rallied vigorouslyto leave Salinas clinging on at the death. It led to suggestions that Quigg had started too slowly, but afterwards he insisted that was the strategy.</p><p>\"The plan was to bore him in the first four or five rounds so he used a bit of energy and switched off before putting down the gears and staying close,\" he said. \"I was mentally tiring him. And from the 10th round onwards he was wincing. He wasn't enjoying it. I hit him with a left hook with the body and after that he was covering up.  I believe I won the fight.\"</p><p>Quigg's promoter, Eddie Hearn, agreed, saying: \"Salinas is an avoided fighter. Everyone in America thought he was going to win it. But Scott completely dominated the back-end of the fight and nicked a couple of the first six rounds.\"</p><p>Where Quigg has led, other British super-bantamweights may yet follow. The European champion, Carl Frampton, has a victory over Martínez, on his ledger, while the British champion, Kid Galahad, has shown enough to suggest that he belongs in a higher class, too. But for now, Quigg is putting unification fights before domestic dust-ups.</p><p>One of the things the likeable lad from Bury will do this week is to return to the school where he persuaded his teachers to expel him so he could start a boxing career, to show them his belt. \"The teachers who were in that room that day when I asked to be expelled will be proud of me,\" he said. \"When I said I was going to be a boxer one of them laughed but they know I have not wasted the talent I have got. They knew I had the drive to do it, which is why they allowed me to leave, provided I did a day of week in college.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419190205|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2ffdce2432e01f6b6d4b5400fc524b74e908a0ce -->",

        "headline":"Anthony Joshua starts pro career with quick knockout of Emanuele Leo",
        "body":"<p>Britain's Olympic super-heavyweight gold medallist Anthony Joshua made an emphatic entrance into the professional ranks by blasting out the Italian Emanuele Leo in the opening round.</p><p>By the time Joshua entered the ring to Kanye West it was nearly midnight, but luckily for those at the O2 Arena, he was in no mood to hang about.</p><p>He staggered Leo several times with right crosses and while the Italian marched forward gamely, the effect was rather like watching a World War One soldier walking into a battery of machine-gun fire. A series of concussive punches ended it 2min 47sec into the first round.</p><p>\"This was just as important as winning the Olympics,\" said Joshua. \"And I ended it in spectacular fashion. I had been out of the ring for 14 months but I've built a really strong team around me.\"</p><p>Leo had not tasted defeat in his eight professional contests, but his was a record as puffy as his midsection. The combined record of the Italian's opponents – 37 wins, 19 draws and 170 losses - told you about his level, and his two contests since 2010 spoke just as eloquently about his preparation.</p><p>But Joshua still had to get him out. And that is what he did – in powerful and impressive fashion. Not that he is getting carried away.</p><p>\"I'd love to be in the heavyweight mix but I've got a long way to go to get there,\" he admitted. \"We'll gauge my progress as I keep winning and keep learning in the gym and we'll see what I am ready for fight-by-fight. I don't want to promise things I can't deliver. I don't want to talk much trash. I want to back things up. It's going to be a tough road and hard work but I'm going to put the work in.\"</p><p>In the co-headliner, Scott Quigg retained his WBA super-bantamweight title after rallying to secure a majority draw with the Miami-based Cuban Yoandris Salinas. The 24-year-old was handed the world title by the WBA rather than winning it in the ring, having previously held their interim title, and had pledged he wouldn't touch the belt until he had won it properly. But after a determined late effort he was rightly delighted to see it draped around his waist. One judge, Ruben Garcia, gave him the fight by a margin of 115-113. The two others made it 114-114, making the fight a technical draw, much to Quigg's disappointment.</p><p>\"I feel I won the fight by two rounds,\" he said. \"I stuck to my gameplan. I knew he would be sharp early on, and I'm gutted I didn't get the win. He had 300 amateur fights, I had 12 but I feel I showed that I belong at world level.\"</p><p>Initially, Salinas's low hands and fast jabs offered a conundrum that Quigg seemed unable to solve. During the first half of the fight the action arrived only intermittently and, when it came, it was on Salinas's terms.</p><p>But slowly, Quigg was gaining control. In the eighth a cuffing right hand knocking Salinas off balance, and there was further success to the body in the ninth and 10th. After another decent round in the 11th, Quigg tried desperately to close the show but Salinas was on his bike, fiddling his way to the finish.</p><p>Another British Olympic gold medallist, Luke Campbell, gave a brief but breathtaking exhibition of his talents as he knocked out Neil Hepper with a savage body shot after two minutes.</p><p>Campbell, who stopped Andy Harris after 88sec in his debut in July, took a little longer in his second paid fight but it was enough to display his hand speed and his power.</p><p>\"I'm switched on, I train hard and come fight I'm prepared,\" said Campbell, who finished proceedings with a brutal body shot. \"I'm learning as I go but I just want to excite the fans.\"</p><p>Also on the O2 bill Lee Selby claimed the Lonsdale belt after defending his British and Commonwealth championship with unanimous points victory over Ryan Walsh.</p><p>Selby was cut under both eyes early but he had the guile to pick through Walsh's defences with his jab and win through by 118-112, 118-110, 117-111 on the judges' cards.</p><p>Meanwhile Kevin Mitchell's sixth-round dismantling of the Mexican Marco Lopez suggested that a third world title shot, at 28, may not beyond him. Next, though, he wants Commonwealth lightweight champion Derry Mathews - a fight, if made, would be a cracker.</p><p></p><p>Wladimir Klitschko retained his WBA, IBO, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles with a unanimous points victory over the Russian Alexander Povetkin, whom he knocked down four times on the way.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419159260|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|bbe3425fa10cf73ec99f669db25f80783afd4966 -->",

        "body":"<p>It says something about Anthony Joshua's relaxed state of mind before his professional debut that, after spending an hour thoughtfully answering the media's questions, he spent nearly as long playfully arm-wrestling friends. No one mustered much of a challenge. You suspect his opponent on Saturday night, the Italian Emanuele Leo, will not either.</p><p>Leo's CV shows an unbeaten 8-0 record, but the physical disparity with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/anthony-joshua-wins-gold-boxing\" title=\"\">Britain's Olympic super-heavyweight gold medallist</a> was laid bare when their tops were removed at Friday's weigh-in. Both came in a shade over 16st 6lb, but so muscular and defined was Joshua's midsection that it could have been sculpted from marble. Leo's dough belly, meanwhile, owed rather too much to mamma's pasta.</p><p>However, Joshua is not taking anything for granted. After Audley Harrison won Olympic gold in Sydney his one-man hype-machine hyperventilated on its own hubris; Joshua stresses the need to learn and stay humble.</p><p>After shaking hands with Leo – something he always did with opponents in the amateurs – he insisted the fight would  be just as important to him as his gold medal bout.</p><p>\"This is a serious business,\" he said. \"It's like the Olympic final for me. I'm going to be walking out in front of nearly 20,000 people and Leo has come to fight; he's got a winner's mentality. I've got to make sure I'm relaxed, perform to what I'm capable of and the win will come.\"</p><p>Leo appears resigned to his fate as a suitable sacrificial lamb who will test Joshua but not overextend him. The Italian admitted he had not watched Joshua and was not exactly talking up his chances of springing a surprise.</p><p>\"I hope I will do a good fight and win,\" he said. He claims to have a decent jab and left hook. Questions about his chin, however, remain unanswered.</p><p>The same can be said about Joshua – whose rare blend of physique, power and light-footed nimbleness, as well as his Olympic gold medal, advertise  his pedigree.</p><p>\"I've never been knocked down in a fight,\" Joshua added. \"The only time it happened was in the amateurs when I first went up to Sheffield and started training with elite fighters. It happens to everyone. Every heavyweight I face is going to have knockouts on their record. The main thing I've got to learn is not to take silly shots.\"</p><p>Joshua believes he has improved significantly since winning gold at London 2012. \"I'm more comfortable in the ring,\" he said. \"At the Olympics it was more determination and fitness that got me through my battles. Now I can stand close and slip, parry and counter. I'm a multi-dimensional boxer.\"</p><p>In the buildup to his debut he has received good luck messages from the Klitschko brothers, Wladimir and Vitali, who told him: \"Good luck and welcome to the professional world\", as well as David Haye, whom he describes as \"a really cool guy\", adding: \"Some heavyweights are a bit <sup></sup>standoffish but he's someone you can speak to for advice.\" In the future he hopes to spar with Wladimir, who fights the unbeaten Russian Alexander Povetkin on Saturday.</p><p>Joshua has also heard from Harrison, who wished him all the best with what lies ahead. \"I've got a lot of respect for Audley,\" Joshua insisted. \"There is a lot of negative energy towards him but it takes a man to get into the ring.\"</p><p>While Joshua should win with few scares or blemishes, Bury's WBA super-bantamweight world champion, Scott Quigg, faces a real battle against the unbeaten Cuban Yoandris Salinas – in what is likely to be the fight of the night. \"I know what I am up against,\" Quigg said. \"He's a very good fighter but I'm 100% confident.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419095297|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d1adb2930d6bd5e88d3ce7d88427fb94dc3aca77 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\" was how the record company's slogan put it back in the 1960s. Equally, nobody plays Ali like Ali, then or now. So it was sensible of the director Stephen Frears and the screenwriter Shawn Slovo to mix original newsreel footage with newly shot material when putting together their film Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight, which they presented to an audience at the British Film Institute on Tuesday night.</p><p>Its US premiere took place 24 hours later in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali's home town, kicking off Three Days of Greatness, a gala at which humanitarian awards were presented in the boxer's name to recipients including Jimmy Carter and Christina Aguilera. No one who saw it on either side of the Atlantic this week could doubt that if any sceptic, at any time in the future, were to question the wider significance of Ali's life, this film would at least start the job of putting them straight.</p><p>In this telling, Ali's greatest fight was not the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXeIoHQahbQ\" title=\"\">Rumble in the Jungle </a>or the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WUgJdygEcA\" title=\"\">Thriller in Manila</a>. Based on accounts <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781590772089\" title=\"\">in a book of the same name written a dozen years ago by Howard Bingham</a>, the magazine photographer who became Ali's close friend, the film focuses on the events surrounding the US Supreme Court's decision in 1971 not to send the boxer to jail for his refusal to be drafted into the services during the Vietnam war. It was a moment at which the civil rights and anti-war struggles intersected, giving vital publicity and impetus to protests aimed at persuading the US government to extract its armed forces – with their disproportionate number of black servicemen – from south-east Asia.</p><p>Slovo told the London audience that, since Supreme Court deliberations are not minuted or otherwise recorded, it had been necessary to invent the exchanges leading up to the historic verdict by a group of judges whose average at the time was north of 70. She relied on the known histories of the nine men, who are played by a group of distinguished actors, led by Christopher Plummer, Frank Langella and Danny Glover.</p><p>\"There's a kind of freedom in that lack of documentation,\" Slovo said, and if that is true, then she has used the freedom effectively to depict a body created to be free from political influence and yet whose chief justice, Warren Burger (played by Langella), was clearly operating according to the wishes of President Nixon.</p><p>For dramatic purposes, the screenwriter also created a group of younger lawyers attached to the individual justices, among whom the debate rages most fiercely. The most significant of them – the one whose commitment tips the balance – is played by Benjamin Walker, a 31-year-old American actor who was also present on Tuesday, telling the audience that, although he had boxed as a youth, he had been unaware of the details or the significance of the story with which the film deals.</p><p>\"This was a time,\" Walker added, rather wistfully, \"when young people were more involved in politics than I imagine they are today.\" You can say that again. And among the figures who inspired the young people of half a century ago was a boxer who, in Walker's words, \"had the ability to remain composed and articulate in the face of a massive amount of opposition\".</p><p>Frears, who so successfully cast Helen Mirren as the Queen and is currently making a film about Lance Armstrong with Ben Foster in the lead role, expressed his relief at not having to find an actor to play Ali. By using the newsreel footage to tell the story of Ali's rise, his conversion to Islam and his confrontation with the authorities, he injects immediacy and momentum to the narrative that unfolds within the Supreme Court building.</p><p>To boxing fans, Ali's legal battle perhaps took second place to his achievements in the ring. But Frears pointed out that, even after winning his world title back against George Foreman in Zaire in 1974, Ali was still enraged by the memory of the years stolen from him by the political establishment.</p><p>Cinemas no longer offer double bills, but I was fortunate to walk into Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight straight from seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/26/nothing-but-a-man-review\" title=\"\">Nothing But a Man</a>, a 1964 film by the director Michael Roemer, little seen at the time but now restored and being shown at the BFI. Set in Birmingham, Alabama just before the civil rights movement broke surface, it deals with a young black man whose attempt to settle down and live a decent life is disrupted when he is sacked for attempting to unionise his co-workers at a sawmill and finds himself suddenly being turned away by other potential employers.</p><p>Shot in black and white, in the style of Italian neo-realist cinema, it captures the texture of life among men whose pride is destroyed by socio-economic powerlessness and women who have to cope with the consequences. Music&nbsp;– whether the gospel choir in a Baptist church or the sound of Martha and the Vandellas throbbing from jukeboxes, car windows and back doors – is everywhere.</p><p>Roemer and Robert M Young, his collaborator on the screenplay, end the film on a note of optimism, with the young couple at the centre of the film, played by Ivan Dixon and the great jazz singer Abbey Lincoln, repairing their relationship and resolving not to buckle under the pressures imposed by a racist society. But the modern viewer is aware that, between the making of the film and its release, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/four-black-schoolgirls-killed-in-birmingham\" title=\"\">a group of white supremacists dynamited a Birmingham church, killing four schoolgirls</a> in one of the most terrible atrocities of the civil rights era.</p><p>That was how the world was when Cassius Clay encountered Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, changed his name to Muhammad Ali, and forced the whole world, from boxing promoters to the president of the United States, to deal with the meaning of his gesture.</p><p>\"You see him fighting for his principles,\" said Attallah Shabazz, Malcolm X's daughter, after seeing the film in Louisville, with Ali and his wife, Lonnie, also in the audience. Those principles continue to make him a worldwide symbol of resistance to oppression and discrimination.</p><p>Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight was funded by HBO, which will broadcast it in the US on Saturday night, to be followed on Wednesday by a UK screening on Sky Atlantic. Nothing But a Man has just begun a run at the BFI. It was my luck to see the two films on the same evening, which is something that might never happen again – although it should, and not just by coincidence.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419063608|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f5dff28707dc25f5e0931f6311d0ceb52155ae59 -->",

        "body":"<p>Amir Khan's matchmaker insists he has \"no knowledge\" of a proposed mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather in May and says that the IBF welterweight champion Devon Alexander is still next in line for the Bolton fighter.</p><p>Robert Diaz, the chief matchmaker of Golden Boy Promotions – which looks after Khan's promotional interests – said he was surprised to hear suggestions that a deal to fight Mayweather was nearly done. \"I got a couple of emails on Wednesday and I said: 'What is this?' I have no knowledge of this, I haven't heard anything about this, I don't know where it is coming from. Really, I can't believe it. That subject hasn't even been brought up.\"</p><p>Diaz suggested that internet rumours mooting a Khan v Mayweather fight, coupled with the continuing delay in signing contracts for Khan to fight Alexander on 7 December, had led to the story. \"From what I am seeing, a couple of different pieces have been moved around to make it look like it was a story. I think we know who it was. To my knowledge his next fight will be on December 7 against Devon Alexander.\"</p><p>Asked why the Alexander fight is being held up, Diaz replied: \"These things are never done overnight. There's always back-and-forths, language changes. It could be something as little as fight tickets. That's why we haven't announced, but we are announcing soon.\"</p><p>Of course in boxing what is true one day can be false the next. And the closer the proposed Alexander bout gets without contracts being signed the more likely it is that the improbable could become possible and then fact. The attraction for Khan facing Mayweather, the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, is obvious. He would earn between five to 10 times more than fighting Alexander. But he would go into such a fight having been inactive for 13 months and also moving up in weight class.</p><p>The cards would not only be stacked against him, but piled skyscraper high.</p><p>Diaz's emphatic comments reinforced those made by Khan's promotion group Team Khan earlier on Wednesday. In a statement they said: \"Team Khan would like to dispel recent reports that Amir Khan has pulled out of a potential match-up against Devon Alexander on December 7th, taking up a fight against Floyd Mayweather in May of next year instead.</p><p>\"Amir is currently in training camp in San Francisco with the aim of fighting again in December against Alexander once an agreement can be reached.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the Olympic super-heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua has targeted a British title by the end of 2014 and a world title by 2017. Joshua, who fights the Italian Emanuele Leo in his first professional fight at the O2 Arena on Saturday, says his plan is to fight twice more in 2013 and eight times in 2014.</p><p>\"It depends on progress, step by step, but I believe it's a four-year cycle to become a world champion, just like the Olympics was between 2008 and 2012,\" he said.</p><p>When Joshua, who is keen to spar the Klitchkos and David Haye to further his development, was asked whether he could be a world champion by 2017 he nodded, adding: \"Sure it's possible.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419004910|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|62d6fc4e77c918ffd6f70a26f07512cb9d0aba6e -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>That 1980s Sports Blog: </strong>Somewhere between the racial tensions in the build-up and the rioting at Wembley Arena in the aftermath, a fight broke out</p>",
        "headline":"Remembering Alan Minter v Marvin Hagler: one of boxing's lowest moments",
        "body":"<p>It wasn't supposed to end like this for either Alan Minter or Marvin Hagler on the night of 27 September 1980. Minter had just seen his all too brief grip on the WBA/WBC world middleweight titles end in seven minutes and 45 seconds of punishment, his face a mess, blood streaming from gashes inflicted by the superb Hagler.</p><p>The American should have been elated, but any such emotions were soon replaced with genuine fear, as bottles and cans of beer headed towards the ring, the new champion fleeing the scene before he could even receive his belts. A shameful end to the story of Minter versus Hagler, but in retrospect perhaps not a surprising conclusion given what had preceded it.</p><p>The ingredients were all in place for what was to follow at Wembley: a simmering race-row between the pair leading up to the fight; petty squabbles on seismic issues such as beards and cuts; the quick defeat of a home favourite; and a beer-fuelled crowd, unable to accept what had taken place in front of their eyes. It doesn't excuse what happened, yet it goes a long way to explaining how the evening descended into scenes Harry Carpenter would later describe as \"my low point of my many years at British ringsides\".</p><p>Minter's rise to world champion could hardly be described as smooth. After winning a bronze medal at the Munich Olympics as a light middleweight, Minter's professional career began promisingly, 11 straight wins earmarking him as a fighter to watch. But Minter's Achilles' heel throughout his career was about to strike, as his prospects took a nose dive in the space of one turbulent year.</p><p>Losses to Don McMillan, Jan Magdziarz (twice) and Ricky Ortiz blocked Minter's progress between 1973 and 1974. That all of these defeats were down to cuts was a worrying development, one that would come back to haunt him in future bouts against Ronnie Harris and Gratien Tonna in 1977, although Minter would show great determination and resolve after losing the latter. Eight straight wins, including his third over Kevin Finnegan, and a revenge win over Tonna, gave Minter a shot at Vito Antuofermo's WBC and WBA titles in Las Vegas.</p><p>A split decision win in America – the first British man to go to the States and win a world title since Ted Kid Lewis in 1917 – saw an emotional Minter achieve his dream in March 1980, and after successfully defeating Antuofermo in a rematch at Wembley, a defence against the No1 contender in Marvin Hagler zoomed into focus.</p><p>That Minter had fought Antuofermo at all still rankled with Hagler and his camp. Somehow the world title fight between Hagler and Antuofermo in 1979 had been deemed as a draw, meaning the Italian-American retained his belts, although anyone who witnessed the bout, including referee Mills Lane, who congratulated Hagler at the final bell, knew Hagler was the rightful winner; the Times' boxing correspondent Srikumar Sen even had Hagler ahead by four rounds.</p><p>Such was Hagler's annoyance, that he claimed credit for Minter's subsequent win, saying: \"Minter is only champion because he gained the benefit of the beating I gave to Antuofermo in Las Vegas.\" It was not the only shot fired in the war of words that led up to judgement day.</p><p>Unfortunately, the first few exchanges between the pair, were to stir up racial tensions. The row began in earnest before the Antuofermo-Hagler fight, with Hagler refusing to shake Minter's hand – the British fighter was in the country to watch the contest – and on Hagler's arrival in the UK, the subject was dug up once more.</p><p>It had been claimed that Hagler had once said to Kevin Finnegan that \"I don't touch white flesh\", although Hagler strongly refuted this accusation. \"I make a point of never shaking hands with future opponents,\" commented Hagler, adding that he didn't feel it appropriate to do so with someone he intended to inflict damage upon, and also indicating that he always shook hands with his opponent, including Finnegan on two separate occasions, after a fight.</p><p>Minter did not exactly help matters though. Talking about the challenge ahead, his proclamation that he had worked 17 years to get to the top and that he \"did not intend to lose his title to a black man\", was unhelpful to put it mildly, Hagler understandably responding in a furious manner: \"He will pay for saying that when we meet at Wembley.\"</p><p>The defence put forward by Minter – that he had been misquoted and had actually said \"that black man\" – papered over the cracks, as either way he had referenced the colour of Hagler's skin, and fanned the flames ahead of the fight.</p><p>It appeared that both parties could find anything to fall out over, a case in point being the Minter camp insisting that Hagler shave his beard off pre-fight, their obvious concern relating to Minter's cut history and the American using his stubble in clinches to his advantage.</p><p>Not to be outdone, back came Hagler's team, pointing out that they would be keeping a very close eye on the work of Minter's cuts man – the Californian expert Jackie McCoy had been used by the champion in his two previous world title fights – insisting they would have Minter stripped of his title if any unknown substances (other than one part water to 1,000 parts adrenalin) were applied to his face.</p><p>According to The Times, the bookies had Minter as 8/11 favourite with Hagler at 11/10, although the previews of the fight tended to paint a different picture. \"I feel Minter is in grave danger of losing to Hagler, the man good judges rate the most capable and dangerous in the division,\" wrote the Mirror's Frank McGhee, who was not alone in voicing his concerns. Srikumar Sen in the Times was chillingly accurate in part of his assessment: \"For British supporters, the bout could well have an unsatisfactory ending with the referee stepping in to prevent Minter losing too much blood.\"</p><p>If the booing greeting Hagler's arrival to the ring on the night was inevitable, and the disrespectful whistling of the US national anthem by a minority not totally unexpected, the hostility in the crowd was something else. \"Wembley Arena was reeking, not so much of nationalism, but had a decidedly rancid smell of racialism,\" noted Harry Carpenter after the fight, and stories of over-zealous fans ripping up any banners held by Hagler supporters were commonplace. Hagler's wife, Bertha, was advised to leave her stars and stripes flag safely tucked away, through fears of trouble. Very wise.</p><p>The sight of Minter approaching the ring behind a Union flag and St George's cross increased the volume within the venue, with the rousing rendition of God Save the Queen adding to the feelings of nationalistic pride brewing at Wembley. After the fight, American promoter Bob Arum would call for a ban of the national anthems, suggesting that the feelings these stirred within some led to some of the issues on display at Wembley. Henry Cooper's call for a ban of booze may have been closer to the mark.</p><p>Among all the fuss of the build-up, and the chaos of the aftermath, the actual fight itself almost feels like a sideshow. But in the short space of time in which the fight took place, it is possible to appreciate just how good Hagler was on the night, and comprehend why he dominated the division for years to come. Minter had his moments, yet it was clear for all to see on the highlights (no live coverage back in 1980), that Hagler was a cut above the champion, if you pardon the pun.</p><p>With a little over a minute gone in the fight, Minter was already cut, the unerring accuracy and power of Hagler's jabs causing problems. The challenger, who had weighed in half a pound over the 160 limit (he lost the excess within half an hour), strode confidently around the ring, landing combinations on Minter that forced the cut under his eye.</p><p>Prior to the fight, the Minter plan had been to bide his time and stretch the fight out in an attempt to test a perceived lack of stamina in Hagler. But in the second round, this strategy appeared to have been abandoned, as an enthusiastic Minter, perhaps driven on by the partisan home support, became embroiled in some furious exchanges with the American.</p><p>Going toe to toe with Hagler was never the wisest of moves, and although Minter did shake his opponent with a fine left hook, his tactics were foolish in the extreme. \"I fought the wrong fight,\" Minter would openly admit after the event, both he and his manager Doug Bidwell revealing that the punch that rattled Hagler was the point at which Minter's senses left him.</p><p>Hagler was undeterred by his brief moment of concern, his consistently good work opening up a cut below Minter's right eye, with more blood dripping from the champion's nose at the end of the second round. The third and final round provided more of the same. Hagler was simply suffocating a blood-splattered Minter, another wound appearing above the right eye of the Englishman, one punch from Hagler knocking Minter's gum shield clean from his mouth. \"He can't keep the man away,\" screamed Harry Carpenter, as Minter tried manfully to wipe the blood from his face and repel the dominant Hagler.</p><p>The end was nigh. The Panamanian referee, Carlos Berrocal, stepped in, taking Minter to his corner to examine the damage. It was all over. Berrocal, in agreement with Bidwell, called an end to proceedings, Minter's cuts were so severe that there was simply no way for the fight to continue; Minter would receive 15 stitches later that evening. Hagler sunk to his knees, his arms aloft in celebration at finally achieving his ambition. And then all hell broke loose.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418951956'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/3/1380795880211/Alan-Minter-v-Marvin-Hagl-003.jpg' alt='Alan Minter v Marvin Hagler riot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Marvin Hagler disappears beneath the protective bodies of his entourage as beer bottles fly into the ring. Photograph: Rex/Monty Fresco/Associated Ne</figcaption></figure><p>The natives were not amused. Disappointment at seeing their boy battered, combined with an unjustified rage towards Berrocal for stopping the fight, led to an explosion in anger within Wembley Arena. Beer bottles and cans rained down on the ring, Hagler's celebrations cut short as his corner surrounded him to protect the new champion. With the help of the police, Hagler and his corner were bundled to safety, but for the VIPs (including Telly Savalas) and commentators ringside, there was little or no hiding place.</p><p>\"And there is chaos here, absolute chaos. I'm smothered in beer and so are all my colleagues around me,\" said an understandably shaky Carpenter, who was struck on the head by a bottle. Some hid under the ring apron, others lifted upturned chairs over their heads as a temporary shelter, as missiles continued to fly towards them.</p><p>According to many reports, there was plenty of ammo at the disposal of dissatisfied spectators, with eye witnesses later revealing that numerous crates of lager were being carried around by fans. The means, motive and opportunity certainly existed for the sorry episode that unfolded.</p><p>Promoter Micky Duff was as embarrassed as most Brits were on the night, apologising profusely to Hagler, and not holding back on his opinion of the perpetrators: \"There were 10,000 there and there were a maximum of 15 to 20 people involved. They were animals\".</p><p>One of the herd got more than he bargained for, however. Attacking Antuofermo, who was taking part in an interview on Italian television, the fan soon discovered he had picked on the wrong man: \"He punched me on the shoulder and I straightened him out on the floor with just one punch. What else could I do?\"</p><p>After being deprived of holding the belts in the ring, having bottles and cans hurled in his direction, and discovering the front window of the car he was travelling in had been smashed, it was hardly surprising that Hagler vowed never to fight again in England. But Marvelous Marvin Hagler would go on to sweep aside all before him in the middleweight division for another seven years, until the debatable defeat in his final fight against Sugar Ray Leonard. To think, it all began at Wembley Arena, on an evening which British boxing would rather forget.</p><p>For Minter, there was no disgrace in losing to such a great champion. Indeed, his performance was brave, yet to put it simply, he was up against a better man. A little over a year later, he fought for the last time, his three round loss to Tony Sibson signalling the end for Britain's former world champion. His career reached the heights, the victory over Antuofermo the obvious peak.

        "body":"<p>Like a lot of big men, Anthony Joshua walks quietly, as if not to disturb the ground beneath him. His voice is soft, gentle and reassuring, his laugh and smile infectious. For a boxer of 6ft 6in and 16st-plus about to embark on a career of hurting people for a living, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/anthony-joshua-wins-gold-boxing\" title=\"\">Olympic super-heavyweight champion</a> brings an unusual calmness into a room, saving the violence for the ring.</p><p>He has always been double-sided, wild in his youth but also sensitive. Out walking recently in Watford, where he grew up, Joshua was already famous but the homeless man he recognised from years before was decidedly anonymous. He walked into a chicken shop, with no money. Joshua followed him, bought them two \"No5s\", and the man said to him, \"You're that boxer. I know your story. You'll do well.\"</p><p>\"Instead of judging people,\" Joshua says, \"I listen to where they come from. This guy is an alcoholic but he's still down to earth, he knows what he is doing.\" As if the scene were scripted, Joshua saw another homeless man further down the street, and stopped to ask him: \"How did you end up here?\"</p><p>He remembers: \"His girlfriend lived in Bristol, his dad lived in Watford but was ill, so he was spending a lot of time in Watford looking after him. When his dad died, he thought he was going to inherit his place, but the council took it back and, in the meantime, he had split up with his girlfriend. So he had no family, no place to live and had been on the street for nine months.</p><p>\"What he said to me was he could go through anything in life now and nothing would break him. Being out on the streets has made his heart so tough. That's the mentality of a fighter: being so tough that nothing can break you, that street fighting mentality does resonate.\"</p><p>It would seem, then, that Joshua is well wrapped up for the wintry blasts his business almost certainly will deliver amid the sunshine. For all that he has won a silver medal at the world amateur championships and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/02/olympics-team-gb-boxer-anthony-joshua\" title=\"\">Olympic gold in London</a>, his resumé is thin by the sport's standards, ahead of his six-round paid debut against the unbeaten <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/26/anthony-joshua-emanuele-leo\" title=\"\">Italian Emanuele Leo at the O<sub>²</sub> Arena on Saturday</a>.</p><p>Still only 23, Joshua admits he was not even aware there was a Great Britain boxing team until Terry Edwards's squad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/mar/18/british-amateur-boxing-olympics-2012\" title=\"\">returned laden with medals from the Beijing Olympics in 2008</a>, by which time his talent had catapulted him into the lower reaches of the sport. He won the ABA title in his 18th fight, displaying maturity and no little power, and, in 16 months, rose from No46 to No1 in the world.</p><p>Having come to boxing late, he has, nevertheless, embraced its past and its intricacies. He is a tireless trainer, spending several hours a day in the gym, where he his tutored by Tony Sims, and on the running track. His was the most prized signature of the London Games, and he is happy to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/24/anthony-joshua-turns-professional\" title=\"\">joined the stable of Eddie Hearn</a>, who can provide him with regular exposure on Sky – although he has not been able to meet all his requests.</p><p>\"He sent me a text when I signed him,\" Hearn recalls. \"His demands aren't too high. He said: 'Can you sort out a meeting with Muhammad Ali?' I said: 'Yeah, hang on a minute, I'll give him a buzz.'\"</p><p>Joshua convulses – but he still wants to meet Ali. \"I've got goals to beat. Everything he achieved, to meet someone like that, just to even touch him, would be an honour. Just to meet him, to be in his presence, he could give me something that no other fighter can give me. I could take a lot of energy away from that, good vibes. I want to be just like him so to just be in his presence, the greatest of all time.\"</p><p>Joshua is a fighter with horizons beyond his discipline, which encourages the belief he will handle the mental and physical rigours of his trade well. We discuss chess, his new-found obsession; he says he will tweet his most recent mentor, Lennox Lewis, to challenge him to a game. He has given up alcohol, but not everything else. It was, \"one of my lady friends\", he reveals, laughing, who introduced him to chess.</p><p>For all that he is an amenable, articulate and engaging company, Joshua also has the fighting gene, without which the whole exercise would be futile. The last big British fighter to return from an Olympics with a gold medal, Audley Harrison, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/09/audley-harrison-boxing-michael-sprott\" title=\"\">never properly tapped into that hunger for a scrap</a>, although Joshua will not be drawn into criticism of him.</p><p>\"I've got a lot more to achieve,\" he says. \"The Olympics didn't satisfy me, at all. That's what I'm trying to find in the professional world now, just to be a dominant force. I've never spoken to Audley about it. Before the Games he rang me a few times and said: 'Relax, do this and that', but I never questioned his career. Maybe, when he won and got all that admiration, that love, that attention, maybe that unsettled him.</p><p>\"There was a stage I seriously contemplated staying on [for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics] because I honestly believe that I would have won the gold again. It hadn't been done in Britain. It was the big temptation. But this is a new beginning for me. You've got to empty the cup, go in as a contender again.\"</p><p>And here he is, on the undercard of a major fight – Scott Quigg's defence of his recently awarded WBA super-bantamweight title against Yoandris Salinas. Will he be up to it, this people-savvy man with a conscience? Could the rougher end of the sport find him out?</p><p>Well, he will enter the ring to the Biggie Smalls version of the Diana Ross hit, I'm Coming Out, so he will have the ambiguity of that to deal with in a raucously male environment, but the core Joshua is a genuine fighting man.</p><p>\"Walking towards the ring, I don't want to put pressure on myself, I chill out,\" he says. \"The switch flicks as soon as I put my foot through the ropes. I just want to beat my opponent up, be too clever, counter-punching, pin him. When my feet are in range and I can land those punches, it's a great feeling. Every time I step in the ring, even when I'm sparring, I picture 20,000 people cheering. Take a walk around the ring, bell goes, on it. It's a good feeling inside the ropes. I feel comfortable in there.\"</p><p>It should be a great homecoming.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418466409|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c69d23b7f28202bf4fbfaf9e6d6b12c8ba3309a6 -->",

He lost the next two encounters with \"The Greatest\" narrowly and contentiously; many believed Norton should have been awarded the decision in all three contests.</p><p>Norton, a former US marine, had a cross-armed defensive style that troubled Ali. Superbly conditioned, with a chiselled muscular physique that made him sought after in Hollywood – his films included Mandingo (1975), with Susan George, and Drum (1976), with Pam Grier – he was a lightly considered underdog when he first fought Ali in 1973.</p><p>Gene Kilroy, who acted as Ali's business manager, said: \"Ali thought it would be an easy fight. But Norton was unorthodox. Instead of jabbing from above like most fighters, he would put his hand down and jab up at Ali.\" Ali was never able to get into his familiar rhythm, and was on the receiving end of a split points decision after 12 rounds. He was left in hospital, where his broken jaw had to be wired up.</p><p>Picked as a supposedly soft touch, Norton had been offered $50,000 for the fight. \"For $50,000, I'd fight the Russian army,\" he said. ABC's commentator Howard Cosell had said before the fight that it was \"the worst mismatch in boxing history and a disgrace\". Later he said: \"Kenny, you made me look silly.\" Norton replied: \"That's OK, Howard, you always look silly.\"</p><p>Six months later, Norton and Ali fought again and this time Ali prevailed by a split decision, setting up a decider in 1976 at the Yankee stadium in New York. By then, Ali was world champion and generating huge sums of money wherever and whenever he fought. The judges gave a narrow points decision against Norton, with booing greeting the verdict from many in the 30,000 crowd.</p><p>Norton was born and brought up in Jacksonville, Illinois. His father, John Norton, was a fire service engineer; his mother, Ruth, was a hospital therapist. An outstanding all-round athlete, Norton won a scholarship to Northeast Missouri State College (now Truman State University) through his proficiency at basketball and American football and as a track athlete. It was only after enlisting in the marine corps that he began boxing, quickly finding that his strength and physique – he stood 191cm (6ft&nbsp;3in) and weighed about 100kg (220lb) – made him ideally suited to the sport.</p><p>Norton was the All-Marine heavyweight champion three times before turning professional in 1967. He made the usual advance of a heavyweight prospect, repelling a succession of the sport's journeymen and soon gained respect in the division. He boosted his earnings with sparring work against the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier\" title=\"Joe Frazier obituary\">Joe Frazier</a>, with whom he shared a trainer in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/oct/12/boxing.theguardian\" title=\"Eddie Futch obituary\">Eddie Futch</a>.</p><p>Frazier, who was close to Norton as a friend, never fought him. But Norton did fight another great heavyweight of the 1970s, George Foreman, for the title in 1974. At the peak of his powers, Foreman faced Norton in Caracas, Venezuela, and floored him three times before the stoppage came in the second round, enabling Foreman to dramatically retain the title he had won by defeating Frazier in 1973. Foreman would later become friends with Norton and praised him, saying: \"He fought Ali through all those questionable decisions and, even though he was patriotic [Ali had famously refused to serve in the army], he never used that against Ali. That made me so proud of him. He was humane.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417826431'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/19/1379608109808/Muhammad-Ali-right-winces-010.jpg' alt='Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch in their second fight, won by Ali in 1973' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch during their second fight, won by Ali, at the Forum in Inglewood, California, in 1973. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the bitter disappointment of losing to Ali in their third fight, Norton rebounded with three wins in 1977 – including victories over the highly rated Duane Bobick and Jimmy Young – and earned himself the position of mandatory challenger for the title, which was claimed by Leon Spinks after his shock victory over Ali in February 1978. The World Boxing Council awarded Norton the title when Spinks agreed to a rematch with the ageing Ali instead of a fight against Norton.</p><p>Norton lost his title in his first defence as champion, again suffering the agonies of being on the wrong end of a split decision, when he took on Larry Holmes in what is now recognised as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS8JXVpJDIk\" title=\"Ken Norton v Larry Holmes in 1978\">one of the all-time classic world heavyweight fights</a>. For 15 rounds at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, the two men traded power punches of almost frightening intensity. Holmes would go on to be recognised as the world No 1 until the mid-1980s, while Norton was never the same fighter again.</p><p>A loss to the big-punching Earnie Shavers in 1979, with Norton suffering a first-round knockout, suggested his time had gone. Another first-round stoppage, against Gerry Cooney in 1981, prompted Norton to announce his retirement from the sport.</p><p>In 1986, a car accident almost killed Norton. He suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured skull and a brain injury that left him with slurred speech. Before then, he had been working as a ringside commentator and had continued to act in films and on television. After a long period of declining health, including a succession of strokes and a heart attack, he moved into a care home.</p><p>Norton is survived by his wife, Rose, and his children Ken (an American football linebacker who now coaches with the Seattle Seahawks), Keith, Kenejon and Kenisha.</p><p><em>• </em>Kenneth Howard Norton, boxer, born 9 August 1943; died 18 September 2013</p><p><em>• </em>This article was updated on 20 September 2013.

        "body":"<p>The first openly gay male professional boxer has proposed to his partner in a film posted on Facebook.</p><p>Orlando Cruz, who made headlines when he came out last October, delighted followers with a video lasting about two minutes in which he asked his long-term boyfriend, José Manuel, to marry him.</p><p>Speaking in Spanish, the Puerto Rican featherweight fighter, 32, said: \"Through the ups and downs we've had, you've always been there for [me].</p><p>\"I'm a little bit nervous, but that aside, I want to tell you and share with your friends and my friends that if you want to marry me?</p><p>\"I want to share my life with you and want to be with you always, and support you 100%, and you support me 100%. I like you a lot, I love you and I look forward to your answer.\"</p><p>Cruz didn't have to wait long. Manuel accepted his proposal with his own emotional video, also posted on Facebook.</p><p>\"I want to tell you, yes, I do accept and would like to marry you, because I love you,\" he replied tearily. \"I'm a bit emotional. I didn't expect to find your proposal posted to Facebook.\"</p><p>Both videos have since been removed from the website.</p><p>Cruz also mentioned the proposal on his Twitter account, saying that he had taken an important step in his life and that he wants happiness for him and his partner as a couple.</p><p>Pedro Julio Serrano, spokesman for the US-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said he will serve as the godfather at the couple's wedding.</p><p>However, it was unclear where the wedding would take place. Same-sex marriage is not allowed in Puerto Rico, or in Florida, where Cruz has a home.</p><p>Cruz is preparing to fight Orlando Salido for the world featherweight title in Las Vegas this October – a year on from his public announcement that he is a \"proud gay man\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415124692|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3a76e61ccf18f7859bd58ec381afe1b4d6e84c4e -->",

        "body":"<p>Three young Afghan women boxers risk missing an official invitation to train and fight in the UK because of \"excessive\" red tape.</p><p>Sadaf Rahimi, Fahima Mohammad and Shabnam Rahman have overcome a host of cultural and financial barriers to pursue their sport in Kabul.</p><p>They were due to visit London for their first bout with UK rivals as part of International Women's Day on Friday. Instead, they have been forced to wait for days in Delhi for paperwork that has already been approved to be \"officially processed\".</p><p>The team from Kabul has \"invited status\" and support for sports visas, but visitors from Afghanistan must get paperwork in India before they can travel to the UK.</p><p>Margaret Pope, founder of the Women in Sport Foundation which had worked to bring the Afghan boxers to the UK, said of the delay: \"It is a frustrating, 11th-hour development to a groundbreaking initiative  … to bring the women to the UK and equip them with skills and experience to take back to Afghanistan.</p><p>\"One of the justifications for the UK military involvement in Afghanistan was to help improve the terrible situation for the country's women,\" she added. \"It is therefore a bitter irony that when there is a clear opportunity to assist some of the bravest, talented and most inspiring young Afghan women, bureaucratic delays are quashing their dreams.\"</p><p>Former aid worker Melanie Brown said: \"Making Afghans who request visas travel to a third country in order to receive them and then wait weeks to hear if they have been successful could cynically be seen as a way of discouraging all those but the very wealthy from visiting the UK.</p><p>\"This is extremely frustrating, there is the considerable cost and the impracticality of staying in Delhi for weeks at a time while waiting for paperwork to be rubberstamped.\"</p><p>Rahimi, Mohammad and Rahman are due to train and attend a charity auction in London to raise money for their gym in Kabul, then travel to Bristol to be coached by Britain's first officially licensed female boxer, Jane Couch MBE.</p><p>Couch is no stranger to struggles with authorities – in 1998 she persuaded an industrial tribunal to overturn a British Boxing Board of Control ruling that had denied her a licence. The BBBC had argued that premenstrual syndrome made women too unstable to box.</p><p>After years of lobbying from British women fighters, women's boxing was officially recognised as an Olympic sport on 14 August 2009. At London 2012 there were women boxers from Kazakhstan, North Korea and Turkey, while British boxer Nicola Adams became the first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405074009|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f967383478ab82b3232f5053fb71a37291ca0f7c -->",

        "headline":"Amir Khan's victory over Carlos Molina begins his climb back",
        "body":"<p>Amir Khan lives not just to fight another day, but another Danny Garcia. After two straight losses – the last one a devastating stoppage in the summer by the Philadelphian that cost him his world light-welterweight belts and led to his split with Freddie Roach – he survived a hat-trick ball to cut down the unbeaten Carlos Molina in a near-perfect performance.</p><p>He knew defeat would leave his career in pieces. Instead his wicked jab and at times bewildering combinations, behind an improved defence – assiduously crafted by his new trainer, Virgil Hunter – earned him a shutout on all three cards after 10 rounds. At that point the referee, Jack Reiss, inspected Molina's carved features for the fourth time and waved it over.</p><p>\"Carlos took some really good shots and he was still coming forward,\" Khan said, \"and that's when I thought I better stick to the plan. Virgil is a great trainer and I'm getting better at boxing and becoming the complete fighter. He is teaching me speed and power, when to throw the big shots. Sometimes I am too brave for my good but now I know it is better to stick to the game plan. Garcia caught me with a good shot but I will fight Danny Garcia again, anytime, anywhere.\"</p><p>Molina, battered but defiant, said: \"I don't know what happened. I couldn't pull the trigger, just couldn't get through. He was so fast and I couldn't get in because he has a long jab. I felt I connected two or three times but I wasn't in the right place to reconnect when I rocked him.\"</p><p>Khan has not boxed with such fixed discipline in one extended performance since he stopped Paulie Malignaggi in New York in 2010. That seems such a long time ago but now he has the opportunity to view 2013 with hope that was not apparent after Garcia had temporarily, at least, evicted him from the elite establishment around 10 stones inhabited by some of the most exciting fighters in the business.</p><p>Khan has to convince Showtime and his American partners, Golden Boy Promotions, not to mention Garcia and his abrasive father, Angel – who had travelled across the country to the west coast to inspect his handiwork – that he is worth a rematch.</p><p>Garcia, who has swagger where once there was untested confidence (considerably buoyed by his recent spectacular stoppage of Erik Morales) has a defence against Zab Judah in New York in February first but has indicated he would fight Khan again if he impressed tonight.</p><p>If Khan gets that gig he will be up against an opponent who has grown into the title, an unbeaten and dangerous foe. But Khan has never shied away from a challenge. He looked unusually nervous during the introductions – with good reason. His whole career was on the line.</p><p>He impressed from the opening bell, his snaking job leaving Molina's round faced visibly marked up in round one, and he only once erred \"in the pocket\", shipping a decent left hook.</p><p>But Molina, who has never been down, has an excellent pedigree (his twin brothers were both Olympians, one for Mexico, one for the United States) and he was not going to fold without fierce resistance. Although he got through with a couple of steadying left hooks in the second, he was too content to box with his face, now reddened beyond cleansing.</p><p>He was more aggressive in the third, leading with a right hook that missed, then marched Khan to the ropes, where he got slightly the better of the exchanges to edge the round, from this vantage point, anyway.</p><p>Ringside observers who have seen a lot of Molina testify to his durability and, even though coming up to 10st for the first time at this level he gave the appearance of immovable solidity. However Khan sensed him wilting a little in the fourth and, for the first time, risked an all-out assault in a blaze of unanswered blows that left his opponent bleeding heavily around the eyes.</p><p>Molina was slow off his stool for the fifth but there was still bounce in his legs as he trundled forward behind a high guard, although, pawing at the leakage around his left eye, he looked bewildered by Khan's jab.</p><p>At the halfway mark Khan had reproduced the sort of focused boxing that dazzled Garcia for two and a half rounds before a disastrous collapse; his challenge was to keep his shape and not hang his chin out as he did on that calamitous night. Molina was still competitive but Reiss took a long look at his wounds before the start of the seventh.</p><p>This was still a fight you could only watch without anxiety in a replay, knowing the result. What appeared on the scorecard like a stroll was in fact a fight loaded with possibilities. However the rebuilt Khan controlled his urge for a brawl, boxing beautifully on the outside.</p><p>After eight rounds Molina had fallen behind to the point where he needed a knockout, increasing the danger for Khan, but there was no sign of his newfound boxing shape deserting him as he moved away from Molina's cocked right.</p><p>The referee called in the ring doctor to inspect Molina's cuts before the ninth and the fighter looked relieved to get the go-ahead. Yet, even buoyed by the reprieve, he could not pierce the shield Khan had constructed behind those whirring combinations and the blood flowed like wine.</p><p>Only a mistake could turn Khan's night bad because, going into the championship rounds, he was in complete control. A bruise had grown ugly around Molina's right eye but his chin showed no sign of deterioration, even under the persistent onslaught.</p><p>But there was no more for him to sacrifice at the end of the round. Molina's father, Miguel, protested in vain. His boy had stepped up, in more ways than one, and might be better moving back to a division where he feels more comfortable.</p><p>The punch stats went overwhelmingly Khan's way: 312 of 679 thrown landing, and he took just 87 of 335 coming the other way. It was the power-punch percentage of 56 that impressed most, however: 156 from 278. That is a staggeringly good return on any fighter's effort to stop his opponent, and way too good for Molina.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401153721|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|120c916d53274e374ac69536782f0646e81bf8f3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The South African boxer Corrie Sanders has died aged 46 after being shot during an armed robbery at a restaurant in Brits, near Pretoria. Sanders was one of the biggest-punching heavyweights of recent years and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xNoXYgi7o4\" title=\"Corrie Sanders fighting Wladimir Klitschko\">most famously defeated Wladimir Klitschko</a> to win the World Boxing Organisation heavyweight title in 2003.</p><p>Sanders was born in Pretoria. A talented sporting all-rounder, he played rugby and cricket as a schoolboy and later honed a golf game to near-professional standard. His impressive physique and strength, allied to a natural athleticism, helped him develop an intimidating punching power from a southpaw stance, which made him one of the most dangerous fighters of his time.</p><p>Claiming 196 wins from 200 amateur fights, he had won the South African heavyweight title in four consecutive years, from 1985 to 1988, before he moved into the professional sport. He won 42 of his 46 paid fights. Perhaps if he had moved to the US, he would have been a bigger name on the world stage. When asked why he had remained in South Africa, he said: \"I loved this country too much. It might sound strange, but I felt I had more black fans than white. Whenever I was out and about, they would stop me and want to chat. That was always very humbling.\"</p><p>With his career handled by the leading promoter Rodney Berman, Sanders rose steadily up the rankings after making his professional debut in 1989, winning his first 23 contests and becoming the South African champion in only his 11th pro fight. Wins over fringe American contenders such as Smokin' Bert Cooper, Levi Billups and Britain's <a href=\"http://www.johnnynelson.org.uk/\" title=\"Johnny Nelson\">Johnny Nelson</a> alerted the cognoscenti to the fact the he could become a potent force in the division.</p><p>His progress was slowed by a shocking second-round knockout defeat in 1994 against Nate Tubbs. But he remained undefeated thereafter until May 2000, when he lost a dramatic contest against the future champion Hasim Rahman. In the fight, televised by the American channel HBO, Sanders had Rahman down before being stopped himself in the seventh round. He was 37, and probably past his best, by the time he got his title shot fighting Klitschko for the WBO title in Hamburg in 2003.</p><p>The Ukrainian had only lost once in 41 fights and was a hot favourite to repel Sanders, who was quoted as a 40-1 outsider. But the South African produced a devastating display of power-punching to floor the champion twice in the opening round and twice more in the second when the fight ended. Ring Magazine hailed Sanders's win as their \"upset of the year\".</p><p>The following year, Sanders relinquished the then relatively lowly rated WBO belt to fight Wladimir's older brother Vitali for the World Boxing Council title, made vacant by the retirement of Lennox Lewis. This time Sanders looked to have a chance in the early rounds, especially the third when he caught Vitali with his danger punch, the left hook. But Vitali was able to withstand the pressure and went on to establish his dominance before stopping the South African in the eighth.</p><p>Sanders fought four more times before retiring, in 2008, and will be remembered as perhaps South Africa's best ever heavyweight. After moving away from boxing, he was a familiar figure at celebrity golf events and, as well as concentrating on various business interests, also worked as a motivational speaker.</p><p>He is survived by his former wife, Sunette, and a son and a daughter.</p><p>• Cornelius Johannes Sanders, boxer, born 7 January 1966; died 22 September 2012</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/396592535|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7a8b3b5e6c8193e3b34e5037f3c79eb768e78fba -->",

        "body":"<p>Super heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua sealed an extraordinary run of home success at the London Olympics by coming back against the reigning Olympic champion to win Team GB's 29th gold medal of the Games, just hours before the closing ceremony.</p><p>The Finchley-born fighter became the latest hero created by an Olympics that delivered 65 medals in total – the best since the first time London hosted the Games in 1908. A late run of golds from Russia in athletics, boxing, gymnastics and volleyball was not enough to deprive Great Britain of third place in the medal table.</p><p>Sam Murray won Team GB's 65th and final medal of the 2012 Games in the women's modern pentathlon on Sunday. The 22-year-old from Preston was pipped to top place by Lithuana's Laura Asadauskaite, but was still chuffed. \"I had a lot to make up on the run, I needed that,\" she said. \"I've made a few mistakes today which set me back but I came through in the end. I'm just so pleased, my legs kept running for me. Up the hills was so steep and I just kept working hard.\"</p><p>Before the Games, UK Sport, the body responsible for pouring £312m into Olympic sport over the last four years, set the target of matching the achievement in Beijing four years ago by finishing fourth. The British Olympic Association (BOA) would talk only of an aspiration of winning more medals in more sports – a landmark that was passed last week.</p><p>Overhauling the Russians in third place was considered unlikely by all but the most bullish of forecasters. BOA chairman Lord Moynihan did not believe it would be possible. \"Did I think we could beat them? Probably not. The fact we're set to is phenomenal credit to the athletes and the support of those athletes,\" he said. \"They always come on strongly. I was aware that Putin was very focused on them being better financed than ever before.\"</p><p>One of the most pleasing aspects for sports governing bodies, the BOA and the high-performance team at UK Sport has been the spread of sports that delivered medals. Of the 26 Olympic sports, 16 brought medals for the British team. While cycling, rowing and sailing continued to deliver, there was gold medal success in sports such as taekwondo, dressage and the canoe slalom for the first time.</p><p>Before the Games, both London 2012 chairman Lord Coe and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge had highlighted the importance of \"golden moments\" that would live in memory. Alongside the achievements of Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprint team and the record-breaking Michael Phelps, the British athletes delivered more than their fair share of moments.</p><p>Sir Chris Hoy's sixth gold broke records, Ben Ainslie's fourth gold in consecutive Games made him the most successful sailor in Olympic history and Mo Farah wrote his name in the history books by becoming the first British man to win a long distance gold since 1908 – and then repeating the feat a week later.</p><p>Anthony Joshua, who only started boxing four years ago, won Team GB's climactic gold medal on Sunday afternoon in controversial circumstances. Three points behind going into the last round against the Italian Roberto Cammarelle, he was roared on by the crowd and fought back to draw 18-18, winning gold on a countback. The furious Italian camp protested but to no avail. Earlier on Sunday Freddie Evans had to settle for silver in the welterweight category.</p><p>Joshua will now field a host of offers to turn professional, following in the footsteps of super heavyweight gold medal winners such as Lennox Lewis and Audley Harrison. Afterwards, he said: \"It's much more than a gold medal, it's a life experience.\"</p><p>Nicola Adams, who won the first ever women's boxing medal in the Olympics, said she hoped her success would inspire others. \"I'm hoping it brings more women into sport, not just boxing. That would be great for me. I was inspired by Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard,\" she said. \"To be able to get in the ring and perform like they did, it meant everything to me. To have kids in the future with a female role model to look up to would be great.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394618674|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|5dd8bd5481da042f2ed58ea63ac3bd94a1961e97 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Olympics have long carried a sense of grand sporting internationalism. But on Saturday the ExCeL arena produced a coming-together of a more parochial nature as British and Irish boxers Luke Campbell of Hull and John Joe Nevin of Mullingar fought for the men's bantam gold before a thrillingly loud and agreeably garrulous UK-Irish crowd. This was not so much ping-pong diplomacy as fists across the water, a meeting of two nations with a rather mixed history of relations, sporting and otherwise, but combining here under the Olympic boxing banner to create another delightfully arresting tableau at these Games.</p><p>In the event it was Campbell who took the gold, producing a display of controlled long range aggression to secure Team GB's 28th gold medal of these rather giddy Games. Medals aside, this was also an occasion of rather deafening sporting kinship inside the ExCel arena. Campbell is also of Irish descent — his family know Nevin's family — and as it had been for the Anglo-Irish bout between Katie Taylor and Natasha Jones earlier in the week, the arena was packed with a boisterous and celebratory crowd, the seats spotted with emerald green Irish football shirts and the entry of both men greeted with a wall of noise that seemed to rattle the 9,000 plastic seats. The cheers for Nevin were as loud as those for the home fighter; for Ireland this has already been a fine Olympics. Five medals, four in boxing, is an excellent return.</p><p>Not that the crowd were particularly concerned with sporting history as Nevin and Campbell set about each other, Campbell the taller man in blue landing some early blows and taking the first round 5-3. The second round went to Nevin, who produced some raucously received combinations to shade it 5-4, before Campbell sealed the fight, even producing a knockdown in the third. The cheers for Campbell were vast, as they were for Nevin at the end of a bout capped by a lingering embrace between the two corners.</p><p>All in all it was another triumphant night for the ExCel, which has been one of the surprise successes of these Games, a multi-roomed docklands hangar of impossibly vast scale, host to more Olympic events under one roof than any other venue in Olympic history. It is not to be tackled lightly: in the first week the venue broadcast manager wore a pedometer and discovered he'd walked eight miles by the end of the day. The boxing concludes here on Sunday with two British gold medal hopes in the ring. They will do well to match the peculiar clamour of Campbell's big night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394592285|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2775a9ab64532f8f773ddc3f82f9dc939c7838b2 -->",
