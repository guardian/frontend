        "body":"<h2>Austria</h2><p><strong>WINNING TIP: Dienten am Hochkönig</strong></p><p>Dienten is a small, traditional Austrian farming village in the middle of the Hochkönig ski area. In the past few years there has been a big investment in the area's ski infrastructure, with lots of new lifts now linking Dienten to the surrounding villages. Despite being only an hour from Salzburg, it is still relatively unheard of and prices have been kept low. We stayed over the New Year week and never once queued for a lift or battled for space on the 150km of pistes. We especially enjoyed numerous beautiful mountain huts serving hearty treats and schnapps.<br /><a href=\"http://www.hochkoenig.at/en\" title=\"\"><em>hochkoenig.at</em></a><br /><strong>Gnarbq</strong></p><h2>Bulgaria</h2><p><strong>Pamporovo</strong><br />I visited this lovely Bulgarian Village 17 years ago and loved it and, on my return this year, I loved it even more. Pamporovo offers fantastic family-friendly skiing and pretty runs allow for all to be involved. The ski school is fantastic whether you are a beginner or an expert. It's great value for money without feeling budget. Give this resort a chance, especially if you are a family considering a first skiing holiday.<br /><a href=\"http://winter.pamporovoresort.com/en/\" title=\"\"><em>winter.pamporovoresort.com</em></a><br /><strong>Julie Catanach Burt</strong></p><h2>France<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113943'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894739536/France-Vosges-Le-Ballon-d-001.jpg' alt='France, Vosges, Le Ballon d' Alsace, Peak, kid on a sled enjoying the snow' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A young on a sled enjoying the snow in Vosges. Photograph: Christophe Lehenaff/Getty Images/Photononstop RM</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Vosges mountains</strong><br />Seven hours drive from Calais, or less than 90 minutes from either Basel or Strasbourg, there are plenty of places to ski in the Vosges. It's quite low, so snow is not guaranteed, but there are some runs with artificial snow. There are also maybe a dozen other places with one or two lifts perfect for a morning's skiing. Suitable for intermediate rather than expert skiers (only a couple of black runs) they're also ideal if you are a bit rusty and want a quick day or two to get back into the swing. Runs are around 2km maximum length, so it's great if you're not (ahem) perfectly fit. Prices are reasonable and there are plenty of nice cheap places to have lunch (¤10 covers a basic meal). <br /><a href=\"http://www.tourismevosges.fr/les-vosges-sports-d-hiver.html\" title=\"\"><em>tourismevosges.fr</em></a><br /><strong>ExPatJohn</strong></p><p><strong>Auron</strong><br />Auron 1600 is a surprise. Less than two hours from Nice, it captivates you with its charming village atmosphere. The skiing is suitable for all the family, catering for novice to expertall levels. It's a fantastic journey up to the resort, hard to believe that you can be transported from the blueness of the Côte d'Azur to the crystal whiteness of the Alpes-Maritime in such a short space of time. The food and accommodation isare delightful, with numerous après ski activities.<br /><em>hiver.auron.com</em><br /><strong>SimonTweed</strong></p><p><strong>Le Grand Bornand</strong><br />Enjoyed by just a small number of British skiers, but loved by the French, Le Grand Bornandcorrect is a charming, chocolate box village in the Aravis. The smaller neighbour to La Clusazcorrect, and just an hour from Geneva and 35 minutes from Annecy, the skiing here is fantastic for all the family. You can choose a ski pass for Grand Bornand or the full Aravis area with regular buses linking the resorts. We never had to queue to get on a lift, the lift operators were always friendly and helpful and there's a good choice of restaurants around the slopes. My husband, who's an expert skier, loved the skiing here, particularly the off-piste - the snowfall we had was amazing.  Oour three year-old loved learning and, as an intermediate skier, I had no end of choice of where to go. The tuition here is also fantastic. We've skied in many other places, but love it here - fantastic town, amazing skiing, easy access to Annecy for non-skiers, lovely restaurants and chilled apres ski.<br /><a href=\"http://www.legrandbornand.com/\" title=\"\"><em>legrandbornand.com</em></a><br /><strong>RachelB17</strong></p><h2>Italy</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894461134/Skiing-in-Macugnaga-Italy-001.jpg' alt='Skiing in Macugnaga, Italy' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Snowboarding in Macugnaga. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Macugnaga</strong><br />Set at the foot of Monte Rosa, which is itself worth the trip, Macugnaga in Piedmont can only be described as a local ski resort. Small in size, it avoids the buses of the package holidays yet it has a vibrant feeling thanks to a friendly bunch of locals. The skiing is excellent – be the first up to peak Moro (3,008m) and enjoy the wide pistes all to yourself. The queues never get long and the hot food in the bars is not a rip-off. There is plenty to do for all; ice skating, trekking, a spa and the après-ski scene is genuine fun.<br /><a href=\"http://www.macugnaga.it/en/\" title=\"\"><em>macugnaga.it</em></a><br /><strong>razmataz87</strong></p><p><strong>Pragelato</strong><br />Peaceful Pragelato is 90 minutes' drive from Turin airport. On the border of the Val Troncea national parkcorrect, it enjoys peace and tranquillity. The Via Latteacorrect skiing area is the main attraction, with more than 400km of runs but, with the Val Troncea national park so near, there is also plenty of walking and snow trekking to be done. One of the legacies from the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics is a fantastic cross-country skiing network. My family has been going to Pragelato for the past 20 years or so, and we have seen the village changing through the years and it is lovely to see!<br /><a href=\"http://www.comune.pragelato.to.it/\" title=\"\">comune.pragelato.to.it</a><br /><strong>two_mamas</strong></p><p><strong>Folgarida</strong><br />Folgarida is a tiny resort in the Italian Dolomites but benefits from being linked to the bigger town of Madonna di Campiglio. It has 28 pistes with a total length of 50km but, when added to the Brenta Dolomites slopes, there's access to 150km of well-groomed, tree-lined runs. Folgarida itself is very quiet on the après side, so it might be better suited to serious skiers or families. A&nbsp;beginner/intermediate resort, it has friendly reds and blues but has access to more challenging reds and blacks in Madonna. Our favourite was the leg-burning Orso Bruno route back from Madonna to Folgarida: 9km without any lifts!<br /><a href=\"http://www.visittrentino.it/en/localita/folgarida\" title=\"\"><em>visittrentino.it</em></a><br /><strong>9avin</strong></p><h2>Switzerland</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113945'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894554810/Chairlift-and-Slopes-in-O-001.jpg' alt='Chairlift and Slopes in Obersaxen' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The quiet slopes of Obersaxen-Mundaun.

It's the home of ski champion Carlo Janka, but Obersaxen sees itself as a family ski resort and the pistes have something to offer at all skill levels. There are several other ski areas nearby for day trips, including Brigels, Sedrun and the popular Flims Laax.<br /><strong>KorKhan</strong></p><h2>Sweden</h2><p><strong>Björkliden</strong><br />From Björkliden, a small ski resort deep inside the Arctic circle and under the northern lights corridor, you can see the great Lapporten Gap – the gateway to Lapland. Cosy cabins, Sweden's highest mountain station (Låktatjåkko) and lots of non-skiing activities. You can also ski on the Swedish/Norwegian border at Riksgränsen using the transfer bus between the ski areas.<br /><a href=\"http://www.bjorkliden.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bjorkliden.com</em></a><br /><strong>Chris Graham</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418850079|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b977150de9bcf5edde1ee2f3d54a072889e75ed2 -->",

Photograph: Nikolas Koenig</figcaption></figure><p>The recent opening of the <strong>London Edition </strong>(<a href=\"http://edition-hotels.marriott.com/\" title=\"\">editionhotels.com</a>), is the result of an unlikely collaboration between Ian Schrager, godfather of the boutique hotel, and mega-chain Marriott. And if it has shown us one thing, it's this: it's no longer enough for a hotel to offer just a place to sleep. It has to be an event, a destination, a&nbsp;hub. Or, as the press release puts it, \"a cultural epicentre and… a portal into the essence of the city\".</p><p>Hotel nightclubs used to be the epitome of naff, a place where jetlagged tourists and businessmen on expenses would go to drink overpriced cocktails. But these days no hostel or&nbsp;boutique hotel worth its salt will open without a cool lounge-bar offering DJ nights and cultural \"happenings\". It's a&nbsp;formula which has been rolled out with great success by French budget chain <strong>Mama Shelter </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.mamashelter.com/en/\" title=\"\">mamashelter.com</a>) and is being mimicked from Berlin to Barcelona.</p><p>If anyone can create a buzz around a&nbsp;new hotel and nightclub, Schrager, founder of Studio&nbsp;54, can. But as a hotel guest, a&nbsp;nightclub comes quite far down the list of things I'm looking for when I check in. Surely half the fun of staying in a new city is wandering out into the night, not quite knowing where you're going to end up. If I&nbsp;want to take the pulse of a city, to mix with the locals, to find – as the Edition's publicity blurb will have it – \"a new kind of gathering place\", then the last place I'm going to look for it is in a hotel basement.</p><h2>Spectacular autumn colours?

        "body":"<p>At the top of the Kasprowy Wierch cable car was a poster about bears. The specimen depicted was fudge-coloured and shaggy, and looked replete, as if he'd just eaten a skier. \"And do they?\" I asked the liftman.</p><p>He thought about it a moment. This part of Poland is famously unhurried, and full of surprises. Over 600km south of the Baltic, this is a land of snowy, Brueghel-esque scenes; sleighs, monasteries, cupolas, huge wooden manor houses – like galleons – and a rolling landscape of whiteness. Then, suddenly, it wells up into a wall of rock, 2,500m high: the Tatras. This is the whiptail of the Alps, as wild and well-wolved as anywhere else.</p><p>\"No,\" said the liftman. \"Bears are fine. And, anyway, they sleep now. Come back in spring.\"</p><p>It's a tempting offer. Everything about our Polish week exceeded expectations – as a family holiday it's hard to beat. I've always liked the sound of Krakow, with its huge 13th-century square, and its ancient churches, but we also decided to slot in some skiing. This was more imponderable. Although the prices were encouraging (a fraction of France's), the skiing was mysterious. How would our resort, Zakopane, cope with our range of talents: the expert (my wife), the novice (Lucy, aged eight) and the haphazard (me)?</p><p>We soon realised that, whatever the skiing was like, Zakopane was charming. Although it has swanky bars and ski shops, it's essentially a very old mountain town. Most of it is made of tree trunks (parts dating from the early 1800s), and even the scrap-dealer still has a sledge. This is the place to buy an enormous sheepskin (£25), or a vast cake of smoked ewe's milk cheese (£1).</p><p>Lucy loved it, as any child would. The locals – called \"highlanders'\" here – use any excuse (eg church) to dress up in costume, and can often be seen in their black hats, sea-shells and narrow, white-felt trousers. Even our hotel, the Litwor, felt pleasingly old-fashioned, although it had a vast fish-tank above the pool that glowed like a planet.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113745'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380886581130/The--Narnian--towers-of-K-001.jpg' alt='The ‘Narnian’ towers of Krakow’s Wawel castle' width='460' height='307' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The ‘Narnia’ towers of Krakow’s Wawel castle Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>The system for skiing seemed a bit odd at first. Each day, we'd take a taxi (£5) or a bus (75p) out to a different ski area. Some didn't open until 9.30am, and then we'd hire what we needed for the day. Like Zakopane, it was all vaguely charming (I once saw a horse and cart, collecting firewood beside a green run). Out on the runs, all of us were happy (\"This,\" announced Lucy, \"is the best fun I've ever had!\"). Harenda, Nosal and Szymoszkowa were perfect for a family like ours, encompassing beginners and the doggedly incompetent. Although – for my wife – there was only one area offering a true adrenaline fix (Kasprowy Wierch), here was an ideal opportunity to master the snowboard. None of this was going to break an arm or a leg, and nor was it going to cost one. </p><p>It'll be hard to go back to paying top-dollar elsewhere after the prices here (daily ski-pass £12; skis and boots £5 a day; lessons £15 per hour). Even a good, slap-up, log-cabin lunch came in at a fiver (mulled wine £2; spag bol £3). I loved these places, all slightly trollish with their log fires and antlers. In Zakopane, there's a pleasing selection of restaurants with open fires and hearty dishes. </p><p>If you want something urban, try <a href=\"http://www.dobrakaszanasza.pl/\" title=\"\">Dobra Kasza Nasza</a>, where grilled chicken and a shot costs around £6. Or to see highlanders in their costumes hefting huge platters of meat, go to <a href=\"http://www.zakopane-restauracje.pl/\" title=\"\">Owczarnia</a>, with spare ribs at around £8. I am also surprised by how many Poles ski with tiny dogs tucked into their jackets.</p><p>After this, Krakow did little to dispel the fairytale aura. At first sight, it's like a city that's risen from the pages of a children's book. Dominating everything is a castle (<a href=\"http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/\" title=\"\">the Wawel</a>), that looks like a meeting of towers from all over Narnia. Beyond it is a great sprawl of Gothic and Baroque; dungeons and underground eateries; old groceries; huge chocolate shops (with bunnies the size of spaniels); and a footbridge to which lovers have attached thousands of padlocks. Grand, hobbity, and slightly eccentric, there is, quite literally, something for all the family.</p><p>It would've taken months to explore it all. We did, however, find the lecture halls of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II, and the house (at 14 Szeroka) where Helena Rubinstein was born. We also found ourselves before da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, in the castle.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113746'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380886658231/the-magical-underground-w-001.jpg' alt='the magical underground world of Wieliczka’s salt mines' width='460' height='293' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The magical underground world of Wieliczka’s salt mines. Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</figcaption></figure><p>But there is a darker, sadder side to Krakow. In 1941, the Nazis had descended on Kazimierz, a district that had been Jewish since 1495. Even today, parts of Kazimierz feel ownerless and derelict, and the resurrection of the synagogues is largely architectural. Of those marched away (amongst them, Roman Polanski, aged eight), some 60,000, or 25% of Krakow's population, perished. You can still see the ghetto across the river, where – for a while – some of them lived. But it isn't all run down: an interesting reconstruction of a Jewish eatery can be found at <a href=\"http://www.dawnotemu.nakazimierzu.pl/\" title=\"\">Dawno Temu Na Kazimierzu</a> on ul. Szeroka 1. And amongst the little factories, one (at 4 Lipowa) is now a startling new museum – and will always be known to the world as Schindler's Ark.</p><p>Before leaving, we made two forays from Krakow. The first, to Auschwitz (70km to the west), was an experience so affecting that – weeks on – I still think about it every day. The second took us deep underground, to a happier time in Poland's story. In the 1280s, rock salt was discovered at Wieliczka, and a mine began. Now, seven centuries later, there are over 240km of tunnels, and we saw around 1% in an afternoon. It was a magnificent walk, past underground lakes and through cathedrals of salt. You could almost feel Lucy's young imagination being gently stretched. There was also a&nbsp;comforting sensation of wealth and fantasy restored.</p><p>So would we return to Poland? Each of us felt our appetite for this remarkable country was merely whetted. So I'm sure we'll be back, if not in time for the bears' first breakfast.</p><p>• <em>The trip was provided by Baltic Travel (0845 6800 642, </em><a href=\"http://www.baltictravelcompany.com/\" title=\"\"><em>baltictravelcompany.com</em></a><em>).

        "body":"<p>A stony-faced man in shellsuit pants tied tight to his torso carefully counts out pancakes as a sallow-faced DJ in jeans slung just below his dignity piles rubbery eggs in a quivering mountain. A waitress stares transfixed as the dubstepper's shaking fingers set off a&nbsp;mini-avalanche and a sweaty sausage drops from the plate unnoticed.</p><p>Her eyes are watching it bounce and roll across the floor when a face appears inches from hers and barks in gruff Glaswegian: \"Hullo gorgeous, hae ye got onie broon sauce?\"</p><p>Wide-eyed hipsters and bleary-eyed Russian families are mingling over the 6.30am breakfast buffet as the first Horizon festival unleashes 500&nbsp;members of the underground British dance scene on the unsuspecting ski town of Bansko, Bulgaria. Some guests are preparing to head out for a full day skiing on eastern Europe's best hill, while others are getting ready for bed.</p><p>The Scot is Jack Revill, aka Jackmaster, co-founder of <a href=\"http://nmbrs.net/\" title=\"\">dance label Numbers </a>and one of the festival's headliners. Two hours earlier and one floor below he'd finished his first set of the week in the <a href=\"http://www.parkhotelgardenia.com/?lng=en\" title=\"\">Park Hotel Gardenia</a>'s subterranean restaurant, transformed into a sweaty techno den for the night. His impish request is meant to be charming, but his sharp features, piercing eyes and perfect quiff remain unmoved and the confused Bulgarian waitress just backs away towards the kitchen.</p><p>Horizon is the latest ski holiday-music festival hybrid to spawn since Snowbombing went nuclear more than a decade ago. Promoters took over nine out of Bansko's reputed 180 bars and clubs in the last week of March last year and filled them with British DJs and clubbers. While Kasabian, Example and Carl Cox played Snowbombing in Mayrhofen the following week, the aptly named Horizon featured up-and-coming acts more likely to be found on Twitter or Soundcloud than the back of the latest Ministry of Sound Annual.</p><p>Some were so anonymous they could warm up for their set on the dancefloor. It was humbling as I threw awkward shapes like a wedding uncle to see one of the legion of teeny boppers around me walk away calmly and take a place behind the decks. That said, names such as <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/loefah\" title=\"\">Loefah</a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/klose-one\" title=\"\">Klose One</a> clearly meant more to my fellow holidaymakers. When School Records hosted a night in strip club Red Rose, the pole dancers turned in early as the crowd only had eyes for the DJs.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113733'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380811726049/A-chair-lift-in-ski-resor-008.jpg' alt='A chair lift in ski resort Bansko, Bulgaria' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Bansko ski resort. Photograph: Joerg Reuther/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>It may sound risky to plan a ski holiday three weeks before the end of the season in a resort that only reaches 2,600m, but organiser Jack Robinson pitched it as a chance for young clubbers to try skiing or snowboarding on the cheap. The co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.outlookfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Dimensions and Outlook</a> music festivals in Croatia said: \"It's a holiday with music. We're providing a soundtrack.\"</p><p>Many of my fellow passengers arrived in fancy dress for the three-hour flight to Sofia, including one who can only be described as a cyber Jack Sparrow, and almost none loaded ski equipment onto the transfer bus, so Robinson appeared to be hitting his target market.</p><p>One of my favourite moments came while hiking a kicker in front of the Mountain Stage at the \"secret\" Hotel Izvorite, hidden in the forest between two lower ski runs, as Route 94 threw out chunks of deep house. Strapping in at the top was an 18-year-old in a bear onesie and day-glo face paint.</p><p>\"Hey man, this is my second day on a board,\" he beamed, before throwing himself enthusiastically off the jump.</p><p>And when the music starts on the mountain at midday and continues in resort until 6am, it doesn't leave much time for exploring endless terrain. That said, Bansko does boast more than 70km of wide, well-groomed runs and a modern lift system. Off-piste is off the cards that late in the season but snow-making on every run guarantees skiing and the snow park has enough to occupy easily bored shredders.</p><p>Freak high winds on the eve of the festival meant the four kickers only opened two days in the week, but rails and boxes below were open all week. Snowboarder Seb Kerns, who was also DJing at the festival, said: \"There is definitely something for everyone in this section and most of it was hitable and getting a good bit more action than the jumps, with people riding it on and off quite a lot.\"</p><p>The town itself, a 6km gondola ride from the pistes, is one of the strangest ski resorts on earth. Rarely have I&nbsp;felt so alien as on the long, hungover walk from hotel to lift station in full snowboard clobber past Orthodox churches, sex shops and huddles of old women in headscarves. But Bansko's bars and clubs are better – and at £2 a pint much, much cheaper – than most in the Alps.</p><p>The secret hotel parties, which ironically few guests found before the third day, had a DIY outdoor party vibe.&nbsp;DJs played from a first-floor balcony to ravers in backpacks shuffling on the forecourt below. Pints in plastic glasses were served over a table as graffiti writers sprayed a giant canvass to the side. Bulgarian producer KiNK got a lift from his dad for his storming live performance and a spontaneous snowball fight broke out during a set by Throwing Snow.</p><p>The best venues were the many traditional \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyhane\" title=\"\">mehana</a>\" restaurants, which offer homely tapas-style Bulgarian food accompanied by often exceptionally talented house bands. Horizon arranged a £20 all-inclusive banquet with bubbling skillets of tongue and mushroom and heaps of succulent barbecued meat at Hotel Molerite on the penultimate night in a bid to tempt young guests away from the mystery meat kebabs on the main strip.</p><p>The band's showman clarinetist calmly screwed apart his instrument as he and his mariachi-style group performed an increasingly frenetic Bulgarian version of a classic Mexican tune until he was tooting the melody through the mouthpiece alone. As the good local wine took hold we danced between the tables to Serbian rap.</p><p>The buxom singer in the more intimate <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://zehtindjieva.com/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%259A%25D1%258A%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0\" title=\"\">Zehtindjieva Kashta</a> mehana gave a pitch-perfect rendition of Sade's Smooth Operator as the owner, evidently overexcited to have foreign guests on whom to practise his English, performed a dance around a chair.</p><p>As we worked our way through a giant ham hock so tender the flesh fell from the bone at the slightest brush, he hovered into view miming with a clarinet. Horizon may have introduced a few hundred young clubbers to winter sports, but if this is now their impression of a ski holiday, they're in for a surprise when they get to Méribel.</p><p>• <em>Flights and accommodation (at the Park Hotel Gardenia, Bansko, +359 749 86900, </em><a href=\"http://www.parkhotelgardenia.com/?lng=en\" title=\"\"><em>parkhotelgardenia.com</em></a><em>) were provided by the Horizon festival, which takes place from 8-14 March 2014); festival + accommodation packages from £199 (</em><a href=\"http://horizonfestival.net/\" title=\"\"><em>horizonfestival.net</em></a><em>.

        "body":"<p>Albi the guide smiles patiently as he watches me sitting in the snow, sluggishly strapping my boots onto my board. \"You&nbsp;know,\" he says, as the thinning clouds offer tantalising glimpses of the mountains all around, \"to snowboard in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKuYDJ5wL0k\" title=\"\">the Dolomites</a>, you have to be a little crazy. You have to go really fast.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm still somewhat groggy from the day before – and the welcoming feast rustled up by the Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.rosalpina.it/\" title=\"\">Hotel Rosa Alpina</a> in San Cassiano, the highlight of which may have been the ground veal served with herb jelly on a salt biscuit. I just can't remember too well. The powerful local <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf_IP55-vxs\" title=\"\">Lagrein wine</a> was fantastic, you see, as was the grappa. Vaguely, I&nbsp;recall that one dish came on its own self-standing, flat-bottomed spoon, allowing you to eat two at once, even as you're being bundled into your taxi.</p><p>Albi, thin as a ski and fast as a bullet, is leading us on day two of a five-day odyssey with local operator Dolomite Mountains, an epic <a href=\"http://www.dolomitemountains.com/en/winter_spring_trips/ski_safari430.htm\" title=\"\">hut-to-hut ski safari</a> (you can board it, like me, but most people ski) that will take in some of the planet's most dazzling peaks and, as I'm beginning to realise, cuisine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK-bupHoz5U\" title=\"\">Cliffhanger</a> was filmed round this part of north-east Italy, Sylvester Stallone being effortlessly upstaged by the area's vertiginous crags, ledges, pinnacles and plateaux. These are pale by day but change dramatically at dusk&nbsp;and dawn, glowing orange, red or even purple. This ravishing phenomenon, called the <a href=\"http://www.alpineadventureagency.com/about-the-region/the-majestic-dolomites/the-enrosadira-phenomenon.html\" title=\"\"><em>enrosadira</em></a>, is caused by the mineral make-up of the rocks – as Roger Moore doubtless appreciated as he dodged gunfire on these slopes in the 1980s, while filming For Your Eyes Only.</p><p>Even without the <em>enrosadira</em>, the Dolomites would be bewitching. Like something out of the US<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryqdoe6xLs4\" title=\"\">'s Monument Valley</a>, these almost violently vertical peaks are characterised, in some places, by huge isolated forms that contrast with the rolling meadows they tower over – and in others, by sweeping, saw-toothed ranges that beat anything else in the alps, to my mind anyway. Elemental forces seem to be at work: it's the sort of landscape Tolkien would have adored. In August 2009, the Dolomites were declared a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1237\" title=\"\">Unesco World Heritage site</a> and, it seems, the foodies and their self-standing spoons moved in.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231009'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380884015026/Andrew-refuels-after-a-bu-001.jpg' alt='Andrew refuels after a busy day … and another fine lunch' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Andrew refuels after a busy day … and another fine lunch</figcaption></figure><p>Amid apologies for overcast skies, we set off on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld1RwNgQG0M\" title=\"\">Sellaronda</a>, a ski tour famed for being a day-long circumnavigation of <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Gruppo_del_Sella.jpg\" title=\"\">the mighty Sella</a>, a plateau-shaped massif whose steep sides are ringed by fangs of rock – and flanked by 42km of snowy trails awash with understandably smug Italians. It's a staggering sight. Every twist and turn I make seems to reveal some new jaw-dropping view of that central stone fortress nosing through the clouds, or of yet another spellbinding colossus way off in the distance. The pistes are a treat, too: steep and tree-lined, then open and gentle – although maybe sometimes a bit too gentle. I'm beginning to see what Albi meant: skiers can pole over the occasional flat, but I'm having to tank it down or face a&nbsp;walk (I've had worse afternoons).</p><p>As the weather closed in, we stopped for lunch at a steamed-up taverna and tried to choose between sauerkraut, goulash, dumplings or ravioli made with rye flour. I wanted the lot but picked the ravioli, which was filled with dried fig and wild pear, and came lovingly doused in hot poppy butter and cinnamon. Serve that in Britain, I thought, and you'd get your own TV show. But here, it was just your average lunch. When we stepped back outside, the skies had lifted and the Sella massif now stood before us in its full glory – its jostling peaks fanning along the horizon like the back of a giant stegosaurus. Giddy on my board, I spent the rest of the day bingeing on Dolomites and trying to keep my eyes on the piste.</p><p>That night I stayed in Corvara, swimming up and down the pool in the four-star <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/information/index/1-0.html\" title=\"\">Posta Zirm hotel</a>, watching through the windows as the Sella turned lobster red – much like myself later, as I lay in the sauna. A member of the hotel staff popped his head in at one point and gestured disapprovingly at my Speedos. I looked around and, through the steam, could make out nothing but naked Germans sweating and snoring. Ah, trunks off, sorry.</p><p>The sauna is part of the hotel's <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/wellness-farm/wellness-farm/24-0.html\" title=\"\">Wellness Farm</a>, which seeks to restore your \"inner equilibrium\" via such <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/wellness-farm/treatments/25-0.html\" title=\"\">treatments</a> as hay baths, soporific music, and the opportunity to stretch out and have a woman in a white tennis top play you like a xylophone. I&nbsp;settled for an Elmore Leonard novel by the log fire, a fluffy gown and lying on a plastic recliner that I didn't realise was heated until I woke up an hour later, my equilibrium perfectly restored.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231010'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380883544788/The-enrosadira-at-Rifugio-001.jpg' alt='The enrosadira at Rifugio Fuciade' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sunset at Rifugio Fuciade Photograph: Giuseppe Ghedina</figcaption></figure><p>The point about the ski safari is that, Sellaronda excepted, it takes you across the best of the Dolomites, not right back to where you started each morning. You pass from terrain to terrain, while your bag meets you at each hotel or high-altitude hut. Although the tougher sections must be guided, you can go it alone here and there – giving yourself an extra challenge and saving a bit of cash.</p><p>Day three, taking us to Arabba and Porta Vescovo for what should have been mesmerising views of the Marmolada glacier, needed Albi. Visible from Venice on a clear day, Marmolada is, at 3,343m, the highest of the Dolomites. Sadly, we could barely see it, even as we stood on its vast reaches, thanks to a whiteout that only began to fizzle out after we'd had to move on. Still, the red-run descent on perfect powder was a knockout: a rattling sprint down a snaking boulevard that flickered in and out of the white. At the foot, out of breath and exhilarated, I realised I hadn't been on a single piste twice all week.</p><p>Albi, who had skilfully been keeping us away from the flat, now swung us into a gorge so narrow it felt like the slightest seismic jitter could squeeze it shut again. This was the Serrai di Sottoguda, a 2km-long canyon with walls 100m high – a place of sudden darkness and blazing light, with no fence between you and the rushing, boulder-filled river Pettorina, which you cross 16 times, on terrifyingly narrow bridges. On the board, there was no choice but to go at these rickety bridges straight on – and therefore far too fast – to the cheers of two guys climbing the \"cathedral\", one of three frozen waterfalls that line the gorge.</p><p>We reached <a href=\"http://www.fuciade.it/main.html\" title=\"\">Rifugio Fuciade</a>, a fabulous cuckoo clock of an inn almost 2,000m up, after a breathtaking chairlift ascent to the soaring shoulder of the <a href=\"http://www.passosanpellegrino.it/portal/en/multimedia/photogallery/item/305-balconi-panoramici.html\" title=\"\">Passo San Pellegrino</a>, followed by a blast through frozen forests on a snowmobile. Built by three priests in the 1960s and now running out of wallspace for its food awards, this haven, surrounded by stillness and hemmed in by mountains, is today run by Sergio Rossi, grandson of one of the priests. With room for just 20 guests, the refuge had been described as something special – and didn't disappoint.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231011'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380884357746/Dolomites-001.jpg' alt='Dolomites' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Yet another stunning valley</figcaption></figure><p>We kicked off our kit, took piping hot showers, stretched out on beautifully carved wooden beds, and then headed down for dinner, through narrow corridors decorated with accordions and antlers, pressed flowers and paintings of nudes, not to mention embroidery, stuffed birds, a gnome straining into a toilet, and the head of every four-legged beast that has ever walked these parts.</p><p>As darkness fell and our muscles stopped throbbing after the day's exertions on some of the finest pistes I've ever sped down, so began the finest meal I've ever had. There was venison carpaccio, risotto with chestnut and truffle, pork shin on polenta, and an egg adrift in potato cream and caviar. There was even a dish called Memory of Wood but, thanks again to the Lagrein and grappa, I can't for the life of me remember what was in it. \"Not bad at all,\" said Albi and headed for bed.</p><p>I stepped outside for a bit of air, noticed that the terrace thermometer said -7C, and ducked straight back inside, shivering. I was just tucking into my second helping of prune tart with elderflower sorbet and feeling like I hadn't a care in the world, when Emanuela, Sergio's wife, raced into the room shouting and waving her arms. <em>\"Abbiamo avuto la fumata bianca!\"</em> she yelled. \"We have had the white smoke!\" I thought the place was on fire and wondered what the procedure would be: would I burn to death in the refuge – or escape, only to freeze to death in the snow? But it turned out Emanuela was just telling us that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lxrvLeq3M\" title=\"\">a new pope had been chosen</a>.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" said Albi in the morning, looking up at the shimmering peaks of the Cimo Uomo and the avalanches that had spilled down its sides in the night. \"We're going to have fun today.\" And so off we went, this time with the boarder leaving the skiers behind, at least until the pistes were reached. It was day four, billed as the visual highlight of the trip, promising stunning views of the Veneto and Trentino Dolomites. And again, we weren't disappointed. Drunk on powder and panoramas, we even did some routes twice, eventually finding ourselves on a stretch of flat so lengthy that some enterprising local had set up a horse-drawn service that would happily pull 20 or so rope-clutching skiers back to the lifts.</p><p>We slept at 2,778m that night, in <a href=\"http://www.rifugiolagazuoi.com/indexUK.php\" title=\"\">Rifugio Lagazuoi</a>, but not before Albi had joined us for a farewell <em>bombardino</em>: a one-is-enough local eggnog, rum and whipped cream drink. More hostel than haven, Lagazuoi is less grand than Fuciade, but I loved it – even if the cuisine is hearty rather than haute. Plus, hung with icicles in the sub-zero morning, the terrace offers <a href=\"http://www.rifugiolagazuoi.com/Ing/Gallery/visGal.php?idGal=23&amp;opzione=0&amp;idCategoria=\" title=\"\">dizzying views</a> that seem to take in not just vast swathes of the Dolomites, but the whole world.</p><p>Day five, daringly unguided, began with the best of what Lagazuoi had to offer: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ytHkMceew\" title=\"\">the 8.5km Armentarola</a>, regarded as one of the best runs in the world, an extended slalom through a rippling, pine-dotted landscape – and Dolomites so tall, so sheer and so close you feel you could reach out and run your fingers along them. Naturally, we got lost fairly quickly after that, but it didn't matter. Eventually, we found our way over to Cortina, for yet another intoxicating afternoon of stirring views and perilous descents, including the ridiculously steep slope used for the women's World Cup downhill, which I skidded almost all the way down on my back, having fallen on the first turn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231008'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798401625/Cortina-in-the-Dolomites--001.jpg' alt='Cortina, in the Dolomites, Italy' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sloping off … great powder and stirring views at Cortina.

The self-guided trip ends at upmarket Aspen, with incredible skiing over four mountains and countless restaurants, shops and hotels.<br /><em>• From £1,650pp for 14 nights, including one in Denver, four in Crested Butte, five in Telluride and four in Aspen; flights; three- and four-star hotels; and SUV hire; </em><a href=\"http://www.skisafari.com/Ski-USA-Colorado-Safari-Classic.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>skisafari.com</em></a><br /><strong>Rachel Dixon</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418766526|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6423458179ab9b18c9968c8066320500004e973e -->",

        "headline":"Extreme skiing at the crater of Japan's Mount Yotei volcano",
        "body":"<p>Scrambling on all fours to the summit and cursing the heavens wasn't how I imagined this ski experience would pan out. As the cold bit and the wind rumbled ominously, I started to question what on earth we were doing. But climbing up Mount Yotei, an active volcano, in search of deep powder was never going to be easy.</p><p>Most skiers coming to Japan's northern island of <a href=\"http://en.visit-hokkaido.jp/\" title=\"\">Hokkaido</a> head for the popular resort of Niseko to experience its pristine snow. But for those who want a non-standard experience, scaling one of Hokkaido's most iconic volcanoes is too big a temptation to resist.</p><p>Yotei, often referred to as Ezo Fuji (or the Mount Fuji) of Hokkaido, is in the Shikotsu-Toya national park bordering the popular towns of Niseko,&nbsp;Kutchan and Makkari on the island's west coast. While skiing anywhere in Niseko, Yotei towers majestically in the distance, usually with small clouds billowing above its crater. At 1,898m, it is the highest mountain in the region and has the longest vertical ski descent in Hokkaido. Much planning is needed to make a successful ascent – bad weather comes in hard and fast in this region – so, from our base at the popular ski town of Hirafu in Niseko, we sought out a well-respected guide: Sam Kerr.</p><p>Sam is a New Zealander who runs Niseko Xtreme Tours, a local company specialising in back-country tours. We&nbsp;liaised with him over 10 days while waiting for the perfect conditions – there was much monitoring of weather patterns, avalanche reports and careful map-reading.</p><p>Finally, we hit the road at 8am one morning and, after an hour's drive, arrived at the base of the mountain. After putting on snowshoes, testing our avalanche transceivers (you would be surprised at how many people omit&nbsp;this vital bit of kit) and packing our shovels, probes, food, boots and skis, we set off for the day.</p><p>With no tracks in the snow before us, no sight of fellow hikers, and seeing&nbsp;Yotei suffused in the early morning light, we&nbsp;knew we'd chosen the right day.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113840'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380892670844/Hiking-up-Mount-Yotei.-008.jpg' alt='Hiking up Mount Yotei.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hiking up Mount Yotei. Photograph: Louise Healy </figcaption></figure><p>It takes between six and eight hours to reach the summit. We left no margin for error, making it to the peak in five and a half hours, stopping only for food and water. This is no leisurely day on the slopes – it's a rigorous hike that will test your resolve and fitness.</p><p>With less than a quarter of the hike to go, it became clear the warm weather had created a hazardous challenge. The sugary top layer of snow was starting to break under our snow shoes, which left our feet sinking up to half a metre. Knowing our goal was to ski the deep powder inside Yotei's crater, we ploughed on.</p><p>The weather was deceptive above 1,000m – the bright sun bathed the mountain in a yellow glow and the winds were biting and dangerously cold but we pushed on and finally reached the crater's edge.</p><p>The crater itself was breathtakingly white from top to bottom; a classic bowl about 400m high with a 360-degree panoramic view. Although I am an advanced skier, the thought of plunging into this both terrified and exhilarated me. I watched the first three of our group descend into the soft, light powder and effortlessly glide down to the base. Then I went for it.</p><p>Pushing off from the ledge and skiing into the crater felt surreal. Unlike other powder runs in busy ski resorts, the beauty of this expedition was that we were allowed so much time and space to carve out beautiful lines with no competition on our backs. I&nbsp;was skiing on fresh powder that had&nbsp;been sitting on a base of untouched snow for weeks. For all my&nbsp;initial reservations, skiing on it felt&nbsp;effortless.</p><p>The main route down the northface starts off with an exciting 50-degree slope which leads into the open powder bowl. One side of the slope was extremely icy, while the other side was deep with fresh powder.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113842'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380816884762/The-crater-at-the-summit--001.jpg' alt='The crater at the summit of Mount Yotei' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The crater at the summit of Mount Yotei. Photograph: Louise Healy</figcaption></figure><p>We were dubious about starting avalanches so we took the icy route, which was unnerving at times, but ultimately led us to one of the best&nbsp;runs of the season. Later, we had a half-hour descent through wonderful,&nbsp;untracked bottomless powder, then we hiked for about 40&nbsp;minutes out of the crater and back to the top ridge of&nbsp;Mount Yotei before making our descent to where the cars were parked.</p><p>Back at base, Sam told us conditions needed to be near perfect to scale Yotei&nbsp;and ski into its crater. Approximately 100 people each winter attempt the climb and only around about 20 actually do it.</p><p>\"Now that you have seen Yotei, you can understand its beauty and power,\" he said.</p><p>Sitting down that evening, sipping Hokkaido's famous plum wine, it was hard to believe we were part of the lucky 20% who managed to ski Mount Yotei's crater that winter. Scrambling on all fours and cursing the heavens was worth it in the end.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418767236|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6c144dc3631abdaefd556ec8a9adf0d5b36f3146 -->",

The first of their kind in Europe, with access to specialised Burton \"Learn to Ride\" snowboard equipment, the lessons will aim to teach children the basics while having as much fun as possible. At the end of the week they'll get a mini-video edit of their riding highlights, which is included in the price as are lessons, use of Burton boards, accommodation, transfers and half board. <br />• <em>0870 068 7030, <a href=\"http://www.rudechalets.com/\">rudechalets.com</a>,</em> <em>£799 for children, £569 for accompanying adults.

Also on the slopes in the American-Indian fun village at Grand Cry, kids can play in the teepees, attend war-paint workshops and star in their own film doing a snow dance or improvised song, which they can, of course, share on social media should they wish. <br /><em>• no phone number, </em><a href=\"http://en.lesgets.com/snow-ski/prices.html\" title=\"\"><em>en.lesgets.com</em></a><em>.

Duo couple massages are also available. Or, if you have pre-teens in your group, nine to 12-year-olds can have massages on Wednesdays between 2-5pm, with older children offered a \"Special Teenage Facial\".

        "headline":"The Rosamunde Pilcher trail: why German tourists flock to Cornwall",
        "body":"<p>\"Rosamunde Pilcher?\" The guy behind the bar gives me a blank look with a hint of social fear: should he know the name? He shouldn't worry. Rosamunde Pilcher was born in 1924, barely 10 miles down the road from <a href=\"http://www.gurnardshead.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Gurnard's Head</a>, a cosy pub in the village of Lelant, in Cornwall's storm-battered, rugged west. After marrying in 1946 she left for Scotland, where she went on to become a writer. Pilcher never came back to live in Cornwall, but many of her stories are set in the rough landscape of her childhood home.</p><p>Now, aged 89, she has sold more than 60m books and has a fortune thought to exceed £100m. Her international breakthrough came late, in 1987, when The Shell Seekers entered the New York Times bestseller list, where it stayed for 48 weeks. Although Pilcher continued to write prolifically, none of her novels and stories since has matched the huge success of that one. She still leads – as family and friends are keen to stress – a very regular life near Dundee, untroubled by a public largely unaware of her work. In the UK, that is.</p><p>In Germany, it is a different story. Pilcher is a household name, not because of its German ring nor the 15m sales of her books – but because for 20 years she has been a firm fixture in the TV schedules. In Germany, <a href=\"http://rosamundepilcherblog.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Sunday night is Rosamunde Pilcher night</a>: around six million people in Munich and Berlin, in Heidelberg and Hamburg, tune in to one of her dramas. <a href=\"http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/kanaluebersicht/aktuellste/422#/kanaluebersicht/422\" title=\"\">Public broadcaster ZDF</a> aired its first Pilcher movie, The Day of the Storm, in 1993. More than eight million – 25% of viewers – watched it, and a further 111 films have followed, all similarly successful. The movies feature mostly German actors, but they're filmed on location in England, usually in Cornwall, and each show typically contains long stretches of scenic footage, fly-overs of the cliffs at Bedruthan steps or of sun-flooded moorland in the west.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099414'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380901924864/German-Rosamunde-Pilcher--007.jpg' alt='German Rosamunde Pilcher adaptation Die andere Frau' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>John Hannah and Natalia Wörner in the German Rosamunde Pilcher adaptation Die andere Frau. Photograph: ZDF/Mike Alsford</figcaption></figure><p>\"The directors film it so well,\" says Mark Pilcher, the only one of the author's four children to live in Cornwall. A 55-year-old cattle farmer, he is local enough to drink at The Gurnard's Head, and thinks that Pilcher mania \"has moved on from people buying my mother's books to Cornwall actually selling them\".</p><p>But why does the drama do so well in Germany? \"Well, the stories are good. They appeal to what you call family viewing,\" says Rosamunde Pilcher, speaking to me on the phone from Dundee, much to the excitement of my own – German – grandmother. \"And the photography in these movies is lovely, almost like a tourism advertisement.\"</p><p>Claus Beling was the editor at ZDF who came up with the idea of turning Pilcher's work into film. \"I have always been fascinated by the Cornish landscape. Its lights and colours are very special,\" he says. \"Pilcher is amazing in conjuring up pictures of that scenery.\"</p><p>He thinks the success of the series is down to a general German fascination for grand landscapes – and to a nostalgic longing for a more traditional world: \"where a village is still a community in which everyone looks after one another\".</p><p>Actor Alexander-Klaus Stecher shares this view. He has starred in 10 Pilcher films, playing variously a mean guy, a lover or a stable worker. \"The concept of the series is not to hurt, under no circumstances,\" he says. Pilcher dramas come with a guaranteed happy ending.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099415'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902459045/Peter-Prideaux-Brune-010.jpg' alt='Peter Prideaux-Brune' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Peter Prideaux-Brune: 'A house like this has to earn its living.' Photograph: Lena Jakat</figcaption></figure><p>The England of these German productions might seem idealised, but the impact of them locally is very real. Peter Prideaux-Brune is a retired barrister who owns a 16th-century stately home near Padstow, parts of which he rents out for filming. No fewer than 16 Pilcher films have been shot at <a href=\"http://www.prideauxplace.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Prideaux Place</a>. It has been the home to one Lord Willoughby, transformed into a luxury hotel and converted into a gin distillery. An oval bedroom, decorated with delicate stucco and painted in soft green, has been nicknamed the Großmutter room – because that is where the grandmother always changes her will, tells the heir that he is illegitimate, or where she dies. In the movies, of course. \"A house like this has to earn its living,\" says Prideaux-Brune.</p><p>The house, which overlooks a lush deer park with picturesque views, sees around 25,000 visitors a year. More than 40% of them come from Germany, many on a Pilcher bus tour. Prideaux-Brune, who likes to greet the first coach of the day in his dressing gown, employs six full-time German-speaking guides and five staff for the adjacent tea room. \"The Germans just love their cream tea,\" he says. Among Prideaux-Brune's large collection of teddy bears in the hallway sit specimens sporting a German soccer jersey or an \"I love Hamburg\" shirt – evidence of well-informed tourists and eager Pilcher fans.</p><p>The coaches cramming the country streets have helped transform the Cornish tourism industry over the last 15 years. Tourism accounts for more than 20% of the county's GDP; one in four locals works in the sector. As a destination for seaside holidays, the area saw a severe downturn in the 1990s. \"Since then, a lot of different niche markets have developed,\" explains Malcolm Bell, head of <a href=\"http://www.visitcornwall.com/\" title=\"\">Visit Cornwall</a>. \"The impact of the movies is hard to quantify, but whenever a programme is on, we see the traffic spike on our website.\" German travel agents notice the same increase. Two-thirds of all foreign visitors who come to Cornwall are from Germany, Austria or Switzerland: almost a quarter of a million each year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099416'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902537533/Rosamunde-Pilcher-Federn--010.jpg' alt='Rosamunde Pilcher: Federn im Wind' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rosamunde Pilcher: Federn im Wind. Photograph: ZDF/John Ailes</figcaption></figure><p>\"The Germans come to Cornwall thinking it is gloriously sunny here all the time, due to the movies. We occasionally have to explain that one of the reasons Cornwall is so beautiful is because it rains,\" says <a href=\"http://www.thepeerage.com/p5461.htm#i54602\" title=\"\">James Molesworth-St Aubyn</a>. I have come to see him and his mother, Lady Iona, at their 50-room family residence, Pencarrow House, five miles north of Bodmin. After removing his muddied Wellingtons, James gives me a tour of the Georgian mansion, <a href=\"http://www.pencarrow.co.uk/house/films\" title=\"\">which in the 2011 Pilcher film English Wine served as Benson Valley Winery</a>.</p><p>The kitchen of Pencarrow looks out on to beautifully groomed gardens. Lady Iona tells of an incident when the ceiling in the dining room came down and covered everything in white dust, just before a group of 160 Germans was expected for a tour. The visitors had actually quite liked it, Molesworth-St Aubyn says. \"Because it shows that it is not all perfect.\" Not like in the Pilcher movies. More and more German Pilcher pilgrims come in their own cars rather than in coaches, observes Lady Iona. Which is good news for the county, because even though foreign tourists on average stay twice as long and spend twice as much money as British visitors,  the economic effect of the coach groups remains limited. \"It is a very convenient way to get a first taste of it,\" says Bell. \"But we hope they come back individually.\" Just like the lost sons and daughters in the Sunday night movies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419097201|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|a053b36f0c1f24b7aa494dbe37e99d3ed3c03952 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Austria</h2><p><strong>WINNING TIP: Dienten am Hochkönig</strong></p><p>Dienten is a small, traditional Austrian farming village in the middle of the Hochkönig ski area. In the past few years there has been a big investment in the area's ski infrastructure, with lots of new lifts now linking Dienten to the surrounding villages. Despite being only an hour from Salzburg, it is still relatively unheard of and prices have been kept low. We stayed over the New Year week and never once queued for a lift or battled for space on the 150km of pistes. We especially enjoyed numerous beautiful mountain huts serving hearty treats and schnapps.<br /><a href=\"http://www.hochkoenig.at/en\" title=\"\"><em>hochkoenig.at</em></a><br /><strong>Gnarbq</strong></p><h2>Bulgaria</h2><p><strong>Pamporovo</strong><br />I visited this lovely Bulgarian Village 17 years ago and loved it and, on my return this year, I loved it even more. Pamporovo offers fantastic family-friendly skiing and pretty runs allow for all to be involved. The ski school is fantastic whether you are a beginner or an expert. It's great value for money without feeling budget. Give this resort a chance, especially if you are a family considering a first skiing holiday.<br /><a href=\"http://winter.pamporovoresort.com/en/\" title=\"\"><em>winter.pamporovoresort.com</em></a><br /><strong>Julie Catanach Burt</strong></p><h2>France<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113943'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894739536/France-Vosges-Le-Ballon-d-001.jpg' alt='France, Vosges, Le Ballon d' Alsace, Peak, kid on a sled enjoying the snow' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A young on a sled enjoying the snow in Vosges. Photograph: Christophe Lehenaff/Getty Images/Photononstop RM</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Vosges mountains</strong><br />Seven hours drive from Calais, or less than 90 minutes from either Basel or Strasbourg, there are plenty of places to ski in the Vosges. It's quite low, so snow is not guaranteed, but there are some runs with artificial snow. There are also maybe a dozen other places with one or two lifts perfect for a morning's skiing. Suitable for intermediate rather than expert skiers (only a couple of black runs) they're also ideal if you are a bit rusty and want a quick day or two to get back into the swing. Runs are around 2km maximum length, so it's great if you're not (ahem) perfectly fit. Prices are reasonable and there are plenty of nice cheap places to have lunch (¤10 covers a basic meal). <br /><a href=\"http://www.tourismevosges.fr/les-vosges-sports-d-hiver.html\" title=\"\"><em>tourismevosges.fr</em></a><br /><strong>ExPatJohn</strong></p><p><strong>Auron</strong><br />Auron 1600 is a surprise. Less than two hours from Nice, it captivates you with its charming village atmosphere. The skiing is suitable for all the family, catering for novice to expertall levels. It's a fantastic journey up to the resort, hard to believe that you can be transported from the blueness of the Côte d'Azur to the crystal whiteness of the Alpes-Maritime in such a short space of time. The food and accommodation isare delightful, with numerous après ski activities.<br /><em>hiver.auron.com</em><br /><strong>SimonTweed</strong></p><p><strong>Le Grand Bornand</strong><br />Enjoyed by just a small number of British skiers, but loved by the French, Le Grand Bornandcorrect is a charming, chocolate box village in the Aravis. The smaller neighbour to La Clusazcorrect, and just an hour from Geneva and 35 minutes from Annecy, the skiing here is fantastic for all the family. You can choose a ski pass for Grand Bornand or the full Aravis area with regular buses linking the resorts. We never had to queue to get on a lift, the lift operators were always friendly and helpful and there's a good choice of restaurants around the slopes. My husband, who's an expert skier, loved the skiing here, particularly the off-piste - the snowfall we had was amazing.  Oour three year-old loved learning and, as an intermediate skier, I had no end of choice of where to go. The tuition here is also fantastic. We've skied in many other places, but love it here - fantastic town, amazing skiing, easy access to Annecy for non-skiers, lovely restaurants and chilled apres ski.<br /><a href=\"http://www.legrandbornand.com/\" title=\"\"><em>legrandbornand.com</em></a><br /><strong>RachelB17</strong></p><h2>Italy</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894461134/Skiing-in-Macugnaga-Italy-001.jpg' alt='Skiing in Macugnaga, Italy' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Snowboarding in Macugnaga. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Macugnaga</strong><br />Set at the foot of Monte Rosa, which is itself worth the trip, Macugnaga in Piedmont can only be described as a local ski resort. Small in size, it avoids the buses of the package holidays yet it has a vibrant feeling thanks to a friendly bunch of locals. The skiing is excellent – be the first up to peak Moro (3,008m) and enjoy the wide pistes all to yourself. The queues never get long and the hot food in the bars is not a rip-off. There is plenty to do for all; ice skating, trekking, a spa and the après-ski scene is genuine fun.<br /><a href=\"http://www.macugnaga.it/en/\" title=\"\"><em>macugnaga.it</em></a><br /><strong>razmataz87</strong></p><p><strong>Pragelato</strong><br />Peaceful Pragelato is 90 minutes' drive from Turin airport. On the border of the Val Troncea national parkcorrect, it enjoys peace and tranquillity. The Via Latteacorrect skiing area is the main attraction, with more than 400km of runs but, with the Val Troncea national park so near, there is also plenty of walking and snow trekking to be done. One of the legacies from the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics is a fantastic cross-country skiing network. My family has been going to Pragelato for the past 20 years or so, and we have seen the village changing through the years and it is lovely to see!<br /><a href=\"http://www.comune.pragelato.to.it/\" title=\"\">comune.pragelato.to.it</a><br /><strong>two_mamas</strong></p><p><strong>Folgarida</strong><br />Folgarida is a tiny resort in the Italian Dolomites but benefits from being linked to the bigger town of Madonna di Campiglio. It has 28 pistes with a total length of 50km but, when added to the Brenta Dolomites slopes, there's access to 150km of well-groomed, tree-lined runs. Folgarida itself is very quiet on the après side, so it might be better suited to serious skiers or families. A&nbsp;beginner/intermediate resort, it has friendly reds and blues but has access to more challenging reds and blacks in Madonna. Our favourite was the leg-burning Orso Bruno route back from Madonna to Folgarida: 9km without any lifts!<br /><a href=\"http://www.visittrentino.it/en/localita/folgarida\" title=\"\"><em>visittrentino.it</em></a><br /><strong>9avin</strong></p><h2>Switzerland</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113945'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380894554810/Chairlift-and-Slopes-in-O-001.jpg' alt='Chairlift and Slopes in Obersaxen' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The quiet slopes of Obersaxen-Mundaun.

It's the home of ski champion Carlo Janka, but Obersaxen sees itself as a family ski resort and the pistes have something to offer at all skill levels. There are several other ski areas nearby for day trips, including Brigels, Sedrun and the popular Flims Laax.<br /><strong>KorKhan</strong></p><h2>Sweden</h2><p><strong>Björkliden</strong><br />From Björkliden, a small ski resort deep inside the Arctic circle and under the northern lights corridor, you can see the great Lapporten Gap – the gateway to Lapland. Cosy cabins, Sweden's highest mountain station (Låktatjåkko) and lots of non-skiing activities. You can also ski on the Swedish/Norwegian border at Riksgränsen using the transfer bus between the ski areas.<br /><a href=\"http://www.bjorkliden.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bjorkliden.com</em></a><br /><strong>Chris Graham</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418850079|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b977150de9bcf5edde1ee2f3d54a072889e75ed2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Albi the guide smiles patiently as he watches me sitting in the snow, sluggishly strapping my boots onto my board. \"You&nbsp;know,\" he says, as the thinning clouds offer tantalising glimpses of the mountains all around, \"to snowboard in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKuYDJ5wL0k\" title=\"\">the Dolomites</a>, you have to be a little crazy. You have to go really fast.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm still somewhat groggy from the day before – and the welcoming feast rustled up by the Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.rosalpina.it/\" title=\"\">Hotel Rosa Alpina</a> in San Cassiano, the highlight of which may have been the ground veal served with herb jelly on a salt biscuit. I just can't remember too well. The powerful local <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf_IP55-vxs\" title=\"\">Lagrein wine</a> was fantastic, you see, as was the grappa. Vaguely, I&nbsp;recall that one dish came on its own self-standing, flat-bottomed spoon, allowing you to eat two at once, even as you're being bundled into your taxi.</p><p>Albi, thin as a ski and fast as a bullet, is leading us on day two of a five-day odyssey with local operator Dolomite Mountains, an epic <a href=\"http://www.dolomitemountains.com/en/winter_spring_trips/ski_safari430.htm\" title=\"\">hut-to-hut ski safari</a> (you can board it, like me, but most people ski) that will take in some of the planet's most dazzling peaks and, as I'm beginning to realise, cuisine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK-bupHoz5U\" title=\"\">Cliffhanger</a> was filmed round this part of north-east Italy, Sylvester Stallone being effortlessly upstaged by the area's vertiginous crags, ledges, pinnacles and plateaux. These are pale by day but change dramatically at dusk&nbsp;and dawn, glowing orange, red or even purple. This ravishing phenomenon, called the <a href=\"http://www.alpineadventureagency.com/about-the-region/the-majestic-dolomites/the-enrosadira-phenomenon.html\" title=\"\"><em>enrosadira</em></a>, is caused by the mineral make-up of the rocks – as Roger Moore doubtless appreciated as he dodged gunfire on these slopes in the 1980s, while filming For Your Eyes Only.</p><p>Even without the <em>enrosadira</em>, the Dolomites would be bewitching. Like something out of the US<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryqdoe6xLs4\" title=\"\">'s Monument Valley</a>, these almost violently vertical peaks are characterised, in some places, by huge isolated forms that contrast with the rolling meadows they tower over – and in others, by sweeping, saw-toothed ranges that beat anything else in the alps, to my mind anyway. Elemental forces seem to be at work: it's the sort of landscape Tolkien would have adored. In August 2009, the Dolomites were declared a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1237\" title=\"\">Unesco World Heritage site</a> and, it seems, the foodies and their self-standing spoons moved in.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231009'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380884015026/Andrew-refuels-after-a-bu-001.jpg' alt='Andrew refuels after a busy day … and another fine lunch' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Andrew refuels after a busy day … and another fine lunch</figcaption></figure><p>Amid apologies for overcast skies, we set off on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld1RwNgQG0M\" title=\"\">Sellaronda</a>, a ski tour famed for being a day-long circumnavigation of <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Gruppo_del_Sella.jpg\" title=\"\">the mighty Sella</a>, a plateau-shaped massif whose steep sides are ringed by fangs of rock – and flanked by 42km of snowy trails awash with understandably smug Italians. It's a staggering sight. Every twist and turn I make seems to reveal some new jaw-dropping view of that central stone fortress nosing through the clouds, or of yet another spellbinding colossus way off in the distance. The pistes are a treat, too: steep and tree-lined, then open and gentle – although maybe sometimes a bit too gentle. I'm beginning to see what Albi meant: skiers can pole over the occasional flat, but I'm having to tank it down or face a&nbsp;walk (I've had worse afternoons).</p><p>As the weather closed in, we stopped for lunch at a steamed-up taverna and tried to choose between sauerkraut, goulash, dumplings or ravioli made with rye flour. I wanted the lot but picked the ravioli, which was filled with dried fig and wild pear, and came lovingly doused in hot poppy butter and cinnamon. Serve that in Britain, I thought, and you'd get your own TV show. But here, it was just your average lunch. When we stepped back outside, the skies had lifted and the Sella massif now stood before us in its full glory – its jostling peaks fanning along the horizon like the back of a giant stegosaurus. Giddy on my board, I spent the rest of the day bingeing on Dolomites and trying to keep my eyes on the piste.</p><p>That night I stayed in Corvara, swimming up and down the pool in the four-star <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/information/index/1-0.html\" title=\"\">Posta Zirm hotel</a>, watching through the windows as the Sella turned lobster red – much like myself later, as I lay in the sauna. A member of the hotel staff popped his head in at one point and gestured disapprovingly at my Speedos. I looked around and, through the steam, could make out nothing but naked Germans sweating and snoring. Ah, trunks off, sorry.</p><p>The sauna is part of the hotel's <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/wellness-farm/wellness-farm/24-0.html\" title=\"\">Wellness Farm</a>, which seeks to restore your \"inner equilibrium\" via such <a href=\"http://www.postazirm.com/en/wellness-farm/treatments/25-0.html\" title=\"\">treatments</a> as hay baths, soporific music, and the opportunity to stretch out and have a woman in a white tennis top play you like a xylophone. I&nbsp;settled for an Elmore Leonard novel by the log fire, a fluffy gown and lying on a plastic recliner that I didn't realise was heated until I woke up an hour later, my equilibrium perfectly restored.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231010'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380883544788/The-enrosadira-at-Rifugio-001.jpg' alt='The enrosadira at Rifugio Fuciade' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sunset at Rifugio Fuciade Photograph: Giuseppe Ghedina</figcaption></figure><p>The point about the ski safari is that, Sellaronda excepted, it takes you across the best of the Dolomites, not right back to where you started each morning. You pass from terrain to terrain, while your bag meets you at each hotel or high-altitude hut. Although the tougher sections must be guided, you can go it alone here and there – giving yourself an extra challenge and saving a bit of cash.</p><p>Day three, taking us to Arabba and Porta Vescovo for what should have been mesmerising views of the Marmolada glacier, needed Albi. Visible from Venice on a clear day, Marmolada is, at 3,343m, the highest of the Dolomites. Sadly, we could barely see it, even as we stood on its vast reaches, thanks to a whiteout that only began to fizzle out after we'd had to move on. Still, the red-run descent on perfect powder was a knockout: a rattling sprint down a snaking boulevard that flickered in and out of the white. At the foot, out of breath and exhilarated, I realised I hadn't been on a single piste twice all week.</p><p>Albi, who had skilfully been keeping us away from the flat, now swung us into a gorge so narrow it felt like the slightest seismic jitter could squeeze it shut again. This was the Serrai di Sottoguda, a 2km-long canyon with walls 100m high – a place of sudden darkness and blazing light, with no fence between you and the rushing, boulder-filled river Pettorina, which you cross 16 times, on terrifyingly narrow bridges. On the board, there was no choice but to go at these rickety bridges straight on – and therefore far too fast – to the cheers of two guys climbing the \"cathedral\", one of three frozen waterfalls that line the gorge.</p><p>We reached <a href=\"http://www.fuciade.it/main.html\" title=\"\">Rifugio Fuciade</a>, a fabulous cuckoo clock of an inn almost 2,000m up, after a breathtaking chairlift ascent to the soaring shoulder of the <a href=\"http://www.passosanpellegrino.it/portal/en/multimedia/photogallery/item/305-balconi-panoramici.html\" title=\"\">Passo San Pellegrino</a>, followed by a blast through frozen forests on a snowmobile. Built by three priests in the 1960s and now running out of wallspace for its food awards, this haven, surrounded by stillness and hemmed in by mountains, is today run by Sergio Rossi, grandson of one of the priests. With room for just 20 guests, the refuge had been described as something special – and didn't disappoint.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231011'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380884357746/Dolomites-001.jpg' alt='Dolomites' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Yet another stunning valley</figcaption></figure><p>We kicked off our kit, took piping hot showers, stretched out on beautifully carved wooden beds, and then headed down for dinner, through narrow corridors decorated with accordions and antlers, pressed flowers and paintings of nudes, not to mention embroidery, stuffed birds, a gnome straining into a toilet, and the head of every four-legged beast that has ever walked these parts.</p><p>As darkness fell and our muscles stopped throbbing after the day's exertions on some of the finest pistes I've ever sped down, so began the finest meal I've ever had. There was venison carpaccio, risotto with chestnut and truffle, pork shin on polenta, and an egg adrift in potato cream and caviar. There was even a dish called Memory of Wood but, thanks again to the Lagrein and grappa, I can't for the life of me remember what was in it. \"Not bad at all,\" said Albi and headed for bed.</p><p>I stepped outside for a bit of air, noticed that the terrace thermometer said -7C, and ducked straight back inside, shivering. I was just tucking into my second helping of prune tart with elderflower sorbet and feeling like I hadn't a care in the world, when Emanuela, Sergio's wife, raced into the room shouting and waving her arms. <em>\"Abbiamo avuto la fumata bianca!\"</em> she yelled. \"We have had the white smoke!\" I thought the place was on fire and wondered what the procedure would be: would I burn to death in the refuge – or escape, only to freeze to death in the snow? But it turned out Emanuela was just telling us that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lxrvLeq3M\" title=\"\">a new pope had been chosen</a>.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" said Albi in the morning, looking up at the shimmering peaks of the Cimo Uomo and the avalanches that had spilled down its sides in the night. \"We're going to have fun today.\" And so off we went, this time with the boarder leaving the skiers behind, at least until the pistes were reached. It was day four, billed as the visual highlight of the trip, promising stunning views of the Veneto and Trentino Dolomites. And again, we weren't disappointed. Drunk on powder and panoramas, we even did some routes twice, eventually finding ourselves on a stretch of flat so lengthy that some enterprising local had set up a horse-drawn service that would happily pull 20 or so rope-clutching skiers back to the lifts.</p><p>We slept at 2,778m that night, in <a href=\"http://www.rifugiolagazuoi.com/indexUK.php\" title=\"\">Rifugio Lagazuoi</a>, but not before Albi had joined us for a farewell <em>bombardino</em>: a one-is-enough local eggnog, rum and whipped cream drink. More hostel than haven, Lagazuoi is less grand than Fuciade, but I loved it – even if the cuisine is hearty rather than haute. Plus, hung with icicles in the sub-zero morning, the terrace offers <a href=\"http://www.rifugiolagazuoi.com/Ing/Gallery/visGal.php?idGal=23&amp;opzione=0&amp;idCategoria=\" title=\"\">dizzying views</a> that seem to take in not just vast swathes of the Dolomites, but the whole world.</p><p>Day five, daringly unguided, began with the best of what Lagazuoi had to offer: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ytHkMceew\" title=\"\">the 8.5km Armentarola</a>, regarded as one of the best runs in the world, an extended slalom through a rippling, pine-dotted landscape – and Dolomites so tall, so sheer and so close you feel you could reach out and run your fingers along them. Naturally, we got lost fairly quickly after that, but it didn't matter. Eventually, we found our way over to Cortina, for yet another intoxicating afternoon of stirring views and perilous descents, including the ridiculously steep slope used for the women's World Cup downhill, which I skidded almost all the way down on my back, having fallen on the first turn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419231008'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798401625/Cortina-in-the-Dolomites--001.jpg' alt='Cortina, in the Dolomites, Italy' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sloping off … great powder and stirring views at Cortina.

        "body":"<p>At the top of the Kasprowy Wierch cable car was a poster about bears. The specimen depicted was fudge-coloured and shaggy, and looked replete, as if he'd just eaten a skier. \"And do they?\" I asked the liftman.</p><p>He thought about it a moment. This part of Poland is famously unhurried, and full of surprises. Over 600km south of the Baltic, this is a land of snowy, Brueghel-esque scenes; sleighs, monasteries, cupolas, huge wooden manor houses – like galleons – and a rolling landscape of whiteness. Then, suddenly, it wells up into a wall of rock, 2,500m high: the Tatras. This is the whiptail of the Alps, as wild and well-wolved as anywhere else.</p><p>\"No,\" said the liftman. \"Bears are fine. And, anyway, they sleep now. Come back in spring.\"</p><p>It's a tempting offer. Everything about our Polish week exceeded expectations – as a family holiday it's hard to beat. I've always liked the sound of Krakow, with its huge 13th-century square, and its ancient churches, but we also decided to slot in some skiing. This was more imponderable. Although the prices were encouraging (a fraction of France's), the skiing was mysterious. How would our resort, Zakopane, cope with our range of talents: the expert (my wife), the novice (Lucy, aged eight) and the haphazard (me)?</p><p>We soon realised that, whatever the skiing was like, Zakopane was charming. Although it has swanky bars and ski shops, it's essentially a very old mountain town. Most of it is made of tree trunks (parts dating from the early 1800s), and even the scrap-dealer still has a sledge. This is the place to buy an enormous sheepskin (£25), or a vast cake of smoked ewe's milk cheese (£1).</p><p>Lucy loved it, as any child would. The locals – called \"highlanders'\" here – use any excuse (eg church) to dress up in costume, and can often be seen in their black hats, sea-shells and narrow, white-felt trousers. Even our hotel, the Litwor, felt pleasingly old-fashioned, although it had a vast fish-tank above the pool that glowed like a planet.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113745'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380886581130/The--Narnian--towers-of-K-001.jpg' alt='The ‘Narnian’ towers of Krakow’s Wawel castle' width='460' height='307' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The ‘Narnia’ towers of Krakow’s Wawel castle Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>The system for skiing seemed a bit odd at first. Each day, we'd take a taxi (£5) or a bus (75p) out to a different ski area. Some didn't open until 9.30am, and then we'd hire what we needed for the day. Like Zakopane, it was all vaguely charming (I once saw a horse and cart, collecting firewood beside a green run). Out on the runs, all of us were happy (\"This,\" announced Lucy, \"is the best fun I've ever had!\"). Harenda, Nosal and Szymoszkowa were perfect for a family like ours, encompassing beginners and the doggedly incompetent. Although – for my wife – there was only one area offering a true adrenaline fix (Kasprowy Wierch), here was an ideal opportunity to master the snowboard. None of this was going to break an arm or a leg, and nor was it going to cost one. </p><p>It'll be hard to go back to paying top-dollar elsewhere after the prices here (daily ski-pass £12; skis and boots £5 a day; lessons £15 per hour). Even a good, slap-up, log-cabin lunch came in at a fiver (mulled wine £2; spag bol £3). I loved these places, all slightly trollish with their log fires and antlers. In Zakopane, there's a pleasing selection of restaurants with open fires and hearty dishes. </p><p>If you want something urban, try <a href=\"http://www.dobrakaszanasza.pl/\" title=\"\">Dobra Kasza Nasza</a>, where grilled chicken and a shot costs around £6. Or to see highlanders in their costumes hefting huge platters of meat, go to <a href=\"http://www.zakopane-restauracje.pl/\" title=\"\">Owczarnia</a>, with spare ribs at around £8. I am also surprised by how many Poles ski with tiny dogs tucked into their jackets.</p><p>After this, Krakow did little to dispel the fairytale aura. At first sight, it's like a city that's risen from the pages of a children's book. Dominating everything is a castle (<a href=\"http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/\" title=\"\">the Wawel</a>), that looks like a meeting of towers from all over Narnia. Beyond it is a great sprawl of Gothic and Baroque; dungeons and underground eateries; old groceries; huge chocolate shops (with bunnies the size of spaniels); and a footbridge to which lovers have attached thousands of padlocks. Grand, hobbity, and slightly eccentric, there is, quite literally, something for all the family.</p><p>It would've taken months to explore it all. We did, however, find the lecture halls of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II, and the house (at 14 Szeroka) where Helena Rubinstein was born. We also found ourselves before da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, in the castle.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113746'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380886658231/the-magical-underground-w-001.jpg' alt='the magical underground world of Wieliczka’s salt mines' width='460' height='293' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The magical underground world of Wieliczka’s salt mines. Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</figcaption></figure><p>But there is a darker, sadder side to Krakow. In 1941, the Nazis had descended on Kazimierz, a district that had been Jewish since 1495. Even today, parts of Kazimierz feel ownerless and derelict, and the resurrection of the synagogues is largely architectural. Of those marched away (amongst them, Roman Polanski, aged eight), some 60,000, or 25% of Krakow's population, perished. You can still see the ghetto across the river, where – for a while – some of them lived. But it isn't all run down: an interesting reconstruction of a Jewish eatery can be found at <a href=\"http://www.dawnotemu.nakazimierzu.pl/\" title=\"\">Dawno Temu Na Kazimierzu</a> on ul. Szeroka 1. And amongst the little factories, one (at 4 Lipowa) is now a startling new museum – and will always be known to the world as Schindler's Ark.</p><p>Before leaving, we made two forays from Krakow. The first, to Auschwitz (70km to the west), was an experience so affecting that – weeks on – I still think about it every day. The second took us deep underground, to a happier time in Poland's story. In the 1280s, rock salt was discovered at Wieliczka, and a mine began. Now, seven centuries later, there are over 240km of tunnels, and we saw around 1% in an afternoon. It was a magnificent walk, past underground lakes and through cathedrals of salt. You could almost feel Lucy's young imagination being gently stretched. There was also a&nbsp;comforting sensation of wealth and fantasy restored.</p><p>So would we return to Poland? Each of us felt our appetite for this remarkable country was merely whetted. So I'm sure we'll be back, if not in time for the bears' first breakfast.</p><p>• <em>The trip was provided by Baltic Travel (0845 6800 642, </em><a href=\"http://www.baltictravelcompany.com/\" title=\"\"><em>baltictravelcompany.com</em></a><em>).

        "headline":"Extreme skiing at the crater of Japan's Mount Yotei volcano",
        "body":"<p>Scrambling on all fours to the summit and cursing the heavens wasn't how I imagined this ski experience would pan out. As the cold bit and the wind rumbled ominously, I started to question what on earth we were doing. But climbing up Mount Yotei, an active volcano, in search of deep powder was never going to be easy.</p><p>Most skiers coming to Japan's northern island of <a href=\"http://en.visit-hokkaido.jp/\" title=\"\">Hokkaido</a> head for the popular resort of Niseko to experience its pristine snow. But for those who want a non-standard experience, scaling one of Hokkaido's most iconic volcanoes is too big a temptation to resist.</p><p>Yotei, often referred to as Ezo Fuji (or the Mount Fuji) of Hokkaido, is in the Shikotsu-Toya national park bordering the popular towns of Niseko,&nbsp;Kutchan and Makkari on the island's west coast. While skiing anywhere in Niseko, Yotei towers majestically in the distance, usually with small clouds billowing above its crater. At 1,898m, it is the highest mountain in the region and has the longest vertical ski descent in Hokkaido. Much planning is needed to make a successful ascent – bad weather comes in hard and fast in this region – so, from our base at the popular ski town of Hirafu in Niseko, we sought out a well-respected guide: Sam Kerr.</p><p>Sam is a New Zealander who runs Niseko Xtreme Tours, a local company specialising in back-country tours. We&nbsp;liaised with him over 10 days while waiting for the perfect conditions – there was much monitoring of weather patterns, avalanche reports and careful map-reading.</p><p>Finally, we hit the road at 8am one morning and, after an hour's drive, arrived at the base of the mountain. After putting on snowshoes, testing our avalanche transceivers (you would be surprised at how many people omit&nbsp;this vital bit of kit) and packing our shovels, probes, food, boots and skis, we set off for the day.</p><p>With no tracks in the snow before us, no sight of fellow hikers, and seeing&nbsp;Yotei suffused in the early morning light, we&nbsp;knew we'd chosen the right day.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113840'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/4/1380892670844/Hiking-up-Mount-Yotei.-008.jpg' alt='Hiking up Mount Yotei.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hiking up Mount Yotei. Photograph: Louise Healy </figcaption></figure><p>It takes between six and eight hours to reach the summit. We left no margin for error, making it to the peak in five and a half hours, stopping only for food and water. This is no leisurely day on the slopes – it's a rigorous hike that will test your resolve and fitness.</p><p>With less than a quarter of the hike to go, it became clear the warm weather had created a hazardous challenge. The sugary top layer of snow was starting to break under our snow shoes, which left our feet sinking up to half a metre. Knowing our goal was to ski the deep powder inside Yotei's crater, we ploughed on.</p><p>The weather was deceptive above 1,000m – the bright sun bathed the mountain in a yellow glow and the winds were biting and dangerously cold but we pushed on and finally reached the crater's edge.</p><p>The crater itself was breathtakingly white from top to bottom; a classic bowl about 400m high with a 360-degree panoramic view. Although I am an advanced skier, the thought of plunging into this both terrified and exhilarated me. I watched the first three of our group descend into the soft, light powder and effortlessly glide down to the base. Then I went for it.</p><p>Pushing off from the ledge and skiing into the crater felt surreal. Unlike other powder runs in busy ski resorts, the beauty of this expedition was that we were allowed so much time and space to carve out beautiful lines with no competition on our backs. I&nbsp;was skiing on fresh powder that had&nbsp;been sitting on a base of untouched snow for weeks. For all my&nbsp;initial reservations, skiing on it felt&nbsp;effortless.</p><p>The main route down the northface starts off with an exciting 50-degree slope which leads into the open powder bowl. One side of the slope was extremely icy, while the other side was deep with fresh powder.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113842'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380816884762/The-crater-at-the-summit--001.jpg' alt='The crater at the summit of Mount Yotei' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The crater at the summit of Mount Yotei.

Later, we had a half-hour descent through wonderful,&nbsp;untracked bottomless powder, then we hiked for about 40&nbsp;minutes out of the crater and back to the top ridge of&nbsp;Mount Yotei before making our descent to where the cars were parked.</p><p>Back at base, Sam told us conditions needed to be near perfect to scale Yotei&nbsp;and ski into its crater. Approximately 100 people each winter attempt the climb and only around about 20 actually do it.</p><p>\"Now that you have seen Yotei, you can understand its beauty and power,\" he said.</p><p>Sitting down that evening, sipping Hokkaido's famous plum wine, it was hard to believe we were part of the lucky 20% who managed to ski Mount Yotei's crater that winter. Scrambling on all fours and cursing the heavens was worth it in the end.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418767236|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6c144dc3631abdaefd556ec8a9adf0d5b36f3146 -->",
