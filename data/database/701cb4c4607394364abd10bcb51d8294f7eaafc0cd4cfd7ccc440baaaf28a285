Robin Lustig, a judge for the journalism prize, said of Freedland: &quot;He has been on the shortlist of the Orwell prize seven times now. His writing has a lucidity and elegance of style that deserves reward.&quot;</p> <p>Guardian foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad won the Orwell prize for journalism for his work on the Syrian conflict, including a special report on a jihadist group effort to take control in the country. Lustig said: &quot;He has shown great personal courage and a rare depth of understanding. He writes with deep compassion for those whose lives have been shattered by the conflict.&quot;</p> <p>The winners were chosen from 235 entries to the book prize and 167 entries to the journalism prize.</p> <p>The books category was won by former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson for his memoir, This Boy, which also won the Ondaatje literary prize.</p> <p>Sue MacGregor, a judge for the books award, said: &quot;This is a tale told without a trace of self-pity, but with great grace and good humour, of what it was like growing up poor in a single- parent family in post-war Britain. It is at once deeply personal and nationally significant, and a highly engaging read.&quot;</p>","creationDate":"2014-05-21T18:50:36Z","internalOctopusCode":"9072206","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","internalPageCode":"2096785","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>Foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad praised for work on Syria while Jonathan Freedland awarded special prize for 'lucidity and elegance' of his writing</p>","lastModified":"2014-05-21T19:23:55Z","lang":"en","headline":"Two Guardian journalists win Orwell prize for journalism","byline":"Martin Williams","commentable":"false","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"437480645"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-437484026","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698424922/Jonathan-Freedland-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"PD*8176351","altText":"Jonathan Freedland","caption":"Jonathan Freedland has been shortlisted for the Orwell prize seven times.
