President Rouhani&apos;s meeting w/WilliamJHague on the sidelines of UNGA has been confirmed,&quot; the tweet said.</p> <p>&quot;We would be happy to meet,&quot; a Foreign Office spokeswoman said, &quot;but we have had nothing formal from Tehran about it.&quot;</p> <p>Diplomats said that the tweet reflected the new Iranian government&apos;s eagerness to make diplomatic headway on the nuclear issue, which has been at an impasse for several years. A Hague meeting with either Rouhani or Zarif could clear the way to restoring full diplomatic ties, which have not existed since the British embassy in Tehran was ransacked by a mob in November 2011.</p> <p>In a television interview aired on Sunday, Obama made clear that there was a diplomatic opening with Iran, not only over the nuclear question but also over Syria. He confirmed earlier reports that he and Rouhani had &quot;reached out&quot; to each other, exchanging letters.</p> <p>US officials were sceptical about a Rouhani meeting, but some observers said the Geneva deal on Syria&apos;s chemical weapons has opened new space for global diplomacy.</p> <p>Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and an expert on US-Iran diplomacy, said &quot;I think there is a chance [of a meeting]. It would be a strong political push for movement. If Obama got involved, it would be the infusion of political will needed to reach an agreement.</p> <p>&quot;Tehran is already claiming some of the credit for the Syria deal. Rouhani needs to show that through his diplomatic efforts he has already avoided a war. He is desperate in his first six months to show his approach has paid more dividends than the hardline approach of his predecessor.&quot;</p> <p>Parsi added that if Obama was to meet Rouhani it was likely to be an orchestrated encounter in a corridor, rather than a sit-down talk, &quot;to give both sides deniability&quot;. The last encounter between an American and Iranian leader was when Jimmy Carter met the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1977.</p> <p>Speaking on ABC&apos;s This Week, Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised &quot;that what&apos;s happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region&quot;. He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at &quot;some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict&quot;.</p> <p>In the same interview, Obama also urged Iran&apos;s leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran&apos;s nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>&quot;I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests. That a nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilising,&quot; Obama said in the ABC interview, which was recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p> <p>&quot;My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn&apos;t draw a lesson that [because] we haven&apos;t struck to think we won&apos;t strike Iran,&quot; Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p> <p>After meeting John Kerry, US secretary of state, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point. &quot;The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime&apos;s patron – Iran,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,&quot; he added.</p> <p>However, Obama insisted: &quot;What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically. You know, negotiations with the Iranians are always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that … if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can strike a deal.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8077790","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"1965793","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>First meeting of US and Iranian leaders since 1979 revolution could open way to diplomatic end to Iranian nuclear standoff</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Iran's Rouhani may meet Obama at UN after American president reaches out","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Julian Borger, Diplomatic editor","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/15/1379275543400/Irans-President-Hassan-Ro-005.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3tnf4","wordcount":"880","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/15/1379275543400/Irans-President-Hassan-Ro-005.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56977641e4b00bd5b80fea71","newspaperPageNumber":"1","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-18T20:06:20Z","standfirst":"First meeting of US and Iranian leaders since 1979 revolution could open way to diplomatic end to Iranian nuclear standoff","linkText":"Iran's Rouhani may meet Obama at UN after American president reaches out","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-14T10:21:29.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"417344382"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/15/obama-rouhani-united-nations-meeting","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-417352062","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/15/1379275549160/Irans-President-Hassan-Ro-010.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, left, meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","caption":"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, left, meeting Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, last week.
