The stockpile has since been secured in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</p> <p>The Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli has asked the Libyan authorities to ensure the concentrated uranium is used for the benefit of Libyans, in &quot;industrial and agricultural development and in the production of clean energy&quot;.</p> <p>Gaddafi signed the chemical weapons convention and joined the OPCW in 2004 as part of an ultimately abortive efforts to shake off pariah status and mend relations with the west.</p> <p>Libya had 13 tonnes of mustard gas when it signed the treaty but Gaddafi claimed to have destroyed the munitions needed to deliver it. Gaddafi&apos;s regime destroyed about 54% of its mustard gas stocks and about 40% of the chemicals used to manufacture the substance, besides 3,500 bombs intended to deliver deadly chemicals.</p> <p>The process, supervised by OPCW experts, resumed in 2012. It intensified in September 2013 with the signing of a deal with Washington, which was increasingly concerned that the stockpiles might fall into the hands of ex-rebel militias that the post-Gaddafi government has struggled to contain.</p> <p>The Syrian disarmament operation, agreed to by Damascus in 2013 under threat of western military action, is running behind schedule, sparking mounting concern in Washington. Syria has declared around 700 tonnes of the most dangerous chemicals and they were supposed to have been shipped out by 31 December. Another 500 tonnes of less dangerous precursor chemicals are supposed to be shipped out by Wednesday.</p> <p>But so far just two small shipments have left the Syrian port of Latakia, accounting for less than 4% of the country&apos;s declared arsenal of most dangerous chemicals and none of the precursors. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has warned President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that he could face consequences if he fails to meet his obligations on giving up the weapons.<br /></p>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2038364","internalRevision":"160","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Government says country has been rid of weapons from Gaddafi era in process hailed by monitors as example for Syria <br>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Libya says chemical weapons destroyed","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Agence France-Presse in Tripoli","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-02-05T05:36:28.505Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mf2q","wordcount":"621","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578453568/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-140x84.jpeg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"52f1c992e4b025fe0e2e665b","internalStoryPackageCode":"67398","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-08T05:36:29Z","standfirst":"<p>Government says country has been rid of arsenal from Gaddafi era in process hailed by monitors as example for Syria <br></p>","linkText":"Libya says chemical weapons destroyed","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-20T19:21:02.000+01:00","internalContentCode":"428938889"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/05/libya-says-chemical-weapons-destroyed","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e28d892f-d2a5-4b6f-ac5b-f39498c93df0","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391578452448/1bb9f957-8069-440a-b615-29ca04268fe6-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*41326996","altText":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.","caption":"Libya's foreign minister, Mohamed Abdulaziz, announces the country's destruction of all its viable chemical weapons.

I am certain that you would wish any interview to be conducted between Mr Al-Senussi and Scottish police officers to be scrupulously fair, putting its admissibility in subsequent proceedings beyond any doubt.&quot;</p> <p>Scottish police are hoping Senussi, Gaddafi&apos;s spy chief for most of the dictator&apos;s 42-year-rule, can answer questions about the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 that have eluded investigators for quarter of a century.</p> <p>A senior member of Emerson&apos;s legal team, Amal Alamuddin, said: &quot;Any new inquiry into the events surrounding Lockerbie needs to be scrupulously fair, and this needs to start with Mr Senussi being given legal counsel during any interview with Scottish law officers.&quot;</p> <p>Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted of the bombing, died in 2012 in Libya protesting his innocence.</p> <p>Libya has appointed two officers to work with Scottish and American Lockerbie investigators, with the justice minister, Salah al-Marghani, saying: &quot;We should know everything about what happened.&quot;</p> <p>Senussi, indicted by the Hague for crimes against humanity, was captured in Mauritania after fleeing Libya after the 2011 Arab spring revolution. He was extradited to Libya and last year went on trial, amid tight security, accused of crimes committed during the revolution.</p> <p>Emmerson, who represented the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, is also appealing against the ICC&apos;s decision in October that Libya could take the Senussi case, arguing that the country&apos;s turmoil raises doubts about its ability to hold a fair trial.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8668479","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2041230","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Interviewing potential suspect in Tripoli jail without lawyer would break precedent, Scotland's lord advocate told","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Lockerbie bombing inquiry: lawyer warns police over al-Senussi interview","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Chris Stephen in Tripoli","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392047379767/Abdullah-al-Senussi--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mjx3","wordcount":"391","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392047379767/Abdullah-al-Senussi--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5694feafe4b060a3548ca67e","newspaperPageNumber":"19","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-13T16:05:32Z","standfirst":"Interviewing potential suspect in Tripoli jail without lawyer would break precedent, Scotland's lord advocate told","linkText":"Lockerbie bombing inquiry: lawyer warns police over al-Senussi interview","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-12T13:25:09.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"429376328"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/lockerbie-bombing-inquiry-lawyer-warns-police-abdullah-al-senussi-interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/10/lockerbie-bombing-inquiry-lawyer-warns-police-abdullah-al-senussi-interview","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429378188","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392047388063/Abdullah-al-Senussi--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"EPA","picdarUrn":"GD*28030588","suppliersReference":"LIB002","altText":"Abdullah al-Senussi ","caption":"Abdullah al-Senussi was once Libya’s intelligence chief and the right-hand man of Muammar Gaddafi.

The stockpile has since been secured in collaboration with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</p> <p>The Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli has asked the Libyan authorities to ensure the concentrated uranium is used for the benefit of Libyans, in &quot;industrial and agricultural development and in the production of clean energy&quot;.</p> <p>Gaddafi signed the chemical weapons convention and joined the OPCW in 2004 as part of an ultimately abortive efforts to shake off pariah status and mend relations with the west.</p> <p>Libya had 13 tonnes of mustard gas when it signed the treaty but Gaddafi claimed to have destroyed the munitions needed to deliver it. Gaddafi&apos;s regime destroyed about 54% of its mustard gas stocks and about 40% of the chemicals used to manufacture the substance, besides 3,500 bombs intended to deliver deadly chemicals.</p> <p>The process, supervised by OPCW experts, resumed in 2012. It intensified in September 2013 with the signing of a deal with Washington, which was increasingly concerned that the stockpiles might fall into the hands of ex-rebel militias that the post-Gaddafi government has struggled to contain.</p> <p>The Syrian disarmament operation, agreed to by Damascus in 2013 under threat of western military action, is running behind schedule, sparking mounting concern in Washington. Syria has declared around 700 tonnes of the most dangerous chemicals and they were supposed to have been shipped out by 31 December. Another 500 tonnes of less dangerous precursor chemicals are supposed to be shipped out by Wednesday.</p> <p>But so far just two small shipments have left the Syrian port of Latakia, accounting for less than 4% of the country&apos;s declared arsenal of most dangerous chemicals and none of the precursors.

Photograph: James Lee Harper Jr/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>British pilots have launched at least 39 missile strikes against suspected Taliban insurgents from American drones based in Afghanistan, according to new figures.</p> <p>The details have emerged from the Ministry of Defence, which has for the first time disclosed how RAF crews using unmanned US aircraft have launched missiles in conflict zones.</p> <p>The MoD insists British drone pilots always operate under UK rules of engagement, whatever asset they are flying.</p> <p>However, campaigners have called for increased scrutiny over the use of the aircraft and condemned a lack of transparency about the programmes run by the American and British armed forces. British crews piloted US Reaper and Predator drones in Afghanistan on 2,150 occasions between 2006 and 2012 – an average of almost once a day.</p> <p>That does not include the thousands of missions British forces have flown with their own fleet of 10 Reaper aircraft.</p> <p>The MoD has also for the first time provided a breakdown of the number of missiles fired by UK drones every month between May 2008 and April 2013.</p> <p>These attacks peaked in November 2011, when 25 missiles were fired. There has been only one month in which no missiles were launched – December 2008.</p> <p>Latest figures show RAF drones fired 94 Hellfire missiles in Afghanistan during 2013, bringing the total number of munitions and bombs fired by British unmanned systems since 2008 to 457.</p> <p>The figures were released last week, nine months after a freedom of information (FoI) request, to <a href=\"http://dronewars.net/\" title=\"\">Drone Wars UK</a>, a website that researches and monitors the British use of unmanned technologies.</p> <p>The website&apos;s creator, Chris Cole, said: &quot;This latest revelation once again demonstrates the secrecy surrounding the use of armed drones and once again underlines the need for increased scrutiny and greater transparency about their use.</p> <p>&quot;The nature of drone technology means they are being used with little or no public accountability.</p> <p>&quot;Unless we act now to curb this new weaponry it seems inevitable that drones will increasingly be used to launch secret and unaccountable military attacks leading to global instability and increased insecurity.&quot;</p> <p>Heather Barr, of Human Rights Watch, added: &quot;One of the problems with drone programmes from the beginning has been a near-total lack of transparency about the scale of the programmes, where they were operating, what their goals are, and who they are targeting and how. If it is now not even possible to know which country has its finger on the button, that adds yet another layer of confusion which will make accountability even more elusive.&quot;</p> <p>The MoD statement to Drone Wars UK makes clear British pilots were flying US drones in Afghanistan long before the RAF had any unmanned aircraft of its own; the UK did not start flying its own Reapers in Afghanistan until mid-2008.</p> <p>The FoI reply states: &quot;Between October 2006 and 31 December 2012, UK aircrew had flown approximately 2,150 operational missions using US Reaper and Predator remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in support of operations in Afghanistan and Libya.</p> <p>&quot;UK and US personnel also operate both nations&apos; RPAS as part of the launch and recovery phase in Afghanistan. Of the 2,150 missions flown by UK personnel, there were 271 missions in Afghanistan when UK personnel utilised a US Reaper as a UK Reaper was unavailable. During these missions, UK personnel released 39 weapons.&quot;</p> <p>While the MoD gave some details about operations in which the UK has borrowed US equipment, it refused to give details about operations flown by British crews formally within the US air force. &quot;I am withholding information about weapons released by UK personnel embedded with the US air force on operations in Afghanistan and Libya,&quot; the letter says.</p> <p>&quot;I have carried out a public interest test. Releasing the information would provide a limited additional understanding of the UK&apos;s relationship with the US over that which is already in the public domain in relation to operations in Afghanistan.</p> <p>&quot;Releasing the information concerned, when the other government has not given permission to do so, would undermine the relationship of trust that exists between the UK and other countries. Consequently, I am withholding the information. Information is not held for operations in Iraq.&quot;</p> <p>Cole said it was essential that information about drone operations undertaken by British RAF pilots while embedded with US forces be made available for public scrutiny and debate.&quot;</p> <p>He called on the defence select committee, which is holding an inquiry into drones, to reconsider its decision to hold its sessions in private.</p> <p>The MoD insists drones operate under the same rules as other aircraft: &quot;The RAF and USAF continue to work closely to provide persistent armed intelligence and surveillance to allied armed forces in Afghanistan. This occasionally involves the RAF utilising USAF assets when UK aircraft are unavailable. These aircraft always operate on UK tasks, with RAF aircrew in control, using UK rules of engagement.&quot;</p> <p>The MoD has yet to decide what it will do with its fleet of armed Reapers once UK forces have left Helmand province at the end of combat operations this December.</p> <p>Under current rules, the aircraft cannot be flown in the UK. The MoD is considering options that might include basing the drones in Kenya to support military operations against terrorists in the Horn of Africa.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8664752","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2040663","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"MoD discloses for first time how British crews using unmanned US aircraft have launched missiles in conflict zones","allowUgc":"false","headline":"RAF has fired missiles in Afghanistan using US drones, MoD reveals","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Nick Hopkins","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391949872686/-RAF-launched-missiles-in-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mt73","wordcount":"872","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391949872686/-RAF-launched-missiles-in-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56988522e4b01b84906e4ae3","newspaperPageNumber":"4","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-12T20:00:01+00:00","standfirst":"MoD discloses for first time how British crews using unmanned US aircraft have launched missiles in conflict zones","linkText":"RAF has fired missiles in Afghanistan using US drones, MoD reveals","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-15T05:36:02.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"429284900"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/09/raf-british-crews-missiles-afghanistan-us-drones-mod","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/feb/09/raf-british-crews-missiles-afghanistan-us-drones-mod","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429285492","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391949877707/-RAF-launched-missiles-in-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP/Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*13026465","suppliersReference":"US-ROBOTS-DRONES-MILITARY","altText":"\nRAF launched missiles in Afghanistan using US drones, MoD reveals","caption":"A US air force MQ-9 Reaper.

When I arrived at the ICC I was a soldier, but I&apos;m no longer a soldier any more.&quot;</p> <p>Spoken in the Kinyarwanda language, these were words that few had expected to hear in a court of law.</p> <p>For years Ntaganda, a Congolese militia leader and fugitive from justice dubbed &quot;The Terminator&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/congo-child-soldiers-ntaganda-monuc\" title=\"\">could be seen dining in fine restaurants and playing tennis at a luxury hotel</a>, a living symbol of apparent impunity.</p> <p>On Monday however, he was confronted with his alleged war crimes by prosecutors at The Hague. Ntaganda ordered fighters to shoot and behead civilians, rape women and recruit child soldiers, the international criminal court (ICC) was told.</p> <p>The prosecution told judges that Ntaganda, now about 40, had committed the crimes while leading fighters of Hema ethnicity to drive ethnic Lendus out of the mineral-rich Ituri region in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo more than a decade ago.</p> <p>The allegations against Ntaganda were made at the opening of a five-day hearing to decide if there is sufficient evidence for him to stand trial. He is not required to make a formal plea at this stage but denies all 18 charges against him.</p> <p>&quot;He played a key role in planning assaults against the civilian population in order to gain territory,&quot; chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, told the hearing. She added: &quot;He persecuted civilians on ethnic grounds, through deliberate attacks, forced displacement, murder, rape, sexual enslavement and pillaging. &quot;</p> <p>Rwandan-born Ntaganda, commander of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia, had &quot;failed to prevent or punish crimes by troops under his effective command or control,&quot; she added.</p> <p>Dmytro Surprun, a lawyer representing victims of the alleged crimes, said: &quot;Victims were killed by bullets, by arrows, by nail-studded sticks. Most of them were mutilated, some were decapitated and their head borne as a trophy.&quot;</p> <p>Ntaganda was indicted in 2006, accused of murder and keeping women as sex slaves, earning comparisons with Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony on the ICC&apos;s most wanted list. But after years fighting for various rebel movements, he became a general in the Congolese army in 2009 and was able to roam the eastern city of Goma at will, cocking a snook at both the ICC and UN peacekeepers.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8666765","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-02-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2040947","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>Prosecutors say he was key in planning attacks on civilians in north-east DRC, but defence denies ethnic character of conflict</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Congo warlord Bosco Ntaganda led ethnically motivated murder, ICC told","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"David Smith, Africa correspondent","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392022185543/Congolese-warlord-Bosco-N-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3mthh","wordcount":"376","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392022185543/Congolese-warlord-Bosco-N-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5699ecfbe4b08611361a832d","newspaperPageNumber":"16","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-13T08:54:26Z","standfirst":"Prosecutors say he was key in planning attacks on civilians in north-east DRC, but defence denies ethnic character of conflict","linkText":"Congo warlord Bosco Ntaganda led ethnically motivated murder, ICC told","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-16T07:11:06.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"429342657"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/congo-warlord-bosco-ntaganda-war-crimes-hague","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/feb/10/congo-warlord-bosco-ntaganda-war-crimes-hague","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-429417714","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392022190696/Congolese-warlord-Bosco-N-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*41468712","suppliersReference":"22891025","altText":"Congolese warlord Bosco Ntaganda","caption":"Nicknamed 'The Terminator', Bosco Ntaganda founded the M23 rebels, who were defeated by UN-backed troops in November.

charges in the light of a huge cache of evidence smuggled out of the country showing the “systematic killing” of about 11,000 detainees, according to three eminent international lawyers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/syria-civil-war-five-years-guardian-reporting\">Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The three, former prosecutors at the criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, examined thousands of Syrian government photographs and files recording deaths in the custody of regime security forces from March 2011 to last August.</p> <p>Most of the victims were young men and many corpses were emaciated, bloodstained and bore signs of torture. Some had no eyes; others showed signs of strangulation or electrocution.</p> <p>The UN and independent human rights groups have documented abuses by both Bashar al-Assad’s government and rebels, but experts say this evidence is more detailed and on a far larger scale than anything else that has yet emerged from the 34-month crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-427644221\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/20/1390243420515/One-of-the-images-contain-006.jpg\" alt=\"One of the images contained in the Syria report\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the images contained in the report, purportedly showing ligature marks across the neck of a prisoner. Photograph: The report</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The three lawyers interviewed the source, a military policeman who worked secretly with a Syrian opposition group and later defected and fled the country. In three sessions in the last 10 days they found him credible and truthful and his account “most compelling”.</p> <p>They put all evidence under rigorous scrutiny, says<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/jan/20/torture-of-persons-under-current-syrian-regime-report\"> their report, which has been obtained by the Guardian and CNN</a>.</p> <p>The authors are Sir Desmond de Silva QC, former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the former lead prosecutor of former Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic, and Professor David Crane, who indicted President Charles Taylor of Liberia at the Sierra Leone court.</p> <p>The defector, who for security reasons is identified only as Caesar, was a photographer with the Syrian military police. He smuggled the images out of the country on memory sticks to a contact in the Syrian National Movement, which is supported by the Gulf state of Qatar. Qatar, which has financed and armed rebel groups, has called for the overthrow of Assad and demanded his prosecution.</p> <p>The 31-page report, which was commissioned by a leading firm of London solicitors acting for Qatar, is being made available to the UN, governments and human rights groups. Its publication appears deliberately timed to coincide with this week’s UN-organised Geneva II peace conference, which is designed to negotiate a way out of the Syrian crisis by creating a transitional government.</p> <p>Caesar told the investigators his job was “taking pictures of killed detainees”. He did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture. But he did describe a highly bureaucratic system.</p> <p>“The procedure was that when detainees were killed at their places of detention their bodies would be taken to a military hospital to which he would be sent with a doctor and a member of the judiciary, Caesar’s function being to photograph the corpses … There could be as many as 50 bodies a day to photograph which require 15 to 30 minutes of work per corpse,” the report says.</p> <p>“The reason for photographing executed persons was twofold. First to permit a death certificate to be produced without families requiring to see the body, thereby avoiding the authorities having to give a truthful account of their deaths; second to confirm that orders to execute individuals had been carried out.”</p> <p>Families were told that the cause of death was either a “heart attack” or “breathing problems”, it added. “The procedure for documentation was that when a detainee was killed each body was given a reference number which related to that branch of the security service responsible for his detention and death.</p> <p>“When the corpse was taken to the military hospital it was given a further number so as to document, falsely, that death had occurred in the hospital. Once the bodies were photographed, they were taken for burial in a rural area.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d453ecf2e3361d21492bb7a0be7d529535d6515\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2d453ecf2e3361d21492bb7a0be7d529535d6515/0_105_3500_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man reacts as he looks at a gruesome collection of images of dead bodies in Syria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man reacts as he looks at a gruesome collection of images of dead bodies in Syria taken by the photographer, who has been identified by the code name “Caesar,” at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three experienced forensic science experts examined and authenticated samples of 55,000 digital images, comprising about 11,000 victims. “Overall there was evidence that a significant number of the deceased were emaciated and a significant minority had been bound and/or beaten with rod-like objects,” the report says.</p> <p>“In only a minority of the cases … could a convincing injury that would account for death be seen, but any fatal injury to the back of the body would not be represented in the images …</p> <p>“The forensics team make clear that there are many ways in which an individual may be killed with minimal or even absent external evidence of the mechanism.”</p> <p>The inquiry team said it was satisfied there was “clear evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government. It would support findings of crimes against humanity and could also support findings of war crimes against the current Syrian regime.”</p> <p>De Silva told the Guardian that the evidence “documented industrial-scale killing”. He added: “This is a smoking gun of a kind we didn’t have before. It makes a very strong case indeed.”</p> <p>Calls for Assad or others to face justice at the international criminal court in The Hague have foundered on the problems that Syria is not a member of the court, and that the required referral by the UN security council might not be supported by the US and UK or would be blocked by Russia, Syria’s close ally.</p> <p>Nice said: “It would not necessarily be possible to track back with any degree of certainty to the head of state. Ultimately, in any war crimes trial you can imagine a prosecutor arguing that the overall quantity of evidence meant that the pattern of behaviour would have been approved at a high level.</p> <p>“But whether you can go beyond that and say it must be head of state-approved is rather more difficult. But ‘widespread and systematic’ does betoken government control.”</p> <p>Crane said: “Now we have direct evidence of what was happening to people who had disappeared. This is the first provable, direct evidence of what has happened to at least 11,000 human beings who have been tortured and executed and apparently disposed of.</p> <p>“This is amazing. This is the type of evidence a prosecutor looks for and hopes for. We have pictures, with numbers that marry up with papers with identical numbers – official governmentdocuments. We have the person who took those pictures. That’s beyond-reasonable-doubt-type evidence.”</p> <p>A US administration official told the Guardian on Monday: “We stand with the rest of the world in horror at these images which have come to light. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of the regime and call on it to adhere to international obligations with respect to the treatment of prisoners.</p> <p>“We have long spoken out about mistreatment and deteriorating prison conditions in Syria. These latest reports, and the photographs that support them, demonstrate just how far the regime is willing to go to not only deny freedom and dignity to the Syrian people, but to inflict significant emotional and physical pain in the process. To be sure, these reports suggest widespread and apparently systematic violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>“The regime has the ability to improve the atmosphere for negotiations in Geneva by making progress in several areas. However, this latest report of horrific and inhumane prison conditions/actions further underscores that if anything, it is tarnishing the environment for the talks.</p> <p>“As we have for over two years, and again today, we call on the Syrian government to grant immediate and unfettered access to all their detention facilities by international documentation bodies, including the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria.</p> <p>“We have long said that those responsible for atrocities in Syria must be held accountable for their gross violations of human rights. The United States continues to support efforts to promote accountability and transitional justice, and we call on the international community to do the same.”</p> <p>William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, said: “This report offers further evidence of the systematic violence and brutality being visited upon the people of Syria by the Assad regime. We will continue to press for action on all human rights violations in Syria, and for accountability for those who perpetrate them.”</p> <p>Nadim Houry of Human Rights Watch said his organisation had not had the opportunity to authenticate the images. But he added: “We have documented repeatedly how Syria’s security services regularly torture – sometimes to death – detainees in their custody.</p> <p>“These photos – if authentic – suggest that we may have only scratched the surface of the horrific extent of torture in Syria’s notorious dungeons. There is only one way to get to the bottom of this and that is for the negotiating parties at Geneva II to grant unhindered access to Syria’s detention facilities to independent monitors.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8576919","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2029595","internalRevision":"33","publication":"The
