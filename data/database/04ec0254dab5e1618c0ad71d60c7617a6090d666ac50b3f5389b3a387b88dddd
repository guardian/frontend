offered a “full and unreserved apology” after Ed Miliband revealed that he told a fringe meeting at the recent Tory conference that some disabled people were “not worth” the minimum wage.</p> <p>As the Labour party called for Freud to be sacked after he suggested that some people with mental disabilities could be paid as little as £2 an hour, the minister said it was “offensive” to suggest that anyone should be paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>In a statement issued by the Department for Work and Pensions, Freud said: “I would like to offer a full and unreserved apology. I was foolish to accept the premise of the question. To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept that it is offensive to suggest anything else.</p> <p>“I care passionately about disabled people. I am proud to have played a full part in a government that is fully committed to helping disabled people overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment. I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.”</p> <p>Freud issued his statement after Mencap called on him to consider his position and Downing Street distanced itself from the minister by saying there could be no exceptions to the minimum wage.</p> <p>Esther McVey, a fellow DWP minister, said the remarks would “haunt” Freud. Speaking on the Daily Politics on BBC2, McVey said: “Those words will haunt him. I cannot justify those words. They were wrong. We have the minimum wage. Everybody has the minimum wage. We have done a lot to support people with disabilities.”</p> <p>McVey spoke out after Miliband disclosed the remarks by Freud in answer to a question at the recent Tory conference in Birmingham about paying the minimum wage to disabled people. Around 100,000 disabled people are paid the minimum wage. The Labour leader quoted Freud as saying to his questioner at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. There is a group where actually, as you say, they’re not worth the full wage.”</p> <p>Asked by Miliband whether that was his view, the prime minister said: “No, absolutely not. Of course disabled people should be paid the minimum wage and the minimum wage under this government is going up and going up in real terms. It is now at £6.50. We will be presenting our evidence to the low pay commission, calling for another real-terms increase in the minimum wage.”</p> <p>Miliband then quoted further from Freud, who added that he was looking at “whether there is something we can do if someone wants to work for £2 an hour”. Amid cries of “outrage” and “shame” from the Labour benches, Miliband said: “Surely someone holding those views can’t possibly stay in his government.”</p> <p>Cameron, who was informed of Freud’s remarks shortly before prime minister’s questions, said: “Those are not the views of the government, they are not the views of anyone in the government. The minimum wage is paid to everybody, disabled people included.”</p> <p>With his voice rising in anger, the prime minister added: “Let me tell you: I don’t need lectures from anyone about looking after disabled people. So I don’t want to hear any more of that. We pay the minimum wage, we are reforming disability benefits, we want to help disabled people in our country, we want to help more of them into work. And instead of casting aspersions why doesn’t he get back to talking about the economy.”</p> <p>Miliband said: “I suggest, if he wants to protect the rights of disabled people, he reads very carefully what his welfare minister has said because they are not the words of someone who ought to be in charge of policy related to disabled people.</p> <p>“In the dog days of this government the Conservative party is going back to its worst instincts – unfunded tax cuts, hitting the poorest hardest, now undermining the minimum wage. The nasty party is back.”</p> <p>Freud is likely to argue in private that the full exchanges at the fringe meeting show he was trying to help people with mental illness into the workplace. He is also likely to say that he was suggesting that the universal credit system could help people with “fluctuating conditions”.</p> <p>But Labour said after the Commons exchanges that Freud should be sacked. Dan Scorer, the head of policy at Mencap, told The World at One on BBC Radio 4: “He needs to very seriously consider his position after making these comments … It is a very serious proposition to put forward and one we fundamentally disagree with.”</p> <p>But Freud was offered some support when David Scott, a Conservative councillor from Tunbridge Wells whose question prompted his remarks, said that the discussion was about helping vulnerable people into the workplace.</p> <p>Scott told The World at One: “I was wanting to explore [with Freud] how to help some very vulnerable people in the community and to find ways that these individuals could actually get greater self-worth and be introduced to the workplace to help them … The sentiment is quite clearly that he was concerned: how do we help these individuals to enter the workplace so they can feel they are adding something and gaining worth.”</p> <p>In the full text, released by the Labour party, Freud was quoted as saying to Scott at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. Now I had not thought through, and we have not got a system for, you know, kind of going below the minimum wage.</p> <p>“But we do have … you know, universal credit is really useful for people with the fluctuating conditions who can do some work – go up and down – because they can earn and get … and get, you know, bolstered through universal credit, and they can move that amount up and down.</p> <p>“Now, there is a small … there is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…”</p> <p>Scott had said: “The other area I’m really concerned about is obviously the disabled. I have a number of mentally damaged individuals, who to be quite frank aren’t worth the minimum wage, but want to work. And we have been trying to support them in work, but you can’t find people who are willing to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>“We had a young man who was keen to do gardening; now the only way we managed to get him to work was actually setting up a company for him, because as a director in a company we didn’t have to pay the minimum wage, we could actually give him the earnings from that. But trying to maintain his support and allow him to work, which he wanted to do, so to stay with benefits, and stay with some way of managing to continue on in that way. And I think yes, those are marginal areas but they are critical of actually keeping people who want to work supported in that process. And it’s how do you deal with those sort of cases?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9645251","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2176101","internalContentCode":"449806799","internalRevision":"27","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Labour

The law is the law: you have got to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>“If you are employing someone to do a full day’s work, you cannot … short change people or pay less.”</p> <p>Clegg said it was the word “worth” that had touched a raw nerve with people. He did not call for Freud to be sacked. Liberal Democrats have said Conservative ministerial appointments are a matter for the prime minister.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister said there were difficult discussions to be had about how to encourage disabled people or those with mental health problems into work, but pointed to schemes such as Access to Work that were addressing the issue.</p> <p>Freud offered a “full and unreserved apology” after Ed Miliband revealed his remarks made at a fringe meeting at the recent Tory conference that some disabled people were “not worth” the minimum wage.</p> <p>The Labour party called for Freud to be sacked after he suggested that some people with mental disabilities could be paid as little as £2 an hour.</p> <p>In a statement issued by the Department for Work and Pensions, Freud said: “I would like to offer a full and unreserved apology. I was foolish to accept the premise of the question. To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept that it is offensive to suggest anything else.</p> <p>“I care passionately about disabled people. I am proud to have played a full part in a government that is fully committed to helping disabled people overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment. I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.”</p> <p>Freud issued his statement after Mencap called on him to consider his position and Downing Street distanced itself from the minister by saying there could be no exceptions to the minimum wage.</p> <p>Speaking on the Daily Politics on BBC2, Esther McVey, a fellow DWP minister, said: “Those words will haunt [Freud]. I cannot justify those words. They were wrong. We have the minimum wage. Everybody has the minimum wage. We have done a lot to support people with disabilities.”</p> <p>McVey spoke out after Miliband disclosed the remarks by Freud in answer to a question at the recent Tory conference in Birmingham about paying the minimum wage to disabled people. About 100,000 disabled people are paid the minimum wage. The Labour leader quoted Freud as saying to his questioner at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. There is a group where actually, as you say, they’re not worth the full wage.”</p> <p>Asked by Miliband whether that was his view, the prime minister said: “No, absolutely not. Of course disabled people should be paid the minimum wage and the minimum wage under this government is going up and going up in real terms. It is now at £6.50. We will be presenting our evidence to the Low Pay Commission, calling for another real-terms increase in the minimum wage.”But Freud was offered some support when David Scott, a Conservative councillor from Tunbridge Wells whose question prompted his remarks, said the discussion was about helping vulnerable people into the workplace.</p> <p>Scott told The World at One: “I was wanting to explore [with Freud] how to help some very vulnerable people in the community and to find ways that these individuals could actually get greater self-worth and be introduced to the workplace to help them … The sentiment is quite clearly that he was concerned: how do we help these individuals to enter the workplace so they can feel they are adding something and gaining worth.”</p> <p>In the full text, released by the Labour party, Freud was quoted as saying to Scott at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. Now I had not thought through, and we have not got a system for, you know, kind of going below the minimum wage.</p> <p>“But we do have … you know, universal credit is really useful for people with the fluctuating conditions who can do some work – go up and down – because they can earn and get … and get, you know, bolstered through universal credit, and they can move that amount up and down.</p> <p>“Now, there is a small … there is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…”</p> <p>Scott had said: “The other area I’m really concerned about is obviously the disabled. I have a number of mentally damaged individuals, who to be quite frank aren’t worth the minimum wage, but want to work. And we have been trying to support them in work, but you can’t find people who are willing to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>“We had a young man who was keen to do gardening; now the only way we managed to get him to work was actually setting up a company for him, because as a director in a company we didn’t have to pay the minimum wage, we could actually give him the earnings from that. But trying to maintain his support and allow him to work, which he wanted to do, so to stay with benefits, and stay with some way of managing to continue on in that way. And I think yes, those are marginal areas but they are critical of actually keeping people who want to work supported in that process. And it’s how do you deal with those sort of cases?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9648176","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2176552","internalContentCode":"449883144","internalRevision":"21","publication":"The

Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Iain Duncan Smith is Jesus Christ. For anyone who missed the Second Coming, it happened at around mid-morning on Thursday when it became apparent that the secretary of state for work and pensions has started to cure the disabled and chronically sick.</p> <p>I mean, he hasn’t actually cured anyone yet. But I assume it’s only a matter of time, because thousands of severely ill and disabled people have had their benefits cut since <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/thousands-with-degenerative-conditions-classified-as-fit-to-work-in-future--despite-no-possibility-of-improvement-9811910.html\" title=\"\">the DWP deemed that they would “recover”</a> from their degenerative conditions in order to go to work. Recover, that is, from a condition that by its very definition is bound to get worse.</p> <p>It has emerged that more than a third of people with disabilities such as Parkinson’s and MS are being denied the full version of employment support allowance and pushed into “work-related activity” – the group expected to be well enough to work, that gets less money, and is routinely sanctioned.</p> <p>Forget the surgeon who enabled a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/21/paralysed-darek-fidyka-pioneering-surgery\" title=\"\">paralysed man to walk again</a>, IDS is the real disability hero of the week. He hasn’t even had medical training, but you don’t see that stopping him. If the DWP decides someone with Parkinson’s will get better in order to find a job, why would medical science disagree? And if they say they are in pain or their limbs are trembling, cutting their benefits should incentivise them to deal with it.</p> <p>Let’s not be shy about the scale of this. Almost 8,000 people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, muscular atrophy, Parkinson’s disease, cystic fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis have been put on this lesser “will be able to work soon” benefit, according to an investigation by the conditions’ respective charities. Of these, 5,000 people were put into the category despite assessors actually writing the phrase “unlikely [to be fit for work] in the longer term” on their reports.</p> <p>It is unclear exactly how IDS is achieving this modern-day miracle. In my mind, I imagine I’d have to rub his scalp for an hour until a ball of light-filled energy shivered through his shiny head to each strand of my genetic makeup. But these are just details. Nonsensical, borderline disturbing details that I just made up. Which, funnily enough, is exactly how disability benefit policy seems to be constructed under this government.</p> <p>This level of incompetence means that seven out of 10 new claimants with a progressive condition have been reassessed two or more times on the same claim. Because it’s good to check that a person’s cystic fibrosis didn’t scrub off in the last month after a few really nice baths. Health experts claim that repeatedly harassing people who are too ill to get out of bed and threatening to remove the money they need to eat is causing stress and anxiety.</p> <p>Is no one grateful for attention, any more? IDS hates ingratitude. As he told <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/iain-duncan-smith-disabled-benefits-spending-video\" title=\"\">Channel 4 news this week</a> when Krishnan Guru-Murthy suggested disabled people felt “hard done by” under this government’s policies: “We probably spend more on disabled and sick people in Britain … than almost any other country in the developed world.” He doesn’t let the fact that this is <a href=\"http://disabilitynewsservice.com/2013/08/ministers-misuse-figures-to-show-uk-is-world-leader-on-disability-spending/\" title=\"\">a lie</a> stop him. He inserts the word “probably” and then says whatever fits with his policies.</p> <p>I believe IDS is “probably” incompetent and is reducing thousands of people, scared, in pain, and humiliated, to poverty. This latest farce is emblematic of a government-wide culture of dehumanising, dangerous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/pip-chaos-government-disabled-people-delays-benefits\" title=\"\">benefit cuts</a> that have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/david-cameron-24bn-universal-credit-problems\" title=\"\">rotted every part of the social-security system</a> and are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/09/david-clapson-benefit-sanctions-death-government-policies\" title=\"\">causing people to die</a>.</p> <p>For this government, work for disabled people doesn’t simply mean <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/15/lord-freud-unreserved-apology-comment-disabled-people-mimimu-wage\" title=\"\">paying them less</a>. It means forcing them into the job in the first place. The terrifying thing is that this isn’t a joke.

I was foolish to accept the premise of the question.</p> <p>“To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept it is offensive to suggest anything else.</p> <p>“I care passionately about disabled people. I am proud to have played a full part in a government that is fully committed to helping disabled people overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment. I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.”</p> <p>But disabled groups remained unhappy. <a href=\"http://www.leonardcheshire.org/who-we-are/people/management-board#.VD7LFC_6rW4\" title=\"\">Clare Pelham, chief executive of Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>, told the BBC: “That final sentence in his apology when he apologises – if he has caused any offence to disabled people – is him slightly missing the point. He’s offended everyone; everyone is offended by the idea that disabled people are not worth a full wage.”</p> <p>The row broke out after Miliband disclosed that Freud had suggested at a fringe meeting at the Tory conference in Birmingham last month that people with mental disabilities could be paid £2 an hour, well below the minimum wage which currently stands at £6.50 an hour.</p> <p>About 100,000 disabled people are paid the minimum wage.</p> <p>The Labour leader quoted Freud responding positively to David Scott, a Tory councillor from Tunbridge Wells, who said that “mentally damaged individuals” would like to work but cannot find employment because employers believe they “aren’t worth the minimum wage”. Freud said to Scott: “You make a really good point about the disabled … There is a group where actually, as you say, they’re not worth the full wage.”</p> <p>Miliband then quoted further from Freud, who had been recorded, who added that he was looking at “whether there is something we can do nationally … if someone wants to work for £2 an hour”.</p> <p>Amid cries of “outrage” and “shame” from the Labour benches, Miliband said: “Surely someone holding those views can’t possibly stay in his government.”</p> <p>The prime minister, who was informed of Freud’s remarks shortly before prime minister’s questions, said: “Those are not the views of the government, they are not the views of anyone in the government. The minimum wage is paid to everybody, disabled people included.”</p> <p>Miliband pressed the prime minister, prompting Cameron to raise his voice as he appeared to allude to his severely disabled late son Ivan and his late father Ian, whose legs were deformed from the knee downwards.</p> <p>The prime minister said: “Let me tell you: I don’t need lectures from anyone about looking after disabled people. So I don’t want to hear any more of that. We pay the minimum wage, we are reforming disability benefits, we want to help disabled people in our country, we want to help more of them into work. And instead of casting aspersions why doesn’t he get back to talking about the economy?”</p> <p>Miliband said: “In the dog days of this government the Conservative party is going back to its worst instincts – unfunded tax cuts, hitting the poorest hardest, now undermining the minimum wage. The nasty party is back.”</p> <p>Esther McVey, a fellow DWP minister, said the remarks would “haunt” her colleague.</p> <p>Speaking on the Daily Politics on BBC2, McVey said: “Those words will haunt him. I cannot justify those words. They were wrong. We have the minimum wage. Everybody has the minimum wage. We have done a lot to support people with disabilities.”</p> <p>Freud is likely to argue in private that the full exchanges at the fringe meeting show he was trying to help people with mental illness into the workplace.</p> <p>He is also likely to say that he was suggesting that the universal credit system could help people with “fluctuating conditions”.Downing Street made no secret of the way in which Cameron instructed Freud to issue a full apology. Cameron’s spokesman said: “The PM gave very clear instructions to his office about how it needed to be taken forward. You’ve seen the outcome from that.”</p> <p>The prime minister was understood to be furious with Freud for slipping up. But Downing Street was loth to lose Freud who is seen to have a full grasp of the universal credit reforms which have run into such trouble.</p> <p>Cameron poached Freud in 2009 after the former investment banker, who had acted as an unpaid adviser to the last Labour government, decided that Gordon Brown was not committed to radical welfare reform.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9646955","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2176402","internalContentCode":"449838703","internalRevision":"26","publication":"The

offered a “full and unreserved apology” after Ed Miliband revealed that he told a fringe meeting at the recent Tory conference that some disabled people were “not worth” the minimum wage.</p> <p>As the Labour party called for Freud to be sacked after he suggested that some people with mental disabilities could be paid as little as £2 an hour, the minister said it was “offensive” to suggest that anyone should be paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>In a statement issued by the Department for Work and Pensions, Freud said: “I would like to offer a full and unreserved apology. I was foolish to accept the premise of the question. To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept that it is offensive to suggest anything else.</p> <p>“I care passionately about disabled people. I am proud to have played a full part in a government that is fully committed to helping disabled people overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment. I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.”</p> <p>Freud issued his statement after Mencap called on him to consider his position and Downing Street distanced itself from the minister by saying there could be no exceptions to the minimum wage.</p> <p>Esther McVey, a fellow DWP minister, said the remarks would “haunt” Freud. Speaking on the Daily Politics on BBC2, McVey said: “Those words will haunt him. I cannot justify those words. They were wrong. We have the minimum wage. Everybody has the minimum wage. We have done a lot to support people with disabilities.”</p> <p>McVey spoke out after Miliband disclosed the remarks by Freud in answer to a question at the recent Tory conference in Birmingham about paying the minimum wage to disabled people. Around 100,000 disabled people are paid the minimum wage. The Labour leader quoted Freud as saying to his questioner at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. There is a group where actually, as you say, they’re not worth the full wage.”</p> <p>Asked by Miliband whether that was his view, the prime minister said: “No, absolutely not. Of course disabled people should be paid the minimum wage and the minimum wage under this government is going up and going up in real terms. It is now at £6.50. We will be presenting our evidence to the low pay commission, calling for another real-terms increase in the minimum wage.”</p> <p>Miliband then quoted further from Freud, who added that he was looking at “whether there is something we can do if someone wants to work for £2 an hour”. Amid cries of “outrage” and “shame” from the Labour benches, Miliband said: “Surely someone holding those views can’t possibly stay in his government.”</p> <p>Cameron, who was informed of Freud’s remarks shortly before prime minister’s questions, said: “Those are not the views of the government, they are not the views of anyone in the government. The minimum wage is paid to everybody, disabled people included.”</p> <p>With his voice rising in anger, the prime minister added: “Let me tell you: I don’t need lectures from anyone about looking after disabled people. So I don’t want to hear any more of that. We pay the minimum wage, we are reforming disability benefits, we want to help disabled people in our country, we want to help more of them into work. And instead of casting aspersions why doesn’t he get back to talking about the economy.”</p> <p>Miliband said: “I suggest, if he wants to protect the rights of disabled people, he reads very carefully what his welfare minister has said because they are not the words of someone who ought to be in charge of policy related to disabled people.</p> <p>“In the dog days of this government the Conservative party is going back to its worst instincts – unfunded tax cuts, hitting the poorest hardest, now undermining the minimum wage. The nasty party is back.”</p> <p>Freud is likely to argue in private that the full exchanges at the fringe meeting show he was trying to help people with mental illness into the workplace. He is also likely to say that he was suggesting that the universal credit system could help people with “fluctuating conditions”.</p> <p>But Labour said after the Commons exchanges that Freud should be sacked. Dan Scorer, the head of policy at Mencap, told The World at One on BBC Radio 4: “He needs to very seriously consider his position after making these comments … It is a very serious proposition to put forward and one we fundamentally disagree with.”</p> <p>But Freud was offered some support when David Scott, a Conservative councillor from Tunbridge Wells whose question prompted his remarks, said that the discussion was about helping vulnerable people into the workplace.</p> <p>Scott told The World at One: “I was wanting to explore [with Freud] how to help some very vulnerable people in the community and to find ways that these individuals could actually get greater self-worth and be introduced to the workplace to help them … The sentiment is quite clearly that he was concerned: how do we help these individuals to enter the workplace so they can feel they are adding something and gaining worth.”</p> <p>In the full text, released by the Labour party, Freud was quoted as saying to Scott at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. Now I had not thought through, and we have not got a system for, you know, kind of going below the minimum wage.</p> <p>“But we do have … you know, universal credit is really useful for people with the fluctuating conditions who can do some work – go up and down – because they can earn and get … and get, you know, bolstered through universal credit, and they can move that amount up and down.</p> <p>“Now, there is a small … there is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…”</p> <p>Scott had said: “The other area I’m really concerned about is obviously the disabled. I have a number of mentally damaged individuals, who to be quite frank aren’t worth the minimum wage, but want to work. And we have been trying to support them in work, but you can’t find people who are willing to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>“We had a young man who was keen to do gardening; now the only way we managed to get him to work was actually setting up a company for him, because as a director in a company we didn’t have to pay the minimum wage, we could actually give him the earnings from that. But trying to maintain his support and allow him to work, which he wanted to do, so to stay with benefits, and stay with some way of managing to continue on in that way. And I think yes, those are marginal areas but they are critical of actually keeping people who want to work supported in that process. And it’s how do you deal with those sort of cases?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9645251","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2176101","internalContentCode":"449806799","internalRevision":"27","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Labour

Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>I promise that what you’re about to read is true. I have not orchestrated a far-fetched parody of Tory attitudes on disability and poverty. A Conservative minister – a welfare minister, no less – has actually been recorded saying that disabled people are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/15/welfare-reform-minister-disabled-not-worth-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">“not worth” the full national minimum wage</a>. It’s unclear how much less Lord Freud would like to pay disabled people: £4.50 less per hour is his first offer. Perhaps he would like to do away with cash altogether, giving blind people dog toys in exchange for a day’s work and wheelchair users shiny coins.</p> <p>Recorded responding to a question from a Conservative councillor at a fringe event at the recent Tory conference, Freud said: “You make a really good point about the disabled. Now I had not thought through, and we have not got a system for, you know, kind of going below the minimum wage ... I know exactly what you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue ... whether there is something we can do nationally ... which if someone wants to work for £2 an hour ...”</p> <p>Part of me thought I’d become immune to this government – to both its attitude and actions towards disabled people. I’ve spoken to enough people, ill, in pain and afraid, who – due to the immorality or incompetence of the Department for Work and Pensions – have been rejected for disability benefits and don’t know where money for food is going to come from. I’ve met enough people who are seeing their social care cut and their independence sold off, who no longer have the support to get dressed, leave the house or go to the toilet when they want. I’ve read eviction letters when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/17/bedroom-tax-housing-benefit-reform-explained\" title=\"\">bedroom tax</a> has pushed carers and disabled children out of their home.</p> <p>There is something about reading a government minister say you are not worth the same wage as the rest of society that goes beyond everything else. That collides with four years of taking and hurting and shaming disabled people and puts it into words. “You are disabled and that means you are not worth as much as other people.”</p> <p>It’s as if they are building an underclass. A few million cheap labourers, more cogs than people. It is really something to hear the people meant to represent you articulate the belief that you are not as good as others, that you are not of value. Disabled? Different? Less citizen, more fair game to be exploited.</p> <p>This news does not come in isolation. We are in the climate of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/15/work-programme-mental-health-ippr-thinktank-benefit\" title=\"\">Work Programme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/overview\" title=\"\">employment and support allowance</a> travesties, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/14/more-jobseekers-allowance-claimants-subject-benefit-sanctions\" title=\"\">jobseeker’s allowance sanctions</a> and personal independent payment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/17/delays-personal-independence-payments-disabled-people-unacceptable-welfare\" title=\"\">delays</a>. Coerced, free labour and a shrinking, ever conditional benefit system. Freud has not spoken out of turn, but encapsulated Conservative attitudes to both disabled people and workers: pay them as little as possible and they will be grateful for it.</p> <p>The Tories are not content with forcing disabled people into work.

Attacks on benefits threaten everyone who is low-paid, not working, sick, has disabilities or plain unlucky. Freezing housing and other benefits would cut the income of 50% of households – those with least money, without work or on low pay, zero hours and high rent. The threat to remove all benefit from people under 21 – many in full-time work, with children, and without rich families to support them – shows ministers’ contempt for our young people and how tough life is for them.</p> <p>The least well-off, in work or not, did not cause the deficit, triggered by trillions in bank bailouts and subsidies. Why should they be penalised, while the richest benefit from more tax cuts? We should not stigmatise or blame each other, but defy and beat these attacks on Britain’s welfare safety net. We can force ministers to retreat, as we have in the fight against Atos, workfare and the bedroom tax. Now is the time to stand up and be counted.

Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>With their most dangerous opponents lined up on the benches behind them, David Cameron and Ed Miliband fell upon each other at their first prime minister’s questions for six weeks like two unwanted labradoodles in the back of an animal rescue van. Both know that though neither of them may be long for this world, they are still safer in each other’s company than anywhere else. Miliband began by apologising for the sore throat that made him sound even more feeble than usual. The prime minister took pity. “I am sure the whole house will want his sore throat to get better soon,” he said. “I hope that, if he gets a doctor’s appointment, he will not forget it.”</p> <p>Miliband was so touched by Cameron’s concern for his wellbeing that he fluffed the chance of a dig about the difficulty of seeing his GP and kept his nose to the script. Having been caught out trying to ad lib at the Labour conference, he won’t risk going off message for a while. He should also stop bothering to waste time trying to pin Cameron down on any policy details, because the prime minister just switches on the Cam-Bot, which is programmed to spew out streams of unrelated statistics on a continuous loop. Asked about tax cuts, he replied by quoting unemployment figures, though even they couldn’t raise any signs of life in the chancellor. Osborne appears to have switched from a 5-2 to a 2-5 diet and it can’t be long before he vanishes inside his suit.</p> <p>Just as the Cam-Bot was reaching terminal velocity – “Up 26%, down 11%, up 17%, long-term economic plan, exterminate” – Miliband landed an unexpected punch. Did the prime minister endorse the comments of Lord Freud, his welfare reform minister, who had recently suggested that disabled people were not worth the minimum wage? The Cam-Bot turned a deep red, a sure sign this was the first he’d ever heard of Lord Freud’s slip.</p> <p>“Those are not the views of the government,” he spluttered, glancing anxiously towards the work and pension secretary, Iain Duncan Smith. The Grand Inquisitor took the hint and left the chamber immediately. Moments later, Lord Freud’s cries of pain echoed throughout Westminster. Having paused to experience the full pleasures of restorative justice in action, Cameron called for an end to the matter. “I do not need lectures from anyone about looking after disabled people, so I do not want to hear any more of that.” Lord Freud’s great-grandfather would have called that wishful thinking.</p> <p>If there was one person having a worse day than Freud, it was Douglas Carswell. After just three days in parliament as a Ukip MP, he has the air of a man who increasingly realises he has made a hideous mistake and can do nothing about it. The longer PMQs went on, the more pronounced his rocking became as he waited to be called. He got his chance just before the end and called for amendment to the recall of MPs bill – the deciding factor, apparently, in his defection to Ukip. Though not one that causes any other Ukip supporter to lose a second’s sleep. The prime minister showed his contempt for Carswell by breaking the habit of a lifetime. He answered the question in full. The cold shoulder doesn’t get much colder.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9646814","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2176328","internalContentCode":"449827478","internalRevision":"11","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Want to rile Cameron?

He links up with another UUP defector to Ukip, the Strangford Assembly member David McNarry. Ukip’s deputy leader and MEP Paul Nuttal described Stoker as “a first rate recruit” at Stormont today. Stoker represents a constituency in South Belfast close to the city centre which includes loyalist working class districts such as the Donegall Road/Village and Sandy Row. He was Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1999 after his third year serving on the city council. One of his sons was badly injured while serving in the Royal Irish Regiment in Afghanistan. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A Ukip parliamentary candidate has been deselected by the party after admitting animal welfare charges.</strong> As the Press Association reports, farmer David Evans, 71, of Week St Mary, was chosen to contest Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall. The seat is held by Conservative George Eustice, who achieved a majority of just 66 votes over the Liberal Democrats in May 2010. Ukip announced Evans would be standing for the party earlier this month, but has now removed him following court proceedings. Evans appeared at Bodmin Magistrates Court on Monday and entered guilty pleas to six animal welfare charges.<br /></li> </ul> <p>That’s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.

Hunt said he though Halfon was one of them.</p> <p>Later in the Commons, Halfon, who has been disabled since birth with spastic diaplegia, which affects only his legs and means he is unable to walk unaided, said Hunt was wrong. Raising a point of order, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I campaigned strongly for increases in the minimum wage and I find this quite incredible. While sitting here I have seen a text from [Hunt] recognising that it wasn’t me who said this. But the problem is that millions of people, on television, will have seen it. </p> <p>I’m a passionate supporter of the minimum wage, especially for disabled people.

Just under half (48%) disagree that a general election vote for Ukip is a wasted vote, compared with 41% who agree. This is a turnaround from earlier this year – last month, prior to the Clacton by-election, 50% thought a UKIP vote was a vote wasted and 41% disagreed; in May, some 57% thought voting UKIP was a wasted vote and just 33% disagreed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>A government review into the use of extreme tactics by trade unions has concluded without being about to establish whether the problem exists. </strong><strong>Bruce Carr</strong> QC terminated his inquiry without making recommendations, saying the “increasingly political environment” and the lack of evidence made a full report impossible.<a href=\"http://carr-review.independent.gov.uk/news/government-publishes-carr-report/\"> In a statement</a> he said:<br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Considering [the use of extreme tactics by unions] – the information gathered by the Review and reflected in the Report shows that there are some employers who believe that they have been subjected to tactics during industrial disputes which they consider to be ‘extreme’. There were also certain themes emerging in the tactics used. However, the one-sided nature of this evidence, the relative lack of primary evidence received, and the inability to thoroughly test it through a question and answer process has made it fundamentally difficult for me to make any evidence-based judgement on either the extent or the ‘extremity’ of such a problem, should it exist.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543e73b0e4b01d51bd0b03d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T14:17:58.398+01:00\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But the free market thinktank, the <strong>Adam Smith Institute</strong>, has defended Lord Freud (even though Freud is not defending himself.) This is from its research director, Sam Bowman.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Freud has been shamefully mistreated by Ed Miliband. His point was that the market value of some people’s wages is below the minimum wage. This is often true of the severely disabled and can have appalling consequences for their self-esteem and quality of life. Fixing this problem was the justification for Remploy, a government-funded firm that gave jobs to disabled people who could not find work elsewhere.</p> <p>To point out that someone’s market value is less than minimum wage has nothing to do with their moral value as human beings. Freud’s point was that we should help people in this situation by allowing them to find jobs paying below the minimum wage and topping up their pay directly to make up the difference.</p> <p>Even if you don’t agree with this method, it is motivated by compassion for the disabled and an understanding of the unpleasant side-effects of our minimum wage laws. Freud’s only crime was to speak bluntly: it is disgraceful to use his words against him in the way Miliband has.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543e736fe4b03829d13c1fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T14:16:00.405+01:00\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Liberal Democrats have condemned Lord Freud’s remarks.

To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept that it is offensive to suggest anything else.</p> <p>I care passionately about disabled people. I am proud to have played a full part in a government that is fully committed to helping disabled people overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment. That is why through Universal Credit – which I referred to in my response – we have increased overall spending on disabled households by £250m, offered the most generous work allowance ever, and increased the disability addition to £360 per month.</p> <p>I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543e7115e4b03829d13c1fc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T14:05:52.237+01:00\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lord Freud has issued a full and unreserved apology.

The same is true for many other people with a disability.</p> <p>People with a disability are often made to feel like second class citizens and face many barriers when trying to receive the same rights as everyone else, especially in employment. Having a politician place further barriers to us being included is incredibly upsetting and frankly quite frightening.</p> <p>I hope politicians realise that people with a disability should be encouraged to become active citizens, and not to be discriminated against for their disability, and I want to call for a full explanation of how these comments are deemed acceptable in this day and age.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543e67e3e4b03829d13c1fb1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T13:26:58.497+01:00\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s the full quote from<strong> Esther McVey</strong>, the employment minister, on Lord Freud on the Daily Politics.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those words will haunt him.

I see that Paul Waugh had it on his blog half an hour before PMQs started, but most of us had not read it and it was not even clear whether or not David Cameron was aware of it. The suggestion that a Tory minister thinks disabled people are not worth the minimum wage is clearly damaging - although, as is often the case in politics, Freud’s actual intent and the impression given by his words are rather different. He wasn’t talking about disabled people in the workforce, but about people who aren’t in the workforce currently, and perhaps have no prospect of being in the workforce, because of the severity of their disabilities. </p> <p>But Cameron had a reply. He quite categorically said that this was not his view, or the government’s view, and then, for good measure, he referred to his experience looking after his late son Ivan, who was severely disabled. If Cameron had equivocated in any way, Miliband would have been home and dry. But Cameron didn’t, and he saw off the Labour leader quite easily. Miliband resorted to making a general point about the “nasty party”, but, in the light of Cameron’s statement, that did not really resonate.</p> <p>(Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has been making the same mistake on the Daily Politics just now. Trying to keep the Freud controversy alive, he said we need to know if it’s government policy. He should now that our politics is, for better or worse, reasonably presidential, and that if the prime minister says it’s not policy, it’s not.)</p> <p>Until then, it was reasonably even-handed, although Cameron was getting the better of Miliband, partly by confidence and bravado, but partly because his (apparently spontanous) joke about Miliband’s memory was better than Miliband’s (prepared) joke about lost MPs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T13:01:23.658+01:00\">at 1.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-543e5cc1e4b0ebfb2a1bf1ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T12:40:58.938+01:00\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is another version of the Lord Freud recording, featuring his comments about some disabled people not being worth the full minimum wage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/itvnews/statuses/522350588366163968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Listen to an audio recording of Lord Freud&#39;s comments about disabled workers&#10;<a href=\"http://t.co/Yojb7Wia2l\">http://t.co/Yojb7Wia2l</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/Va3zhUFgsT\">pic.twitter.com/Va3zhUFgsT</a></p>&mdash; ITV News (@itvnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/522350588366163968\">October 15, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Politics <strong>Esther McVey</strong>, the employment minister, has just said that she cannot justify his words. “They were wrong,” she says.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T13:27:15.405+01:00\">at 1.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-543e5ba7e4b01d51bd0b03a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T12:34:17.393+01:00\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says unemployment is coming down, but the government has to stick to its long-term economic plan.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543e5b54e4b0cd82a095f76d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-15T12:33:42.587+01:00\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour’s <strong>Meg Hillier</strong> asks what the UK is doing to stop a massacre at Kobani.</p> <p>Cameron says the UK operating in the air over Iraq.

I will always make the case for Scotland to be an independent country, but with the Westminster parties already backsliding on the delivery of new powers, my immediate job will be to hold them firmly to account - and I am today putting them on notice that I intend to do just that.</p> <p>Of course, the SNP that I will lead has grown dramatically in recent weeks and we are now the third largest political party in the UK. We are in great heart as we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.</p> <p>Our new members bring a new energy and dynamism - and not just to the SNP. They are also a potent force who can help Scotland progress as a country.</p> <p>I am looking forward to meeting as many of our new recruits as possible and sharing with them my vision for the future. The tour of Scotland that I will undertake in the next few weeks also sets the template for the kind of First Minister I want to be - open, accessible and determined to work with others across the political divide to find common cause and build a better country.</p> <p>The hope, excitement and sense of opportunity of the referendum campaign did not end on polling day.

Likewise, her shadow, Yvette Cooper, is generally expected to go for the Labour leadership if Ed Miliband loses.</p> <p>It is now confirmed that Nicola Sturgeon will succeed Alex Salmond as leader of the Scottish National Party next month, becoming Scotland’s First Minister in the process. The Welsh nationalists, Plaid Cmyru, are already led by a woman, <a href=\"http://www.partyofwales.org/leader/\">Leanne Wood.</a></p> <p>The Green party, meanwhile, is on its second successive female leader, with <a href=\"http://greenparty.org.uk/people.html\">Natalie Bennett</a> following Caroline Lucas back in 2012. Even the George Galloway-founded Respect party has previously been led by a woman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/22/salma-yaqoob-respect-george-galloway\">Salma Yaqoob.</a></p> <p>Across the Irish Sea, the trend is, if anything, more pronounced. Westminster’s first-ever woman MP back in 1918 was Sinn Fein’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Markievicz\">Constance Markievicz</a> and the Irish republican movement has always produced prominent women figures. In fact, If Gerry Adams decides to spend more time <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gerry-adams-enjoys-a-slice-of-birthday-cake-he-baked-for-political-foe-peter-robinson-29874335.html\">baking cakes</a> and Martin McGuinness retires to his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2nxMtm7f3s\">fly-fishing</a>, a likely replacement leader comes in the form of <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/sinn-feins-mary-lou-mcdonald-tipped-to-succeed-gerry-adams-as-leader-of-sinn-fein-29797577.html\">Mary-Lou McDonald</a>, currently Sinn Fein’s vice-president.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since it’s a Wednesday, it’s worth asking whether PMQs would be different if the prime minister and the leader of the opposition were both women.

Labour retains a modest lead in the opinion polls, which in theory would give Miliband a majority but which in practice is too slender for anyone in the party to be very confident about it lasting until polling day. But Cameron has also won a historic victory in Scotland (despite it being more of a Labour victory, it’s the Conservatives who are doing the celebrating - there’s more on this<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/oct/01/tory-conference-2014-tory-donor-defects-to-ukip-politics-live-blog#block-542bcbd4e4b0b6acd03979e3\"> here)</a> and, even though Ukip is on the rampage, and probably threatening the Conservatives election prospects more than Labour’s, Cameron’s standing in his party is significantly higher than Miliband’s.</p> <p>At 12pm they can both channel all of this into 15 minutes of verbal aggro.</p> <p>But there is quite a lot of other news around too.

But Cameron showed anger when he alluded to his severely disabled late son, Ivan, as he told Miliband that he would take no lectures on disabled people.</p> <p>The angry exchanges came as Miliband disclosed the remarks by Freud in answer to a question at the recent Tory conference in Birmingham about paying the minimum wage to disabled people. The Labour leader quoted Freud as saying to his questioner at the fringe meeting: “You make a really good point about the disabled. There is a group where actually, as you say, they’re not worth the full wage.”</p> <p>Asked by Miliband whether that was his view, the prime minister said: “No, absolutely not. Of course disabled people should be paid the minimum wage and the minimum wage under this government is going up and going up in real terms. It is now at £6.50. We will be presenting our evidence to the low pay commission, calling for another real terms increase in the minimum wage.”</p> <p>Miliband then quoted further from Lord Freud, who added that he was looking at “whether there is something we can do if someone wants to work for £2 an hour”. Amid cries of “outrage” and “shame” from the Labour benches, Miliband said: “Surely someone holding those views can’t possibly stay in his government.”</p> <p>Cameron said: “Those are not the views of the government, they are not the views of anyone in the government. The minimum wage is paid to everybody, disabled people included.”</p> <p>With his voice rising in anger, the prime minister added: “Let me tell you: I don’t need lectures from anyone about looking after disabled people. So I don’t want to hear any more of that. We pay the minimum wage, we are reforming disability benefits, we want to help disabled people in our country, we want to help more of them into work. And instead of casting aspersions why doesn’t he get back to talking about the economy.”</p> <p>Miliband said: “I suggest, if he wants to protect the rights of disabled people, he reads very carefully what his welfare minister has said because they are not the words of someone who ought to be in charge of policy related to disabled people.</p> <p>“In the dog days of this government the Conservative party is going back to its worst instincts – unfunded tax cuts, hitting the poorest hardest, now undermining the minimum wage. The nasty party is back.”</p> <p>In the full text, released by the Labour party, Freud was quoted as saying: “You make a really good point about the disabled. Now I had not thought through, and we have not got a system for, you know, kind of going below the minimum wage.</p> <p>“But we do have … you know, universal credit is really useful for people with the fluctuating conditions who can do some work – go up and down – because they can earn and get … and get, you know, bolstered through universal credit, and they can move that amount up and down.</p> <p>“Now, there is a small … there is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…”</p> <p>Freud had been responding to a question from David Scott, a Tory councillor from Tunbridge Wells. Scott had said: “The other area I’m really concerned about is obviously the disabled. I have a number of mentally damaged individuals, who to be quite frank aren’t worth the minimum wage, but want to work. And we have been trying to support them in work, but you can’t find people who are willing to pay the minimum wage.</p> <p>“We had a young man who was keen to do gardening; now the only way we managed to get him to work was actually setting up a company for him, because as a director in a company we didn’t have to pay the minimum wage, we could actually give him the earnings from that. But trying to maintain his support and allow him to work, which he wanted to do, so to stay with benefits, and stay with some way of managing to continue on in that way. And I think yes, those are marginal areas but they are critical of actually keeping people who want to work supported in that process. And it’s how do you deal with those sort of cases?”</p> <p>After Freud’s response (above), there was this further exchange:</p> <p>Scott: “They particularly want to work because it does add so much to their lives…”</p> <p>Freud: “Yes.”</p> <p>Scott: “…Being able to do something. And being employed in a job gives them so much self-esteem, but nobody is willing to pay that minimum wage. And then we’re supporting them massively financially, but we also want them to work, for their own self-esteem and everything else.”</p> <p>The work and pensions minister, Esther McVey, told the Daily Politics on BBC2: “I cannot justify those comments. They were wrong. He will have to explain them.”</p> <p>Freud is likely to argue that the full exchanges at the fringe meeting show he was trying to help people with mental illness into the workplace. He is also likely to argue that he was suggesting that the universal credit system could help people with “fluctuating conditions”.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9644425","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2175992","internalContentCode":"449796903","internalRevision":"21","publication":"The

Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>If this were a fairer world, Lord Freud would never be facing calls for his resignation as welfare minister. He would not have been forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/15/prime-minister-david-cameron-lord-freud-apologise-disabled-people-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">into a public apology</a> after being caught musing insensitively about whether some disabled people “aren’t worth” the full minimum wage, and could make do with £2 an hour. He wouldn’t have gone to ground yesterday. All this would never have happened, because in an ideal world Freud would never have been a minister in the first place.</p> <p>His qualifications, as a former banker and journalist, for radically reforming the welfare state were admittedly something of a mystery even when Labour first hired him as an adviser to Downing Street back in 2006. But at least they had the sense not to unleash him on a nervous public. It was only when Freud <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/84832/Benefits-adviser-switches-to-Tories\" title=\"\">jumped ship to the Tories</a> three years later that he was made a shadow minister; and whatever his technical expertise, that’s when his clodhopping public manner became a problem. This is the man who, when asked how as a millionaire he could ever understand what it’s like to be on benefits, responded that “<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9698985/Lord-Freuds-welfare-lifestyle-comments-show-nasty-party-is-back-say-Labour.html\" title=\"\">you don’t have to be a corpse to go to the funeral</a>”. This week he very nearly dug his professional grave.</p> <p>Words matter in politics. They hurt people, and causes, and public confidence; they damage trust, or what trust many disabled people have left in the Department for Work and Pensions. The careless language Freud used revives particularly deep fears about having to constantly prove yourself to the prejudiced and ignorant; about whether some people secretly regard the disabled as second-class, somehow lacking in humanity.</p> <p>But that said, and with all due respect to his great grandfather Sigmund, this isn’t really a Freudian slip. It isn’t proof that deep down all Tories despise disabled people and yearn to see them destitute. Contrary to popular belief, politicians don’t generally destroy lives just for kicks. They make bad decisions most often when they won’t listen, or when they allow emotion and ideology to get the better of the evidence. Well, so do we all. Which is why a little more clear-headed examination of the facts here – and a little less screeching about how the party opposite eats babies – would come in handy.</p> <p>To recap: it all started with Tory councillor David Scott, the father of a severely disabled daughter, <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/106453/fresh_freudian_slip%3F.html\" title=\"\">asking Freud at a party conference fringe meeting</a> about people with learning disabilities (although the phrase he actually used was “mentally damaged”) who want to work but can’t get hired because they’re “to be frank not worth” the minimum wage. Those were clumsy words, which the minister shouldn’t have clumsily repeated. But it turns out the question wasn’t about how to get away with paying peanuts. It was about how the state should respond when that is already happening, quite legally.</p> <p>When tracked down by the BBC, Scott described the case of a young man who wants to be a gardener but takes hours longer than usual to finish a job. He is always going to struggle to compete with able-bodied gardeners, but what if he likes gardening and wants to do something purposeful and sociable with his days? So a company was set up for him to work as a self-employed gardener, and since the self-employed don’t get the minimum wage – well, bingo. What Scott was really asking Freud was how the gardener’s low earnings could be topped up by the state.</p> <p>There are glaring pitfalls to all this, obviously. It might work out fine with careful oversight, altruistic customers, and genuinely willing workers who couldn’t otherwise get jobs – which is presumably why some charities already run projects helping people with learning disabilities to start kitchen-table businesses. It would be disastrous if it meant unscrupulous people exploiting the vulnerable for cheap labour. The arguments are finely balanced, but what we’re really talking about is whether the state should subsidise self-employment – or in this case, something halfway between self-employment and therapy – for a minority who will never thrive in an open job market but still want to feel they’ve a role in life, a place in society.</p> <p>And there’s a faint echo here of a much bigger looming question about self-employment in general. Is it still a godsend for all sorts of people who don’t fit neatly into corporate boxes? Or is it increasingly becoming an ingeniously cheap way for corporate Britain to wriggle out of its responsibilities and cut the wage bill?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/11026632/Self-employed-workers-are-being-left-behind-under-David-Cameron.html\" title=\"\">One in six Britons is self-employed </a>now, which is the highest rate in 40 years. Obviously, they’re not all downtrodden and exploited; some are born entrepreneurs, busy hatching the household names of the future, or parents who went freelance for the joy of managing their time as they damn well please. Others just love being their own bosses, or are past retirement age but reluctant to stop work and rattle around empty houses. The lucky ones earn more than they ever did on the inside.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11045631/Self-employed-Youll-be-older-working-longer-and-for-less-pay.html\" title=\"\">self-employed wages have fallen by nearly a quarter</a> on average since the crash, and that’s partly because too many are the unlucky ones who aren’t here by choice. They are the ones forced to set up on their own after being made redundant, or because they can’t afford to retire, or because they work in professions that are systematically cutting costs by shedding permanent staff and then hiring talent on a casual basis – which neatly avoids having to pay for their pensions and perks. Which is why Labour is now actively thinking about strengthening the rights of the self-employed as the next big frontier.</p> <p>This might just be a temporary hangover from the recession, of course, a phenomenon that vanishes with the recovery. But what if it isn’t? What if companies start to solve the pressures on them, on a stagnant economy, by deciding that swathes of their staff are “not worth” what they cost to employ; and to hit on the obvious solution of nudging them into self-employment?</p> <p>Working for yourself can be gloriously liberating if you’re highly skilled, sticking two fingers up to the corporate rat-race. But if you’re scrabbling for work in a crowded market, watching your rates get driven down, it can be miserably insecure. There are an awful lot of people, some potentially quite vulnerable, now swaying up there on this particular high wire. Whether Lord Freud stays or goes, it’s time to think about a safety net.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9649772","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2177060","internalContentCode":"449937733","internalRevision":"9","publication":"The

Her appointment requires the approval of parliament, but the SNP’s majority at Holyrood would ensure that this is a formality.</p> <p>Launching her leadership bid a week after the referendum, Sturgeon said she accepted and respected that Scottish voters had voted to remain in the UK and promised to work “in good faith” with pro-union parties and the Smith commission, which will oversee the fast-tracked programme to draw up new tax and welfare powers for Scotland by January.</p> <p>Setting out the Scottish government’s submission to the Smith commission on Friday, which called for maximum devolution within the UK including full control over tax and fiscal policy, Sturgeon said: “This cannot be an attempt to win independence by the back door.”</p> <p>Following the close of nominations on Wednesday morning, Sturgeon described it as a “privilege” to have been chosen by the SNP to succeed Salmond.</p> <p>“Alex is a hard act to follow but I am determined to lead the SNP – and the country – from strength to strength.”</p> <p>Reiterating her determination to ensure that Holyrood secures the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/16/cameron-miliband-clegg-pledge-daily-record\" title=\"\">powers promised to Scotland by the pro-union parties </a>before the referendum, she said: “I will always make the case for Scotland to be an independent country, but with the Westminster parties already backsliding on the delivery of new powers, my immediate job will be to hold them firmly to account – and I am today putting them on notice that I intend to do just that.”</p> <p>Sturgeon also announced a speaking tour of cities across Scotland to rally the thousands of new members who have joined the SNP since the referendum on 18 September.</p> <p>The membership surge shows no sign of abating, with the total now at 84,000, making the SNP the third largest party in the UK.</p> <p>She said the tour would set the tone for her tenure as first minister. “I am looking forward to meeting as many of our new recruits as possible and sharing with them my vision for the future.</p> <p>“The tour of Scotland that I will undertake in the next few weeks also sets the template for the kind of first minister I want to be – open, accessible and determined to work with others across the political divide to find common cause and build a better country.</p> <p>“The hope, excitement and sense of opportunity of the referendum campaign did not end on polling day. It is alive, well and growing. This is a great time for Scotland and I look forward to leading my party and our country to even better times ahead.”</p> <p>As Sturgeon’s leadership was confirmed, Alex Salmond described his former deputy as “the outstanding politician of her generation in Scotland”.</p> <p>Speaking after a keynote address to the Scottish TUC’s conference in Glasgow, Salmond said: “She is absolutely ready for this role. She has outstanding ability, and she’ll be Scotland’s first female first minister, which is important.”</p> <p>Noting that the latest employment figures show a record number of women in the Scottish workplace, he added: “We’re moving towards Scandinavian levels of women’s participation in the workforce, so it’s entirely appropriate that we have three female leaders in the Scottish parliament. And it makes an effective contrast to Westminster.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9643486","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2175835","internalContentCode":"449782554","internalRevision":"31","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Sturgeon will replace Alex Salmond next month and will become Scotland’s first female first minister","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed as next leader of the SNP","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Libby Brooks, Scotland reporter","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-15T10:09:14.486+01:00","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413368409189/4f44cdb3-8c68-493d-bb87-8cb67e4b881d-140x84.jpeg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"543e38b7e4b0ebfb2a1bf19f","newspaperPageNumber":"24","internalStoryPackageCode":"81041","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-18T09:09:15Z","standfirst":"Sturgeon will replace Alex Salmond next month and will become Scotland’s first female first minister","linkText":"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed as next leader of the SNP","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-10-16T00:02:20.352+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-confirmed-snp-leader","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-confirmed-snp-leader","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/nicola-sturgeon","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/snp","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/alexsalmond","webTitle":"Alex Salmond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/alexsalmond","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/libbybrooks","webTitle":"Libby Brooks","rcsId":"GNL004689","r2ContributorId":"15986","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294301217/Libby-Brooks-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"brooks","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Libby Brooks is the Guardian's Scotland correspondent, based in Glasgow.

has said Labour should not rule out demanding changes to the European treaties necessary to bring about reforms in EU rules on the free movement of labour.</p> <p>His remarks go further than most members of the shadow cabinet in saying Labour must be willing to negotiate changes from Brussels to secure what he describes as the fair movement of workers within the European Union.</p> <p>Speaking at a Progress meeting at Westminster on Tuesday, he said: “Sometimes people talk as if free movement is a pillar of the 1957 treaty and therefore that cannot be debated and discussed, but it cannot be a free-for-all.”</p> <p>He stressed he thought some reforms could be achieved without treaty change but added: “In order to raise the qualification period for unemployment benefit above six months, something people feel strongly about, in order to stop people sending child benefit back to families overseas while living in our country you might need to have treaty change. I do not think we should say anything that requires treaty change should be off the agenda.”</p> <p>Balls argued that such treaty changes would not necessarily trigger a referendum in the UK under Labour policy since Labour is only committed to a referendum if there is a transfer of powers to Brussels.</p> <p>He said: “What I am talking about is managing our labour market in a way that people see as fair. I do think there are some big and difficult issues here about how you manage a union of 28. You cannot bury your head in the sand and say you can have a union of 28 countries and say you will have movement of people that is free and unfettered any more that you can have a market where goods flows freely without proper rules of the game or free movement of capital without that being sound and regulated.”</p> <p>He also stressed: “We cannot afford to turn away as a party from change or migration or turn the clock back – that is the Ukip position. But we have got to show it is not a free-for-all and that it is being managed.”</p> <p>He said the phrases “‘free movement, free market, free for all” made people feel like this was not in control.</p> <p>He added a precondition to voters listening to the party’s wider messages on the cost of living and the health service was a belief that it was tackling the issue of the deficit and immigration. He said: “If I want people in my constituency to believe Labour will deliver a free NHS and tackle the cost-of-living crises, there is a prior thing they also have got to need to know. That is that we are going to balance the books and that we will have tough and fair immigration controls. That is not to do with Ukip – that is just about persuading working people that we will respond to their priorities and what they are about.”</p> <p>He said he sensed the immigration debate – an issue of “huge concern” in his Morley and Outwood constituency – had shifted from ethnicity to economics. He said: “For people of working age it is about terms and conditions and for some people who tend to be a little older, it is about what is happening to society around them and the pace of change.</p> <p>“People want to know that when people come they will contribute and they will pay taxes. They are worried about the undercutting of wages, they are worried about the pressure on services. They think it is really important skilled workers come or people come to universities but they want the rules to be tough and fair. If people come to study they have to show they can pay for their courses, borders have got to be policed, we have got to check people in and out, the minimum wage must not be undercut, agency workers rules must not be abused.</p> <p>“I don’t think they want to leave the EU or to shut the borders at all, they don’t want a free-for-all. They want it to be fair and controlled. “We can win the argument on migration, but not if you won’t talk about it. If you say: ‘There are some issues too difficult and we are not going to talk about it. We don’t know the answers,’ then other people that peddle sophistry and simple answers have a clear field.”</p> <p>Although his willingness to countenance treaty change on the free movement of labour is new, his remarks would only take him beyond existing party policy if he started to talk about limits on unskilled labour from the EU, something Ed Miliband has not yet countenanced.</p> <p>The party has in the past discussed requiring companies to train a UK apprentice if it wished to employ a skilled EU migrant, but the policy was criticised by the business sector.</p> <p>Pressed on the unpopularity of the party leader, he said he believed Miliband would reveal himself in the TV debates, but stressed the party would be presenting as a team and the campaign would not be presidential. “The reality is that we don’t have a presidential system. We have a parliamentary democracy so the team is important,” he said.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9643350","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2175778","internalContentCode":"449772276","internalRevision":"80","publication":"The

The others are the recently taken seat of Clacton and the Labour seat of Great Grimsby.</p> <p>The figures also suggests there are a further 10 seats where Ukip is a good contender, including the Conservative seats of Great Yarmouth, Camborne and Redruth, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, Folkestone and Hythe, Thanet North, and Waveney, plus the Labour seats of Dudley North, and Rotherham. The Lib Dem seat of Eastleigh, and Rochester and Strood, the vacant seat of Tory-to-Ukip defector Mark Reckless, are also in this category.</p> <p>In a sign of how hard the Conservatives will fight Reckless for Rochester, David Cameron has this week written to all constituents in the seat offering them the chance to select one of two potential candidates. They are local councillors Anne Firth and Kelly Tolhurst. The byelection, it was announced on Tuesday, will be held on 20 November.</p> <p>A further 15 seats have been classified as areas where Ukip is in with a chance of winning in 2015, including the Heywood and Middleton seat where the party narrowly came second to Labour in last week’s byelection, and several Lib Dem southern coastal seats including Eastbourne and St Austell and Newquay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1413293305594/dataBlog_UKIP_done.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The analysis suggests Ukip still poses the biggest threat to Conservative-held seats, but several Labour and Lib Dem MPs cannot rest on their laurels.</p> <p>The biggest opportunities for Ukip appear to be in Boston and Thanet South, as two moderate Conservatives are stepping down in these constituencies, leaving them without incumbents. However, many MPs contesting Ukip in the tightest seats are still dismissive of the party’s prospects. Austin Mitchell, the retiring Labour incumbent in Great Grimbsy, said he would be horrified and astonished if Ukip’s candidate, Victoria Ayling, won in his seat. The longstanding MP, who some have mooted as a possible defector to Ukip, said: “Victoria is a good candidate and she works very hard but she won’t win. Grimsby is a Labour seat, it will stay a Labour seat and its interests lie with the Labour party. I don’t think Ukip is going to make any big impression. Their vote may go up, but so will Labour’s because we lost votes last time to the Liberals and that is coming back to us.”</p> <p>Jackie Doyle-Price, the Tory MP for Thurrock, argues that Ukip will help to drag her “over the line” in her re-election efforts, saying it will help to take working-class votes off Labour.</p> <p>Others in seats with strong Ukip support argue the threat is diminishing, not growing. Mike Thornton, the Lib Dem MP who narrowly fought off Ukip in the Eastleigh byelection of 2013, said his team had got better at responding to Farage’s party.</p> <p>“We didn’t expect it in the byelection and we didn’t again in the county council elections, but in the more recent borough elections they didn’t get a single seat. Now we know what their message is going to be better, we know where they are going to target and we know better how to counteract their message,” Thornton said.</p> <p>Because of the unpredictability of the fight, all the parties are braced for unexpected upsets. David Winnick, who has held the seat of Walsall North for Labour since 1979, is still ahead in his seat by five points, according to a survey by Lord Ashcroft, but the second party challenging him is now Ukip and not the Conservatives.</p> <p>“If it wasn’t for immigration, Ukip would be in a very different situation … but my view is that bread-and-butter issues, frozen wages, midwives on strike, the anger and resentment that undoubtedly exist, Ukip are exploiting it to say it is more or less all immigration. Labour’s job is to say: yes, immigration is a problem and we don’t underestimate it, but the anger and resentment, we’re trying to demonstrate that it is to a very large extent due to Tory policies.” There have been numerous attempts by academics, thinktanks and pollsters to classify the seats that Ukip is most likely to win, but many of its local surges so far have taken the other parties by surprise. Ukip itself has a target list of at least 12 seats and possibly up to 25, including more challenging options such as Aylesbury, the safe seat of Conservative Europe minister, David Lidington, where there is significant opposition to HS2.</p> <p>Farage’s party also has its eye on Portsmouth South, the seat of former Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock, who resigned over inappropriate advances to a female constituent.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9642075","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2175642","internalContentCode":"449743465","internalRevision":"128","publication":"The
