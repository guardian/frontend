José María Olazábal's Continental Europe team looked set to extend their overnight lead for much of the play but a sterling fightback started by Jamieson left the score at 5½ to 4½ heading into the weekend.</p><p>Paul Casey and Simon Khan had given Great Britain and Ireland a good start with a 3&amp;2 victory over Mikko Ilonen and Thorbjorn Olesen partly thanks to a brilliant rescue shot from Casey which left them three up after seven.</p><p>But the remaining four matches threatened to swing blue and Continental Europe restored their two-point advantage when Nicolas Colsaerts and Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño equalled the biggest winning margin in the tournament's history by recording a thumping 6&amp;5 success against Paul Lawrie and Stephen Gallacher.</p><p>Although Jamie Donaldson and Marc Warren once again reduced the deficit with a 4&amp;2 win over Thomas Bjorn and Miguel Ángel Jiménez, both remaining matches looked like going to Europe until a dramatic late twist.</p><p>Italians Francesco Molinari and Matteo Manassero looked to be sailing home against Jamieson and David Lynn as they held a two-stroke lead with two holes to play, but Jamieson's birdie on the 17th took it to the final hole, where he sank a six-foot birdie to steal victory.</p><p>In the final match of the day, Tommy Fleetwood and Chris Wood came up agonisingly short against Joost Luiten and Gregory Bourdy despite a brave fightback when all seemed lost. The Continental Europe pair were three up after 14 and two up with two to play, but Woods' eagle on the 17th ensured it would go down to the final hole.</p><p>Both Wood and Fleetwood had putts to win the final pin and halve the match, but Fleetwood's effort drifted wide from six feet, allowing Luiten and Bourdy to escape with a one-hole victory to restore Europe's narrow advantage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419108243|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|0db6e3c5fd8fa7c00eb58f79b0abc4c06aee86a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Given the role played by Rory McIlroy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/15/paul-mcginley-rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">Paul McGinley's appointment as the European Ryder Cup captain</a>, mutual appreciation is inevitable. When McGinley spoke about the &quot;flatlining&quot; form of Europe's most high-profile players, that was kind in the specific case of McIlroy. The former world No1 has endured a turbulent year both on the course and off it, where McIlroy's termination of a contract with his former management company was confirmed on Friday.</p><p>It remains inconceivable that McIlroy will not form part of McGinley's 12-man team at Gleneagles in a year's time, despite the captain's assertions that no player is guaranteed selection. For now, McGinley continues to assert his belief that McIlroy will return to his best before too long.</p><p>&quot;There hasn't been a player in the history of the game who has not gone through peaks and troughs,&quot; McGinley said. &quot;Rory has pretty much had a vertical upwards trajectory, so it was only a matter of time before he had a bit of a downward spiral. But there is no doubt he will come back up again.</p><p>&quot;All players go this way. Whether it be Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Tom Watson or Paul McGinley. We have all had peaks and troughs. The game is not a constant vertical climb. Rory has had a bit of a dip but he will come back.&quot;</p><p>When it was put to McGinley that this McIlroy trough has proved rather a deep one, the Dubliner was unmoved.</p><p>&quot;Tom Watson went through one,&quot; added McGinley. &quot;Jack Nicklaus had a long period of time between winning one major and the next. It comes and goes, as some people come out of it very quickly. Just look at Henrik Stenson.</p><p>&quot;Rory is such a good player and he has so much drive. He will not be sitting back on his laurels; he will be practising hard. It will come back and things in his head will just click into place.</p><p>&quot;I am nonchalant about the whole thing because I have seen it in so many careers.&quot;</p><p>McGinley's opposite number with the United States, Watson, has admitted his competitive playing days are nearing an end. The 64-year-old came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/19/clink-tom-watson-open-golf\" title=\"\">within touching distance of one of the greatest sporting triumphs of all time at the 2009 Open Championship</a> but, since then, has found tournament golf a tougher proposition.</p><p>&quot;The older you get the wiser you should become,&quot; Watson explained. &quot;There's an element of that in my case. I haven't played particularly well lately, which is a disappointment and continues to be a disappointment.</p><p>&quot;I see the horizon getting closer to the time when I'm going to have to hang it up. And I don't relish that fact. I don't like it, because this is what I do. I'm a professional golfer. But besides being a professional golfer, I'm other things and those things have probably become more important in my life.</p><p>&quot;As you well know, professional golfers can be pretty selfish and that attribute is pretty apparent in all the great players. The older you get the more you understand that there are things that are more important than just winning a golf tournament.</p><p>&quot;I don't know how I'm going to end my career. But I have to be honest with you, I've been thinking about it. It's getting closer and you have to prepare for the future.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418513190|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|70fced40e476d292b71c44375b379d5732ea52e2 -->",

        "headline":"Tom Watson would prefer 'purist' Ryder Cup with no captain's picks",
        "body":"<p>Tom Watson, the captain of the 2014 USA Ryder Cup team, believes the system of wildcard picks for the event should be scrapped in order to return it to its \"purist\" form.</p><p>Watson reduced the number of captain's selections from the four used by his immediate predecessor, Davis Love III, to three. Speaking alongside his European counterpart, Paul McGinley, at next year's host course, Watson expressed a wish to see all players qualify automatically.</p><p>\"If you really look at it, the purist form of Ryder Cup would be no picks, no captain's picks, 12 players who qualify,\" Watson said. \"That's the way I qualified for my first two Ryder Cups, or maybe three. All of them, you had 12 players and no picks. Maybe that's the way it should go back to.</p><p>\"I reduced my picks this year from four to three and was thinking actually two, because I wanted the players who are playing to get on the Ryder Cup team to have that as a goal. If they got there, then they have earned something very, very special. And maybe we should go back to no picks. It would also release the pressure on me as a captain to call up the players who were under consideration to say: 'You're out.' That's not a pleasant phone call to make.\"</p><p>McGinley, who has increased his picks from two to three, insisted it would be unrealistic for his team, whose players earn automatic qualification via both European and world points lists, with the split necessary because of the number of top players who are based in the United States.</p><p>\"That's not a conversation that I think we need to go into,\" McGinley said. \"I don't want to go down the road of even discussing that because it is not [comparing] apples with apples.\"</p><p>As the two captains marked one year to go until Europe defend the Ryder Cup, the eight-times major winner Watson also claimed criticism that he is too old to perform this role has been \"a bit unfair.\"</p><p>The 64-year-old Watson said: \"The players know that I have been there before. They know I will know exactly how they feel. I have the experience of being a Ryder Cup player and a Ryder Cup captain. If I were a player in my team, looking at me, I would say: 'He has that experience'.\"</p><p>During what was generally a lengthy session of mutual appreciation between the captains, Watson perhaps indulged in early mind games by insisting Europe are the clear favourites for the event on the basis of home advantage and form.</p><p>He has placed faith in the world No1, Tiger Woods, despite an indifferent Ryder Cup record. Watson was a notable public critic of Woods after scandal surrounding his personal life had emerged. Watson said in 2010 that Woods's actions were \"bad for our game\".</p><p>The USA captain did not hide the fact Woods \"hasn't played well\" in past Ryder Cups. Watson said: \"I haven't sat with Tiger privately for any length of time, but I'll have a sit down with him. I'll need to with everybody.</p><p>\"Davis Love said Tiger was a leader [in 2012], especially at the end when they lost. He really proved himself to be a leader and that's essential. Everyone looks up to Tiger and for him to be a leader is very important for our team.\" Watson shrugged off the three incidents this year in which Woods has been punished for on-course rules' infractions. \"Those were innocent, every one of them.\"</p><p>McGinley risked offending Colin Montgomerie and José María Olazábal by stating: \"Lady luck has shone at us in the right times at the last two Ryder Cups, there is no doubt about it, and we have been fortunate to come out on the right side.\"</p><p>McGinley, who confirmed he plans to name four vice-captains next summer, offered praise to the \"special\" Ian Poulter but denied any player is a certainty to feature at Gleneagles. \"There is nobody in my head of whom I am thinking: 'He is definitely in the team'.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418167877|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|53cc8cf4b6eae15cff05d8887501393d105eee0c -->",

        "headline":"Phil Mickelson to cut playing schedule by 25% to improve his chances",
        "body":"<p>Phil Mickelson plans to cut his schedule by a quarter next year after an inconsistent season, even though his three tournament wins in 2013 included his first Open Championship.</p><p>Mickelson secured a memorable victory in the Open at Muirfield in July, with his other successes coming at the Scottish Open and Phoenix Open. Yet after signing off with a tie for 12th at the Tour Championship in Atlanta, nine shots adrift of the winner Henrik Stenson, Mickelson explained his plan for improvement in 2014, which is also a Ryder Cup year.</p><p>\"It has been a really good year for me,\" he said. \"Culminating with the British Open win, the Phoenix Open win, the Scottish Open win in there. It's been a good year.</p><p>\"I've had some good things happen in my game. I've reached different levels of abilities with driving the ball. My short game has really come around to the level I expect it to be at. My putting has just been tremendous. I'm looking forward to next year. I think that, as I look back on this year, I had some great highs and I had some lows. I think that I don't play at my highest level every single week. I have kind of ups and downs and I'm a very emotional player.</p><p>\"I think that I'm going to have to factor that into some of my scheduling and maybe cut out 25% of my events in an effort to play at a high level when I do play, because I know that I'm not able to do it 25 weeks a year. Maybe I can do it 18 or 20, though.\"</p><p>Mickelson's comments bore a slight resemblance to those of his old adversary, Tiger Woods. The world No1 cited fatigue in Atlanta and admitted he, once again, will try to curtail his schedule as much as possible next year. Rory McIlroy did likewise for the year, albeit that move was widely criticised after the Northern Irishman's switch to new equipment. McIlroy has conceded he should have played more competitive golf at the start of the season.</p><p>One player who is relishing every chance he gets on the US PGA Tour is Jordan Spieth. The 20-year-old tied for second in the Tour Championship and is now 21st in the world rankings, a matter of months after starting to play regular top-level golf.</p><p>Spieth  will now join Mickelson, Woods <em>et al</em> as part of the United States team for next weekend's Presidents Cup.</p><p>\"Not only is he a great player but he's got a great demeanour,\" said Mickelson of Spieth. \"He is very easy to be around and very likeable. That adds a lot to the team room and adds a lot to him as a partner for whoever plays with him at the Presidents Cup.</p><p>\"I would think there's a good chance that a guy like Steve Stricker, who partnered with him in our little Wednesday match at East Lake, that they would spend some time together.</p><p>\"But whoever plays with Jordan has got a real treat because he can make a lot of birdies. He's exciting to play with. But he's just as enjoyable to be around.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418058097|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|eb43a686c49f6e5c2119a15a9c91fbcf91063b57 -->",

        "headline":"Henrik Stenson hits FedEx Cup jackpot to become first European winner",
        "body":"<p>Were golf a popularity contest, Henrik Stenson would never have slipped into the sport's obscurity in the first place. The fact that he did simply made success at East Lake, which was worth $11.44m (&pound;7.15m), all the sweeter for the Swede.</p><p>Two years ago Stenson had cause to wonder where it had all gone wrong while educated golfing observers were bemused by his slip outside the top 200 players in the world. Even in June, at the time of this year's Scottish Open, Stenson was 31st in those rankings.</p><p>On Monday morning Stenson should be confirmed as currently the fourth best golfer in the world. A place in the European Ryder Cup team for next year's meeting with the United States at Gleneagles is all but assured.</p><p>The level of congratulations bestowed on him for his triumph in Georgia illustrated the esteem Stenson is held in by fellow players and fans alike. Justin Rose was among those who hung around the 18th green to congratulate the first ever European winner of the FedEx Cup.</p><p>If success in both the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup confirmed Stenson's professional redemption, there was an unavoidable personal element to the 37-year-old claiming the most lucrative prize in golf, not to mention a Nike sponsorship deal.</p><p>Stenson, after all, was a high-profile victim of the Allen Stanford fraud scandal. He has always, understandably, been very reluctant to discuss any details and could never be classed anywhere near a poverty line but the received wisdom is that Stenson lost millions in savings and investments.</p><p>It can hardly be viewed as coincidence that his form took a quick tumble in the aftermath of that horrid affair. In proving that maybe karma does exist, Stenson is now having the time of his life as Stanford continues a life-long prison sentence.</p><p>&quot;It just shows you should never give up, keep trying hard and good things will happen,&quot; said Stenson. &quot;I have come back from slumps twice in my career.&quot;</p><p>He offered typical humour to describe precision bunker shots on the 71st and 72nd holes. &quot;I used to live in Dubai. My sand game is quite good.&quot;</p><p>Starting from a position of three clear of the field on Sunday, some Stenson nerves would have been fully understandable. There was little sign of that at all, however, as he reached the turn in one under par. By the time he sauntered on to the 18th tee, Stenson held a three-shot lead which ultimately proved his margin of victory over Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth. Stenson did not display any of his heroics of the opening three days in signing off with a 68. He did not have to.</p><p>&quot;My first two and a half rounds were incredible, really, tee to green,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;It was tougher out there today but I managed to hang in.&quot;</p><p>For Spieth, the rapid rise to the summit of world golf continues apace. He had a fourth-round 64 at East Lake to endorse further his status as the brightest young talent in the game. &quot;It has been a dream come true,&quot; admitted the 20-year-old Spieth.</p><p>The lingering image of Tiger Woods from East Lake was not related to on-course brilliance but instead the world No1's two young children greeting him after the completion of round four. The appearance of Charlie and Sam at events Woods plays in has become a more regular feature this year than ever before.</p><p>&quot;That's what life's all about,&quot; said Woods. &quot;There are more important things in life than hitting a little round ball and putting it in a gopher hole.&quot;</p><p>Woods finished level par at the Tour Championship, thereby failing to add to his five wins in 2013. Those earlier successes, it seems, have left him with a perfectly content state of mind.</p><p>&quot;I'm very satisfied,&quot; he added. &quot;I had a number of chances to win some tournaments. I won five, which is, I think, a pretty good year.&quot;</p><p>Woods also spoke of how happy he was for Stenson. He was far from alone. Sometimes the biggest prizes do go to those who fully deserve them.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417982958|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|2fcdeaed3ce3645670d3a7bd76a3fe88cc223437 -->",

        "headline":"Bobby Jones can rest in peace after East Lake's remarkable renaissance",
        "body":"<p>East Lake will forever be synonymous with the legendary Bobby Jones. Images of him adorn the Tudor clubhouse walls and remnants of his glorious career are on display in cabinets offering a glance back to the time when a golfing icon regarded this club as his home.</p><p>In the years following Jones's death the East Lake area of Atlanta, Georgia and its eponymous golf club earned a reputation of another kind entirely, an unwanted one which only determination and significant financial intervention was able to turn around.</p><p>As East Lake golf club slipped into a state of disrepair, so too did the adjacent community. By the early 1990s the club was up for sale on the orders of a court after its owners tumbled into financial trouble. The East Lake district was a no-go zone even for police officers; with a crime rate 18 times the national average, this was one of the most dangerous areas in the United States. Employment stood at 13.5%, only four per cent of families earned incomes over the poverty line, 59% of adults relied on welfare, and educational achievement was close to non-existent.</p><p>Enter Tom Cousins. Now 81 and once a first-hand student of Jones's brilliance, the businessman bought the club in 1995 and immediately set about breathing fresh life into the historic venue and the area in which it stands. The results have been stunning, fuelled by the East Lake Foundation which Cousins set up as the vehicle for change.</p><p>Today East Lake bears all the hallmarks of a thriving community. Violent crime has been reduced by 95% in 18 years, a mere five per cent of adults rely on welfare while the Drew Charter school is both over-subscribed and produces results which exceed state averages. From the 2nd fairway the shell of a new high school which will open next year is visible.</p><p>Golf, so often maligned on account of the routine riches available at the top level, has played a huge part in East Lake's rebirth. The link between course and community has been perfectly restored, to mutual benefit.</p><p>The PGA Tour approached Cousins on hearing of his East Lake takeover, with an initial view to bringing a lower-tier event to the course. &quot;I told them if we ever have a golf tournament here, it ain't going to be the second rank,&quot; Cousins recalls. Now, the highly lucrative FedEx play-off series, complete with $10m (&pound;6.25m) prize, culminates at a venue which has been completely revived from a crumbling wreck in genuine danger of being turned into something other than a golf course.</p><p>The Tour has bestowed more than $13m on the foundation since the Tour Championship arrived here in 1998. All members of the club make a contribution too, with the corporate element obliged to hand over $200,000 up front to Cousins' charity. Two PGA Tour players, Stewart Cink and Billy Andrade, host an annual invitational event here with proceeds, once again, diverted towards the East Lake Foundation.</p><p>&quot;The sponsors and individual members of the golf club all support the East Lake Foundation,&quot; explains Danny Shoy, the foundation's chief executive.</p><p>&quot;The members make that contribution as soon as they join the club and beyond that any revenue generated by the members using the club goes towards the work of the foundation. Each time the club adds a new member the foundation benefits.</p><p>&quot;Tom Cousins saw the club as an opportunity to anchor the revitalisation of the community. The club really had its heyday in the community in the 1920s. By the 1980s there was a massive increase in drug use in the area and a rapid upsurge in violent crime here. The decline of the club had happened before the general community but they were both in a bad way.</p><p>&quot;Our work continues, we have to continue to tell our story to break the cycle of poverty. For us that means working with young people and their families to give them the best chances.&quot;</p><p>This chain of events is already being mirrored in other parts of the United States. And, as anyone in attendance this week at East Lake will testify, with very good reason.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417972104|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|5484f8573ac2d8759273aded70f8a598cdf8282d -->",

        "headline":"Henrik Stenson marches towards FedEx glory despite late wobble",
        "body":"<p>A one-time Henrik Stenson procession regressed into a commanding lead. For much of Saturday, the Tour Championship looked a closely fought contest without Stenson as part of the narrative. The Swede had produced the most impressive performance in the history of this FedEx playoff finale, reducing the other 29 players in the East Lake field to the role of also-rans, before a finish which at last offered a glimpse of fallibility. Suddenly, it was reasonable to ask if the most wounding slip of Stenson's erratic career could arrive in the outskirts of Atlanta.</p><p>By close of play, Stenson held a four-shot lead. Notably, though, he dropped two shots in his closing three holes. Only a terrific par save from 15ft on the 17th prevented Stenson from sliding further back towards the pack. Heavy rain checked Stenson's otherwise imperious form; thankfully for the tournament's organisers, adjusted and early third round tee times prevented any storm delays.</p><p>Bookmakers priced Stenson at 50-1 on as he cantered into a nine shot lead half way through his third round. Perhaps only the mind-boggling thought of what difference the $11.44m cheque for winning both the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup would make to his still holds danger for Stenson. Or, on this evidence, more inclement weather.</p><p>Background statistics illustrate just how dominant Stenson had been until his wobble over the closing stretch  on Saturday. They also highlight the improbability of any player preventing Stenson from becoming the first European player to win the FedEx Cup and, with it, a massive pay out. Stenson has played East Lake's front nine in 30, 31 and 31 respectively over the first three days. A similar start on Sunday and there would be little point in Stenson even taking to the closing half.</p><p>Dustin Johnson has emerged as the strongest threat to the Swede. The big-hitting Johnson defied horrible conditions in returning a 67 that owed as much to finesse as typically powerful play from the tee. Unlike Stenson, Johnson heads into round four with nothing to lose and absolutely everything to gain. It is also in his nature to be aggressive, which could unnerve his Swedish playing partner.</p><p>Sympathy is due towards Adam Scott, who had earliertried manfully to keep pace with Stenson. The Masters champion had to be was placed on an intravenous drip before taking to the course, as he suffered from a heavy fever. Scott understandably slumped to 74, within which he and is due immense credit for playing the back nine at all, let alone in under par.</p><p>Few could grudge Stenson his glory, should it arrive on Sunday evening. In two separate spells, the popular and wonderfully charismatic 37-year-old has endured on-course slumps which completely contradict his level of talent. It is nonsensical that Stenson should be placed outside the top 10 golfers in the world when, in reality, he sat 230th just two years ago.</p><p>Stenson was also a high-profile victim of the Stanford Financial Group collapse, which led the golfer to lose millions in investments and savings. If Stenson lifts the FedEx trophy aloft, he would be entitled a mental glance towards the disgraced Allen Stanford, who was sentenced to 110 years in prison last March.</p><p>Tiger Woods will not launch a legitimate challenge to Stenson despite a third round 69. The world No1 sits three over for the tournament in hinting once again that East Lake is a course which does not really fit his eye.</p><p>Woods offered subsequent hope to the tournament leader. \"This is a great golf course to protect a lead on because there's really not that much danger,\" Woods said. \"You can make a bunch of pars. It's one of those golf courses where it's so easy to shoot 68 to 72.</p><p>\"It's not a surprise where Henrik is because of the way he has been playing, really from the British [sic] Open on. He has been playing consistently well so it's not surprising he's out in front. I played with him that first day here, where through five holes he never missed a shot. I think he has basically continued playing well.\"</p><p>Luke Donald, who is in the midst of changes to his swing, carded a 67 to move within the top 10. Justin Rose, however, could not quite deliver on his promise of the first two days and signed for 70 to remain four under.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417925159|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|bb1b6f92b756e2751cae98b00caad5f37f7458f1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sunnylands, the setting for the Xi-Obama summit under way this weekend, bills itself as a magnet for famous golf lovers: Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra and no fewer than four presidents (Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr) have teed off there.</p><p>Obama is known to be partial to 18 holes, but golf enthusiasts should not expect to see him take on Xi Jinping. Chinese leaders have been pictured kicking soccer balls (Xi) and playing basketball (former premier Wen Jiabao); it is practically <em>de rigueur</em> for them to pick up a table-tennis bat or proclaim their love of swimming (not surprising, since Chairman Mao would take to the water when he wanted to demonstrate his vigour). But golf is definitely not on the list of approved sports for the Chinese leadership to be seen playing in public.</p><p>The first and last high-profile golfer was Zhao Ziyang – the general secretary toppled for his sympathy towards the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p><p>A photograph in his secretly recorded memoirs shows him chipping a ball into a net in his courtyard home during his house arrest, which lasted until his death - although he was occasionally allowed out to play, surrounded by guards.</p><p>Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney,  suggests the association with Zhao, and its archetypally American image, may have helped to give the sport \"a certain negative flavour\".</p><p>It had already been banned as a bourgeois indulgence during the cultural revolution and courses were dug up, not to re-emerge until the mid-80s.</p><p>But they flourished as the economy boomed, and in 2004 China banned the creation of more courses because of concerns about the declining amount of farmland and water usage. It had little effect: the number is believed to have soared from under 200 that year to around 600.</p><p>Thanks to such illicit openings, and its popularity with China's elite, golf has also become associated with inequality, the excesses of the rich and rampant corruption.</p><p>When China's new anti-corruption chief said last week that discipline and supervision staff should return any prepaid membership cards they had been given, observers were quick to draw the link with golfing.</p><p>\"Many officials' salaries cannot afford expenses at high-end places, such as golf clubs, but they often consume in those places with membership cards,\" Zhu Lijia, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance, told China  Daily. </p><p>A 2008 survey by KPMG found the average cost of joining a Chinese club was $53,000: several times the modest annual salary of even a high level official.</p><p>Will the game ever become respectable? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/guan-tianlang\">The emergence of teenage prodigy Guan Tianliang</a> has probably helped to improve its image, as has the news that it will return to the Olympics in 2016. But a photo of Xi lifting a club would still be something of a surprise</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410375744|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|81a57ae2c2e253a47c8749df48f2aa4c11a6e750 -->",

        "body":"<p>The hallowed fairways of Augusta National, the home of golf's annual Masters tournament, are being opened up to women for the first time, ending an increasingly controversial and anachronistic ban on female membership which had survived for 80 years.</p><p>Bowing to the not-so-modern concept of gender equality, the club announced on Monday it had invited two female members to join the club: former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore. </p><p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" club chairman Billy Payne said in a statement. \"We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for membership at Augusta National. Consideration with regard to any candidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and Darla was no different.</p><p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne continued. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall.\"</p><p>In a statement released by the club, Rice, who served in George Bush's administration, said she looked forward to \"playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity\".</p><p>Moore, the vice-president of private investment firm Rainwater, said being asked to join the Augusta National represented \"a very happy and important occasion in my life\".</p><p>The announcement marks the end of a rearguard action by Payne and the Augusta leadership against the march of sexual equality. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/04/masters-2012\">As recently as the last Masters tournament in April, Payne had reaffirmed the all-male policy</a>.</p><p>After successfully fending off demands to admit women members, the club faced intense scrutiny this year following the appointment of Ginni Rometty as IBM's chief executive officer. IBM is a major sponsor of the Masters, and Rometty's four predecessors had been invited to become members of the club. However, no such invitation was issued to Rometty.</p><p>In the ensuing controversy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/06/augusta-national-golf-club-women-members\">Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney joined the calls</a> for Augusta to abandon its men-only rule.</p><p>Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organisations, who has led the campaign for the club to admit women since 2002, said she was delighted at the news, but added that her invitation to join had yet to arrive. </p><p>\"I am very pleased. The woman's movement has prevailed,\" she said. \"It took a decade, but we did it. It is definitely a vindication.\"</p><p>She added: \"If I get an invite I will accept, absolutely.\"</p><p>Burk had repeatedly clashed with then Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson, who defended the policy even when it meant losing television sponsorship. Corporate sponsors, unnerved by the controversy over sexism, pulled out of the 2003 and 2004 Masters tournaments.</p><p>Before stepping down in 2006, Johnson conceded that Augusta National might one day have a woman in a green jacket, \"but not at the point of a bayonet.\" It became a battle cry for stubborn male members.</p><p>Although under the previous policy women were prohibited from gaining membership, they were allowed onto the course as guests.</p><p>It should not be surprising that Augusta National has taken so long to fall in line with the rest of society. The club, which opened in in December 1932, only accepted its first black member in 1990.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394966913|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|6258bc91b8f0365fcce7591d787a4b2f8b469ad4 -->",

That would be four years after the 2003 Masters, when Burk's protest in a grass lot down the street from the club attracted only about 30 supporters, and one year after Payne became chairman.</p><p>Moore and Johnson are close friends, both with roots in South Carolina and banking, and the person said Payne and Johnson agreed on the timing of a female member. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the club typically does not discuss membership issues, said it was important to Payne to be respectful of the membership process. The person said prospective members often are not aware they are being considered.</p><p>Augusta National, which opened in December 1932 and did not have a black member until 1990, is believed to have about 300 members. While the club until now had no female members, women were allowed to play the golf course as guests, including on the Sunday before the Masters week began in April.</p><p>The issue of female membership resurfaced again this year after Virginia Rometty was appointed chief executive of IBM, one of the Masters' corporate sponsors. The previous four CEOs of Big Blue had all been Augusta National members, leading to speculation that the club would break at least one tradition – membership for the top executive of IBM or a men-only club.</p><p>Rometty was seen at the Masters on the final day wearing a pink jacket, not a green one. She was not announced as one of the newest members.</p><p>Moore, 58, first rose to prominence in the 1980s with Chemical Bank, where she became the highest-paid woman in the banking industry. She is vice president of Rainwater, a private investment company founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. She was the first woman to be profiled on the cover of Fortune Magazine, and she made a $25 million contribution to her alma mater, South Carolina, which renamed its business school after her.</p><p>Moore was mentioned as a possible Augusta National member during the height of the all-male membership debate in 2002. She and Johnson worked on South Carolina's $300 million capital campaign in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"Augusta National has always captured my imagination, and is one of the most magically beautiful places anywhere in the world, as everyone gets to see during the Masters each April,\" Moore said. \"I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life.</p><p>\"Above all, Augusta National and the Masters Tournaments have always stood for excellence, and that is what is so important to me.\"</p><p>Rice, 57, was the national security adviser under former President George W. Bush and became secretary of state in his second term. The first black woman to be a Stanford provost in 1993, she now is a professor of political economy at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.</p><p>\"I have visited Augusta National on several occasions and look forward to playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity,\" Rice said in a statement released by the club. \"I have long admired the important role Augusta National has played in the traditions and history of golf. I also have an immense respect for the Masters Tournament and its commitment to grow the game of golf, particularly with youth, here in the United States and throughout the world.\"</p><p>Rice recently was appointed to the US Golf Association's nominating committee.</p><p>Johnson regarded the membership debate as infringing on the rights of a private club, even though every April it hosts the Masters, the most popular of the four major championships, which brings in millions of dollars through television rights for the highest-rated telecast in golf.</p><p>In a 2002 interview with the Associated Press, Johnson said the makeup of the club was more about four members-only parties each year than who plays the course.</p><p>\"Our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that's served us well for so long, that it makes it difficult for us to consider change,\" he said. \"A woman may be a member of this club one day, but that is out in the future.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394959069|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ba8337be4a41bcca70a42f97a540b019cc30419c -->",

Environmentalists have opposed the development, built across a stretch of stunning land overlooking the North Sea near Balmedie in Aberdeeenshire, because of its proximity to protected sand dunes. </p><p>But Trump dismissed the concerns when he teed off with a rather unimpressive shot. </p><p>The opening came three years later than planned, delayed by a public inquiry and official wrangling. Plans for a clubhouse, hotel and villas are on hold.

        "headline":"Tiger Woods' hopes for comeback overshadowed by ex-coach's memoir",
        "body":"<p>When Tiger Woods tees off in the first round of the Masters in Augusta on Thursday, millions of golf fans will be wondering if the former world No&nbsp;1 can bring off one of the greatest comeback stories in professional sport.</p><p>After winning his first tournament in two-and-a-half years last month, Woods appears set finally to put the turmoil of his life and career behind him since details first emerged of his repeated extramarital dalliances.</p><p>\"Americans love second chances and stories of redemption. Most golf fans are very eager to have him back,\" said Orin Starn, a professor of cultural anthropology at  Duke University in North Carolina and author of <em>The Passion of Tiger Woods. \"</em>Like him or hate him, he has provided spectacular drama.\"</p><p>But, like most things in Woods's career since a night-time car accident in Florida first hinted at problems in his domestic life, the path to redemption is still not entirely smooth. Last week Woods's camp reacted with fury to the publication of a tell-all book, <em>The Big Miss,</em> by his former swing coach Hank Haney.</p><p>Haney's book did not contain too many surprises, especially around the string of mistresses who turned the golfer from admired family man to tabloid fodder.</p><p>Instead it just confirmed a portrait of a Woods that most people already thought they knew: hyper-focused, unemotional and self-absorbed. But Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, issued a slamming statement anyway. \"Haney admits he never had in-depth, personal discussions with Tiger. This self-serving book is full of guesses and false assumptions,\" he said.</p><p>When a journalist asked the fitness-obsessed Woods recently about the book's claim that – in reaction to his personal crises – he had considered giving up golf and joining the elite Navy Seals, Woods got into a terse exchange with the reporter that included him saying: \"You're a beauty, you know that?\" Woods faces another press conference on Tuesday in Augusta.</p><p>More recently pictures of an unsmiling Woods signing autographs showed that his ability to relate comfortably to his public might still need a little polishing. \"He looked like a resentful killer robot signing autographs. He still had that imperious stare. After everything that has changed in his life he is still the same old Tiger Woods,\" said Starn.</p><p>But now there is another blast from the past: Woods is the bookies' favourite for the Masters, one of golf's four major championships. For many observers that matters more to the rehabilitation than any of his still icy behaviour or fresh revelations about his past. In the end Woods and golf – like any sport and its major star – is a business that is all about money and success. An on-form Woods playing at the Masters is already a talking point. If he were to look like winning, then TV ratings for the tournament would go through the roof. It could also mean a bonanza for Woods as advertisers, who abandoned the star in the wake of his fall from grace, might be tempted to flock back with endorsement offers. \"That tide might shift totally after next weekend. If he is in contention to win it, then it will be a huge event,\" said Frank Shorr, the director of the Sports Institute at Boston University.</p><p>But even if Woods does triumph in Augusta – a tournament that he has won four times, but not since 2005 – he will still be a very different figure from the pre-scandal sporting hero. He had always been held up as a family man with the perfect marriage, mixing that with a turbo-charged  style that saw him dominate his sport. That is never coming back.  After an expensive divorce, therapeutic counselling and changes in both caddies and coaches, Woods is rising back to the top of his sport. But there is also a sense that many of the golfing public in America are ready to back him again.</p><p>\"I am sure he will be re-embraced by corporate America. But it will be a different Tiger Woods. It will not be the family man, straight-arrow role model,\" said Starn.</p><p>It is, of course, hard to tell if Woods will care too much. Haney's book repeatedly describes a man whose emotions and thoughts are impossible to read, even for someone who spent six years as a close companion and teacher. \"Whether with friends, business associates, other players, his mother or his wife… he seemed to keep the atmosphere around him emotionally arid,\" Haney wrote.</p><p>Which is something that sounds familiar to any serious follower of Woods's career: the more it has changed the more he has stayed the same.</p><p>His intense, blank expression does not seem to shift. \"He has gone through so many life changes, but when you see him from the outside it is very hard to tell,\" said Shorr.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388117450|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|4c0852f5aeb5f61c47063b8bc36aa23346e401e6 -->",

        "headline":"Seve Ballesteros remembered by Gary Lineker",
        "body":"<p>My mum fancied Seve Ballesteros to death. It was the only time she'd ever watch golf, if Seve was playing. She thought he was gorgeous.</p><p>When I was a boy he was one of my heroes. He wasn't a conventional golfer – all fairways and greens and cautious play. Rather he was a swashbuckler. He had huge charisma. Whatever position he was in he'd somehow conjure up a magical shot to get out of it.</p><p>I first met him in 1999, playing in a pro-am tournament at Woburn before the British Masters. I remember seeing in the draw that I was playing with Seve; I had about 50 people asking if they could caddie for me, which was wholly unusual. Seve was in great form. Not necessarily in terms of his game – Woburn is a tight course, and Seve is pretty wild off the tee; he was forever in the trees. He still hit some incredible shots. He holed a putt that twisted left and right and up and down before dropping in. A monster shot, and he gave one of his typical celebrations – the big smile and fist pump. The celebration wasn't quite on a par with winning his first British Open, in 1979 in his famous blue jumper, but it wasn't far off.</p><p>I was fortunate to spend a lot of time in his company that day, and latterly I worked with him a number of times through the BBC. I wouldn't presume to claim Seve as a mate, but we got on well. He was a big Barcelona fan  and would always want to talk about football while I would always want to talk about golf.</p><p>He was ill for a long time, having been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. It was a constant source of conversation in the game: how's Seve? People were worried about him. At big tournaments, especially the Ryder Cup, there was always an atmosphere, a feeling, a thought towards Seve. It was a difficult time in the game, especially, I imagine, for players who'd played with him, and his close friends, the Spanish guys, José María Olazábal in particular, after that amazing partnership he and Seve had in Ryder Cups over the years.</p><p>After he died, in May, we made a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012lt4d\" title=\"\">tribute film</a> at the BBC. It was great to see new footage of him, and to hear all the stories about him, particularly from his caddies. He was so fiercely competitive, and always, perhaps, quick to blame the caddy – as most golfers are. Always better to blame someone else because confidence is everything in sport. But I think the caddies had a pretty tough time with him; that was something I hadn't realised before, that he could be difficult to work with.</p><p>But there were some terrific stories about him. There was once a kid at the side of the green, making noise, and Seve turned to him to say something like: \"You're nervous? You don't think I am?\" I thought that summed him up. It was a chastisement but done with great charm, great humour. That was Seve.</p><p>I spoke to him on a few occasions before his death. I interviewed him on the phone for the BBC a couple of years ago about his illness. He wanted to raise awareness about brain cancer, and it was a very emotional interview. He spoke deeply about what he was going through, the mental sides of his disease. There were a couple of times when I struggled to speak. Later I called him in the hope that he might be able to come over to receive the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/8405808.stm\" title=\"\">lifetime achievement award</a> at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. He was too ill to fly.
