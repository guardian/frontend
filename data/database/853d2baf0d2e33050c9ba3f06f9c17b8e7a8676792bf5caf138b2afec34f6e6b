        "body":"<p>When Observer architecture critic Rowan Moore wrote about his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/dec/02/london-high-rise-craze-ruins-skyline\">concerns about London's tall building construction free-for-all</a> in the New Review, the impassioned responses from readers made fascinating reading. Is the capital's rash of new skyscrapers the result of lazy, unimaginative designs waved through by council planners for political and commercial gain? Or do high buildings bring a sense of ambition to a city's idea of itself &ndash; and provide desperately needed space on the vertical plane? The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We'd like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings &shy;&ndash; the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are. Share your images using GuardianWitness &ndash; and if you get them to us before 10am on Friday 18th, the best will be published on the Guardian site.</p> <p>Closes 5pm Wednesday 24 April 2013.</p> <p><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.

It has also opened up a whole new world for those outside of newsrooms to tell their stories.</p><p>We believe that journalism gets stronger when these worlds collaborate. This is open journalism.</p><p>Today, in partnership with EE, we launch <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> – a new platform that takes the Guardian another step further on this open journalism journey. </p><p>Of course working with you, our readers, is something that the Guardian has always been proud to do.</p><p>We are lucky to have amazing communities that come to our site to share their passions and interests. From politics to poetry our community members regularly work with us to bring additional insight and depth to our coverage. </p><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greenland\">Greenland</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, West Africa's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guinea-bissau\">Guinea-Bissau</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tuvalu\">Tuvalu</a> in the Pacific, over the past year Guardian readers have accessed our site from almost every country in the world. Working together with our journalists - from picture and multimedia editors to correspondents and columnists - together we can help bring stories to light from across the globe.</p><p>In recent years alone, you have been involved in some of the biggest news stories of the age: helping us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/mps-expenses\">review MPs' expense claims</a>; providing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">eyewitness accounts of the Arab Spring</a>; unpicking<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarah-palin-emails\"> Sarah Palin's emails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\">covering</a> – and later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">understanding</a> - the UK riots.</p><p>When police told us that there was nothing suspicious about the death of the newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson, it was a reader that sent us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/07/ian-tomlinson-g20-death-video\">a video which clearly showed a police officer knocking Tomlinson to the ground</a>. When we started to investigate unfair Government work schemes, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/12/poundland-ruling-government-work-schemes\">Cait Reilly submitted her story</a> and subsequently challenged the Government's workfare scheme in court.</p><p>You have helped us tell <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/series/breadline-britain\">the human story of public spending cuts</a> with heartfelt and emotional personal stories, added depth and insight to our culture site's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/music+tone/albumreview\">album</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/series/reader-reviews-roundup\">book reviews</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/culture+tone/q-and-as\">quizzed actors, authors, musicians, dancers and artists</a> to find out exactly what makes them tick, and created our own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/series/not-the-booker-prize\">alternative to the Booker prize</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness platform</a>, and supporting <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/guardianwitness/id587343125?mt=8\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian.witness&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5ndWFyZGlhbi53aXRuZXNzIl0\">Android apps</a> will help us to carry on this tradition.

        "body":"<p>When Observer architecture critic Rowan Moore wrote about his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/dec/02/london-high-rise-craze-ruins-skyline\">concerns about London's tall building construction free-for-all</a> in the New Review, the impassioned responses from readers made fascinating reading. Is the capital's rash of new skyscrapers the result of lazy, unimaginative designs waved through by council planners for political and commercial gain? Or do high buildings bring a sense of ambition to a city's idea of itself &ndash; and provide desperately needed space on the vertical plane? The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We'd like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings &shy;&ndash; the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are. Share your images using GuardianWitness &ndash; and if you get them to us before 10am on Friday 18th, the best will be published on the Guardian site.</p> <p>Closes 5pm Wednesday 24 April 2013.</p> <p><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.

Have your local public services that you use had to close, such as libraries or sports facilities? Can you no longer afford to take your children for days out, or pay for school trips? We're asking for images of the things you've had to stop doing, to get an idea of how the government cuts are challenging daily life. Perhaps you could send us an image of a shop that you can no longer afford to go to, or a journey you have stopped taking, or something you're making do with because you can't afford to replace it.</p> <p>Send us your images using GuardianWitness and help us build a more comprehensive picture of life under the cuts.

        "body":"<p>Hello and welcome to the GuardianWitness guide to video. Over the next few months we&rsquo;ll be giving you some tips so you can improve your video, whether you&rsquo;re using an iPhone, a DSLR with all the bells and whistles, or anything in between.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ll also be setting a range of assignments, from rough and ready point-and-shoots that require zero editing, to requests for slightly more polished efforts.</p> <p>There should be something for everyone, no matter how skilled you are (or aren&rsquo;t) with a camera.</p> <p>Light is the topic for our first tutorial. How you see light and how you choose to record it is fundamental to shooting good video, and you certainly don&rsquo;t need a fancy camera to have a go. Your eyes are much more important than your kit for this exercise.</p> <p>As the series continues, someone from the Guardian will be on-hand to offer some constructive criticism after each assignment, and to highlight the best responses.</p> <p>We&rsquo;re also hoping you will let us know if there&rsquo;s a topic you&rsquo;d like to see covered or if there are other issues you think we should be addressing.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s an option in the <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> app to &lsquo;Send us an assignment idea&rsquo; for you to do just that, and we&rsquo;ll open comments here once we&rsquo;ve got some videos from you.</p> <p>So without any further ado, take a look at our first episode, then get outside with your camera and show us what you&rsquo;ve got!</p> <p>Closes 1pm Tuesday 30 April 2013.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others.
