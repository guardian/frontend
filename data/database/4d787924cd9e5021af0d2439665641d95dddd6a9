        "body":"<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine got married. To do this, she moved to London from Germany, leaving behind her friends, her family – and her job. She wasn't too worried about this: she'd built up more than a decade of experience and achievements. She could speak perfect English. She'd miss her family but financially, she'd be fine.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, London had other ideas. She went to interview after interview. They all ended in rejection.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she went to an interview where she was asked some odd questions. She was asked which part of London she lived in. She was asked what her husband did. And finally the interviewer just came out with it: \"Look, your husband is obviously doing quite well for himself, you've just got married, why do you even want a job?\"</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, that question contained the sexist (not to mention economically antiquated) idea that women just work for pin money. But it also hinted at another issue: the issue of babies. The issue of maternity leave. The issue of \"why should I hire you when you'll probably just end up costing me thousands of pounds in wasted pay a few months down the line?\"</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2013/11/04/government-launches-pregnancy-discrimination-investigation/\" title=\"\">European court of human rights has just been given £1m</a> by Maria Miller, the minister for women and equalities, to investigate just how bad this situation is. This follows on from a damning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/mar/09/women-on-maternity-leave-illegal-discrimation\" title=\"\">Slater &amp; Gordon poll</a> showing that many women were returning from maternity leave to worse jobs – or sometimes no job at all.</p><p></p><p>Research into this area is of course welcome. But I can't help but feel that we are ignoring the most obvious reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/04/review-pregnancy-discrimination-work\" title=\"\">women are discriminated against in this way</a>. The issue is at heart incredibly simple: it's about money.</p><p></p><p>Women from the age of 30 to 45 are viewed with suspicion and seen as a liability. They are a fecund cost waiting to happen. So why, these companies think, should we take the risk on this well-qualified woman, when we can place a safe bet on this man. He might not be as effective at the job, but at least he'll be around in six months' time. And so the cycle continues, with brilliant women floundering in their careers, overtaken by men not as a result of merit, but as a result of a shrewd cost decision. And perhaps the most irritating thing about this cycle is how easy it is to fix.</p><p></p><p>It is currently enshrined in law that women are the primary care-givers. Women get 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional maternity leave. Men get one or two weeks of ordinary paternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional paternity leave. There is no reason for this disparity, beyond a traditional notion that women are somehow more innately qualified than men to bring up children.</p><p></p><p>It's great that the government is finally sitting up and taking notice of this problem. It's great that it is seeing that legislating against discrimination doesn't mean that it stops. But what we need to see now is some action to change that. And splitting leave equally between the two parents of a child is the obvious and equitable way to do that.</p><p>Until men are seen as equally likely to take time off because of the child that they have brought into the world, this kind of covert, wink-wink discrimination will continue – and it will continue to affect women who don't intend to or can't have children, as much as those who do. If a company can't know either way, it is going to take the safer bet. And that bet is going to result in more women like my friend, who is still looking for a job, and still not finding one. I'm starting to wonder if she ever will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683067|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a54e37b5494be69e781ae538e618358d0f89c2e1 -->",

        "headline":"Mutual banks play an important role in hard times – we must save the Co-op",
        "body":"<p>The co-operative movement, started by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/27/co-operative-group-retail\" title=\"\">Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers</a> in the 19th century is fascinating in terms of social history. The Rochdale pioneers were a collective of weavers who developed a set of ethical principles which formed the basis for their first co-operative and for the modern movement. These included democratic member-control of the co-operative, which was to be community oriented, in other words, a social enterprise. Membership was open to all, without fear of discrimination in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation or disability.</p><p></p><p>Today, it is easy to dismiss the movement as having little relevance. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">takeover of the Co-operative Group's banking arm</a>, with 70% of ownership now in the hands of City investors, appears to have fatally undermined the movement's principles. Is the Co-op Bank even worth saving?</p><p></p><p>Put aside first the dismissive argument that the Co-op Bank was mismanaged and therefore does not deserve to be supported. It is easy to say this <em>in vacuo</em>, but saying it to the 12,000 retail bondholders, the 1,000 people who could lose their jobs, the even larger number who have accounts with the bank, who believe in the co-operative movement and feel disappointed and let down by events, becomes more difficult. The fact is that there is a difference between cherishing a set of values and principles and practical action. We can argue vehemently for both adhering to the founding principles and for a management that can be held to account while implementing them.</p><p></p><p>We need also to look back to the 1980s to understand how mutualisation was undermined and fell out of favour through the privatisation of the building societies. The windfall that members enjoyed at the time seemed so worthwhile; a few hundred pounds each to put towards a new lounge carpet or whatever.</p><p></p><p>Now, the readiness with which we junked the mutual societies seems to be coming back to bite us. The private banking system has let us down badly; the absence of any ethical principles to underpin that system has resulted in mayhem; and a bailout of our main high street banks of an order that borders on incomprehensible. With so few mutualised societies left, people have fewer places to turn to place their hard-earned cash. So what we need is a return to mutualisation. And for this reason alone the Co-operative Bank is worth saving.</p><p></p><p>Circumstances have not changed that markedly since the founding of the Co-operative retail stores and bank. Indeed, we have been reminded recently of the abject poverty that many have fallen into, needing to use food banks or choose between \"eating and heating\" and the need for charitable institutions to step forward and help the needy. Other aspects of the social fabric are of concern. People feel they are having to choose between supporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-green-levy-energy\" title=\"\">green energy policies </a>and paying the fuel bills.</p><p>In a civilised, developed society everyone should be able to eat well, heat their homes and support policies that protect the environment to ensure our long-term wellbeing and future happiness. One way to do that would be to support a financial sector that includes mutualised institutions underpinned by ethical principles similar to those cherished by the Rochdale pioneers. They may not be exciting but banking with community-based, socially oriented institutions would surely enable people to sleep more soundly at night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647722|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|36872322e60cc673763f80d55700c56885e0aa05 -->",

Bloomingdale's department store <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">takes a dim view of the practice</a>, and has marked its merchandise with big black tags that you have to leave on in order to get a refund, meaning you can attend the gala dinner in a Cavalli cocktail dress that you intend to take back the next day, as long as you don't mind looking like you arrived Santa-style, by climbing down a sooty chimney.</p><p>Big stores lose out when we return clothes, but everyone else wins. It depends on the returner, and the garment – you'd hope that no one would be so vulgar as to attend a hot yoga class in their new Spandex unitard and then demand a refund on their purchase. But as long as the wearer has remembered their deodorant and been careful with their cigarettes, I don't mind the idea of buying a dress that's already had a few gratis nights out. After all, we love vintage clothes because they have a history and a story. Returned clothes could have great stories too, it's just they're more likely to end with a trip to Chicken Cottage.</p><p>It's possible to rent occasion wear from some outfitters, but if stores feel \"wardrobing\" is a serious problem, they need to get in on the act. Chain stories could consider introducing a clothes library, where a garment can be rented for a reduced fee, which covers storage and cleaning costs. If nothing else, it would make a sizeable dent in the scary pile of man-made fabrics that end up in landfill every year.</p><p>For women, fashion consumerism is a game they can't win. In one light, we're flibbertigibbets, unable to focus our minds on serious issues like sport, because our heads are full of sparkles and chiffon. If we find joy in fashion, we're thought to be frivolous and simple, even though this is an industry that generates thousands of jobs and billions of pounds, attracting artistic visionaries and smart entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, we can't escape fashion. Everywhere we turn, we're being told to look different, to look better, to have the right outfit for every mood and occasion. If you ever have to go out, be seen in public and talk to people, I am certain there will have been at least one occasion in your life when it became a tearful and traumatic experience because you felt you looked wrong. We're judged by our peers and our families, and now on Facebook and Instagram. People you haven't seen since school can berate you for recycling a bridesmaid's dress and wearing it to a christening. Of course we fantasise about finding the outfits that fill us with joy, that make us feel like our very best selves, as if we could tap dance down the Left Bank and solve mysteries and build bridges and make brioche, while being simultaneously sexy, clever, cool and insouciant. But most women, shopping is not a source of joy. Forget the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQK0VTTXvA\" title=\"\">\"Big mistake! Huge!\"</a> scene in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81528/pretty-woman\" title=\"\">Pretty Woman</a>. In reality it's more like a mash up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\" title=\"\">Battle Royale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36325/scum\" title=\"\">Scum</a> and the bit in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/70550/men-in-black\" title=\"\">Men In Black</a> where the man is slowly revealed to be a big greasy alien.</p><p>If wardrobing was legitimised and formalised, shopping would not lead to alarming amounts of waste and even more alarming levels of debt. We would have the time to work out whether we were comfortable in a garment and whether it made us happy. Shopping wouldn't be such a stressful, expensive risk. It might even become as much fun as the movies suggest. If we could try more and buy less, we'd end up with so many items we truly loved that it would curb our desire for a pointless purchase just because it's new. No matter how big the store is, returning worn items and lying to get a refund is definitely not OK. But it would be great if shops could recognise why this practice is so widely adopted, and meet us in the middle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632571|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8761e898a4d30f408a8aeab33b4299d1e4dca5e3 -->",

        "headline":"Judges can sidestep religion, but they can't avoid morality",
        "body":"<p>Sir James Munby <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Speeches/law-morality-religion-munby-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> last week saying that judges no longer concerned themselves with the promotion of virtue and the discouragement of immorality – and nor should they: Britain is now a secular society, he said, and religion has no special privilege beyond what it is granted by human rights legislation. This was widely reported as claiming that the law no longer has any business enforcing morality. I have now read his speech carefully and I am not at all certain that this is what he said – and if it's what he meant he is clearly wrong and his own speech proves it. Judges, he thinks, are very much in the business of enforcing morality, and so they ought to be. The confusion, and it's a very important one, arises from supposing that morality now means what it meant in respectable circles 100 years ago – a form of 19th-century Protestantism.</p><p>Much of his argument is wonderfully clear and, more importantly, right. Within living memory many influential judges did assume that morality was largely concerned with sexuality and the application of biblical standards of patriarchy in so far as this was possible. All this has gone. \"Judges are no longer <a href=\"http://thelawdictionary.org/custos-morum/\" title=\"\"><em>custos morum</em></a> of the people, and if they are they have to take the people's customs as they find them, not as they or others might wish them to be,\" said Munby.</p><p>\"And if they are\" – that's where the argument shifts, because, as will become apparent, he does believe judges are the custodians of morality to some extent. I suspect that any other view is incoherent, or at least wicked. The burden of his talk is an attack on religious privilege. It seems odd to suppose that this must also be an attack on morality.</p><p>For Munby's claims about what has replaced morality are themselves profoundly moral ones. They have to be. Look at his praise of tolerance.</p><p>He wants to live in \"a tolerant society, increasingly alive to the need to guard against the tyranny which majority opinion may impose on those who, for whatever reason, comprise a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority\".</p><p>This seems to me an entirely and unavoidably moral desire. What justification is there for not imposing our views on a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority? You can't answer the question without using moral concepts. What amoral reason could there be not to impose our views on the minority? Only that we might fail in the attempt and that's not often a serious danger.</p><p>Similarly, his argument against privileging religion is not based on the idea that we can sidestep morality, but on the belief that our idea of morality is better and truer than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/06/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Lord Denning</a>'s was in 1957. Munby said that \"Reliance upon religious belief, however conscientious the belief and however ancient and respectable the religion, can never of itself immunise the believer from the reach of the secular law.\" I don't think many people would disagree with this – I certainly wouldn't. But the question then becomes how to draw the line, and the answer most certainly involves moral judgment and reasoning, as he goes on to recognise.</p><p>\"Where precisely the limits are to be drawn is often a matter of controversy. There is no 'bright-line' test that the law can set. The infinite variety of the human condition precludes arbitrary definition.\"</p><p>Even when Munby has recourse to European human rights law, he remains enmeshed in the problem: he points out that the <a href=\"http://human-rights-convention.org/the-texts/simplified-convention/\" title=\"\">European Convention on Human Rights</a> \"forbids the state to determine the validity of religious beliefs\" but that prohibition depends on a very narrow definition of validity and religious beliefs. What he means, clearly, is that the state has no business with the truth claims of religious mythologies: the state should have no opinion on whether Jesus rose from the dead, or if Muhammad really heard the angel Gabriel. But in other respects the convention positively demands that we determine the validity of religious beliefs. Are they, for instance, \"worthy of respect in a democratic society\"? Are they \"compatible with human dignity\"? These, again, are moral judgments, which society cannot avoid and should not try to.</p><p>Munby's easy acceptance that morality means what Lord Denning thought it did abandons a very necessary battlefield and hands victory there either to religious conservatives who claim that morality must have a supernatural sanction, or to the kind of market fundamentalists who claim that morality is unnecessary or unproblematic. Humanists need to do better than that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421619645|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|49a5713d9841f6bf3949e524277a1daa29c07e54 -->",

        "headline":"In Michael Gove's world Jane Austen, Orwell and Dickens will die out",
        "body":"<p>Michael Gove is <a href=\"http://dickens.stanford.edu/hard/issue1_gloss2.html\" title=\"\">Mr M'Choakumchild</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/charles-dickens/9048771/Gradgrind-My-favourite-Charles-Dickens-character.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Gradgrind</a> personified: \"<a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/cdickens/bl-cdick-hard-1.htm\" title=\"\">What I want is, Facts</a>. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.\" In Gove's schools, whatever might seize the imagination, give pleasure and stay in the heart and mind for a lifetime longer than rote-learned facts is being rooted out.</p><p>When he has done with cleansing the curriculum, it may be the case that fewer people know who Gradgrind and M'Choakumchild are. Dickens and much of literature will be a closed book to those not lucky enough to encounter them outside their exam-crammed education. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/15/michael-gove-gcse-changes-english-literature\" title=\"\">English literature is to be stripped out of the core English GCSE exam</a>, leaving nothing but grammatical correctness and straitjacket language reduced to right and wrong answers. Literature is to become an optional extra, and probably not a highly regarded one, for fear it might let the imagination roam dangerously free. English language, maths, three sciences, a foreign language and history or geography are the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19626663\" title=\"\">core English baccalaureate subjects</a>. <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/why-did-shakespeare-make-rest-silence-hamlets-400760\" title=\"\">The rest is silence</a>, more or less. (But soon few may recognise that reference.) In a world of harsh exams, with the screw tightened down to factual rigour, league table tyranny will increasingly sideline optional extras.</p><p>An array of writers, artists and academics fired off a <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Education/article1335699.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_11_02\" title=\"\">letter of protest to the Sunday Times, including Michael Morpurgo</a>, Robert Harris, Sheila Hancock, Miriam Margolyes and professors John Carey and John Sutherland. The new English literature exam will become more rigorous, concentrating on pre-20th century texts, which may deter all but enthusiasts: when everyone had to do some literature, it was more accessible to all. Prof Sutherland talks of how \"the humanities humanise us\".</p><p>No doubt Gove thinks that soft-headed, but he might ponder the conservative values of preserving the best. If few read literature together, the idea of a canon vanishes. The Bible has all but gone in a generation, a deep cultural loss: apart from the nativity, there is no common reference point, no chill to the marrow at <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&amp;pentid=P568\" title=\"\">God telling Abraham to cut his son's throat</a>, no common understanding of a reference to Lazarus. Another term of Gove-ism, and Jane Austen, Dickens, Orwell, Wilfred Owen, JD Salinger and all the rest will go the same way: it doesn't take long. Pupils may groan at literary texts, but books stay in the mind for further exploring. Whatever is unexamined with marks and tables is unvalued under the Gove whip.</p><p>The consultation in progress is unlikely to change the plan. Gove pretends it's for schools to choose – but drama, dance, art and now literature will slip away. Confident top schools may keep these subjects, but average schools, under intense pressure to perform in core EBacc exams, will let the rest slide. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/22/cultural-learning-building-knowledge-tate\" title=\"\">Cultural Learning Alliance</a> argues passionately for the cause of arts in schools. The Arts Council is negotiating valiantly behind the scenes with <a href=\"http://ofqual.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofqual</a> about how to ensure arts exams are as rigorous, and so of equal status, as the rest.</p><p>In Gove's groves of academe, high achievers will be more clearly set apart, laurels for the winners in his regime of fact and rote, 1950s grammar schools reprised, rewarding those who already thrive under any system. The UK always scored well with top students: it is the long tail of those falling behind who drag down our ranking in PISA tables. He is giving this unequal society, made more so by this government, schools better honed to reflect that social difference. The hurdles are set higher, the fallers will fall further and harder, with fewer paths into education for those not fired up by a strict diet of maths, grammar, physics and French.</p><p>Rudely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\" title=\"\">Gove dismisses the education world as \"the blob\"</a> – but if he asked further education colleges, those havens of second and third chances, what best rescues students failed by schools first time round, it is often those other doors into the many gardens of learning.</p><p>Schools need friendly secret niches with different kinds of teachers: for some children it might be sport, for others design, art, music, dance or drama where other talents and enthusiasms are welcomed to draw a child in, not propel them out. New GCSE codes downgrade all these, urging schools to discourage them. Under Gove's tutelage 14% fewer pupils are taking arts GCSEs. The Commons education select committee reports that the EBacc effect narrows options away from the arts, affecting disadvantaged children most. An Ipsos Mori report finds that schools with a high proportion of children taking free school meals are more than twice as likely to abandon arts subjects as are privileged schools. <a href=\"http://t.co/t17EsAb1pZ\" title=\"\">Gove boasts</a>: \"We've rewarded schools that teach traditional subjects, which help all students get into university.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/XeJOVZmORY\" title=\"\">Liz Truss, his minister, parrots</a>: \"We are rebalancing the curriculum towards high-value subjects – in maths, sciences, DT, computing, English and languages.\"</p><p>What is \"low value\" about drama? Small children learn through acting out imaginary roles. There is no discipline tougher than putting on a play, relying on one another, learning a part, hitting a cue, in mortal peril of failure and hope of triumph before an audience. Anyone who ever acted in a school play remembers it for ever. Ability to speak out, perform and pretend is essential for most jobs, from estate agent upwards. Employers complain that young people mumble, slouch and don't look them in the eye, prizing the \"soft skills\" that elite schools teach through drama and debating. Emotionally, drama teaches children lacking in empathy to put themselves into others' shoes, to express fears.</p><p>But ever fewer schools employ specialist drama teachers: English teachers may or may not have an aptitude. Shakespeare is on the curriculum, no longer to be examined, but dead on the page without performance to breathe life and sense into it. The RSC sends out a toolkit to help-teachers teach Shakespeare. The <a href=\"http://www.ssf.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare Schools Festival</a> is in progress, a thousand primary and secondaries performing in real theatres everywhere, a brilliant project – but drama should be the right of every child. No school should be judged good or outstanding unless it's good at arts: the Arts Council awards an \"<a href=\"http://www.artsmark.org.uk/about-artsmark\" title=\"\">Artsmark</a>\" to schools that do well, but only a quarter earn it. My guess is Gove wouldn't send a child of his to any school that regards arts as a waste of time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421652147|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c9526c1784a53d26651c59e782592ccf1accbe69 -->",

        "headline":"Indonesia-Australia spying row: welcome to full-contact diplomacy",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of full-contact diplomacy. Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natelagawa’s warnings that Indonesia will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/spying-row-indonesia-threatens-to-stop-co-operating-on-people-smuggling\">review its intelligence co-operation </a>with Australia and the United States unless they provide assurances they won’t spy on Indonesia shouldn’t be over-interpreted; they’re part of the rough-and-tumble world of diplomacy. And before we diagnose a crisis in Indonesia-Australia relations, we need to take a closer look at what’s going on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">revelations</a> about the collection of signals intelligence at Australian missions in regional capitals are the work of an American whistleblower and Australian journalists, not neighbouring governments. If foreign governments are genuinely surprised and shocked that the US and Australia spy on them, they are naive in the extreme. Stealing secrets has been a part of statecraft since time immemorial, and arguably makes the world a safer place by minimising the chances that governments will surprise each other. Amidst all the outrage in Germany that the NSA has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">tapping Angela Merkel’s private mobile phone</a>, someone should be asking some hard questions about why her phone hasn’t been encrypted from the start. If the Americans weren’t tapping the German chancellor’s unsecured phone conversations, the Russians, Chinese and French would be.</p> <p>In reality, Jakarta is well aware that Australia is part of the most potent eavesdropping partnership in the world. Indonesia has been a beneficiary of Australia’s intelligence capabilities in its fight against terrorism, just as Australia has benefited from intelligence cooperation with Jakarta. Against this background, Natelagawa’s threatened “review” takes on a Yes Minister slant – something that’s done in order to look decisive, while leaving things pretty much as they are.</p> <p>The Indonesian foreign minister is responding vociferously because he and his president don’t want to seen to be supine in response to allegations of Australian eavesdropping. Indonesia is in the countdown to a presidential election next year, and one way to discredit opponents is to accuse them of selling out to western interests. President Yudhoyono is already criticised by nationalists for being too nice to Canberra; and even though he can’t run again, he can’t discount his party being punished if he isn’t seen to be outraged by this apparent assault on Indonesia’s integrity.</p> <p>There’s another element to Natelagawa’s response that can’t be discounted either. Diplomacy is not all about smooth talk and cocktail parties; it’s often a brutal competition for the slightest advantage, even between ostensible friends and allies. The ability to exploit the slightest weakness can be worth its weight in gold as governments manoeuvre against each other.</p> <p>Natelagawa, who studied in Australia, has probably watched the odd State of Origin game. He knows the first 10 minutes of the match are known as the “softening up period” – a stanza of ferocious physicality in which each side tries to cow the opposition into a disadvantageous state of mind. Right now, there's a new government in Canberra, and neighbouring governments are likely to be keen to test its mettle. The odd diplomatic jab can give a better sense of what can be expected from a new government than years of polite cocktail discussions. New Australian governments over the past two decades have had some rocky foreign policy starts – think of the Howard and Rudd governments’ run-ins with Beijing early on – which makes one think that a bit of softening up may have become part of the regional diplomatic scene.</p> <p>Remember, this is not the first time Natelagawa has muscled up to the Abbott government. More than a few eyebrows were raised in Canberra back in September when he disclosed the contents of private discussions with Julie Bishop to the media – on the foreign minister’s first overseas trip no less. For this reason, the government’s neither-confirm-nor-deny, steady-as-she-goes response is spot-on. The last thing they want to do is to look unsettled.</p> <p>Does all of this add up to a new attitude of antagonism in Jakarta? No. Indonesia has demonstrated over several years that it well understands the value of building a robust and pragmatic relationship with Australia. Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made in Jakarta that it needed to do more to meet Australia half-way on the asylum seeker issue – and it has done so, under a distracting cover of grim warnings about Australian policy positions. So too should the current protestations be taken as a bit of Indonesian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang\">wayang</a> theatre, while the real business of collaboration carries on behind the curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669687|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|1546b826bfef6a406c61e35d7c6da21222b02405 -->",

        "headline":"Why Australia should celebrate Guy Fawkes night",
        "body":"<p>\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November,\" lectures the old nursery rhyme. It&rsquo;s not really about remembering the date, but what it stands for: the importance of our political processes, and preventing people from hijacking them through public apathy.</p> <p>For the past few weeks, we have been up to our novelty eyeballs in discussions about whether Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/halloween-in-australia-what-a-terrible-and-spooky-sight\">should celebrate Halloween</a>. But given recent developments in Australia&rsquo;s political landscape, perhaps we should have been discussing whether Australia should celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night\">Guy Fawkes night</a>.</p> <p>In 1605, British authorities arrested a Catholic terrorist who was about to ignite enough explosives to blow the UK&rsquo;s House of Lords. His plot was to kill the king, the Privy Council, and a handful of aristocrats. His goal was to facilitate a Catholic queen&rsquo;s ascension to the throne. His name was Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>History would be kind to Fawkes. Although the fifth&nbsp;of November was instituted as a holiday to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot and an opportunity to stir up anti-Catholic prejudices, Fawkes would eventually be recast as an anti-authoritarian hero. At the start of the 20th Century, he was the protagonist of children&rsquo;s stories; by the end, he was the face of Alan Moore&rsquo;s protagonist in V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist who worked with Moore on V for Vendetta, said that the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735\">Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny</a>\". Although the historical Fawkes differs significantly from the contemporary imagination, his face has entered the popular consciousness as a prompt for questions about civil liberties and the relationship between the population and the state.</p> <p>As a young conservative who is generally in favour of greater state powers, I sit on the other side of the political spectrum from what Fawkes now represents. But despite my position on the right side of the political spectrum, I still find it profoundly disturbing that state and federal governments have been able to pass laws increasing the scope of their power with very little debate in the broader public.</p> <p>Governments have discovered that they don&rsquo;t need to discuss, negotiate, or persuade because the broader public has become almost completely apathetic to the idea of scrutiny and oversight. Activists and academics may write huffy pieces in hyperbolic prose, but the broader public simply does not care. Where there should be genuine outrage and concern, there is an eerie silence from a public that is disaffected, disinterested, and has forgotten the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November.</p> <p>Queensland&rsquo;s \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/queenslands-new-anti-bikie-laws-a-recipe-for-tyranny-david-simon-says\">anti-bikie\" legislative package</a>, for example, seemed to come out of nowhere, was discussed for no more than 30 minutes, and then promptly passed into law. Although there were good reasons to introduce the legislation, the attorney-general of Queensland canvassed none of them. Instead of trying to persuade people with reasoned argument, he opted instead to troll the leader of the opposition over Twitter: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarrodBleijieMP/statuses/389991967125299201\">you must tell us who's side you are on, Criminal Motorcycle Gangs or Qld'ers?</a>\". Licensed by the public&rsquo;s lack of interest, other states are <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/vic-qld-on-board-with-our-bikie-lawsnsw/story-e6frfku9-1226749540734\">introducing similar legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the federal level, a weekly press conference satiates the public&rsquo;s interest in the scrutiny of border protection policies. The media and Coalition were once sent into apoplexy every time a boat arrived; now the discussion has gone deathly quiet, as if millions of voices cried out for six years and were suddenly silenced.</p> <p>The situation is so dire that news organisations are resorting to stunts &ndash; like the New Stateman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\">commissioning of Russell Brand as a guest editor</a>, and Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\">subsequent interview with him on Newsnight</a> &ndash; in a desperate attempt to stir any public interest in politics. But it&rsquo;s a flash in the pan, a brief candle illuminating nothing.</p> <p>It seems weird to complain about this malaise when it so clearly benefits my side of politics, but it feels like an ungallant, ignoble victory. Had St George slayed the dragon while it slept, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written stories about him. Similarly, achieving good political outcomes is more than just getting your legislation into force; it&rsquo;s about having contentious but meaningful policies survive the ordeal of fire, generated by vigorous public discussion and debate.</p> <p>By forgetting the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November &ndash; whether as a lesson about the importance of protecting political institutions, or as a symbol of anti-authoritarian rebellion &ndash; we have extinguished fiery political conflict with wet blankets of apathy. Our political culture is desperate for symbols behind which the public can rally and express its political concerns. Fawkes gives us that symbol, reinvented time and time again to speak to new political concerns.</p> <p>Who better to symbolise the resistance to more powerful security legislation than a terrorist from the 1600s cast as both the villain and hero of the holiday? How better to reignite the political passions of the public than with a bonfire? What better attracts the public&rsquo;s interest in community than fireworks? Come for the bonfire and the fireworks; stay for the political symbols.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not the whole answer, but popularising political engagement is a good first step. Celebrating Guy Fawkes night hands the flame of political change back to the popular consciousness. Today, it&rsquo;s time to remember the fifth of November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664451|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d995107b91217bc5f0cdf2064cc7cc8078677f3e -->",

        "headline":"Melbourne Cup: the diktat of classy fashion highlights our class problem",
        "body":"<p>Just like countries in the northern hemisphere are blessed with very dramatic seasonal changes &ndash; the crimson leaves of autumn, the snow storms, the emergence of spring flowers &ndash; Australia has a soothing, predictable commentary cycle&nbsp;rhythm.</p> <p>We are inundated with op-eds about the meaning of patriotism each ANZAC day, about nationalism each Australia day, and early November &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/fashion/stop-dressing-like-slappers-for-the-races/story-e6frfn7i-1225942489318\">year</a> after <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/on-melbournes-day-of-days-the-real-decision-is-to-flaunt-or-follow-the-rules-of-racewear-20111101-1mtxg.html\">year</a> after <a href=\"http://au.sports.yahoo.com/racing/news/article/-/15328772/melbourne-cup-lady-lets-fists-fly/\">year</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;heralds a slew of articles bemoaning young women&rsquo;s attire and behaviour at the races.</p> <p>Consider the recent <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/how-short-is-too-short-when-it-comes-to-melbourne-cup-day-fashion-etiquette/story-e6frfmqi-1226752675920\">news.com.au article</a> which asked &ldquo;when is short simply too short and how much skin is appropriate to show?&rdquo; Amid headless photographs of women in outfits the author deemed unacceptable, the article asked incredulously \"don't racegoers read fashion form guides of any kind?\" Fake tans, backless dresses and exposed midriffs are apparently ruining the hallowed traditions of a notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/melbourne-cup-horse-racing\">cruel</a> horse race.</p> <p>So far, so predictable: moral panic about girls in sexy outfits is hardly novel. There is arguably more to such articles, though, than just the usual prurient (and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/08/women_know_more_than_just_love_and_sex/\">quasi-anthropological</a>) interest in young women behaving badly.</p> <p>Australia has long been shaped by a narrative of egalitarianism. Our national self-image centres on a uniquely <a href=\"http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10571\">classless society</a>, unencumbered by the stratification and snobbery of the Old World. Acknowledging that divisions exist and that we do not in fact inhabit a <a href=\"http://tarahunt.com/2013/10/28/meritocracy-is-almost-as-real-as-this-unicorn/\">unicorn-filled meritocracy</a> is impossible within this framework. For those who wish to maintain the comforting fiction of a nation where Jack is as good as his master, the resulting sense of denial creates strange outcomes. As Guy Rundle <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/01/rundle-rupert-clive-and-campbell-in-the-arkansas-of-the-world/?wpmp_switcher=mobile\">noted</a> recently, Australia is a topsy-turvy place where &ldquo;billionaires lecture us about elitism&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have a class-shaped gap in much of our national conversation, and this void is filled by coded, euphemistic language, including <a href=\"http://thingsboganslike.com/\">mockery</a> of &ldquo;bogans&rdquo; and, relevantly, the lamentation that young women attending a horse race fail to conform to dress codes. Thus we have &ldquo;leading stylist and Westfield ambassador Donny Gallela&rdquo; advising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When dressing for the races, women should dress like a lady and adhere to basic racing style rules such as not flashing too much flesh and always wearing headwear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, we are repeatedly <a href=\"http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/article/-/19485760/melbourne-cup-carnival-2013-race-day-fashion-explained/\">told</a>, is the point of the Cup for women: it gives us a chance to &ldquo;dress like a real lady&rdquo;.&nbsp;We are attuned to sexism, but classism also lurks in this sort of advice. The term &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is used to denote a division between different types of women (recall also that class is inextricably linked to race), and it circulates in modern times despite the equivalent descriptor &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (to separate male plebs from their betters) having largely fallen into disuse.</p> <p>Consider the UK-produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladette_to_Lady\">Ladette to Lady</a> television show that appeared during the 2000s, teaching boisterous young women to enunciate their vowels, dress demurely, and sublimate their personalities. For added colonial cringe, there were <a href=\"http://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/aussie-ladette-to-lady/\">versions</a> of the show featuring all Australian contestants. A century after George Bernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion, the urge to remould young Eliza Doolittles has not yet evaporated.</p> <p>In 2013, it is no longer acceptable publicly to fulminate about the failings of the <br />&ldquo;lower orders&rdquo;, but this sentiment has not disappeared: could it lie beneath the horror expressed each November at the spectre of fake-tanned, miniskirted young women?</p> <p>Parallels may be drawn with the phenomena English writer Owen Jones interrogated in his 2011 polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Classes</a>; the author argued that hostility towards an &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; represented in caricatures such as Little Britain&rsquo;s Vicky Pollard masked contempt for the working classes (a term rarely used in Australia&rsquo;s mainstream media, except when politicians <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Costello-taxes-the-point-were-all-working-class/2005/05/16/1116095909038.html\">claim membership</a>). For Jones, demonization was &ldquo;the ideological backbone of an unequal society&rdquo;.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the Cup and the scandalised commentary surrounding its dress codes, which raises some questions. What does a lady look like? Who determines what behaviour is deemed ladylike? Is a lady simply a woman who conforms to antiquated assumptions rooted in a moribund yet strangely durable English class system?</p> <p>To ask these kinds of questions in the context of the Melbourne Cup is not to romanticise binge-drinking, which poses a danger to both men and women (although enthusiastic boozing attracts less concern when embraced by the male of the species). Neither is fashionably scanty clothing, at the races or otherwise, necessarily a symbol of empowerment; it&rsquo;s as well to be sceptical of versions of feminism that coincide with the dictates of consumer capitalism. It is simply to suggest that lamentations about the failure of young women to act &ldquo;like ladies&rdquo; need to be read with a critical eye.</p> <p>One thing is more or less certain: the day after the Cup, the papers will be replete with gleefully prurient pictures of bedraggled young women carrying their shoes. Our leaves don't fall in dramatic fashion, we don't have many snow storms, but here in this wide brown land the seasonal cycle continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421659057|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d52e8b145a330ddc1e8f405799adbdbf5fd02022 -->",

Hunter argued that there was a continuity between the original 12th-century protection of commoner's rights over a piece of land, and a similar right in the 19th century. The new suburbanites might have no sheep, pigs or cows, but access to open space and fresh air was as important to them as grazing had been to their ancestors. Enshrined in law in the mid 1870s, the principle preserved thousands of acres – although it is now being undermined by new planning legislation. Later, Hunter had the idea of preserving the wilder landscape of the Lake District by creating a land-holding company. It should, he proposed, be called the national trust.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662536|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6442d6a9c743fd705a5a1222ea58c251d41e5162 -->",

For a brief period after the catastrophe of 2008, however, a deep but vague conviction that there must be a different way to run financial affairs became entirely mainstream; so mainstream, in fact, that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-coalition-documentation\" title=\"\">coalition partners</a> made a hazy commitment to promote banking mutuals, a year after the outgoing Brown administration had issued special statutory instruments to allow the Co-operative Bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/21/britannia-cooperative-banks-building-societies\" title=\"\">to merge with the Britannia building society</a>.</p><p>This deal, it was fondly imagined, could create a player to drag a friendly society ethos of finance into the 21st century, and on a scale to put a branch on every high street, really challenging the Big Four's way of doing business. Four years on, the necessity of that challenge has been underlined by scandals involving everything from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/libor-scandal/\" title=\"\">rate-rigging</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21840052\" title=\"\">money laundering</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\" title=\"\">systematic mis-selling of insurance</a>. Far from thriving, however, the great Co-operative challenger is fighting for life, and this week announced that it was being kept alive – but only with, in the final cruel irony, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">help of American hedge funds</a>.</p><p>The details of the deal are depressing first and most acutely for the workers who will lose their job in a run of branch closers. But they are depressing, too, for anyone who wants to see new models of finance, or indeed of business more widely. For the wider Co-op group is going to have to find £462m, which is half a billion pounds that will not be available to invest its mutually owned supermarkets and funeral homes. Assuming enough individual bond holders can be persuaded to acquiesce in the deal, the Co-op group's stake will shrink from 100% to 30%, while it writes ethical values into its articles of association.</p><p>In theory, the Co-op group will be able to blow the whistle on its own bank for any transgressions, but how likely is that? At best, like a declaration of confidence in a club manager, this is an avowal the company would rather it did not have to make. In the very worst case, the pledges could turn out as hollow as <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49344\" title=\"\">the guarantees of editorial freedom</a> that secured Rupert Murdoch's take-over of the Times.</p><p>That, however, is probably melodramatic. For 30% should be enough for control; more fundamentally – as those hedge fund investments make plain – there is a serious market for ethical banking. Co-op Bank's difficulties came from expanding too fast, a hubristic habit learnt from the mainstream. The real difficulty, then, wasn't that Co-op was too different – but that it was not different enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662147|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8da52c806e113b92b78d055bab060ea7bf4fe32f -->",

For those who wish to maintain the comforting fiction of a nation where Jack is as good as his master, the resulting sense of denial creates strange outcomes. As Guy Rundle <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/01/rundle-rupert-clive-and-campbell-in-the-arkansas-of-the-world/?wpmp_switcher=mobile\">noted</a> recently, Australia is a topsy-turvy place where &ldquo;billionaires lecture us about elitism&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have a class-shaped gap in much of our national conversation, and this void is filled by coded, euphemistic language, including <a href=\"http://thingsboganslike.com/\">mockery</a> of &ldquo;bogans&rdquo; and, relevantly, the lamentation that young women attending a horse race fail to conform to dress codes. Thus we have &ldquo;leading stylist and Westfield ambassador Donny Gallela&rdquo; advising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When dressing for the races, women should dress like a lady and adhere to basic racing style rules such as not flashing too much flesh and always wearing headwear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, we are repeatedly <a href=\"http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/article/-/19485760/melbourne-cup-carnival-2013-race-day-fashion-explained/\">told</a>, is the point of the Cup for women: it gives us a chance to &ldquo;dress like a real lady&rdquo;.&nbsp;We are attuned to sexism, but classism also lurks in this sort of advice. The term &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is used to denote a division between different types of women (recall also that class is inextricably linked to race), and it circulates in modern times despite the equivalent descriptor &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (to separate male plebs from their betters) having largely fallen into disuse.</p> <p>Consider the UK-produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladette_to_Lady\">Ladette to Lady</a> television show that appeared during the 2000s, teaching boisterous young women to enunciate their vowels, dress demurely, and sublimate their personalities. For added colonial cringe, there were <a href=\"http://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/aussie-ladette-to-lady/\">versions</a> of the show featuring all Australian contestants. A century after George Bernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion, the urge to remould young Eliza Doolittles has not yet evaporated.</p> <p>In 2013, it is no longer acceptable publicly to fulminate about the failings of the <br />&ldquo;lower orders&rdquo;, but this sentiment has not disappeared: could it lie beneath the horror expressed each November at the spectre of fake-tanned, miniskirted young women?</p> <p>Parallels may be drawn with the phenomena English writer Owen Jones interrogated in his 2011 polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Classes</a>; the author argued that hostility towards an &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; represented in caricatures such as Little Britain&rsquo;s Vicky Pollard masked contempt for the working classes (a term rarely used in Australia&rsquo;s mainstream media, except when politicians <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Costello-taxes-the-point-were-all-working-class/2005/05/16/1116095909038.html\">claim membership</a>). For Jones, demonization was &ldquo;the ideological backbone of an unequal society&rdquo;.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the Cup and the scandalised commentary surrounding its dress codes, which raises some questions. What does a lady look like? Who determines what behaviour is deemed ladylike? Is a lady simply a woman who conforms to antiquated assumptions rooted in a moribund yet strangely durable English class system?</p> <p>To ask these kinds of questions in the context of the Melbourne Cup is not to romanticise binge-drinking, which poses a danger to both men and women (although enthusiastic boozing attracts less concern when embraced by the male of the species). Neither is fashionably scanty clothing, at the races or otherwise, necessarily a symbol of empowerment; it&rsquo;s as well to be sceptical of versions of feminism that coincide with the dictates of consumer capitalism. It is simply to suggest that lamentations about the failure of young women to act &ldquo;like ladies&rdquo; need to be read with a critical eye.</p> <p>One thing is more or less certain: the day after the Cup, the papers will be replete with gleefully prurient pictures of bedraggled young women carrying their shoes. Our leaves don't fall in dramatic fashion, we don't have many snow storms, but here in this wide brown land the seasonal cycle continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421659057|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d52e8b145a330ddc1e8f405799adbdbf5fd02022 -->",

        "body":"<p>Something awful happened to me last week while I was playing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/grand-theft-auto-5-review\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> (GTA). As usual, I was hijacking a car; either because I wanted to escape the police or because my other car was parked about 50ft away and I couldn't be bothered to walk over to it. It doesn't matter which.</p><p>However, this time the driver happened to be an old lady. A sweet old lady who pleaded with me not to hurt her as I pulled her frail body from her seat. That car was probably the only thing that still allowed her some degree of independence, I realised. The insurance company would probably dick her around, too. It might take her months to get the car replaced. And that's if she even had the confidence to return to the wheel at all, which she probably wouldn't.</p><p>Robbing the old lady, even though I knew she was just a lump of pixels, made me feel terrible. What sort of monster had I become? Appalled at myself, I gave her the car back and let her drive away in it.</p><p>I am rubbish at GTA 5. I think I'm just a bit too Guardian for it.</p><p>There have been other instances of this. I've only ever robbed one shop, and that was only when the game made me. I won't do it willingly due to a misguided belief that you should support the local businessman. I routinely get shot dead on missions because I don't like the idea of topping up my health meter with sugary snacks made from processed foods. I'm barely even skimming what the game has to offer, and it's all because I'm a woolly, liberal, cartoon joke.</p><p>This sounds like comic exaggeration, but I promise it isn't. If the game controller's R3 button allowed you to leave an apologetic note on the windscreen of the car you've just accidentally bumped into, then that's how I'd spend 95% of my time.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. When the first top-down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/18/dan-houser-grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">GTA game was released in 1997</a>, I was as recklessly immoral as they come. Back then I'd quite happily flamethrower a line of dancing Hare Krishnas for a giggle. But now that I've grown up into a hand-wringing, left-leaning ninny I've found myself trying to play the game as responsibly as I can. Like someone's mum would.</p><p>Playing GTA Online only makes this worse. The story mode makes you do a number of terrible things but that's fine because you're controlling a fictional character. But online, when I'm controlling a character who looks like me – albeit a skinnier, more attractive version of me – everything changes. For want of a better word, playing GTA Online turns me into a yellowbellied nancypants.</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm alone in being crippled by this sense of social responsibility, too. When you play GTA Online, you can hear everyone else, and in my experience all the other players are either rapping six-year-old French arsonists or middle-aged men who only stop trying to murder me as gratuitously as possible in order to shout swearwords at their newborn babies.</p><p>And yet, despite all this, I'll keep playing. Because the beauty of GTA is that it's set in such a perfectly realised world that nobody ever has to compromise their ideals if they don't want to. There are plenty of other things to do within the game. So let's hear it for GTA 5: the most expensive biking around a mountaintop while listening to Eddie Murphy simulator that there has ever been.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629670|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|15ed5daa467c0d2096383993df9cd70682c9a055 -->",

        "headline":"Indonesia-Australia spying row: welcome to full-contact diplomacy",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of full-contact diplomacy. Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natelagawa’s warnings that Indonesia will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/spying-row-indonesia-threatens-to-stop-co-operating-on-people-smuggling\">review its intelligence co-operation </a>with Australia and the United States unless they provide assurances they won’t spy on Indonesia shouldn’t be over-interpreted; they’re part of the rough-and-tumble world of diplomacy. And before we diagnose a crisis in Indonesia-Australia relations, we need to take a closer look at what’s going on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">revelations</a> about the collection of signals intelligence at Australian missions in regional capitals are the work of an American whistleblower and Australian journalists, not neighbouring governments. If foreign governments are genuinely surprised and shocked that the US and Australia spy on them, they are naive in the extreme. Stealing secrets has been a part of statecraft since time immemorial, and arguably makes the world a safer place by minimising the chances that governments will surprise each other. Amidst all the outrage in Germany that the NSA has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">tapping Angela Merkel’s private mobile phone</a>, someone should be asking some hard questions about why her phone hasn’t been encrypted from the start. If the Americans weren’t tapping the German chancellor’s unsecured phone conversations, the Russians, Chinese and French would be.</p> <p>In reality, Jakarta is well aware that Australia is part of the most potent eavesdropping partnership in the world. Indonesia has been a beneficiary of Australia’s intelligence capabilities in its fight against terrorism, just as Australia has benefited from intelligence cooperation with Jakarta. Against this background, Natelagawa’s threatened “review” takes on a Yes Minister slant – something that’s done in order to look decisive, while leaving things pretty much as they are.</p> <p>The Indonesian foreign minister is responding vociferously because he and his president don’t want to seen to be supine in response to allegations of Australian eavesdropping. Indonesia is in the countdown to a presidential election next year, and one way to discredit opponents is to accuse them of selling out to western interests. President Yudhoyono is already criticised by nationalists for being too nice to Canberra; and even though he can’t run again, he can’t discount his party being punished if he isn’t seen to be outraged by this apparent assault on Indonesia’s integrity.</p> <p>There’s another element to Natelagawa’s response that can’t be discounted either. Diplomacy is not all about smooth talk and cocktail parties; it’s often a brutal competition for the slightest advantage, even between ostensible friends and allies. The ability to exploit the slightest weakness can be worth its weight in gold as governments manoeuvre against each other.</p> <p>Natelagawa, who studied in Australia, has probably watched the odd State of Origin game. He knows the first 10 minutes of the match are known as the “softening up period” – a stanza of ferocious physicality in which each side tries to cow the opposition into a disadvantageous state of mind. Right now, there's a new government in Canberra, and neighbouring governments are likely to be keen to test its mettle. The odd diplomatic jab can give a better sense of what can be expected from a new government than years of polite cocktail discussions. New Australian governments over the past two decades have had some rocky foreign policy starts – think of the Howard and Rudd governments’ run-ins with Beijing early on – which makes one think that a bit of softening up may have become part of the regional diplomatic scene.</p> <p>Remember, this is not the first time Natelagawa has muscled up to the Abbott government. More than a few eyebrows were raised in Canberra back in September when he disclosed the contents of private discussions with Julie Bishop to the media – on the foreign minister’s first overseas trip no less. For this reason, the government’s neither-confirm-nor-deny, steady-as-she-goes response is spot-on. The last thing they want to do is to look unsettled.</p> <p>Does all of this add up to a new attitude of antagonism in Jakarta? No. Indonesia has demonstrated over several years that it well understands the value of building a robust and pragmatic relationship with Australia. Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made in Jakarta that it needed to do more to meet Australia half-way on the asylum seeker issue – and it has done so, under a distracting cover of grim warnings about Australian policy positions. So too should the current protestations be taken as a bit of Indonesian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang\">wayang</a> theatre, while the real business of collaboration carries on behind the curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669687|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|1546b826bfef6a406c61e35d7c6da21222b02405 -->",

But given recent developments in Australia&rsquo;s political landscape, perhaps we should have been discussing whether Australia should celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night\">Guy Fawkes night</a>.</p> <p>In 1605, British authorities arrested a Catholic terrorist who was about to ignite enough explosives to blow the UK&rsquo;s House of Lords. His plot was to kill the king, the Privy Council, and a handful of aristocrats. His goal was to facilitate a Catholic queen&rsquo;s ascension to the throne. His name was Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>History would be kind to Fawkes. Although the fifth&nbsp;of November was instituted as a holiday to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot and an opportunity to stir up anti-Catholic prejudices, Fawkes would eventually be recast as an anti-authoritarian hero. At the start of the 20th Century, he was the protagonist of children&rsquo;s stories; by the end, he was the face of Alan Moore&rsquo;s protagonist in V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist who worked with Moore on V for Vendetta, said that the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735\">Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny</a>\". Although the historical Fawkes differs significantly from the contemporary imagination, his face has entered the popular consciousness as a prompt for questions about civil liberties and the relationship between the population and the state.</p> <p>As a young conservative who is generally in favour of greater state powers, I sit on the other side of the political spectrum from what Fawkes now represents. But despite my position on the right side of the political spectrum, I still find it profoundly disturbing that state and federal governments have been able to pass laws increasing the scope of their power with very little debate in the broader public.</p> <p>Governments have discovered that they don&rsquo;t need to discuss, negotiate, or persuade because the broader public has become almost completely apathetic to the idea of scrutiny and oversight. Activists and academics may write huffy pieces in hyperbolic prose, but the broader public simply does not care. Where there should be genuine outrage and concern, there is an eerie silence from a public that is disaffected, disinterested, and has forgotten the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November.</p> <p>Queensland&rsquo;s \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/queenslands-new-anti-bikie-laws-a-recipe-for-tyranny-david-simon-says\">anti-bikie\" legislative package</a>, for example, seemed to come out of nowhere, was discussed for no more than 30 minutes, and then promptly passed into law. Although there were good reasons to introduce the legislation, the attorney-general of Queensland canvassed none of them. Instead of trying to persuade people with reasoned argument, he opted instead to troll the leader of the opposition over Twitter: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarrodBleijieMP/statuses/389991967125299201\">you must tell us who's side you are on, Criminal Motorcycle Gangs or Qld'ers?</a>\". Licensed by the public&rsquo;s lack of interest, other states are <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/vic-qld-on-board-with-our-bikie-lawsnsw/story-e6frfku9-1226749540734\">introducing similar legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the federal level, a weekly press conference satiates the public&rsquo;s interest in the scrutiny of border protection policies. The media and Coalition were once sent into apoplexy every time a boat arrived; now the discussion has gone deathly quiet, as if millions of voices cried out for six years and were suddenly silenced.</p> <p>The situation is so dire that news organisations are resorting to stunts &ndash; like the New Stateman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\">commissioning of Russell Brand as a guest editor</a>, and Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\">subsequent interview with him on Newsnight</a> &ndash; in a desperate attempt to stir any public interest in politics. But it&rsquo;s a flash in the pan, a brief candle illuminating nothing.</p> <p>It seems weird to complain about this malaise when it so clearly benefits my side of politics, but it feels like an ungallant, ignoble victory. Had St George slayed the dragon while it slept, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written stories about him. Similarly, achieving good political outcomes is more than just getting your legislation into force; it&rsquo;s about having contentious but meaningful policies survive the ordeal of fire, generated by vigorous public discussion and debate.</p> <p>By forgetting the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November &ndash; whether as a lesson about the importance of protecting political institutions, or as a symbol of anti-authoritarian rebellion &ndash; we have extinguished fiery political conflict with wet blankets of apathy. Our political culture is desperate for symbols behind which the public can rally and express its political concerns. Fawkes gives us that symbol, reinvented time and time again to speak to new political concerns.</p> <p>Who better to symbolise the resistance to more powerful security legislation than a terrorist from the 1600s cast as both the villain and hero of the holiday? How better to reignite the political passions of the public than with a bonfire? What better attracts the public&rsquo;s interest in community than fireworks? Come for the bonfire and the fireworks; stay for the political symbols.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not the whole answer, but popularising political engagement is a good first step. Celebrating Guy Fawkes night hands the flame of political change back to the popular consciousness. Today, it&rsquo;s time to remember the fifth of November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664451|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d995107b91217bc5f0cdf2064cc7cc8078677f3e -->",

The interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, sounded as if he was in mourning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/pakistan-taliban-leader-us-drone-strike\" title=\"\">when he said</a>: \"This is not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts.\" Imran Khan, who heads the provincial government in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has reiterated a threat to block Nato vehicles from passing through his province unless drone strikes are discontinued. While journalists and others pointed out that Mehsud was terrorising the population of Pakistan, most politicians sounded ambivalent at best.</p><p>This reaction is partly the result of immediate political concerns. The conservative government of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/11/pakistan-elections-turnout-violence-khan\" title=\"\">Nawaz Sharif came to power in May</a> on a platform of peace talks with the Taliban and action against drone strikes. A few weeks ago, Mehsud took the unusual step <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/taliban-leader-pakistan-talks-offers\" title=\"\">of giving an interview to the BBC</a> in which he said that his organisation was open to talks. Politicians from both Sharif and Khan's parties are presenting Mehsud's death as a devastating blow to these efforts. Nisar and others have even suggested the US deliberately timed the strike to undermine dialogue.</p><p>The Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which Mehsud had led since 2009, has tentatively said that talks may still go ahead, but it is likely that Mehsud's death will delay the process. Of course, the overblown rhetoric coming from politicians fails to acknowledge that talks with the Taliban were at an embryonic stage. Mehsud's outlandish conditions for dialogue included the imposition of a harsh version of Islamic law across the country. Peace talks with the TTP have taken place before, and have always ended in failure, so it perhaps an over-statement to imply that had Mehsud survived, peace in Pakistan would have prevailed.</p><p>Drone strikes, however, remain politically difficult. The public is divided, but the prevailing mood – encouraged by politicians – is that their use is yet another US violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. As always in Pakistan, the real picture is complex (many people in the areas most affected by terrorism actually support drone attacks, despite civilian deaths), but anti-Americanism is also rife. Even if a common enemy has been killed, it is difficult to celebrate if it is the result of Americans intruding on Pakistani soil. In Pakistan, it can be difficult to have any political discussion without the blame eventually being pinned on America. This paranoia is the result of years of perceived – and often real – double-crossing by the Americans. The confused reaction that results is reflected in how people who deplore terrorism and hate the TTP speak admiringly of the Afghan Taliban because they are standing up to American invaders.</p><p>Pakistan has taken a heavy toll in the war on terror. At least 35,000 people have died in terrorist violence since 2001, a figure that dwarfs the combined death toll in all western countries. Ultimately, the death of a single Taliban leader will make little difference to the group's campaign of terror as the power structures are decentralised enough to absorb such losses. Which begs the question: what hope is there for peace? Clearly, the leaders of Pakistan and the US have yet to find any credible options.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421628242|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8fb804c2b2115737c224cb0fb85be166af1fddda -->",

You know, the one that asked whether corporations should have the power to strike down our laws? No, I don't either. Mind you, I spent 10 minutes looking for my watch the other day before I realised I was wearing it. Forgetting about the referendum is another sign of ageing. Because there must have been one, mustn't there? After all that agonising over whether or not we should stay in the European Union, the government wouldn't cede our sovereignty to some shadowy, undemocratic body without consulting us. Would it?</p><p>The purpose of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and European nations. I mentioned it <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2013/10/14/elite-insurgency/\" title=\"\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. But I left out the most important issue: the remarkable ability it would grant big business to sue the living daylights out of governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing.</p><p>The mechanism through which this is achieved is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement\" title=\"\">investor-state dispute settlement</a>. It's already being used in many parts of the world to kill regulations protecting people and the living planet.</p><p>The Australian government, after massive debates in and out of parliament, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20559585\" title=\"\">decided that cigarettes should be sold in plain packets</a>, marked only with shocking health warnings. The decision was validated by the Australian supreme court. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets\" title=\"\">using a trade agreement Australia struck with Hong Kong</a>, the tobacco company Philip Morris has asked an offshore tribunal to award it a vast sum in compensation for the loss of what it calls its intellectual property.</p><p>During its financial crisis, and in response to public anger over rocketing charges, Argentina imposed a freeze on people's energy and water bills (does this sound familiar?). It was sued by the international utility companies whose vast bills had prompted the government to act. For this and other such crimes, it has been forced to pay out over a billion dollars in compensation. In El Salvador, local communities managed at great cost (<a href=\"http://www.canadians.org/fr/node/5297\" title=\"\">three campaigners were murdered</a>) to persuade the government to refuse permission for a vast gold mine which threatened to contaminate their water supplies. A victory for democracy? Not for long, perhaps. The Canadian company which sought to dig the mine is now suing El Salvador for $315m – for the loss of its anticipated future profits.</p><p>In Canada, the courts revoked two&nbsp;patents owned by the American drugs firm Eli Lilly, on the grounds that&nbsp;the company had not produced enough evidence that they had the beneficial effects it claimed. Eli Lilly is now <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854\" title=\"\">suing the Canadian government for&nbsp;$500m</a>, and demanding that Canada's patent laws are changed.</p><p>These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing. The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear. Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing. There is no right&nbsp;of appeal on the merits of the&nbsp;case.&nbsp;Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.</p><p>You don't believe it? Here's what one of the judges on these tribunals says about his work. \"When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign&nbsp;states have agreed to investment arbitration at all ... Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.\"</p><p>There are no corresponding rights for&nbsp;citizens. We can't use these tribunals to demand better protections from corporate greed. As the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Democracy Centre</a> says, this is \"a privatised justice system for global corporations\".</p><p>Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: \"I've seen the letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day.\" Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible under these circumstances.</p><p>This is the system to which we will&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject if the transatlantic treaty&nbsp;goes ahead. The US and the European commission, both of which have been captured by the corporations they are supposed to regulate, are pressing for investor-state dispute resolution to be included in the agreement.</p><p></p><p>The commission justifies this policy by claiming that domestic courts don't offer corporations sufficient protection because they \"might be biased or lack independence\". Which courts is it talking about? Those of the US? Its own member states? It doesn't say. In fact it fails to produce a single concrete example demonstrating the need for a new, extrajudicial system. It is precisely because our courts are generally not biased or lacking independence that the corporations want to bypass them. The EC seeks to replace open, accountable, sovereign courts with a closed, corrupt system riddled with conflicts of interest and arbitrary powers.</p><p>Investor-state rules could be used to smash any attempt to save the NHS from corporate control, to re-regulate the banks, to curb the greed of the energy companies, to renationalise the railways, to leave fossil fuels in the ground. These rules shut down democratic alternatives. They outlaw leftwing politics.</p><p>This is why there has been no attempt by the UK government to inform us about this monstrous assault on democracy, let alone consult us. This is why the Conservatives who huff and puff about sovereignty are silent. Wake up, people we're being shafted.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a>.
