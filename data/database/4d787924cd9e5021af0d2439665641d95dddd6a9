        "headline":"The Dominican Republic and Haiti: one island riven by an unresolved past",
        "body":"<p>When Haiti was hit by the devastating earthquake in 2010, its island neighbour, the Dominican Republic, rushed to help. It was among the first to send rescue workers, food and water, and also allowed overseas relief agency flights to land at Santo Domingo airport.</p><p>But three years on, the goodwill seems to have dissipated and old tensions resurfaced. Just over a week ago <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-26/world/42423002_1_haitian-migrants-dominicans-citizenship\" title=\"\">the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled to revoke the citizenship of children of illegal Haitian migrant workers</a> – a measure to be applied to anyone born after 1929, and thus affecting not only migrants' children, but their grandchildren and, in some cases, even great-grandchildren.</p><p>This is the latest legal attack on the rights of Haitians and their descendants; measures in the past few years have included reclassifying migrant workers as \"in transit\" rather than legal residents. This meant any child born in the Dominican Republic – which had been one basis for citizenship – also needed one Dominican parent, or one who was a legal resident.</p><p></p><p>The latest ruling could leave thousands who identify themselves as Dominican but may have had a Haitian ancestor facing an uncertain future – already some 40,000 people have been told they will not receive identity documents. Without official papers, it is impossible to access services such as schools or healthcare. Human rights groups and local NGOs have expressed their concern, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/30/3662097/un-will-review-dominican-ruling.html\" title=\"\">and the UN will be reviewing this ruling</a>.</p><p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola, where Christopher Columbus established the first European settlement in 1492. Despite their shared history of colonialism and slavery, dictatorship and oppression, a physical and emotional border has long separated them.</p><p>The western third of the island was ceded by Spain to France in 1697, and the entire island by 1795. By 1801 the famed former slave General Toussaint Louverture had freed all the slaves on the island and united it under his governorship, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/600902/Toussaint-Louverture\" title=\"\">though this was short-lived</a>.</p><p>In 1808, a group of Dominicans started  the war of reconquest to drive out the French and return the eastern part the island to Spanish rule – the west by this point was the republic of Haiti. But by 1822  Haiti had established control of the whole island once more. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1217771.stm\" title=\"\">Dominican Republic gained its independence</a> from Haiti, not Spain, in 1844.</p><p>Modern times have been no less complicated. In 1937, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo – who wore makeup to lighten his skin and was obsessed with \"whitening\" the predominantly mixed-race island – ordered the massacre of Haitians in border areas, where many worked cultivating sugar. To determine who was Haitian, soldiers with machetes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880967\" title=\"\">asked dark-skinned people to say the word \"perejil\"</a>, which is Spanish for parsley. For Creole-speaking Haitians, the \"r\" sound was difficult to pronounce, and a slip of the tongue became a death sentence. Estimates of the massacre range from 10,000 to 25,000 people killed over the course of a few weeks. And the bitter irony was that Trujillo's grandmother was Haitian.</p><p>Today the border continues to inspire fear. Dominican-born children of Haitian descent number around 210,000, in a nation of 10 million. Haitians have long been migrant workers,  with many finding seasonal employment in sugar cane fields or other low-wage work, which has become especially crucial in the aftermath of the earthquake. And, like immigrants elsewhere, they are often blamed for taking jobs. At the same time, racialised fears of \"Haitianisation\" are still regularly voiced by politicians and sections of the media, though many Dominicans have expressed shock and anger over the court's decision. But violence is still directed at Haitians; crimes against them often go unreported; <a href=\"http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?NoCache=1&amp;Dato=20130927&amp;Kategori=NEWS&amp;Lopenr=309270154&amp;Ref=AR\" title=\"\">and many continue to live in dire poverty</a>.</p><p>Deportations of workers who have no chance to appeal are common – the Dominican military reported it sent away some <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dominican-ruling-strips-citizenship-20387587\" title=\"\">47,700 Haitians in the past year, up from 21,000 the year before</a>. And now tens of thousands of people who consider themselves Dominicans face a one-way trip to a country where they cannot speak the language, may not have any family, and face extreme economic hardship. The Haitian government  said it \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/haiti-strongly-disagrees-with-dominican-ruling-that-strips-citizenship-of-immigrant-children/2013/10/05/b07141be-2dee-11e3-b141-298f46539716_story.html\" title=\"\">strongly disagrees</a>\" with the decision and <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/01/3663924/haiti-recalls-envoy-activists.html\" title=\"\">has recalled its ambassador to the Dominican Republic</a> for consultations on the implications of the ruling.</p><p>Anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic reaches back decades, if not centuries; unacknowledged and institutionalised, it has been manipulated and put to political use. Rather than being united by their shared histories, the two sides of Hispaniola remain riven by an unresolved past. It is not yet clear how this ruling will be turned into policy, but in facing such an uncertain future, these Dominicans also carry with them a heavy burden of the past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419097404|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|7f1f5dd8deb0d2a90e819146ce8841aee4fb2b83 -->",

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-special-forces-libya-somalia\" title=\"\">US attacks on Somalia and Libya </a>over the weekend were against lawless parts of the world that harbour dangerous people intent, so we are told, on causing mayhem outside their borders. Someone needs to deal with them. Yet both these countries have been subject to massive western intervention, supposedly to set them on the path to democracy and good order. As with the failed Somalian kidnap, something went wrong there too.</p><p>The attempt to curb international violence is taking ever newer forms. In Britain the centralisation of crime-fighting has been a bad joke for years, as the Home Office invents one \"British FBI\" after another. It has splurged money on bureaucrats, while the frontline is cut back. This week the government has invented yet another body, the £450m <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/national-crime-agency-theresa-may-europol-keith-bristow\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>, with the crass motto \"We instil fear\".</p><p>The reality is that ordinary policing of terrorism in most European countries has a decent record. There have been no serious terrorist massacres in Britain since 2005. The US seems equally safe. The stories that have emerged suggest this is largely the result of local tip-offs and good intelligence work rather than any drastic extension of police powers or global derring-do.</p><p>All the best police work is local. The best tip-offs are local, the best knowledge is local. It was a failure of local intelligence in Pakistan that meant it took the Americans more than a decade to find Osama bin Laden. The future of western security lies not in the courage of special forces or the deployment of drone squadrons and snatch squads. It lies in dogged police work, and in not provoking or abusing the sovereignty of countries that may so readily offer refuge and support to terrorists.</p><p>If one thing has been proved beyond a doubt, the surest way to endanger the west is to proliferate the hamfisted interventions that have made Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere a ready refuge for those who want to take revenge on westerners. To go crashing about the world arresting and doubtless mistreating suspects is a desperate throw. It makes good headlines but it does no good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419231327|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|f6d28659359cad54f33fdf4408c1f44b38b1e46e -->",

        "headline":"Is Buddhism a religion?",
        "body":"<p>What first attracted me to Buddhism in the years that followed my slow abandonment of formal Christianity wasn't anything intellectual but had to do rather with imagination, with images of liberation. I was struck by the serenity of the figure of the Buddha, its representation of self-possession and calm. There was danger there, the temptation towards a too-easy and precipitate appropriation of a demeanour that depended upon arduous and sometimes unappetising struggle. Nevertheless, Buddhism was attractive and it seemed to be a way of rediscovering something that seemed to be missing, without requiring an entrance fee in the form of religious or metaphysical belief.</p><p>I suppose that what was missing was \"spirituality\". But this raises the question of whether \"spirituality\" can be extricated from those belief-commitments. Some commentators have pointed out that there is no shortage of metaphysical beliefs in the Buddhist traditions and that its practices and rituals are embedded in worldviews of some complexity and sophistication. They wonder whether Buddhist practices really can be extracted from this environment without damage to their identity, whether the Buddhisms to be found in the contemporary west have become deracinated, cut off from the necessary nourishment of their cultural and metaphysical roots. It may well look like this. Thus, people attest to the therapeutic value of meditation and the NHS is more comfortable with a mindfulness-based psychotherapy than one that makes use of the Christian practice of prayer because it is an efficacious technique with measurable health benefits and it is not \"religious\". Clients don't need a background of religious belief in order to settle down to a spot of meditation.</p><p>Some contemporary groups go out of their way to insist that Buddhism is not \"religious\" and what they seem to imply is, again, that engaging in its practices doesn't depend upon the belief-subscription. These same groups, however, are also quite traditional in their language and their rituals and this should give us pause as we consider this charge of deracination. It is true that many contemporary Buddhist practitioners have done the same de-mythologising job as a previous generation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/04/death-god-theology-elson\" title=\"\">Death of God theologians</a> who were themselves accused of rendering the New Testament into an inoffensive and pallid humanism.</p><p>But it is one thing to seek to liberate Buddhist practice from unsustainable or unbelievable worldviews and another to reduce it to a mere technique, even one that is therapeutic. The usual culprit is the calming technique that makes it easier to carry out the bombing run or makes one a more sharply predatory capitalist. The reason one might want to say that meditation has been reduced to a technique is that it has lost its essential rootedness as a practice of ethical preparation.</p><p>It is traditional to distinguish forms or aspects of meditation in terms of what calms the egocentric or the communal passions and to say that this prepares the practitioner for the essential Buddhist experience of enlightenment or awakening. Now one of the temptations of former Christians is to think that what they might find in Buddhism is some kind of transcendent experience. But this seems too much like nostalgia for God. If there is any kind of transcendence in Buddhism it is a matter of transcending ego-centric self-enclosure. The calming of the passions that Buddhism is interested in is the calming that reduces the dominance of those self-interested feelings that prevent one from seeing what is staring one in the face: one's own real condition and that of others. One is surrounded by the real world but is too preoccupied to notice it.</p><p>In that case Buddhist practice becomes a form of ethical preparation, reducing the forms of self-preoccupation that impede a concern for justice. This aspect of Buddhism has led some commentators to say that it is more like a philosophy of life than a religion. This contrast with religion relies too heavily on the assimilation of religion to religious belief and it neglects the ceremonial and ritual and community-building aspects of the various religions, including Buddhism.</p><p>More positively, though, thinking of Buddhism as a philosophy brings it into dialogue with the ancient conception of philosophy, one of whose essential components was precisely what was called spiritual practice or exercise, the various ways in which one is able to liberate oneself from illusion and make oneself better capable of ethical action and, of course, the ethical refusal to act. It is worth noting that the ancient philosophers tried to live in communities and one can think of a philosophical community, whether instantiated in a Christian congregation, a Buddhist sangha, a humanist group, as serving to protect and support the conditions for that undeluded perception of the world from which issues moral action.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419071811|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|d7406b7d9633d916a76d96038dcabcb17d5046f0 -->",

        "headline":"Kenya terror attack: corruption wasn't to blame",
        "body":"<p>It was difficult to read Giles Foden's article squarely blaming the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi</a> on alleged inadequacies of the Kenyan government and, as he puts it \"rampant corruption\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-behind-terror-rampant-corruption\" title=\"\">Behind terror is corruption</a>, 24 September). The Kenyan military led the operation to free hostages and kill or capture those who had trapped them, and we are proud of the professionalism and determination of our forces.</p><p>Foden says: \"In Kenya crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either.\" And he continues: \"These attacks are part of a spectrum of banditry, with corruption at one end, terrorism at the other, and regular robbery in the middle.\"</p><p>Make a brief comparison with other terrorist attacks. The disasters of 9/11 or the more recent Boston marathon in the US and 7/7 in the UK – both highly developed countries – could hardly be blamed on corruption, so why Kenya? We do not recall Foden blaming corruption within the security agencies involved.</p><p>\"A lot of money has gone into commercial property, and particularly the building of supermarkets. But without governance it all looks very shaky,\" says Foden. But he seems unaware of how much Kenya has changed in the past decade. The country's first truly free and fair multiparty election only took place in 2002, and since then the country has been transformed by a new constitution that gives power to all communities. Less than 10 years ago we introduced free primary education, now over a million children a year go to school.</p><p>Judicial reform, in some cases supported by international experts and donors – including the US and UK – has put the courts out of the political influence that once was common. Anti-corruption campaigns by government and civil society, the requirement for open tenders for government contracts, and the development of a lively media, have transformed the country.</p><p>This is not to say Kenya is perfect – far from it. A multinational forensic investigation currently under way – including with British agents – will examine the tragedy and assess the government's response to it. It shows the extent of our openness that we allow foreign security forces to share in an investigation we could probably manage ourselves.</p><p>At the same time, we will strive to be as open as possible in our actions against al-Qaida and its regional ally al-Shabaab in the coming months, without compromising the security of our country and the safety of our military personnel.</p><p>It is important that there is responsible international reporting. In this age of budget cuts in the international media there are too few foreign journalists with expert experience of Africa living in and reporting from the continent. Kenya suffered a terrible tragedy at Westgate. As information is released in the coming days and weeks, it is crucial – for the sake of the victims and the survivors – that reporting reflects the Kenya of today, and that we are judged by today's reality, not memories of a Kenya past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179702|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|93dbcb21324e39417e66a4a610b3dd331f4f418c -->",

        "headline":"Women: naked realities",
        "body":"<p>Barely a week goes by without a row over whether women should take their clothes off, keep them on or be allowed to cover up completely. Last week, singer Sinéad O'Connor became the latest to offer a view, writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\" title=\"\">an open letter to teen sensation Miley Cyrus</a> advising her not to be so frequently or conspicuously naked lest she allow the music business to act as her \"pimp\".</p><p>On university campuses this term, student unions have been attempting to hold back what they see as a tide of casual misogyny by banning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/20/robin-thicke-blurred-lines-ban\" title=\"\">Robin Thicke's hit Blurred Lines</a>, with lyrics described by one critic as \"rapey\".</p><p>The campaign to persuade the Sun newspaper to drop its topless models has, by contrast, studiously avoided talk of a ban. <a href=\"http://nomorepage3.org/\" title=\"\">No More Page Three</a> wants Rupert Murdoch voluntarily to put the naked \"lovelies\" out of their misery. Nevertheless, the campaigners have been hampered by many public figures immediately assuming that to voice disapproval of Page 3 might associate them with an illiberal wish to introduce censorship.</p><p>Might our nervousness about returning to the days when the lord chancellor could stride on to the stage to stop an objectionable play have made us too tolerant of publishers, musicians and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10355275/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-is-designed-deliberately-to-degrade-women.html\" title=\"\">video game designers </a>who trade in images of women that many find degrading and even dehumanising? Because, for good or ill, the female body and its drapery remains territory where we do battle over our ideas of liberty as well as specific examples of personal choice. \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c782x\" title=\"\">This is a free country</a>,\" David Cameron asserted last week, promising in the next breath full backing to institutions that wish to forbid Muslim women from wearing the niqab, or full-face veil.</p><p>Excessive interference? Or an uncomfortable reminder that the UK's laudable ideal of tolerance and religious freedom has led, in some cases, to moral relativism – a blindness to injustices and injuries that undermine those very freedoms that we cherish, particularly for women. The idea of \"a national debate\" is often decried as a thin disguise, a veil if you like, to partially conceal intolerant ideas. But in these three very different cases – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/sep/20/how-many-wear-niqab-uk\" title=\"\">the still-rare niqab</a>, the daily diet of Page 3 \"lovelies\", and the monotonously omnipresent naked females in popular music – we should keep the conversation alive about our cultural discomforts.</p><p>We applaud Ms O'Connor, the No More Page Three campaigners and Mr Cameron for at least questioning the values of organised religion and commercial entertainment: but no blanket prohibitions, please. Rather, let us have an open discussion – initiated and led by the UK's female citizens, and not merely prompted by some Las Vegas shock merchant making shareable pop videos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419202270|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|ffd617b87b4b1f4974e74b5c64f60a32b457d9dc -->",

        "headline":"Help to Buy: George's marvellous medicine",
        "body":"<p>This Tuesday George Osborne will make arguably his most significant economic intervention since the austerity budget of June 2010. Sadly, it has all the makings of being just as big an error. Like his cuts plan, Mr Osborne's extension of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a> comes with an economic justification but is driven by political motivation. The political imperative was again made clear last week when David Cameron, rattled by Ed Miliband's energy-price cap, decided to bring forward the launch of the scheme from next year to this week. For the austerity Conservatives, this is about being seen to be on the voters' side. By no means is this a new theme, but it has taken on an added sharpness and urgency after the conferences.</p><p>It is in this light that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/10343793/Help-to-Buy-Key-questions-answered.html\" title=\"\">the coalition's new mortgage market booster</a> should be seen. Until this week, the government's Help to Buy scheme allowed first-time buyers to borrow up to 20% of the value of a new-build home from the government, interest-free for the first five years. The Treasury justified this policy as both helping would-be homeowners on to the housing ladder, and spurring on Barratt's and other giant construction firms to do more building. These explanations cannot apply to this latest extension of Help to Buy.</p><p>As of this week, any household – whether first-time or not – will be able to get help buying any kind of home, whether the paint is still drying or it has been around since George&nbsp;II, worth up to £600,000, as long as they can get together a deposit of 5% of the property value. The government will then provide a guarantee to the mortgage lender of a further 15% of the value. On Tuesday Mr Osborne will lay out further details – such as how much the guarantee will cost lenders (a cost which they&nbsp;will presumably recoup from the customers in higher borrowing rate). And after that, going by what housing market analysts are already saying about interest from would-be buyers, there may well be clouds of dust on British high streets as punters rush to their local estate agents.</p><p>Nearly a quarter-century on from the Lawson boom, stoked by another Conservative chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/03/uk-economic-boom-could-be-boomlet\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne may well succeed in creating his own boomlet</a>. It may be patchy, it might be temporary, and it may well be dangerous. But the Tories surely hope that it will give them a fighting chance at the next general election, because electoral calculation runs through this policy like words on a stick of rock. Consider: the average price of a property across Britain is £172,000. Yet the government is underwriting purchases on homes worth up to £600,000.</p><p>It may be cynical to suggest that the cap has been set so high to entice wavering voters in key marginals in the pricier property markets of London and the south-east; then again, it may be blunt common sense. One group who will not benefit from Mr Osborne's £12bn intervention are those who cannot save up the 5% deposit. To help them, the government would need to either: improve regulations on landlords and lettings agents (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/letting-agents-cowboy-and-cowboy\" title=\"\">when ministers are doing the opposite</a>); provide more social or public housing (some hope); or allow property prices to come down from what remain their stratospheric highs. This policy doesn't help the first two objectives, and it positively blocks the last. Instead, it will push a few more Britons up the housing ladder and then yank that ladder away from the estimated 20% who'll have to fight it out in the underregulated private rented sector.</p><p>From the chancellor who inveighed against Labour's culture of debt and the government that vowed to focus on rebalancing the economy, Help to Buy smacks either of hypocrisy or an admission of defeat. If it works, this policy will get economic growth by luring households to borrow more and pump up Britain's historic housing bubble. What's more, it will subsidise banks to lend on property rather than productive enterprise. Encouraging debt rather than creating jobs, Help to Buy poses as a vote-winner. Perhaps, but it is also an economic dead end.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201408|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|12be58408c56e31bd3516c8245bdde5d5300e1cb -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Eddie would go!\" This is the line surfers use to encourage one another to tackle big waves and show some bravado. Eddie Aikau was an Hawaiian lifeguard and fearless surfer who died on duty in 1978 aged 31, and whose achievements are celebrated in <a href=\"http://xgames.espn.go.com/surfing/article/9749881/legend-eddie-aikau-premieres-espn-films-30-30\" title=\"\">a new documentary</a>, Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau. In 10 years, he made more than 500 rescues in Waimea Bay. No lives were lost under his watch, though he often had to brave monstrous 9ft waves. A dedicated peacemaker, he also worked tirelessly to break up fights between the Australian and US surfing teams. In the 1980s, shortly after his death, the sport morphed into a heavily branded multimillion-dollar industry: all logos and big money. But stripped from those artifices, surfing remains much more than just an athletic endeavour: it's a practice that teaches you to be respectful of the environment, courageous in the face of danger, and compassionate towards others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201222|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|95384003b60e09246a085b7ad9e2ef2a9d6f7920 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Stronger oversight\" is frequently demanded as a way of reassuring people about the spying activities and conduct of GCHQ. The problem is that trust has been lost in the current mechanisms: parliament's <a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">intelligence and security committee (ISC)</a> lacks the necessary knowledge and experience and is woefully under-resourced; the interception and intelligence commissioners have a limited remit and are also reluctant to challenge the spooks; senior politicians who sign warrants are unlikely to have the necessary background to ask tough questions, particularly in relation to the effects of changing technologies.</p><p>Some tightening of UK and EU data protection laws may be desirable but, in the end, who wants to be going to the courts all the time?</p><p>The key bits of the two most important pieces of legislation in this area, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) and the Intelligence Services Act, will always require flexible interpretation. There is no perfect oversight solution – any new regime will still lack total transparency – and will involve individuals, almost certainly with high levels of security clearance, sitting in secret.</p><p>But it is important to ask: what do we want oversight to achieve? Similarly, it is necessary to test the current assessment of the threat and whether this justifies the levels of agencies current intrusion (and expenditure).</p><p>It is worth noting there have been fewer than 60 mainland deaths from domestic terrorism since 1989. In 2005, when 52 people died in the London bombings, another 3,201 died in traffic accidents. Is terrorism the persistent existential threat so often used to justify whole-population surveillance?</p><p></p><p></p><p>While it might be desirable for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption\" title=\"\">GCHQ to \"master the internet\"</a>, the range and extent of material now available for harvesting, plus the ease of large-scale data mining, changes the intrusion equation. Is \"you never know, all this data might be useful someday\" a good enough reason to initiate large schemes for mass collection? And do we really think that intrusion only occurs when globally collected data is actually searched?</p><p>There are circumstances when encryption must be broken but, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden's revelations</a>, trust in e-commerce, e-banking and routine business confidentiality precautions, all reliant on crypto and all essential to the economy, is under threat. Who understands and tests GCHQ's judgments on the balance of risk in these matters?</p><p>There is probably not a perfect oversight regime to satisfy all the competing interests, but there is great scope for improvements. In my view, ministers should retain operational authorisation for agency activities – but warrants for interception, including the broad-based section 8(4) Ripa \"certificated\" warrants – should be passed for approval to a court, with short-term provision for retrospective warrant-granting in emergencies. The government should publish an annual fact-based national threat assessment rather than the current simplistic references to \"moderate\", \"substantial\" and \"severe\".</p><p>The ISC should become a proper select committee of the Commons and Lords with no pre-nomination by the prime minister and preferably with a robust chair person. It should have extended permanent staff, including a privacy advocate and academic technical experts not drawn from the intelligence community. And the ISC should hold at least one public session a year with the heads of the agencies and also with key ministers who should provide full, candid information in secret sessions.</p><p>In addition, all future annual ISC reports should cover the changing strategic objectives of agencies and address issues such as transparency, value for money, impact of technological change and commentary on intrusion limitation. The committee should have powers to demand access without the current limitation of potential ministerial veto, as well as the power of no-notice visits.</p><p>The intelligence service commissioners should be given more resources and be authorised to publish the types, purpose and quantity of the interception warrants that have been approved. Meanwhile, GCHQ should also follow the NSA and appoint a civil liberties and privacy officer to advise on all aspects of strategy. Snowden's documents provided details of what the agencies can and are seeking to do. Now that some of that detail is in the public domain GCHQ can, paradoxically, be more candid in discussing some of its activities and judgements. And, rather than concentrating on Snowden's \"traitorous\" nature, perhaps the debate should now turn on ways to achieve greater public support and legitimacy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419184619|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|28ab6bcd5debd5d130a0716fb5cc978eeda8550b -->",

        "headline":"Scientists do speak up, but politicians decide policy",
        "body":"<p>George Monbiot likens me to a dictator who has \"shut down programmes that produce unwelcome findings and sought to muzzle scientists\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/scientists-democracy-dissent-reasonable-boyd\" title=\"\">Muzzle scientists, bin data: this is the new Lysenkoism, 1 October</a>). He goes on to say that \"this is a modern version of Soviet Lysenkoism: crushing academic dissent on behalf of bad science and corporate power\". Nothing can be further from the truth.</p><p>Monbiot selectively quotes me: \"Scientists should be 'the voice of reason, rather than dissent, in the public arena'. Vladimir Putin? Kim Jong-un? No, Professor Ian Boyd,\" he says. The article to which he refers clearly explains that it is indeed the scientist's job to explain their field of work to the public and to ensure that any uncertainties are made clear. This most definitely involves scientists speaking up and the need for transparency in government. The point I was making, which Monbiot obviously didn't grasp, was that it is not their job to make politicians' decisions for them – when scientists start providing opinions about whether policies are right or wrong they risk becoming politicised. A politicised scientist cannot also be an independent scientist.</p><p>\"To be reasonable, when a government is manipulating and misrepresenting scientific findings, is to dissent,\" Monbiot says. But his adversarial politicisation of science is not the solution. Instead, the scientific community needs to understand its role in the complex field of policymaking to ensure that its contribution can be maximised. This means sticking to the scientific evidence and clearly explaining the risk associated with different policy options. It does not mean passing off personal opinion as scientific evidence.</p><p>Monbiot says the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs \"claimed that its field trials of neonicotinoid pesticides on bees showed that 'effects on bees do not occur under normal circumstances'. Hopelessly contaminated, the study was in fact worthless.\" He assumed the government (and implicitly I) had based its position on a single study. This is emphatically not true. It was based on a balanced assessment of all the available scientific evidence. The view arrived at was that the evidence behind the proposed ban of certain neonicotinoid pesticides was poor. Of course, lack of evidence does not amount to lack of impact. But we have little evidence that a ban will eliminate the problems Monbiot believes exist.</p><p>Last, Monbiot questions the link between badgers and bovine tuberculosis. He picks on only one part of a broad evidence base, suggesting figures we have been using have \"been sexed up from inadequate data\". Epidemiological modelling, based on data from <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.badger.org.uk%2F_Attachments%2FResources%2F322_S4.pdf&amp;ei=Y4dRUqr0L4OY0AXyp4GADw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtTi5TpepP4ZkD5-BC1PLBCBzAgQ&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.d2k&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">the Randomised Badger Culling Trial</a>, suggests badgers account for about 50% of bovine TB occurrences in the areas where it is prevalent. There is uncertainty around this number but particular genetic strains of the disease exist in badgers and cattle in the same geographic location. The trial also showed that reducing the density of badgers reduces TB in cattle. Badgers are a part of the disease cycle of bovine TB. However, it is possible to pursue quite different policy options. If scientists start to say one or other option is right or wrong, they begin to take the position of politicians and devalue the scientific evidence they claim to present.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189765|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|5a67b2a3cbbc36ad8fdf09e8cd9ddf0089504dd7 -->",

        "headline":"The US government shutdown is a playground spat that badly damages credibility",
        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|1d5226d3d704630c88921b684a5006897c145d13 -->",

        "headline":"I'd much rather be a slag than a slut",
        "body":"<p>Last week I got asked to speak at an event called <a href=\"http://www.run-riot.com/think/slut-night-other-club\" title=\"\">Slut Night</a>, at a new venture called The Other Club in central London. Organised by some bright young feminists, Slut Night sold out surprisingly fast, as it offered various female writers and performers talking explicitly about the joys of sluttishness. The fanny jokes ran as freely as the wine; it was a right laugh. But when I first heard the name of the event, my immediate reaction was, ugh. That word. Slut. No.</p><p>My immediate reaction should probably have been more specifically – ugh, slut is a grubby little insult and I want no part of it. Ugh, slut is used to pass judgment on women's desires, their social life, the tightness of fabric around their bum, and I'm not interested in trying to reclaim that degree of damage because language reclamation is a pseudo-alchemy and no abusive thing ever turned into a good thing because you sucked the poison out of the sting yourself. Also, ugh, sluttishness – if sexual promiscuity is as emancipatory as I used to think it was, then how come it could only ever emancipate me in cahoots with tequila, kebabs and a really uncomfortable feeling when anyone used highly stressful words such as \"commitment\" or \"love\"?</p><p>But no, my immediate reaction was: ugh, no to sluts – I'd much rather be a slag. You know where you are with the word slag. You are, in my mind, in the closing scene of the greatest film ever made, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091859/\" title=\"\">Rita, Sue and Bob Too</a>, written by the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/12/theatre\" title=\"\">Andrea Dunbar</a> and filmed in 1980s Bradford.</p><p>This is a spoiler, so look away now if you haven't yet seen the greatest film ever made. It closes with the two teenagers, Rita and Sue, lying in Bob's bed. His wife has left him because he's been sneaking off and shagging these schoolgirls in his car. The girls' home lives have fallen apart, too, so one after the other, they've moved in with him. Yes, this is all very creepy, and nobody's saying it's a film that depicts a utopian model of living to which we should all aspire. It's grim. Still, after everything has gone really, horribly wrong, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9-79fHwqpM\" title=\"\">there is a moment of sheer joy when Bob finds them both in his bed and dives right into it</a>. They all beam with happiness. The film ends there – on that dive – a moment of joy that we know can't and won't last. The pure joy of being a slag – as the other characters in the film have already labelled them – Bob, of course, being the biggest slag of them all.</p><p>Why I like slag so much is not because I want to cast aspersions on people's sexual shenanigans, but because it has now become a great all-round handy insult. If you're not convinced, look how skilfully the actor Danny Dyer once deployed the term to discuss terrorism. \"Can't believe it's been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,\" <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/danny-dyer-calls-911-attackers-slags-on-twitter/285600\" title=\"\">he tweeted on 11 September 2012</a>. \"It still freaks my nut out to this day.\"</p><p>Still, I should admit here that my fondness for the word slag doesn't always end well for me. I still shudder with guilt when I think of the time I tweeted a friend and told her to bring another friend, \"that slag\", with her to my house. As a joke. It's a word we use between ourselves, fondly. Only, when I tagged the slag friend, I got her Twitter name slightly wrong and accidentally directed the message to a total stranger with a similar name – who turned out to be a 15-year-old girl in a coma. Whose Twitter account was being run by her loving dad to raise awareness of his daughter's condition. All he could see was that London journalists were insulting his sick child – it took quite a lot of explanation to dig my way out of that one and apologise. Possibly not helped by my friend tweeting him and saying: \"No, you don't understand, it was definitely meant for me and not your daughter, because I really am a massive, massive slag.\"</p><p>I recently met a media studies lecturer who told me he uses #slaggate as an example for his students of how not to use Twitter. Oh God.</p><p>Still, slut feels like a very American word – even if British grandmothers did use it to describe a messy woman who left things on her bedroom floor, not a woman who left her knickers on other people's bedroom floors. Slut is now a word for online porn ads, popping up all over your screen saying that horny sluts with breasts like balloons and buttocks like boiled eggs would like to live-chat with you now.</p><p>Indeed, it turned out that the Slut Night I went to was not about praising the word at all. As the organiser Amelia Abraham explained: \"The goal isn't to reclaim the word 'slut'; it's to completely undermine it.\"</p><p>Slutwalks, organised in cities across the world in defence of women dressing how they want without fear of assault, received criticism from some feminists who felt the word was wrong. I realise they were named after the exact words of a Canadian policeman, but still – I'd probably have gone if they were called slagwalks instead. Let's not put the word slag on the linguistic slagheap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100719|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|9367850b16b6979360333ff03cdb47da9b368e3d -->",

        "body":"<p>\"OMG, you have to watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a>! You simply have to. Stop whatever you're&nbsp;doing and watch it right now. Stop resuscitating that patient, and watch Breaking Bad. Stop flying that plane, crash it into that field and fire up&nbsp;Netflix.\"</p><p>As I understand it, we are now all legally obliged to watch Breaking Bad by&nbsp;the end of 2013. Our prisons are already full to bursting with people who&nbsp;failed to watch The West Wing or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a> when they were expressly told to. I even saw a woman prosecuted last week for not having read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-review\" title=\"\">Gone Girl</a>. What was she thinking?</p><p>These days we are told we simply have to watch, to read or just to do, very many things: 100 Things to Do Before You Die; 100 Films You Have to See, 100 Books You Must Read If You Don't Want Everyone at Work to Realise Exactly What a Shallow, Self-Obsessed, X Factor Fan You Really Are.</p><p>Like most Guardian readers, I am very&nbsp;keen to do what I'm told at all times. If I'm told there are 25 Must-Dive Reefs or 30 Loganberry Recipes You&nbsp;Can't Live Without then I take that&nbsp;responsibility very seriously and immediately go out shopping for scuba equipment and soft fruit.</p><p>But, while I can't stress enough that I&nbsp;don't wish to be a troublemaker, there is a slight problem with the maths.</p><p>The average human being will live for&nbsp;701,844 hours. You will be asleep for 233,600 of those hours (more if you're a&nbsp;cricket fan). You will be working for 74,060 hours (fewer if you're Usain Bolt)&nbsp;and you'll be waiting for your children to hurry up and get their shoes&nbsp;on for 11,850.</p><p>Take off another 200,000 hours for miscellaneous activities such as being on hold for broadband customer service, queuing at Costa Coffee, or looking up pictures of your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend on Facebook.</p><p>You suddenly find yourself with just&nbsp;182,334 useful hours in your life for reading, watching films and baking your signature Loganberry Pecan Flapjacks.</p><p>But it gets worse. Given that you are reading the Guardian you are, let's be honest, at least 40. If you were under 40&nbsp;you'd be reading the cheat codes for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto V</a> instead (FYI, the dirt-bike code is Circle, X, L1, Circle, Circle, L1, Circle, R1, R2, L2, L1, L1). This means your available hours now stand at 91,167. That's what you have left. Just over 90,000 hours. To do everything.</p><p>So, Breaking Bad should be a breeze: just 61 hours, or 0.000667% of the rest of your life. And – I don't know if you've heard – apparently it's amazing.</p><p>But if you wanted to watch every episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jan/12/guardian-50-television-dramas\" title=\"\">the Guardian's Top 50 TV series of all time</a>, that would take up another 2,080 of your precious hours. Add in two new series a year – every year – that you simply have to watch, and that's a further 4,000 hours. Then add in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off</a> and, in&nbsp;all, that's around 6,130 hours of television you simply have to see. That's&nbsp;nearly 7% of your available life</p><p>Watching every film on the BFI's list of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/polls-surveys/greatest-films-all-time\" title=\"\">The Greatest Films of All Time</a> will take you 217 hours (with an extra half-hour if you want to watch the hilarious \"blooper reel\" at the end of Citizen Kane). You will also have to watch at least one new film a month that Charlotte at work keeps banging on about, and one foreign-language film a month because Peter Bradshaw has called it \"a&nbsp;stunning new benchmark for Latvian cinema\". That takes your total for films you simply have to see up to 2,233 hours.</p><p>And now an even bigger problem: books. Let's read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction\" title=\"\">the Observer's 100 Greatest Novels</a>. Add in one new book a month that Charlotte has recommended (I like Charlotte, but I wasn't absolutely convinced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/09/james-bowen-bob-cat-addiction-book\" title=\"\">A Street Cat Named Bob</a>) and one new book a month that the Review section has described as Margaret Atwood meets EL James. Sum&nbsp;total of hours spent on books you&nbsp;simply have to read? 6,360.</p><p>Then you also have to find time to swim with dolphins, to watch the sunset&nbsp;over Machu Picchu, to kiteboard in the Andes, and to do any number of other tiresome things you see people doing in their profile pictures on <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\">Guardian Soulmates</a>.</p><p>There are also 50 boutique hotels you must visit, 100 ways to make&nbsp;your garden or your children happy, and 5,000 fonts you can't PowerPoint without.</p><p>And these, of course, are just the things you have to do. The mandatory things. You will still have to find time for the things you actually like doing, such as popping bubble wrap.</p><p>Isn't it time to end this tyranny? In&nbsp;the 1970s we weren't told what we had to do all the time. Mainly because there were only about eight things you actually could do, so everyone simply did all of them as a matter of course. But&nbsp;there are now too many things in the world, too much stuff. None of the old stuff has gone anywhere, and new things are being added all the time. Citizen Kane still exists, but now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147290/piranha-3dd\" title=\"\">Piranha 3DD </a>does as well.</p><p>Let's end this madness shall we? By&nbsp;all means watch Breaking Bad (I've&nbsp;heard it's good – have you heard it's&nbsp;good?), but the only bit of TV you actually <em>have</em> to see before you die is the&nbsp;episode of Superstars where Kevin Keegan falls off his bike. Use the time I&nbsp;have saved you to watch the TV you&nbsp;actually want to. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/04/pointless-alexander-armstrong-richard-osman\" title=\"\">Pointless</a>, for example.</p><p>The only films from the BFI's list that&nbsp;you must watch are Some Like It Hot, The Godfather and Singin' in the Rain. You have my permission to never watch FW Murnau's 1927 masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hpo5gJK6Jw\" title=\"\">Kenji&nbsp;Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari</a>. Watch them if you want, but you don't have to. You also don't have to watch the Lord of&nbsp;the Rings trilogy (that's 47&nbsp;hours saved right there).</p><p>Of 100 Greatest Novels, you can happily ignore all of them except <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141187495/scoop-a-novel-about-journalists\" title=\"\">Scoop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/dec/13/john-crace-miss-jean-brodie-digested-read\" title=\"\">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a>. I am assuming you've already read To Kill a Mockingbird for O-level. Read Shakespeare if you want to, but you don't have to. (Though if you don't ever&nbsp;read him, you're not allowed to say&nbsp;he's rubbish. Deal?) You should probably read Great Expectations, but feel free to leave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Dickens</a> there. And I&nbsp;think Wuthering Heights is the only&nbsp;Emily Brontë novel worth reading&nbsp;(someone will rise to this, just&nbsp;you wait and see).</p><p>You must never swim with dolphins. If they ever want to swim with you, I'm sure they'll let you know. Forget Machu Picchu; the sunset on the west coast of&nbsp;Scotland is as beautiful as any you'll see in the world, and it's really nearby. And by all means go kiteboarding above the Andes, but that might be the thing you do literally just before you die. And&nbsp;the Guardian would miss your Soulmates subscription.</p><p>In reality there are very few things you actually <em>have</em> to do before you die. They include: ring your mum more often; recycle; watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/24/book-of-mormon-review\" title=\"\">The Book of Mormon</a>.</p><p>Please feel free to leave other suggestions online. The simple things, not the showy things. The things that&nbsp;make the world a better place. I&nbsp;believe, for example, that I've already mentioned popping bubble wrap.</p><p>But before you do that, have you seen Breaking Bad? You must.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983647|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|693a85c3feb1b7e348963ab1206f81b17ae99f52 -->",

        "headline":"The US government shutdown is a playground spat that badly damages credibility",
        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|1d5226d3d704630c88921b684a5006897c145d13 -->",

        "headline":"Australia's economy remains the envy of the developed world",
        "body":"<p>In the three months since I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/27/wayne-swan-resigns-video\">stepped down as treasurer</a>, I have had plenty of time to reflect on Labor's six years of government and contemplate the future. I've spent a lot of it reflecting on the often gaping difference between the perception and actual performance of the Australian economy and why such a gulf exists. It's never more obvious than when I travel overseas to attend international conferences and talk to respected economists and policy-makers, as I&rsquo;ll be doing next week in the US and Europe.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve always been up for a robust discussion on our economy and it is great to have a range of views in our public debate. But I've also been a politician for more than 20 years, so I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that often assertion and opinion in our public debate are bereft of the facts. Our national debate pays a price for this: you could almost set your watch to the rubbish coming from the conservatives and their cheerleaders in the media. As a side note, it's almost comical how quickly the new Abbott government has bolted from its claims of a \"budget emergency\" and \"debt crisis\", instead flagging the need for stimulus spending and government backed debt to build infrastructure.</p> <p>Despite the predictable claims to the contrary, the performance of the Australian economy over the last 20 years has been rock solid, and continues to be outstanding in the face of ongoing global volatility. These are facts readily accepted by the IMF, the OECD and most credible private sector economists, but ignored by those with vested interests and parts of the press.</p> <p>The facts are these. In global terms, there can be no clearer display of strength and resilience than the incredible 22 consecutive years of growth we have achieved. The incredible resilience of our economy has been confirmed yet again in the recently published <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/index.html\">2013 June quarter National Accounts</a> showing GDP growth of 2.6%, a little below trend for the 2012-2013 financial year.</p> <p>It's probably fair to say that Australians have been less aware of our economic strength than the rest of the world, but this isn&rsquo;t their fault. It lies in the refusal of a faction of those who lead and influence debate to deal with hard facts, and who instead are constantly looking to talk the joint down and erode confidence.</p> <p>I recently saw some commentary suggesting Australia&rsquo;s extraordinary record of continuous economic growth was largely \"made-in-China\", might soon come to an end, and that as a nation we didn&rsquo;t have much to show for it. It's not the first time I've seen assertions that Australians have been complacent and profligate consumers of the benefits of the mining investment boom, leaving them ill prepared for lower commodity prices and terms of trade.</p> <p>Whilst these incorrect assertions have been common in our domestic debate, they are damaging to the extent that they filter through to international perceptions. At its core, this diagnosis misses a lot of important developments in recent years and is not supported by evidence, such as the restraint Australian households have shown in response to the terms of trade boom. Household saving has been substantially higher &ndash; spectacularly so after the global financial crisis, but beginning well before that.</p> <p>Australians have not been feckless in their experience of the terms of trade increases over the last 10 years; they have saved an enormous amount of income from the boom. In just the March quarter alone, net saving by Australian households was a massive $44bn of their disposable income. That's the highest quarterly household savings total in our history. It's four times as much as households saved in net terms a decade ago, when the terms of trade boom began. The combination we&rsquo;ve seen of high savings and high investment reassures me that we are not wasting our good fortune &ndash; and to suggest so is incorrect. Australians are saving and investing like never before.</p> <p>It's also not the first time I've seen the myth that Australia&rsquo;s recession-beating performance came largely from riding China&rsquo;s coattails. This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. In their <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2011/Economic-Roundup-Issue-2/Report/Part-2-The-key-quarters\">authoritative post-crisis analysis</a>, Australian treasury officials Steve Morling and Tony McDonald concluded that \"a combination of factors explain the extraordinary resilience of the Australian economy\" during the global financial crisis.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the strength of the Australian financial system was critical in buffeting Australia's economy. As Morling and McDonald note, the decisive measures taken by the Rudd Labor government and our financial regulators to support the financial system \"were important in ensuring continued financial stability in Australia, allowing the flow of credit to households and businesses to continue\".</p> <p>The Treasury officials also conclude that the \"rapid deployment of fiscal stimulus appears to have been effective in increasing domestic demand, with transfers in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 boosting household consumption and putting a floor under business and consumer confidence\".</p> <p>Put simply, in their words, together with the \"first effects of rapid and timely reductions in interest rates in Australia ... fiscal stimulus started to be reflected in increased household cash flow\". To be blunt, it's therefore plainly ridiculous to argue that stimulus worked in China but not in Australia.</p> <p>So what about China? Of course China helped, but Australian mining overall didn&rsquo;t particularly. As Morling and McDonald state, Australian export volumes of metal ores and minerals dropped by 9% in the December quarter of 2008, and were down a cumulative 6.4% over the three quarters to the end of March 2009. The volume of coal, coke and briquettes fell sharply in both the December quarter 2008 and the March quarter 2009, to be over 16% lower over the three quarters. Continuing growth in demand from China helped to partly offset much lower demand from other major trading partners, but overall, mining production contributed only 0.1% to overall real GDP growth of 0.3% over the three quarters or 0.4% to overall growth of 1.8% from the June quarter of 2009 to the December quarter of 2009.</p> <p>And while there&rsquo;s no doubt our economy is in transition and will need new sources of growth beyond the investment phase of the mining boom, mining investment as a share of the economy still remains at record highs. In the June quarter this year, new private business investment remained at around 50 year highs as a percentage of GDP, at around 17.5%. All that investment is now starting to show dividends, as the production and export phases of the mining boom begin to ramp up. In fact, our exports were up an impressive 6.4% over the year to the June quarter 2013.</p> <p>I think BHP Billiton CEO Andrew Mackenzie smashed these claims out of the park <a href=\"http://www.bhpbilliton.com/home/investors/reports/Documents/2013/130805_group_ASMAsiaSocietySpeech.pdf\">when he stated that</a> \"global demand for commodities is expected to grow by up to 75% over the next 15 years as 250m more people move from the Chinese countryside to cities and Asia&rsquo;s middle class approaches 3bn\". For example, Mackenzie noted that \"steel consumption is expected to increase by over 50% in the next 10 years with more than half of this in Asia\". As Mackenzie put it, \"only a handful of countries, of which Australia is one, can currently deliver the volume of resources required for Asia&rsquo;s continued economic growth\".</p> <p>Most significantly, I was struck by the suggestion that Australia has not been served well by the last three years of minority government, particularly with our economy in transition. Of course, even a cursory glance at the sheer size and scale of the long-term economic reforms that the Labor government has put in place over the last three years blows these claims out of the water. These included putting a market price on carbon pollution, reforming resource rent taxation arrangements, boosting superannuation or the massive productivity enhancing investments that have made in infrastructure, skills, education and the National Broadband Network and <a href=\"http://www.disabilitycareaustralia.gov.au/\">Disability Care Australia</a>.</p> <p>These are transformational reforms which will strengthen Australia&rsquo;s economy for decades to come. Of course some of these reforms are about to be repealed, which will pose challenges for the Abbott government and our economy.</p> <p>However, I&rsquo;ll leave the last word on this to Fitch Ratings, which during this term of minority government upgraded Australia to give our nation the gold-plated AAA-rating from all three global ratings agencies for the first time in our history. In March this year, Fitch <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australias-credit-rating-still-aaaok-20130329-2gyct.html\">reaffirmed our AAA rating</a>, saying that \"Australia's high level of political stability and governance is maintained, which supports the country's attractive business climate\".</p> <p>And Fitch didn&rsquo;t stop there. It blew the economic trash-talkers away with its simple declaration that \"Australia has remained one of the strongest performing economies in the AAA universe since the global financial crisis began\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419021892|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|936c54ef9866eb4675a145574a3feb5ae54bd3f9 -->",

        "body":"<p>I begin with a feeling, an affect, which is perhaps personal, perhaps unjustified, but which I nevertheless feel, given the information at my disposal: a feeling of general political impotence. What is currently happening in Greece is something like a concentrate of this feeling.</p><p>Of course, the courage and tactical inventiveness of progressive and anti-fascist demonstrators is cause for enthusiasm. Such things, moreover, are thoroughly necessary. But novel? No, not at all. They are the invariant features of every real mass movement: egalitarianism, mass democracy, the invention of slogans, bravery, the speed of reactions … We saw all of these same things, undertaken with the same energy – joyful and always a little anxious – in May '68, in France. We have seen them more recently in Tahrir Square in Egypt. Indeed, these things must have already been at work in the times of Spartacus or Thomas M&uuml;nzer.</p><p>Let us set out, provisionally, from another point of departure.</p><p>Greece is a country with a very long history, one of universal significance. It is a country, whose resistance to successive oppressions and occupations has a particular historical density. It's a country where the communist movement, including the form of armed struggle, has been very powerful. A country where, even today, the youth set an example by sustaining massive and tenacious revolts. A country where, without a doubt, the classic reactionary forces are very well organised, but where there is also the courageous and ample resource of the great popular movements. A country where there are certainly formidable fascist organisations, but also a leftist party with an apparently solid electoral and militant base.</p><p>Now, everything in this country happens as if nothing could stop the utter domination of capitalism, unleashed by its own crisis. As if, under the direction of ad hoc committees and servile governments, the country had no alternative but to follow the savagely anti-popular decrees of the European bureaucracy. Indeed, with regard to the questions posed and their European &quot;solutions&quot;, the resistance movement looks more like a delaying tactic than the bearer of a genuine political alternative.</p><p>Such is the great lesson of the times, inviting us not only to support the courage of the Greek people with all our strength, but also to join them in meditating on what must be thought and done so that this courage should not be, in a despairing way, a useless courage.</p><p>For what is striking – in Greece above all, but elsewhere as well, particularly in France – is the manifest impotence of the progressive forces to compel even the slightest meaningful retreat of the economic and state powers that are seeking to submit the people unreservedly to the new (though also long-standing and fundamental) law of thoroughgoing liberalism.</p><p>Not only are the progressive forces making no headway, and failing to score even a limited success, but also the forces of fascism have been growing and, against the illusory backdrop of a xenophobic and racist nationalism, now claim to lead the opposition to the European administrations' decrees.</p><p>My feeling is that the root cause of this impotence is not, at bottom, the people's inertia, a lack of courage, or a majority support for &quot;necessary evils&quot;. Many testimonies have shown us that the resources for a vigorous and massive popular resistance exist. Nevertheless, no new thinking of politics has emerged on a mass scale from these attempts, no new vocabulary has emerged from the rhetoric of protest and the union bosses have finally managed to convince everyone that we must wait … for elections.</p><p>I think that what we are experiencing today is instead that the majority of the political categories activists are trying to use to think and transform our current situations are, as they now stand, largely inoperative.</p><p>After the sweeping movements of the 1960s and 1970s, we have inherited a very long counter-revolutionary period, economically, politically and ideologically. This counter-revolution has effectively destroyed the confidence and power that were once able to commit popular consciousness to the most elementary words of emancipatory politics – words, to cite a few at random, like &quot;class struggle&quot;, &quot;general strike&quot;, &quot;revolution&quot;, &quot;mass democracy&quot;', and many others. The key word of &quot;communism&quot;, which dominated the political stage since the beginning of the 19th century, is itself henceforth confined to a sort of historical infamy. That the equation &quot;communism equals totalitarianism&quot; should come to appear as natural and be unanimously accepted is an indication of how badly revolutionaries failed during the disastrous 1980s. Of course, we also cannot avoid an incisive and severe criticism of what the socialist states and communist parties in power, especially in the Soviet Union, had become. But this criticism should be our own. It should nourish our own theories and practices, helping them to progress, and not lead to some kind of morose renunciation, throwing out the political baby with the historical bathwater. This has led to an astonishing state of affairs: regarding a historical episode of capital importance for us, we have adopted, practically without restriction, the point of view of the enemy. And those who haven't done so have simply persevered in the old lugubrious rhetoric, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Of all the victories of our enemy, this symbolic victory is among the most important.</p><p>Back in the day of the old communisms, we used to heap mockery on what we called <em>langue de bois</em>, or hackneyed, cliched language – empty words and pompous adjectives.</p><p></p><p>Of course, of course. But the existence of a common language is also that of a shared idea. The efficacy of mathematics in the sciences – and it cannot be denied that mathematics is a magnificent <em>langue de bois</em> – has everything to do with the fact that it formalises the scientific idea. The ability to quickly formalise the analysis of a situation and the tactical consequences of that analysis. This is no less required in politics. It is a sign of strategic vitality.</p><p>Today, one of the great powers of the official democratic ideology is precisely that it has, at its disposal, a <em>langue de bois</em> that is spoken in every medium and by every one of our governments without exception. Who could believe that terms like &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;freedoms&quot;, &quot;human rights&quot;, &quot;balanced budget&quot;, &quot;reforms&quot;, and so on, are anything other than elements of an omnipresent <em>langue de bois</em>? We are the ones, we militants without a strategy of emancipation, who are (and who have been for some time now) the real aphasics! And it is not the sympathetic and unavoidable language of movementist democracy that will save us. &quot;Down with this or that&quot;, &quot;all together we will win&quot;, &quot;get out&quot; &quot;resistance!&quot;, &quot;it is right to rebel&quot; … This is capable of momentarily summoning forth collective affects, and, tactically, this is all very useful – but it leaves the question of a legible strategy entirely unresolved. This is too poor a language for a situated discussion of the future of emancipatory actions.</p><p>The key to political success certainly lies in the force of rebellion, its scope and courage. But also in its discipline, and in the declarations that it is capable of – declarations having to do with a positive strategic future, and that reveal a new possibility that remained invisible amid the enemy's propaganda. This is why the existence of sweeping popular movements does not by itself furnish a political vision. What cements a movement on the basis of individual affects is always of a negative character: the sort of thing that proceeds from abstract negations, like &quot;down with capitalism&quot;, or &quot;stop the layoffs&quot;, or &quot;no to austerity&quot;, or &quot;down with the European troika'&quot;, which have strictly no other effect than provisionally soldering the movement with the negative frailty of its affects; as for more specific negations, since their target is precise and they bring together different strata of the population, like &quot;down with Mubarak&quot;, during the Arab spring, they can indeed achieve a result, but they can never construct the politics of that result, as we see today in Egypt and in Tunisia, where reactionary religious parties reap the rewards of the movement, to which they have no true relation.</p><p></p><p>For every politics becomes the regimentation of what it affirms and proposes, and not of what it negates or rejects. A politics is an active and organised conviction, a thought in action that indicates unseen possibilities. Watchwords like &quot;resistance!&quot; are certainly suitable for bringing individuals together, but they also risk making such an assembly nothing more than a joyful and enthusiastic mixture of historical existence and political frailty, only to become, once the enemy (who is far better politically, discursively and governmentally equipped) wins the day, a bitter redoubling and sterile repetition of failure.</p><p>It's not in the contagion of a negative affect of resistance that we might find what it takes to compel a serious retreat of the reactionary forces that, today, seek to disintegrate every form of thought and action that refuses to follow them. It is in the shared discipline of a common idea and the increasingly widespread usage of a homogeneous language.</p><p>The reconstruction of such a language is a crucial imperative. It is to this end that I have sought to reintroduce, redefine and reorganise everything that hinges on the word &quot;communism&quot;. The word &quot;communism&quot; denotes three fundamental things. First, it denotes the analytic observation according to which, in today's dominant societies, freedom, whose democratic fetishisation we're all familiar with, is, in fact, entirely dominated by property. &quot;Freedom&quot; is nothing but the freedom to acquire every possible commodity without any pre-established limit, and the power to do &quot;what one wants&quot; is strictly measured by the extent of this acquisition. Someone who has lost any possibility of acquiring something does not, as a matter of fact, have any kind of freedom, as is plain to see, for instance, with the &quot;vagabonds&quot; that the English liberals of rising capitalism executed by hanging, without any qualms. This is the reason why Marx, in the Manifesto, declares that all the injunctions of communism can, in a sense, be reduced to just one: the abolition of private property.</p><p>Next, &quot;communism&quot; signifies the historical hypothesis according to which it is not necessary that freedom be ruled by property, and human societies be directed by a strict oligarchy of powerful businessmen and their servants in politics, the police, the military and the media. A society is possible in which what Marx calls &quot;free association&quot; predominates, where productive labour is collectivised, where the disappearance of the great non-egalitarian contradictions (between intellectual and manual labour, between town and country, between men and women, between management and labour, etc) is under way, and where decisions that concern everyone are really everyone's business. We should treat this egalitarian possibility as a principle of thought and action, and not let go of it.</p><p>Finally, &quot;communism&quot; designates the need for an international political organisation. It endeavours to set people's inventive thinking in motion, to construct, in a fashion unalloyed with the existing state, a power internal to any given situation. The goal is for this power to be capable of bending the real in the direction prescribed by the tying together of principles with the active subjectivity of all who have the will to transform the situation in question.</p><p>The word &quot;communism&quot; thus names the complete process by which freedom is freed from its non-egalitarian submission to property. That this word has been the one that our enemies have most doggedly opposed has to do with the fact that they cannot endure this process, which would indeed destroy their freedom, the norm of which is fixed by property. If that is what our enemies detest above all, then it is with its rediscovery that we must begin.</p><p>Have these verbal exercises taken us far afield from Greece and the concrete urgency of the situation? Perhaps. However, a politics [<em>une politique</em>] is always the encounter between the discipline of ideas and the surprise of circumstances. My wish is for Greece to be, for us all, the universal site of such an encounter.</p><p>• This is an edited extract of an article in <a href=\"http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/our-contemporary-impotence\" title=\"\">Radical Philosophy</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418835691|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|f3b8a686a1fd4e76fc7941a2f38f3532be787fa8 -->",

        "headline":"Sinéad O'Connor – don't assume Miley Cyrus is a victim",
        "body":"<p>Sinéad O'Connor's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">open letter to Miley Cyrus</a> isn't entirely helpful to women. While O'Connor's warnings about young artists being exploited by the music industry should be taken seriously, the implication is that naked or other sexual images of women inevitably entails the woman being a victim. Why should this be the case? How boring a world without any images of nudity would be. There would be no celebration of the immense power of sexuality, no eroticism.</p><p>O'Connor doesn't use the word objectification in her letter, but the idea that looking upon women's naked or semi-naked bodies necessarily means the disempowerment of women underlies her words. When O'Connor writes, \"you ought be protected as a precious young lady\", and says that female nudity makes young women \"prey for animals and less than animals\", she equates women's bodies with vulnerability and violence.</p><p>It's a similar rhetoric to that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/10/anti-page-3-the-sun-campaigner\" title=\"\">No More Page Three campaign</a>. <a href=\"http://nomorepage3.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"\">A quote on its website</a>, for example, states that the Page 3 image is \"a sex object\" and then immediately, with no other nuance, relates this to \"300,000 women being sexually assaulted and 60,000 raped each year\".</p><p>Perhaps you can already see the problem here. It is not women's bodies or images of them that cause the exploitation of women or violence against women. The perpetrators are to blame. If women's bodies were to blame for any violence or exploitation of women, then rapists would be justified in claiming their victims were asking for it by looking attractive. The rhetoric of objectification actually feeds that which it claims to protect women against – the equation of female nudity with exploitation and violence. What the world needs is not the idea that women are precious victims. Women need to be able to behave in a sexual way without exploitation or violence being considered a necessary outcome.</p><p>O'Connor's line \"your body is for you and your boyfriend\" is not far off from saying that a woman should only be seen by her husband – which may be OK if that is what she wants, but where does that leave women who don't have boyfriends or husbands, or who want to be promiscuous?</p><p>We live in times when hugely powerful women like Rihanna and Beyonce could be said to objectify themselves and other women in their videos. But the simplistic formula that images of women's bodies are always objectifying is old-fashioned and plays into the idea of feminists as asexual. Young women need to know that when they take off their clothes, they are still in charge of themselves.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418993243|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|aea5780159e3a638b58dc69e3abcf42e17a7047d -->",
