        "body":"<p>Christmas always comes early for Roma supporters. Their messiah was born on 27 September, not in a Bethlehem stable but instead room 12 of the Fabia Mater clinic in Rome. Francesco Totti was sent to earth to distract them from their sins, and lead them into footballing glory.</p><p></p><p>As such, his birthday is a time of great celebration. This year many fans gathered outside Roma's training base in Trigoria to give thanks. A plane flew overhead trailing the message: \"History speaks for you\". Inside, Totti was presented <a href=\"http://www.forzaroma.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/trono.jpg\" title=\"\">with a throne bearing his name and number</a>, as well as a remarkable 37kg cake <a href=\"http://www.giallorossi.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/torta-totti.jpg\" title=\"\">featuring a partial replica of the Colosseum</a>.</p><p></p><p>At 37 years old, most players would have been plotting an imminent retirement; Totti instead toasted the two-year contract extension that he had signed a week previously. He might also have been reflecting on his role in a brand new footballing miracle: the resurrection of AS Roma.</p><p></p><p>The club had been pronounced dead just four months previously, by supporters of their city rivals Lazio. Celebrating a 1-0 victory over Roma in the final of the Coppa Italia, fans of the Biancocelesti put together a grand funeral procession– <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpuZW7SPR8Q\" title=\"\">complete with hearse and wailing widow</a>.</p><p>The stunt itself did not hurt Roma fans as much as the fear that their team was indeed fading. For the second year running, the Giallorossi had failed to qualify for Europe. A season that begun amidst great optimism, with Zdenek Zeman's re-appointment as manager prompting a boom in season ticket sales, had ended with their team 25 points adrift of champions Juventus.</p><p></p><p>Matters only got worse over the summer, as Roma sold off both of their two leading scorers from last season – Pablo Osvaldo and Erik Lamela – as well as the promising young centre-back Marquinhos, in a bid to balance the books. On top of all that, they appointed a manager, Rudi Garcia, who many of their fans had never heard of.</p><p></p><p>The Frenchman failed to endear himself to his new public, suggesting that a group of Ultras who turned up to jeer the team during a preseason training session must actually be Lazio supporters. A poll by Corriere dello Sport found that less than half of readers believed he was the man to turn things around.</p><p></p><p>Totti, though, was impressed. Zeman had never shielded his team from public criticism, instead encouraging it when he openly criticised Daniele De Rossi's attitude in training and accused other players of misinterpreting his tactical schemes. Garcia took the opposite approach, handing down stern admonishments behind closed doors but refusing to hear a bad word said by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>On the pitch, his team's performances left little room for criticism. By the time of Totti's birthday, Roma had already won all five games that they had played, including a derby victory over Lazio. Two days later they made it six out of six, crushing Bologna 5-0.</p><p></p><p>Already they were into uncharted territory. Never in the club's history had they won more than four consecutive games to start a season. But now the real challenge had arrived. Despite the victory over Lazio, there was still a perception that Roma had benefited from a relatively soft opening set of fixtures. Their seventh game would provide a real test, taking them to face Inter at San Siro.</p><p></p><p>The Nerazzurri had made an impressive start of their own, dropping just four points in six games under new manager Walter Mazzarri. Even the champions, Juventus, had settled for a draw when they visited Inter a few weeks previously.</p><p></p><p>Garcia promised in the days leading up to the game that his team would seek nothing less than a win. Even he, though, cannot have envisaged quite what a win it would be.</p><p></p><p>Totti opened the scoring in the 18th minute, taking a pass from Gervinho on the edge of the D and crashing a first-time shot into the bottom corner of Inter's goal. He added another goal in the 40th, blasting a penalty beyond Samir Handanovic.</p><p></p><p>The forward's most briliant intervention, however, might be the one that he made another four minutes later, when he controlled a partial clearance on his chest and then the side of his boot, before swivelling away from Alvaro Pereira to release Kevin Strootman <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVhGGbNZtsM\" title=\"\">before the ball had even hit the ground </a>. The Dutchman raced upfield before teeing up Alessandro Florenzi to score Roma's third and final goal.</p><p></p><p>The game finished 3-0 to the visitors. They had enjoyed some good fortune – Fredy Guarín hit the post for Inter when the score was still 1-0, while replays suggested that Gervinho had actually been just outside the area for the foul that led to Totti's penalty. But Roma were good value for their win. They had taken the game to their opponents from the get-go without ever threatening to leave themselves exposed.</p><p></p><p>Totti was the consensus choice for man of the match, and indeed for Roma's man of the season so far. Playing as the central striker in Garcia's 4-3-3, he has seemed at times to be reprising the role that he played in Luciano Spalletti's 'strikerless' 4-6-0 – dropping deep and denying opponents their usual points of reference. He had only scored once before Sunday, but leads Serie A with six assists.</p><p></p><p>In recent games, though, Totti has also shared the stage with Gervinho – a player reborn following his summer switch from Arsenal. The Ivorian's speed and directness have been key assets for Roma, allowing them to transition rapidly from defence to attack. Before Saturday, he had also scored three goals in the last two games.</p><p></p><p>\"Every day in Africa a gazelle wakes up and wishes it could be as fast as Gervinho,\" raved Sebastiano Vernazza in Sunday's Gazzetta Sportiva. Tonino Cagnucci took the hyperbole even further in the fan-produced publication Il Romanista, declaring that: \"Now Africa has its Messi\".</p><p></p><p>Several other new signings have also excelled. Kevin Strootman's power and drive in the middle of the park have overwhelmed opponents, while Mehdi Benatia has been unflappable in central defence.</p><p></p><p>The real star, though, has not been any of those players but rather Garcia himself. Through seven games, his team has scored 20 goals and conceded just one. Those numbers are remarkable enough before you consider the fact that Roma had one of the worst defensive records in the whole division last season, giving up 56 goals in 38 games.</p><p></p><p>Garcia's sister, Sandrine, told reporters in France last week that even at 10 years old Rudi would spend hours re-arranging his Subbuteo teams into different formations to see which ones worked best. But if the manager's tactics are certainly functioning well, his most striking achievement has simply been to instil such confidence in his players so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Last year's Roma, after all, might have been capable of grabbing a three-goal lead away from home, but they could never have maintained it so serenely.</p><p></p><p>\"What really matters is our heads,\" said Totti after Saturday's win. \"With a clear head anything is possible.\" Corriere dello Sport's editor Paolo De Paola put it another way: \"Roma have freed themselves from fears, nonsense and never-ending controversies,\" he wrote. \"They stuck their inherited insecurities in the loft and became resolute.\"</p><p></p><p>So much are Roma's players in awe of their new manager, that they are even reported to have given his half-time team-talk on Saturday a round of applause. More importantly, they also took it to heart, heeding his warning not to leave room for complacency.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even those sceptical fans seem to have been won round. Roma returned to Fiumicino airport at around 2am on Sunday morning to find nearly <a href=\"http://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/serie_a/roma/2013/10/06-336734/Serie+A+Roma%2C+che+accoglienza+a+Fiumicino+FOTO-VIDEO\" title=\"\">1,000 supporters waiting to greet them</a>.</p><p></p><p>Garcia would prefer that they had not. He has repeatedly stressed the need for people not to get ahead of themselves, pointing out on Saturday that there were still 93 points left to play for. \"It's better just to focus on our objective of getting back into Europe, rather than talking about the Scudetto and disappointing our supporters down the line,\" he said. \"And please don't talk about a revolution. That's an important word in France.\"</p><p></p><p>Precise use of language is important to Garcia, who made a point of learning Italian as quickly as he could after taking the job. But no amount of word play can dissipate the excitement that his team is generating. Just seven teams in the history of Serie A have ever begun a season with seven consecutive wins, and only one of those (Inter in 1966-67) failed to win the Scudetto.</p><p></p><p>Now the fans have a full two weeks to savour this result, and to look ahead to another key fixture against Napoli once the teams return from the international break. Roma has died and Roma is risen, but even Totti does not yet know quite what comes next.</p><p></p><p><em>Talking points to follow …</em></p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=13\" title=\"\">The full Serie A table</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419238660|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6af7586eb1f37b12f710d342d5d29f0c27e24afc -->",

        "body":"<p>Harry Redknapp does not believe the Football Association's senior officials are equipped to make high-level sporting decisions and said he \"would not trust them to show him a good manager if their lives depended on it\".</p><p>Redknapp was considered to be the clear favourite to take the England job when Fabio Capello resigned last year, but the FA opted to approach Roy Hodgson, then in charge at West Bromwich Albion.</p><p>It had been considered a near-certainty that Redknapp would leave Tottenham to take the job, and he has admitted he believed as much himself, going as far as asking Brendan Rodgers, then at Swansea and now at Liverpool, to be his assistant at Euro 2012.</p><p>Although Redknapp maintains he holds no grudge against Hodgson, Redknapp is still unhappy and claims he was the leading choice with the fans and the players, suggesting senior members of the national squad like Steven Gerrard texted him to offer their support for him to succeed Capello.</p><p>\"I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it. How would they know? What clubs have they ever run? Who do they speak to who really knows the game?\" the QPR manager said in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail.</p><p>\"This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue. And they get to pick the England manager.</p><p>\"Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job. I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry. But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager – a man who is more their cup of tea.\"</p><p>While Redknapp was expected to leave Tottenham for England, he ended up leaving them without a job at all as the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy parted company with him that summer.</p><p>A number of Spurs fans had held the belief Redknapp had allowed the England job to become the focus of his attention and, despite denying that, he has confessed to making plans for the national team while in the Tottenham dugout.</p><p>\"If I had become the England manager I would have taken Brendan Rodgers as my number two,\" he added. \"My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?</p><p>\"So when Tottenham played Swansea on April 1, 2012, I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championship in the summer as my part-time coach?</p><p>\"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it.</p><p>\"Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day, by the way.</p><p>\"It didn't work out. On April 1, I was contemplating the way forward for England with Brendan Rodgers – and on April 29 the FA offered the job to Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"I'll admit, I thought it was mine. Everyone seemed so certain, everyone I had met from all parts of the game seemed utterly convinced it was my job.\"</p><p>Redknapp believes that the issue of compensation to Tottenham remains one of the reasons why he was never asked.</p><p>\"I'm sure the FA would deny they were interested in me anyway, they always like to say they got their No1 choice, but maybe what helped make their minds up was the thought of writing a cheque in the region of £16million to Levy.</p><p>\"He is known for driving a hard bargain at the best of times; get Daniel on a bad day and I would have ended up more expensive than Capello – and the FA were already getting a lot of criticism over his £6m-a-year salary.</p><p>\"Of all the reasons doing the rounds for me not becoming England manager, the compensation issue makes most sense.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419236317|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|86ccc1920854f86df6c7ff5b8e0b7deaae4a5533 -->",

        "headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action",
        "body":"<h2>1) Rodgers's grumblings were justified</h2><p>It is unusual to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">hear a manager criticising</a> the manner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league\" title=\"\">of a 3-1 win</a> and even more striking when the manager in question is Brendan Rodgers, a man not averse to accentuating the positives at Liverpool. He was justified in his complaints after Saturday's defeat of Crystal Palace, however. No team reflects the openness of this Premier League season better than Liverpool, who sat top of the table on Saturday night but have yet to produce a commanding 90-minute display in this campaign. Rodgers lamented the \"lack of control\" behind the otherwise impressive front two of Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge and Palace had enough opportunities to disturb Liverpool's incisive first-half display. It was encouraging to hear the manager at the Premier League summit demanding improvement, although Anfield would happily listen to that criticism every week if the table remained the same. \"We'll get better in the second half of the season,\" said Rodgers. \"But it was critical that we made a good start. I believe that we have still got a lot of improvement to make which is good, especially if we continue with this mentality of winning games. We've won five out of seven but there is still a lot of improvement to do.\" <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><h2>2) Will Moyes stick with Januzaj?</h2><p>David Moyes claimed he would have started Adnan Januzaj three or four weeks ago, but for injuries elsewhere which scuppered his plan. It will now prove a source of intrigue whether or not the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/david-de-gea-manchester-united-sunderland\" title=\"\">United manager continually picks the 18-year-old</a>, both at home and in Europe, or reverts back to the experienced performers who had struggled earlier in the season. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p><h2>3) All hail Allardici</h2><p>Sam Allardyce once speculated that he might be taken more seriously as a tactician and, therefore, considered for the very top jobs, if he had a European-sounding surname. At White Hart Lane on Sunday, the West Ham United manager contented himself with aping Spain's 4-6-0 formation, which had triumphed at Euro 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league\" title=\"\">to enjoy a memorable 3-0 win</a>. He positively basked in the post-match acclaim. 'No, no, don't call me a managerial genius (but you can if you want)', was the subtext to a line from his press conference. André Villas-Boas hated it. The Tottenham Hotspur manager gave Allardyce and West Ham absolutely no credit. He said that their goals had come from a set-piece, a fluke and a one-man break against two of his defenders. Allardyce's tactics had emphatically not thrown him. \"It's nothing to do with the strategy but you can write whatever you want,\" Villas-Boas huffed. Having been outwitted in the second-half by Chelsea's José Mourinho the previous weekend, this was a low point. Allardyce is riding high. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p><h2>4) Pellegrini finds the 'release pressure' valve</h2><p>There was a first at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/joe-hart-manchester-city-everton\" title=\"\">Manchester City's 3-1 win over Everton</a>: the sight of a Manuel Pellegrini discarding his billing as the calm patrician of the technical area to become, well, a touch animated. This collector's item came in two parts. The opening stanza featured the Chilean exchanging some involved words with James Milner after Romelu Lukaka's opener for Everton that may or may not have been a telling-off for the midfielder. Then, in the second half, when Aleksandar Kolarov had to depart due to a facial injury, Pellegrini, to use the parlance, \"lay into\" both the left-back's proposed replacement, Gaël Clichy, and Brian Kidd, his assistant, after the Frenchman had sat back down after warming up. Coming soon to a Premier League dugout near you: a water-bottle kicking, fourth-official berating, opposition manager-baiting Pellegrini … <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><h2>5) Mackay knows better than to take on Cardiff's owner</h2><p>The Cardiff players said before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/newcastle-cardiff-alan-pardew\" title=\"\">Saturday's defeat to Newcastle</a> that they were thinking of asking the manager, Malky Mackay, to ban the club's owner, Vincent Tan, from the dressing room after a row over bonuses. The dispute has been resolved but ill feeling lingers and Tan did not make his usual appearance in the changing room after the final whistle. So was he barred from doing so? Hardly. The mega-rich Malaysian owns the club, and to ban him from any part of it would be akin to barring him from his own front room. Tan did not make his millions from being compliant, he is a tough task master and Mackay, who is nobody's fool, is not about to take him on. <strong>Joe Lovejoy</strong></p><h2>6) Mourinho has bench-warming game-changers at his disposal</h2><p>While Chris Hughton, perhaps rather harshly, starts fretting again over his position at Carrow Road with a trip to Arsenal to come after the international break, Chelsea can warm to their newfound squad depth. Much is justifiably made of their lack of goals up front, with the three senior strikers on the Londoners' books having yet to register in the league while Romelu Lukaku already boasts four on loan at Everton. Yet José Mourinho still benefits from game-changers on his bench. He could fling on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/norwich-city-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Eden Hazard and Willian against Norwich</a>, with the two-time European Cup winner Samuel Eto'o also making a contribution as the visitors shape-shifted boldly in a bid to conjure a winner. Last year the management might have been looking to Yossi Benayoun or Marko Marin to inspire such a victory having been pegged back. Mourinho will need more than one transfer window before he is content with the balance of his squad, but others would be envious of the options already at his disposal. The strikers may not be scoring, but the collective boasts personnel who can inspire revivals. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p><h2>7) Pochettino's quick thinking swung the game</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/southampton-swansea-premier-league-matchreport\" title=\"\">Swansea will play worse and win</a>. After Southampton took the lead through Adam Lallana after 19 minutes, Swansea dominated for long enough for the edginess in the crowd to become very apparent and it was only the excellence of Artur Boruc and some wasteful finishing that prevented them from equalising before half-time. At the start of the second half, Swansea's control only became more pronounced and a goal felt inevitable. Mauricio Pochettino had started the game with his side set up in a 4-4-2 formation, Rickie Lambert and Daniel Osvaldo partnering each other in attack, but now Southampton were getting overwhelmed in midfield. Pochettino, however, did not sit there hoping for the best. Instead he reacted. He removed Southampton's biggest name, Osvaldo, and brought on a teenager, James Ward-Prowse, to bolster his side's midfield in the 58th minute and Swansea soon ran out of ideas. Another goal did indeed arrive - but not for Swansea. Pochettino is becoming increasingly impressive. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><h2>8) Is Wenger wrong to doubt Wilshere's scoring credentials?</h2><p>\"I don't think he will ever be a goalscorer,\" Arsène Wenger said when a journalist in the Hawthorns pressroom pointed out that Jack Wilshere had recently described his own goals record as \"embarrassing.\" Yet in the next sentence, Wenger also pointed out a lot of people had previously thought the same about another of the players in the Arsenal dressing room. \"Let's not forget we had the same problem with [Aaron] Ramsey a while ago. Once they start to score it comes naturally.\" Wilshere, he added, is \"a player who can provide chances for others ... in our job, it's quite simple, you need players who score and players who give the balls to those who score. He's more in the second category but of course from that category you want a few goals as well, so it's good that he knows he can do it.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/west-brom-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">Wilshere's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at West Brom</a> was his first goal in the Premier League since a 4-2 win at Aston Villa in November 2010 (though, in mitigation, a lot of that time has been spent missing through injury). In total, he has two in 82 appearances. All the same, it was strange for Wenger to say, as his first reaction, there would never be a time when Wilshere scored with regularity. Of course, Wilshere will always be a creator but he strikes the ball so accurately, and is such an elusive opponent, is it expecting too much to think if he stays injury-free that eight to ten goals a season should be beyond him? <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p><h2>9) Stoke may need to embrace a familiar plan B</h2><p>Rightly or wrongly, Tony Pulis has taken a battering of late – last week Kenwyne Jones called Stoke's style under the Welshman \"more or less kick-and-hope. I think team-mates could testify it was very hard to come by chances.\" And yet, under a new manager and ethos, converting these chances has been sorely lacking of late – Stoke are the Premier League's lowest scorers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/fulham-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">In their 1-0 loss to Fulham</a>, Stoke dominated possession for long periods and were unlucky not to be given a penalty but failed to fashion clear-cut chances and still looked most dangerous from set-pieces; Robert Huth header from a corner being his his team's only effort on target. Mark Hughes should be admired for trying to establish his own legacy, but in games where Stoke lack incision, as they did on Saturday, he might have to accept that with the attributes of his current squad, Jones et al, 'kick-and-hope' remains an ugly but effective plan B. <strong>Michael Butler</strong></p><h2>10) Where to start at Hull?</h2><p>The former Real Madrid director general Jorge Valdano once compared games between Liverpool and Chelsea to \"shit on a stick\", but relative to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/premier-league-hull-aston-villa\" title=\"\">Hull and Villa</a>, both \"shit\" and \"stick\" become comparatively fascinating and metaphorically redemptive. Accordingly, not even The Guardian has the brass neck to manufacture a talking point out of a match so soul-curdlingly sordid – but for the fact that it just has. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189766|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|df987e5342f542dd43e11699b01304a15c6def24 -->",

        "body":"<p>Manchester United are to give the teenage sensation <strong>Adnan Januzaj</strong> a <strong>2,900% pay rise</strong>, reports the Sun, in an effort to keep him at Old Trafford. If the nation's biggest-selling newspaper is right United's offer would up the starlet's salary from the relatively miserly £1,000 a week he's earning now to £30,000. But there's wild uncertainty about the precise deal on the table, with Metro putting it at £50,000 a week and The Mail reckoning United's generous moneymen will be willing to go to £60,000. Talking of Manchester United, kind of, their former first-team coach <strong>Rene Meulensteen</strong> could shortly be back in Premier League employment after he was offered a job by <strong>Fulham</strong>, though there are said to be several more lucrative offers on the table.</p><p></p><p>Talking of coaches, Harry Redknapp's autobiography is being exclusively serialised in the Mail, where today's key revelations are that Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and John Terry all texted saying they wanted him to get the England job, and that he had already lined up Brendan Rodgers as his part-time temporary international assistant for the European Championships.</p><p>\"He had players at Swansea passing it like Franz Beckenbauer,\" Redknapp reveals. \"My thinking with Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea, what can he do with Rio and Terry and Rooney and Gerrard? He was up for it. 'It would be a great experience for you, Brendan,' I told him. 'I want England to play like you play. Pass the ball, play and play and play.' Redknapp also reveals that he will now never manage England. \"The FA made their decision and I cannot see me wanting to work for them in the future,\" he wrote. \"If the job came up again, I wouldn't want to be considered.\"</p><p></p><p>And Redknapp isn't the only major English footballing figure who is turning his back on the national game – <strong>Gary Lineker</strong> is considering <strong>emigration</strong>. \"We've been out to LA recently and I love the lifestyle,\" he enthused. \"There are great opportunities for my wife Danielle to work as an actress but I'm not sure my career as a football pundit would hold up in the US.\" The career of Lineker's wife is already on the up, with this year seeing her most high-profile role to date – \"Reporter\" in an episode of BBC series Silent Witness.</p><p></p><p>PSV Eindhoven's 17-year-old Belgian prodigy <strong>Zakaria Bakkali</strong>, linked in Friday's Mill with Arsenal, is today being linked with <strong>Manchester United</strong> – and local rivals City are also rumoured to be sniffing around a player labelled \"the new Eden Hazard\". Really, this Belgian golden generation business is getting ridiculous. The old Eden Hazard is only 22 and they've already got a new one, and meanwhile we're still looking for a new Bobby Moore. In further scouting news, <strong>Tottenham</strong> have been looking for the new <strong>Andrea Pirlo</strong> – but have failed, given up and instead started talks with the old one, who is already 35.</p><p>\"There is contact between Pirlo and Tottenham for next season,\" revealed Gianluca Vialli, who insists he has \"got the rumours from London\". Very wise too – it's where all the best rumours come from. London is to rumours what Campania is to mozzarella, as Gianluca has obviously realised.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered that Alan Pardew gave a fairly big hint that he wanted to sign <strong>Loïc Remy</strong> by, um, trying to sign him last January, and offered a decent-sized clue that he still wanted to sign him by, well, actually signing him in the summer, albeit only on loan from QPR. Anyway, he still wants to sign him. \"He is on our books and we are pleased to have him,\" Pardew revealed. \"At the moment he is a QPR player. It was interesting to read Harry Redknapp's comments that he probably won't be coming back, but we'll see.\"</p><p></p><p>Talking of not signing strikers, Mark Hughes has detailed Stoke's failure to sign Darren Bent in the summer. \"We looked at Darren but we were told he wouldn't come to Stoke – or his agent wouldn't – so that was that,\" he sniffed. \"We don't know why but we didn't get a chance.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Bolton</strong> are planning a January clear-out, with many of the players whose contracts are up next summer to be made available six months early. David Ngog – the £4m former Liverpool sharpshooter who with no goals at all so far this season is struggling to suggest that he will match last season's career-best haul of, er, eight – Chris Eagles, Zat Knight, David Wheater and Tyrone Mears are the names on the list, though no suitors have so far been publicly identified.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419229283|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f650ce2952355468da45cb09fe14ae44a16870b9 -->",

They backed it up with another title, only to flounder for the first half of last season amid instability brought about by the departure of Ange Postecoglou and the failed short-term reign of Rado Vidosic. </p><p>Now under Mike Mulvey there are signs that success, and the 'Roarcelona' tag, could be making a return to Suncorp Stadium. Many of the key personnel from the dual-championship winning roster remain. Most significantly, perhaps,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com.au/story/1698020/matt-mckay-signs-with-brisbane-roar/?cs=12\"> is the return of Matt McKay</a> following an indifferent period in Asia, with the Brisbane-proud Socceroo very much a driving force in that breakthrough title win. As an aside McKay is set to be utilised in central midfield which will surely hinder his hopes of game time at next year's World Cup in Brazil, having been used for the Socceroos almost exclusively as a left-back.</p><p>Much will depend on what Mulvey brings to the team in his first full season at the helm, but after a strong finish to last season there are plenty of signs that he has the wherewithal to get the group pushing in the same direction. McKay described Mulvey as \"an extremely good coach and great man manager\" upon his re-signing two months ago. Indeed, Mulvey had the Roar enjoying significant momentum by the end of the last campaign, with the team eventually halted by Western Sydney Wanderers in the penultimate match of the finals series.</p><p>Though not particularly well known before being handed the reins a third of the way into last season, Mulvey has undergone a significant coaching apprenticeship, winning two titles at the helm of Gold Coast United in the National Youth League. He stepped into the breach through the turmoil that was Gold Coast's A-League demise and somehow managed to have a team of teenagers turn in several extremely competitive performances despite hugely difficult circumstances.</p><p>Mulvey has been entrenched in the Queensland football scene throughout his coaching career. The state has arguably produced more young talent than any other region of Australia during the past decade and, to their credit, the Roar have traditionally aimed to promote local products. And it is a value that Mulvey has stated is part of his modus operandi. Indeed at the time of Mulvey's appointment last December, the Brisbane Roar general manager Sean Dobson said \"his [Mulvey's] values and expectations met those of the club.\" In other words, the Roar wish to retain the culture, philosophy and local identity that has worked so well for them in the recent past.</p><p>The backroom staff that Mulvey has at his disposal is as impressive as any in the league. But, like Mulvey himself, it is very much a case of quite achievement rather than headline grabbing. Ken Stead, who many point to as a critical component behind the success enjoyed by the Roar during the Postecoglou era, has assumed the role of technical director. Luciano Trani comes in as Mulvey's No2 with the Melbournian regarded highly for his technical analysis work with Adelaide United and Wellington Phoenix, and even at Melbourne Knights during the National Soccer League. One-time Evertonian and Brisbane product Jason Kearton will look after the club's goalkeepers.</p><p>A small section of the Roar support last year, initially at least, viewed Mulvey as unworthy of the role. The displeasure coincided with the Roar's elimination from the AFC Champions League on penalties against Thailand's Buriram United. However subsequent results achieved by the big-spending Thai side have proven that there was no shame in suffering the same fate as the likes of Uzbekistan powerhouse Bunyodkor. A poor run of form to open the season could, however, bring rancour from some of the Suncorp faithful, but the Roar management are far more even-keeled than many of their competitors and it would take a cataclysmic run of events for the club to even consider a change at the top.</p><p>Last season saw Brisbane without the services of skipper Matt Smith and forward Henrique for large chunks of the season. The pair's return to full health and match fitness will be a valuable boost for the Roar. Striker Besart Berisha enjoyed a relatively modest campaign by his own lofty standards, but with midfield support from Thomas Broich, Liam Miller, McKay and Luke Brattan it is hard to imagine the Albanian not delivering in front of goal.</p><p>Brisbane Roar's main acquisition during the off-season has been midfielder Miller. It may well be that the former Celtic player fits in at the Roar more so than he did for much of his time at Perth Glory. So too, Dimitri Petratos could blossom at the club having departed Sydney FC in unhappy circumstances. There are plenty of examples of talented youth that have started an A-League career in glittering fashion only to take several seasons to find consistency. It is easy to imagine the 2013-14 season being a turning point in Petratos's still fledgling career. </p><p>Equally, it is conceivable that Bratton will be a star of the upcoming A-League season. Postecoglou described the midfielder as one the best passers he has ever seen, and Bratton was a constant during the Roar's late season run last term. On the debit side Brisbane have lost the attacking guile of Mitch Nichols and the outrageously quick Ben Halloran, while foundation player Massimo Murdocca will take his metronomic style to Melbourne Heart.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419168886|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6ac9b03afbcfc15366352b05ed729fa514684caf -->",

        "body":"<p>There are times when Australian football is just too good to be true. Today is one of those days. In partnership with Victorian police and the Melbourne clubs, <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/police-ffa-and-clubs-prepare-for-season-ahead/76630\">this morning the FFA announced it is cracking down on violence</a>. Call it what you want – soccer violence, football hooliganism, an excuse to wear Fred Perry button-downs and Adidas trainers – enough is enough. </p><p>Naturally, to encourage us all to stop throwing our over-priced, plastic-cupped, mid-strength beer at the players, officials and opposing fans, the A-League have enlisted the services of Kevin Muscat to sell the message.</p><p>The FFA has made some interesting decisions over the years. One was to appoint Ben Buckley as CEO in 2006. Another was to court <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/ffa-hit-by-fraud-claim-20130423-2icwd.html\">Fifa's self-appointed ragged-trousered philanthropist, Jack Warner</a>, in the infamous World Cup bid. Another still was to employ Pim Verbeek and Holger Osieck to bring back that old feeling of disappointment in your gut whenever you watch the Socceroos. And now this. </p><p>Kevin Muscat: the man who rearranged <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/1651609.stm\">Christophe Dugarry's knee ligaments in a friendly</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/24/football.vivekchaudhary\">who ended Matty Holmes's career</a>; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37eln66RNj0\">who gave Adrian Zahra this friendly tap-up</a> in the Melbourne derby is now being used to plead with confused fans to respect the family friendly nature of the A-League.</p><p>This is one of those moments where half-baked writers like myself are given a free kick at being funny. This is a joke we simply can't butcher. It is, as Paul Keating once said in reference to Alexander Downer, \"the salmon that jumps on the hook for you\". </p><p>The only thing sillier than the Ghandi-fication of the man Martin Grainger called \"the most hated man in football\" is the new police measures themselves. One has to wonder what the FFA is playing at with this decision. Of all the threatening environments one might find oneself on a Saturday night, A-League matches rank fairly low. I've seen more acts of violence towards Hungry Jack's toilet-bowls on Oxford Street than I have at most A-League fixtures. If transit officers are just failed policemen, to me those stadium security guards are just failed toilet-cleaners. </p><p>Victorian police commander Rick Nugent said in a statement: \"What we're doing is collectively standing up against violence ... we're going to do whatever we can to ensure we provide a safe environment for supporters, families and kids who come along to watch sport.\"</p><p>Of course, few people could argue with the sentiment. However, the measures being planned to keep the natives from cannibalising each other do seem a little out of step with the current culture of A-League matches. </p><p>With the blessing of the FFA and the two Melbourne clubs, the police plan to closely monitor fans by CCTV, dedicate a crack team of detectives to investigate any incidents at matches, start a 'dob-a-yobbo' hotline for 'good' fans to point out any 'bad' fans who give them the stink-eye, and implement stronger ticket regulations to ensure the riff-raff have to sit through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQTNHhDTC54\">Andy Harper's commentary from home or the nearest pub</a>. Punishment enough.</p><p>If the Victorian measures are seen to be successful, the FFA plans to expand its security operations around the country. Perhaps the worst part of all this is it will further add to an already severe persecution complex among many A-League fans. </p><p>That said, there is more than a hint of hypocrisy from the FFA, which likes to trade on images of active supporters in its promotional packages and ad campaigns. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/hyundai-aleague-fans-power-the-game/75509\">the latest Power the Game advert</a>. Freeze-frame it. Dob them all in on your smartphone for participating in an ad that is surely a crime against good taste. </p><p>The FFA has a history of hyperventilating at any hint of anti-social behaviour. Hiring a private security firm, Hatamoto, to police the terraces has been particularly unpopular in recent years.</p><p>Treating A-League supporters like criminals does little to create the impression that football is a pleasant place to spend your evening. If anything, it's helping create a folk-devil for the tabloid press.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419208640|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|58b7df38d25fce3e254962ded3a600c5c64a695d -->",

        "body":"<p>Harry Redknapp does not believe the Football Association's senior officials are equipped to make high-level sporting decisions and said he \"would not trust them to show him a good manager if their lives depended on it\".</p><p>Redknapp was considered to be the clear favourite to take the England job when Fabio Capello resigned last year, but the FA opted to approach Roy Hodgson, then in charge at West Bromwich Albion.</p><p>It had been considered a near-certainty that Redknapp would leave Tottenham to take the job, and he has admitted he believed as much himself, going as far as asking Brendan Rodgers, then at Swansea and now at Liverpool, to be his assistant at Euro 2012.</p><p>Although Redknapp maintains he holds no grudge against Hodgson, Redknapp is still unhappy and claims he was the leading choice with the fans and the players, suggesting senior members of the national squad like Steven Gerrard texted him to offer their support for him to succeed Capello.</p><p>\"I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it. How would they know? What clubs have they ever run? Who do they speak to who really knows the game?\" the QPR manager said in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail.</p><p>\"This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue. And they get to pick the England manager.</p><p>\"Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job. I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry. But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager – a man who is more their cup of tea.\"</p><p>While Redknapp was expected to leave Tottenham for England, he ended up leaving them without a job at all as the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy parted company with him that summer.</p><p>A number of Spurs fans had held the belief Redknapp had allowed the England job to become the focus of his attention and, despite denying that, he has confessed to making plans for the national team while in the Tottenham dugout.</p><p>\"If I had become the England manager I would have taken Brendan Rodgers as my number two,\" he added. \"My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?</p><p>\"So when Tottenham played Swansea on April 1, 2012, I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championship in the summer as my part-time coach?</p><p>\"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it.</p><p>\"Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day, by the way.</p><p>\"It didn't work out. On April 1, I was contemplating the way forward for England with Brendan Rodgers – and on April 29 the FA offered the job to Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"I'll admit, I thought it was mine. Everyone seemed so certain, everyone I had met from all parts of the game seemed utterly convinced it was my job.\"</p><p>Redknapp believes that the issue of compensation to Tottenham remains one of the reasons why he was never asked.</p><p>\"I'm sure the FA would deny they were interested in me anyway, they always like to say they got their No1 choice, but maybe what helped make their minds up was the thought of writing a cheque in the region of £16million to Levy.</p><p>\"He is known for driving a hard bargain at the best of times; get Daniel on a bad day and I would have ended up more expensive than Capello – and the FA were already getting a lot of criticism over his £6m-a-year salary.</p><p>\"Of all the reasons doing the rounds for me not becoming England manager, the compensation issue makes most sense.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419236317|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|86ccc1920854f86df6c7ff5b8e0b7deaae4a5533 -->",

        "headline":"West Ham's Ravel Morrison finds his feet to floor Tottenham Hotspur",
        "body":"<p>Sam Allardyce described Ravel Morrison as a \"genius\" after his jaw-dropping solo goal set the seal on West Ham United's 3-0 win at Tottenham. The midfielder burst through from the halfway line, with his team already 2-0 up, to beat two defenders, draw the goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and dink the ball beyond him. Spurs had previously conceded only two goals in 11 matches this season.</p><p>It was a derby day that had been framed by the determination of both clubs and the authorities to avoid any repeat of the antisemitic abuse from the visiting fans that had marred the fixture last season. There had been the pre-match warning from the Metropolitan police that any use of the term \"Yid\" could see its officers make arrests.</p><p>The Tottenham support, who regularly refer to themselves and their players as such, ignored the warning and used the term on several occasions. West Ham fans, tongues in their cheeks, called them \"racists\". The visiting support trod a fine line when a small number of them chanted, \"We won't say his name, he's coming for you.\" Some of them had caused outrage last season by chanting that Adolf Hilter was coming for the Spurs fans. They then sang, \"Same old West Ham, taking the piss.\"</p><p>The Met made one arrest, that of a Spurs fan for allegedly using \"Yid\" in a chant. He was held on suspicion of committing a section 5 public order offence at half-time in the East stand. But it was Morrison, a former Manchester United player, who demanded the headlines.</p><p>\"It's the genius of Ravel Morrison, that is a genius goal for me and you will struggle to see a better goal this season,\" said Allardyce, the West Ham manager. \"He picks the ball up in his own half and heads directly to [Jan] Vertonghen and [Michael] Dawson and slips them two like they weren't there and waits for the goalkeeper to go down. It's a great day for us because in the second half we played extremely well.\"</p><p>Allardyce described how Sir Alex Ferguson, the former United manager, had told him that he would have a superstar player if he could iron out Morrison's indiscipline. The 20-year-old, who joined West Ham from United in January 2012, spent last season on loan at Birmingham. Allardyce said that Ferguson had felt Morrison had \"to get away from Manchester\", although he did not enlarge on the reasons for that.</p><p>Allardyce added: \"Ferguson said, 'I hope you can sort him out because, if you can, he'll be a genius. He's a brilliant footballer, he has top-class ability. He needs to get away from Manchester and start a new life.'</p><p>\"It looks like it's paid off for us. He [Ferguson] has let Ravel go for Ravel's benefit because he couldn't see it happening at Man United. It was: 'Get him down there and see if you can get the best out of himbecause you'll have a great player on your hands.'\"</p><p>\"As we say in the football fraternity, the penny has dropped with him. It has dropped in lifestyle and attitude and his time-keeping, and all of a sudden, there is a belief that he doesn't want to do anything other than break into our first-team. I think that 12-month spell at Birmingham gave him time to reflect on what it takes to be a player on a week-in-and-out basis.\"</p><p>The West Ham captain Kevin Nolan said: \"Ravel Morrison has been fantastic. Last year we had a lot of problems with him ... his lifestyle off the pitch, but he went to Birmingham and worked hard. You are now starting to see the player that Manchester United saw when he was younger.\"</p><p>Allardyce used a novel formation without strikers. \"The first thing you do is listen to the complaints [from the players] ... 'What's he trying to do again? Who has dreamed this one up?' It was a big risk but we practised it for three good days. I said to them it would give us the licence to play counter-attacking football. The fans at Tottenham thought it was going to be a nice, easy-breeze today but the Premier League will tell you that if you think like that, you are going to get your backside kicked. They got their backside kicked today.\"</p><p>André Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager, said: \"It's a wake-up call. We have to react but we can't let it undermine what we have been doing up to now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419197874|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e2c27ee09b78b1c97b800ad59f53dfe4cc221120 -->",

        "body":"<p>Arsène Wenger praised Arsenal's \"special resilience\" after they came from behind to pick up a point against West Bromwich Albion and go into the international break top of the table, above Liverpool on goals scored. The Arsenal manager said that his players would take \"mental comfort\" from their place at the Premier League summit but said it was far too early to say whether they had the mentality of champions.</p><p>Claudio Yacob put a resurgent Albion side ahead and Nicolas Anelka had two decent chances early in the second half to double their lead against his former club before Jack Wilshere equalised. It was his first league goal for Arsenal since November 2010 and came at the end of a testing week for the England midfielder, who had been pictured holding a cigarette after Tuesday night's win over Napoli. \"I think he learns very quickly and what is more important for England and Arsenal is that he shows the right response on the pitch,\" Wenger said.</p><p>The Frenchman admitted that Albion posed plenty of problems on an afternoon when Arsenal fell behind for the first time since their first-day defeat. \"It required special resilience today because they didn't give us any space and they were well organised and we needed to find something special to score,\" Wenger said.</p><p>\"I'm not pleased, because I want to win, but if you ask me if it's a fair point over the 90 minutes, I would say yes. Why? Because we were 1-0 down just before half-time and straight after half-time Anelka has the two near [chances] and that would have made it difficult.\"</p><p>Asked about the significance of leading the Premier League ahead of a two-week break, Wenger replied: \"I feel it was important not to lose once we were down today. That is the most important thing. But for the mental comfort it's good [to be top] as well.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419197564|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|462a7077b4c6e0c1d992fc692b4bb475c24797bb -->",

        "body":"<h2>1) Rodgers's grumblings were justified</h2><p>It is unusual to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">hear a manager criticising</a> the manner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league\" title=\"\">of a 3-1 win</a> and even more striking when the manager in question is Brendan Rodgers, a man not averse to accentuating the positives at Liverpool. He was justified in his complaints after Saturday's defeat of Crystal Palace, however. No team reflects the openness of this Premier League season better than Liverpool, who sat top of the table on Saturday night but have yet to produce a commanding 90-minute display in this campaign. Rodgers lamented the \"lack of control\" behind the otherwise impressive front two of Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge and Palace had enough opportunities to disturb Liverpool's incisive first-half display. It was encouraging to hear the manager at the Premier League summit demanding improvement, although Anfield would happily listen to that criticism every week if the table remained the same. \"We'll get better in the second half of the season,\" said Rodgers. \"But it was critical that we made a good start. I believe that we have still got a lot of improvement to make which is good, especially if we continue with this mentality of winning games. We've won five out of seven but there is still a lot of improvement to do.\" <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p><h2>2) Will Moyes stick with Januzaj?</h2><p>David Moyes claimed he would have started Adnan Januzaj three or four weeks ago, but for injuries elsewhere which scuppered his plan. It will now prove a source of intrigue whether or not the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/david-de-gea-manchester-united-sunderland\" title=\"\">United manager continually picks the 18-year-old</a>, both at home and in Europe, or reverts back to the experienced performers who had struggled earlier in the season. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p><h2>3) All hail Allardici</h2><p>Sam Allardyce once speculated that he might be taken more seriously as a tactician and, therefore, considered for the very top jobs, if he had a European-sounding surname. At White Hart Lane on Sunday, the West Ham United manager contented himself with aping Spain's 4-6-0 formation, which had triumphed at Euro 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league\" title=\"\">to enjoy a memorable 3-0 win</a>. He positively basked in the post-match acclaim. 'No, no, don't call me a managerial genius (but you can if you want)', was the subtext to a line from his press conference. André Villas-Boas hated it. The Tottenham Hotspur manager gave Allardyce and West Ham absolutely no credit. He said that their goals had come from a set-piece, a fluke and a one-man break against two of his defenders. Allardyce's tactics had emphatically not thrown him. \"It's nothing to do with the strategy but you can write whatever you want,\" Villas-Boas huffed. Having been outwitted in the second-half by Chelsea's José Mourinho the previous weekend, this was a low point. Allardyce is riding high. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p><h2>4) Pellegrini finds the 'release pressure' valve</h2><p>There was a first at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/joe-hart-manchester-city-everton\" title=\"\">Manchester City's 3-1 win over Everton</a>: the sight of a Manuel Pellegrini discarding his billing as the calm patrician of the technical area to become, well, a touch animated. This collector's item came in two parts. The opening stanza featured the Chilean exchanging some involved words with James Milner after Romelu Lukaka's opener for Everton that may or may not have been a telling-off for the midfielder. Then, in the second half, when Aleksandar Kolarov had to depart due to a facial injury, Pellegrini, to use the parlance, \"lay into\" both the left-back's proposed replacement, Gaël Clichy, and Brian Kidd, his assistant, after the Frenchman had sat back down after warming up. Coming soon to a Premier League dugout near you: a water-bottle kicking, fourth-official berating, opposition manager-baiting Pellegrini … <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><h2>5) Mackay knows better than to take on Cardiff's owner</h2><p>The Cardiff players said before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/newcastle-cardiff-alan-pardew\" title=\"\">Saturday's defeat to Newcastle</a> that they were thinking of asking the manager, Malky Mackay, to ban the club's owner, Vincent Tan, from the dressing room after a row over bonuses. The dispute has been resolved but ill feeling lingers and Tan did not make his usual appearance in the changing room after the final whistle. So was he barred from doing so? Hardly. The mega-rich Malaysian owns the club, and to ban him from any part of it would be akin to barring him from his own front room. Tan did not make his millions from being compliant, he is a tough task master and Mackay, who is nobody's fool, is not about to take him on. <strong>Joe Lovejoy</strong></p><h2>6) Mourinho has bench-warming game-changers at his disposal</h2><p>While Chris Hughton, perhaps rather harshly, starts fretting again over his position at Carrow Road with a trip to Arsenal to come after the international break, Chelsea can warm to their newfound squad depth. Much is justifiably made of their lack of goals up front, with the three senior strikers on the Londoners' books having yet to register in the league while Romelu Lukaku already boasts four on loan at Everton. Yet José Mourinho still benefits from game-changers on his bench. He could fling on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/norwich-city-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Eden Hazard and Willian against Norwich</a>, with the two-time European Cup winner Samuel Eto'o also making a contribution as the visitors shape-shifted boldly in a bid to conjure a winner. Last year the management might have been looking to Yossi Benayoun or Marko Marin to inspire such a victory having been pegged back. Mourinho will need more than one transfer window before he is content with the balance of his squad, but others would be envious of the options already at his disposal. The strikers may not be scoring, but the collective boasts personnel who can inspire revivals. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p><h2>7) Pochettino's quick thinking swung the game</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/southampton-swansea-premier-league-matchreport\" title=\"\">Swansea will play worse and win</a>. After Southampton took the lead through Adam Lallana after 19 minutes, Swansea dominated for long enough for the edginess in the crowd to become very apparent and it was only the excellence of Artur Boruc and some wasteful finishing that prevented them from equalising before half-time. At the start of the second half, Swansea's control only became more pronounced and a goal felt inevitable. Mauricio Pochettino had started the game with his side set up in a 4-4-2 formation, Rickie Lambert and Daniel Osvaldo partnering each other in attack, but now Southampton were getting overwhelmed in midfield. Pochettino, however, did not sit there hoping for the best. Instead he reacted. He removed Southampton's biggest name, Osvaldo, and brought on a teenager, James Ward-Prowse, to bolster his side's midfield in the 58th minute and Swansea soon ran out of ideas. Another goal did indeed arrive - but not for Swansea. Pochettino is becoming increasingly impressive. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><h2>8) Is Wenger wrong to doubt Wilshere's scoring credentials?</h2><p>\"I don't think he will ever be a goalscorer,\" Arsène Wenger said when a journalist in the Hawthorns pressroom pointed out that Jack Wilshere had recently described his own goals record as \"embarrassing.\" Yet in the next sentence, Wenger also pointed out a lot of people had previously thought the same about another of the players in the Arsenal dressing room. \"Let's not forget we had the same problem with [Aaron] Ramsey a while ago. Once they start to score it comes naturally.\" Wilshere, he added, is \"a player who can provide chances for others ... in our job, it's quite simple, you need players who score and players who give the balls to those who score. He's more in the second category but of course from that category you want a few goals as well, so it's good that he knows he can do it.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/west-brom-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">Wilshere's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at West Brom</a> was his first goal in the Premier League since a 4-2 win at Aston Villa in November 2010 (though, in mitigation, a lot of that time has been spent missing through injury). In total, he has two in 82 appearances. All the same, it was strange for Wenger to say, as his first reaction, there would never be a time when Wilshere scored with regularity. Of course, Wilshere will always be a creator but he strikes the ball so accurately, and is such an elusive opponent, is it expecting too much to think if he stays injury-free that eight to ten goals a season should be beyond him? <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p><h2>9) Stoke may need to embrace a familiar plan B</h2><p>Rightly or wrongly, Tony Pulis has taken a battering of late – last week Kenwyne Jones called Stoke's style under the Welshman \"more or less kick-and-hope. I think team-mates could testify it was very hard to come by chances.\" And yet, under a new manager and ethos, converting these chances has been sorely lacking of late – Stoke are the Premier League's lowest scorers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/fulham-stoke-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">In their 1-0 loss to Fulham</a>, Stoke dominated possession for long periods and were unlucky not to be given a penalty but failed to fashion clear-cut chances and still looked most dangerous from set-pieces; Robert Huth header from a corner being his his team's only effort on target. Mark Hughes should be admired for trying to establish his own legacy, but in games where Stoke lack incision, as they did on Saturday, he might have to accept that with the attributes of his current squad, Jones et al, 'kick-and-hope' remains an ugly but effective plan B. <strong>Michael Butler</strong></p><h2>10) Where to start at Hull?</h2><p>The former Real Madrid director general Jorge Valdano once compared games between Liverpool and Chelsea to \"shit on a stick\", but relative to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/premier-league-hull-aston-villa\" title=\"\">Hull and Villa</a>, both \"shit\" and \"stick\" become comparatively fascinating and metaphorically redemptive. Accordingly, not even The Guardian has the brass neck to manufacture a talking point out of a match so soul-curdlingly sordid – but for the fact that it just has. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189766|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|df987e5342f542dd43e11699b01304a15c6def24 -->",

He eventually left for the Italian club on a four-year contract that draws a reported salary of £20,000 a week, with his agent, Mino Raiolo, also earning a six-figure fee from the move.</p><p>Discussions with Januzaj began last spring with the manager's predecessor, Sir Alex Ferguson, but have dragged because of what David Moyes recently described as \"some influences around him\".</p><p>Januzaj, whose father takes overall responsibility for his career and who is represented by the agent Dirk De Vriese, is interesting Juventus, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.</p><p>Last week De Vriese claimed that Januzaj has many potential suitors. \"I'm not going to say which teams are interested in him, but I can tell you that there is interest from several European clubs,\" he told Voetbal Nieuws. \"The departure of Sir Alex Ferguson meant that there was a break in the negotiations. We are back working on the calls and will see how it goes. Adnan's family have given me the permission to communicate. As it is only me involved, there can be no misunderstandings in the media.\"</p><p>Januzaj was arguably United's best player during the club's three-week pre-season tour of Asia and Australia. And with Moyes now fast-tracking him into the first-team squad there is hope that it will help convince Januzaj that he should remain at United beyond next summer.</p><p>Moyes said: \"I would have probably put him in the team three or four weeks ago. There were a couple of games when I was going to start him. I just felt that until we got a bit of momentum into our play, I thought we had to wait.\"</p><p>His international future is also in the balance as Januzaj could play for Belgium, as he was born there, Albania or Kosovo through his parents, as well as Turkey and Serbia through his grandparents. Playing for England is also an option under the residency rule, though this would not be possible until 2018.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419177910|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f981ed5dc4f790ee935682a3b2d2eb2a80fe8279 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>Real Madrid are considering a January bid for Sergio Agüero after the Manchester City striker was identified as the Spanish club's prime target at the start of the summer, ahead of Gareth Bale, who was bought for a world record £85.3m.</p><p>Madrid made an inquiry about Agüero – who scored in Saturday's  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/manchester-city-everton-premier-league\" title=\"\">3-1 win over Everton</a> at the Etihad Stadium – and were told he would not be sold. They had also wanted to sign Neymar, who was then at Santos, and Radamel Falcao, who began the summer at Atlético Madrid, ahead of Bale.</p><p>That means the Welshman was effectively Madrid's fourth choice. Falcao signed for Monaco on 20 May before Neymar joined Barcelona a week later, with City announcing on 24 May that Agüero had agreed a one-year extension to his contract, keeping him at the club until 2017.</p><p>Madrid retain an interest in Falcao, but Agüero remains their first choice to&nbsp;strengthen the striking options of Carlo Ancelotti,  which comprise only Karim Benzema and 20-year-old Alvaro Morata.</p><p>While Real may firm up their interest for Agüero in the January transfer window with an offer expected to be markedly more than the £38m he cost the club two years ago, in an interview with the <em>Guardian</em> on Saturday Agüero reiterated his loyalty to City.</p><p>\"I'm very happy at City, very happy since the day I came,\" he said. \"I knew that the project was good and in my head there is nothing else but Manchester City, so how long I'm going to be at City is just never a question.</p><p>\"I'm happy here, my family's here when they come to England, all I can do is give everything I have for the club and concentrate on achieving for the club. We are improving every year the team, the club, the club is growing, we are working in the same direction to get the club as high as possible. Some years are better than others, but it's a much better club, a much better team than it was four or five years ago, so we just have to go [continue] in the same way.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419155397|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|656089c4456fd210c1ef8757f6c5309ede9059f7 -->",
