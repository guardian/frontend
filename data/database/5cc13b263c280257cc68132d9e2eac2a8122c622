        "headline":"What Should We Tell Our Daughters? by Melissa Benn – review",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://melissabenn.com/\" title=\"\">Melissa Benn</a>'s <em>What Should We Tell Our Daughters? The Pleasures and Pressures of Growing Up Female</em> ought to have served an important purpose: we do need \"a manifesto for modern womanhood\", as it's billed, to help young women inherit the benefits of feminist history.</p><p>Sadly, Benn's book is an exemplum of why many young women reject their mothers' version of feminism. In covering familiar ground thoroughly ploughed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/08/susan-faludi-100-women\" title=\"\">Susan Faludi</a>, Carole Gilligan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/susie-orbach\" title=\"\">Susie Orbach</a> and Natasha Walter, she does identify some of the pressures on young western women, such as perfectionism, pornography, work-life balance and fragile self-confidence. But her own migraine-inducing prose style, the lack of rigour she brings to her data, and the banality of her proscriptions showcase what not to do to enlist young women in the feminist cause.</p><p>Manifestos must manifest opinions. But Benn's editor is as much at fault as the author for tolerating the sloppy tic of starting endless paragraphs with questions. \"So why do I <em>still</em> cavil at that 'ambition' word then?\"\"Have we somehow come full circle, I wonder?\" \"Perhaps we should [be] grateful to pornified culture that provides more information than we dare?\" \"Is sexism rather than sexualisation the real problem?\" \"Does the talk not now have to come much closer to home?\" I don't know: does it? One has paid the cover price in order to find out.</p><p>This tissue of relentless, flutteringly phrased musings undoes Benn's \"manifesto\" claim: the reader struggles to figure out just what she believes, let alone whether to follow her lead. It finally feels passive-aggressive, as with the relative who requires 10 minutes of urging to take the last cream puff (\"Should I? No, really…\").</p><p>This equivocation is more than a stylistic problem; it's a failure of moral courage in a task that requires it. If you're going to write a book that's setting a goal for others to follow – the work of a manifesto – you must at least come out in the open in declarative sentences to assert what you think, and take the hits or plaudits that follow. Masking self-protective equivocation as opinion is very negative role modelling for young women.</p><p>What should we tell our daughters? First of all, not to dither in print. Another serious flaw in the book is that the \"daughters\" rarely appear – except as statistics illustrating helpless folly: faceless victims caught up in a hell of anorexia, of passionless \"hooking up\", of a zombie-like search for perfection and, in a passage that lumps together the serious illness of anorexia with the perhaps less dire trend of shaving off all of one's pubic hair, as sacrifices to full-body depilation.</p><p>Benn expresses sadness about anorexia rates at length but interviews no young anorexics. Why are they starving? (You'd be interested by how many times anorexic young women will start by complaining not about patriarchy, but about their mothers.) She bemoans those shaved and waxed young women but doesn't ask one of them why they do it. Is it all coercion by porn? Or is it because many young women like the way it feels during sex? Or both? We don't find out. She wonders if girls are having all that sex because they like it or because they feel pressured, but again she fails to ask them directly. She quotes the chief executive of the Guides by name – Julie Bentley – but interviews no Guides.</p><p>Benn cites the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/slutwalks\" title=\"\">SlutWalk</a> protest movement but doesn't interview any young organisers to find out why it, rather than the <a href=\"http://takebackthenight.org/about\" title=\"\">Take Back the Night</a> marches of their mums' generation, took off internationally. In every case, where the \"daughters\" are left out we lose a chance to learn something about cultural change that might help us all renew feminism.</p><p>She interviews, rather, plenty of middle-aged, British professional women and treats them as exemplars – without exploring with young women why they're turning away from these very models of women's lives: \"Rita Clifton is chief executive of Interbrand, one of the world's largest corporate consultancies…. \"Journalist and TV presenter Caryn Franklyn…\" You hear reverentially from \"mum\" again and again – Benn asks several friends what they told their daughters about sex. But she does not ask the daughters their – perhaps appalled or amused – reactions. Benn can also be seriously tendentious with her data. She cites many statistics on the economic suffering of women – which is all too real. But when she must address, in a poorly argued chapter on work-life conflict called Breakpoint, the fact that Hannah Rosin has written a thoroughly documented book – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-interview-end-of-men\" title=\"\"><em>The End of Men</em></a><em> –</em> drawing opposite conclusions to Benn's, she dismisses Rosin's important identification of the new demographic in the \"seesaw marriage\" (in which well-educated couples trade off work priorities and tasks fairly) as \"little to do with feminism and everything to do with lifestyle and economic expectations'. Class, can we spell tautological reasoning?</p><p>Benn sometimes twists data in other ways. She claims, which would suit her argument, that anorexia has returned and is increasing. But all the data confirms that anorexia rates have remained steady for 30 years; it's body dissatisfaction (dysmorphia) that's on the rise – a big difference.</p><p>Most importantly, Benn consistently fails to explain <em>why</em> the issues she raises are in fact women's issues. The daughters' generation rejects this kind of feminism for good reason. Their mantra is \"race, class, gender\". Does porn affect only girls negatively? Benn acknowledges that it must affect boys too, but insists that girls must be more victimised by it. Is the \"search for perfection\" not something that young men feel too, in a social media-heavy, economically stressed world? Young people say it is. Is sexual violence a women's issue alone, or even primarily? The new<strong> </strong>groups on campus that are inclusive of the 17% of young men who are raped or molested, would see this women-only framing as offensive or just dumb. Many activist young women don't identify with Benn's type of 70s-to-90s feminism because it is too simplistic, casting complex questions in pat gender binaries.</p><p>Benn's insights can be agonisingly trite: \"Divorce is never easy.\" Her analysis can be school-essayish: \"Revolution has always provoked stern reaction.\" Her conclusions are usually vague, stale and girly: \"We need to persuade policy-makers that raising a child is a communal responsibility.\" Yeah, we have known that and tried to for 40 years – and now Europe teeters under the burdens of austerity. (Benn airily cites the need for a mother's \"lobby\" but doesn't interview members of the only one up and running – <a href=\"http://www.momsrising.org\" title=\"\">MomsRising </a>– so we might actually learn how to break this hoary stalemate.) Other solutions are retro New Labour: forcible quotas or retro essentialist feminist: make them talk more nicely in parliamentary debate. These shallow notions insult the reader's awareness of the well-established critiques around many of them as theoretically unrigorous and materially impracticable solutions.</p><p>Search in vain here for concrete advice for daughters: how should they be financially autonomous? How should they speak in public with authority? How might they start a movement? What should they do with their desire?</p><p>The erasure of Benn's intended audience makes for just the kind of one-directional,  condescending harangue (\"You never clean your room, young lady!\") that teens and twentysomething women who reject feminism often complain about. When they identify self-referential feminist mothers, or the feminist organisations where they're continually being told how lucky they are – and how ungrateful for their foremothers' sacrifices – smart young women cite Benn's approach.</p><p>What thinking, self-respecting young woman would rally to that banner? This book reveals just why many of \"our daughters\" have turned away.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418769579|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|11023583d58ed6a45bd42f644aafc615cc231da7 -->",

        "body":"<p>This autumn, my local Waterstones is hosting various young adult author events. I went to the first of these at the end of September to hear David Levithan speak, in conversation with Keith Gray, about his latest book, Every Day. </p><p>Every Day tells the story of A who wakes up in a different body every day of their life. A tries to leave the smallest impact possible on the bodies they inhabit until they wake up in the body of Justin and fall in love with Justin's girlfriend, Rhiannon.</p><p>The event started with a reading from Every Day. Without spoiling anything for those who haven't read the book yet, the reading was from a turning point in the book and Levithan's presence during the reading really brought the characters to life. (For those interested the reading was Day 6015). The atmosphere of the entire event was great, kicked off by Keith Gray's question about the driving force behind Every Day. Levithan said he wanted to answer two questions: 'Who would you be if you didn't have a body and therefore no input from outside influences?' and 'If the person you loved changed every day could you still love them?'.</p><p>There was also a lot of discussion about the use of gender pronouns by audiences. I thought the question of gender pronouns was especially interesting as one of the central aspects of the book is that A considers themselves to be genderless. Levithan made the observation that most readers he speaks to default to the pronoun 'he' for A, either because the author is male or because the first body A is seen in is male. One audience member asked if anyone defaulted to 'she' and Levithan revealed that because the audiobook is narrated by a woman he had met one reader who defaulted to 'she'.</p><p>Levithan and Gray then talked more deeply about A's character and the motivations for their actions both before and after they meet Rhiannon, before talking more generally about how Levithan went about writing the book, writing each body point of view in a day and then moving on the next day. As a writer myself, I enjoyed this insight into another writer's process especially for a book with such a unique plot and style.</p><p>The floor was quickly opened to questions and some focused on the pros and cons of writing collaboratively (Levithan co-wrote the novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/review-will-grayson-will-grayson-john-green-david-levithan\">Will Grayson, Will Grayson with John Green</a>). Finding out how Levithan worked on this and some tips for people thinking about trying it, was, from a writing standpoint, extremely helpful and interesting. </p><p>At the end there was a signing session and the queue was phenomenal - it was great to see so many people not just coming to hear an author speak but also willing to wait around to get things signed. While we waited, I chatted to Keith Gray about his book The Ostrich Boys, anthologies he has edited and his own writing process. We talked a lot about National Novel Writing Month (November, for those who don't know!), and after the event I was lucky enough to get a chance to ask David a few questions about his books, his creative process and writing in general.</p><p><strong>What was your favourite part of writing Every Day?</strong></p><p>I really enjoyed getting to inhabit a character without a body. Writing A was a new experience because I had to write A on A's terms - I couldn't change him to fit into a different mould.</p><p><strong>Was it harder to write from a female perspective than from a male?</strong></p><p>It was a lot easier than I expected it to be because A filtered things for me. No matter the body it was still A who I was writing. And I had help from my US editor who made sure I balanced A out and didn't make them too masculine or feminine. But A was helpful to the writing, definitely.</p><p><strong>Which of the bodies A inhabited was your favourite to write?</strong></p><p>The second chapter was really fun to write because it had a complete tonal shift from the first chapter.</p><p><strong>And which characters were difficult for you to write?</strong></p><p>The girl dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression was a hard one because it's the first time A has to deal with the question of whether it's their place to intervene in someone else's life. Even if they should do something, is it their right to?</p><p><strong>Every Day is out now and How They Met and Other Stories will be published for Valentine's Day 2014 but are there any other up and coming publications for UK readers to look forward to?</strong></p><p>Egmont have recently acquired the rights for two of my collaborations with Rachel Cohn - Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and Naomi and Ely's No-Kiss List - and Two Boys Kissing, my newest book, will be coming to the UK soon as well.</p><p><strong>Egmont announced that you're writing a sequel of sorts to Every Day told from Rhiannon's point of view - do you know what your next project after that will be?</strong></p><p>Not yet - I have a lot of ideas in my head but I like to focus on one at a time.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to teenagers who want to pursue a career in writing?</strong></p><p>My main piece of advice would be don't worry about being published - just write a really good book, but also don't be afraid to write a bad book. Give yourself permission to fail and don't be afraid.</p><p><strong>You've collaborated on YA books and edited books for other young adult authors but what are some of your favourite YA books that you haven't worked on?</strong></p><p>The Scorpio Races by Maggie Stiefvater is definitely up there. It's got action, suspense and romance - everything you could need in a book. I also really liked Feed by M. T. Anderson because it's about having the internet in our brains and it was written before the internet really took over in the way it is now and that I found really amazing.</p><p><strong>My last question was asked by a friend while we got our books signed. She asked, if you could have a jelly-bean named after you, what flavour would it be?</strong></p><p>Definitely watermelon because I used to be obsessed with watermelon jelly-beans!</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418953399|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|1ecdc8fd5989ee681e732b6ffda5a7c44d822570 -->",

        "headline":"Solo: A James Bond Novel by William Boyd – review",
        "body":"<p>The (rare) critics of this book in the past 10 days have fallen into the very trap against which Boyd gently cautioned. That of trying to judge his book against the James Bond <em>films</em>. It is, in mitigation, a faintly understandable confusion, the films having become down the decades such a lash-up of stylistic tics, fashion anachronisms, \"humour\", believable gunplay, cartoon violence and casual sexism that it's a wonder anyone can remember the Bond of the books as opposed to the brand Bond.</p><p>William Boyd remembers the distinction. He obviously remembers the very smell of those 1960s/70s paperbacks, with their tiny type, and page corners folded down with impatient grubby fingers on every monstrous interruption, as we learned the meanings of \"cordite\" \"gunmetal-gray\" and, for late developers, \"nipple\"; he obviously quietly revered the excitement of the creation. Whether, when older, he similarly revered the creator, Ian Fleming, is dubious – the two writers (as was Bond) were privately educated and with strong Scottish connections, but Fleming had a cruel streak – possibly a necessary legacy of the war – but also a streak of undisguised snobbery, whereas Boyd has a softly spoken dry donnish humour to him and his only streak is that of writerly success.</p><p>And he has succeeded indubitably in lifting to his lips the poisoned chalice of the Bond books franchise where so many, from Kingsley Amis on, have to a lesser (Amis) and greater (<a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141035451\" title=\"\">Sebastian Faulks</a>) degree failed. Not only lifted it but drained it, then licked those lips. This book is more true to Fleming's intentions than some of the less good (and frankly padded) originals.</p><p>So we get, set in 1969, all the trademark worsted suits, and thin dark knitted ties, and the Dorchester (where Bond has been celebrating his 45th birthday, purposefully alone, lost in vague memories and specific cocktails); and the cars, but also the sordid Pimlico flat where Bond has to finagle a (believably) pilfered passport, and the whoosh of early cappuccino steam in the Cafe Picasso on the King's Road, and most viscerally the humid poisoned heat of&nbsp;west Africa (to which neither Boyd nor his fictions are strangers). All faithful, down to the guns, and the nipples, to Fleming's obsession with detail. But we also get the prose of Mr&nbsp;Boyd, which is frankly superior to&nbsp;that of Mr Fleming.</p><p>But he has not attempted to write \"as\" Fleming. Instead he's immersed himself in that Bondworld of his youth, with all the remembered excitements and fears and gadgetry of the cold war, and then pretty much just written as himself – he's no slouch in the spy genre – and made it immensely believable. And transposed it to 1969 and done so with hats-in-the-air faithful success, all the more remarkable in that 1969 arrived five years after Fleming had died (in fact Bond, by then, is a slight anachronism, but a determined one). This is not a pastiche, which is where some of his predecessors erred. This is a <em>novel</em>, by a grown-up, and could only have been achieved by someone who had been enthralled when young and <em>still believed</em>, and also believed, with the thrilling self-confidence accorded to few writers, that he could make it better.</p><p>A couple of small niggles. The explanation for the African adventure, recounted in hindsight to Felix Leiter, turns into a bit of a longueur. But an exposition on a small oil war in tribal west Africa is arguably more interesting, then and now, than Fleming's own expositions on the histories of voodoo or the Kentucky Derby. Also, offering this with the temerity of a vole between headlights, I seem to remember, in one of Fleming's books, M railing against men with tans, something about them being the preserve of foreigners and lazy playboys – yet here is M on page 32 with a vigorous gardening tan, for shame! But these are the only niggles I can find, in a long book – longer than any of Fleming's – and don't let anyone tell you Bond's been rendered \"PC\"; the quiet snobberies and sexism are there, just a little less obnoxiously so. Apart from anything else, it's simply a bloody good thriller. A triumph. Bond is back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418643353|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9e4d0ceb10b4a293cbc3e8a93935ee1a4789fa00 -->",

        "body":"<p>This is a dreadful film. But at its heart, there is a valid idea. It's about a 32-year-old Jane Austen obsessive called Jane, who visits a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156702/austenland\" title=\"\">theme park where Austen fans dress up</a> in Regency costume and are courted by actors. Jane, played by Keri Russell, does ring true: I met a number of women like her in my time as curator of <a href=\"http://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk\" title=\"\">Jane Austen's House Museum</a> in Chawton, though I can't say whether any of them actually had a lifesize cutout of Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in their bedroom.</p><p>As far as I know, a theme park like Austenland doesn't exist, but I can certainly imagine one. There's a <a href=\"http://www.dickensworld.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dickens World</a> in Kent with costumed actors giving tours – but I don't think they actually immerse visitors in the world of the books to the same extent. There's certainly a huge Austen industry, though. Fan fiction, in particular, is massive: <a href=\"http://www.lizziebennet.com\" title=\"\">the Lizzie Bennet Diaries</a> is a very modern online version of Pride and Prejudice, in which Lydia, rather than just eloping with Wickham, makes a sex-tape with him.</p><p>The film contains several gauche nods to Austen. We see a character carrying a pug – there's a pug in Mansfield Park. And Jane's friend Lizzie Charming has affinities to Mrs Jennings in Sense and Sensibility. JJ&nbsp;Feild is superb as the dashing Henry Nobley, too. In fact, this whole film could be said to have an over-the-top, gothic air that's reminiscent of Northanger Abbey, though really it bears no comparison with Austen's art.</p><p>Austen was a very funny person. I think she might have found certain aspects of the film amusing – the whole idea of the Austen industry, for one. But I don't think she'd have liked the film's ultimate debasement of her craft. She was one of our truly great novelists, and yet so many people just get bound up with the bosoms and the bonnets. They want to delve back into a past when everything was simple and everyone was nice, and the hero always brought a happily-ever-after. I sometimes wonder if Austen shouldn't have written so many happy endings.<em>Austenland is out now.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419066085|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|38fff7af2b6ba5f48538d6188969c9b15d760ac7 -->",

        "headline":"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding – review",
        "body":"<p>It's always a jolt to remember that the first two Bridget Jones books, published way back in the 90s, predated texting, tweeting, Facebook and internet dating: the constant stream of personal updates pinging between our devices in 2013. Her diary-style abbreviations, number-crunching obsessiveness over trivia and jokey combination of self-exposure and self-deprecation have had such an influence on the tone of social media that we all sound like Bridget now.</p><p>So it's no surprise that Helen Fielding was tempted to let Bridget loose on what looks like her natural terrain. Think what opportunities modern technology offers for embarrassment: the erroneously forwarded email, the ill-advised drunken text, the disastrous internet date. What's surprising, and cheering, is that rather than freeze-framing her as the eternal thirtysomething, Fielding has allowed Bridget to age in real time, making her 51 (and in need of glasses to operate her smartphone).</p><p>More shockingly, instead of the dissatisfied divorcee one might have expected, Bridget is now a tragic widow. Mark Darcy has died a typically noble death, leaving her with two small children, Billy and Mabel. These days, as well as counting calories and alcohol units, she's also totting up nits on the comb and bags of grated cheese scoffed&nbsp;from the fridge while making the kids' supper.</p><p>Having had children late, and been bereaved, she's once again out of step with her friends, just as she was with the \"smug marrieds\" of her 30s. Now Jude is on the internet dating not-so-merry go round, Tom is obsessed with boutique hotel bargains on Laterooms.com, and glamorous Talitha is refusing to countenance that 60 might be middle-aged. Time has turned Daniel Cleaver from bad boy into sad case, unable to talk to a woman without inquiring after the colour of her \"panties\" and only good for a spot of inept babysitting.</p><p>And Bridget, after five years' mourning, is looking to get back into the dating game. But will the old rules still apply? \"Everything has changed since you were single,\" says Talitha. \"There was no texting. There were no emails. People spoke on telephones. Plus, young women are more sexually aggressive now, and men are naturally more lazy. You have to, at the very least, … encourage.\"</p><p>After launching herself on Twitter as @JoneseyBJ (\"Cannot figure out how to put up photo. Is just empty egg-shaped graphic. Is fine! Can be photo of self before was conceived\") and waiting for the followers to flood in, she hooks a \"toyboy\", 29-year-old Roxster, whose \"ripped\" body makes her the envy of her drooping middle-aged friends. Cue many comic tweets and texts, and a surprising number of fart and vomit jokes. There's the familiar agonising, with why-hasn't-he-called replaced by why-hasn't-he-texted, but mostly Roxster is funny, sexy and adoring enough to fulfil any woman's wishes.</p><p>Which is part of the problem: Bridget has been given such a tragic backstory, and the very grown-up burden of young fatherless children, that there's less traction to be had from dating niggles; and with so much darkness there already, Fielding seems unwilling to write any more in. There's a new sentimentality, even slushiness, to her old subjects of love, sex and loneliness; the familiar jaunty tone is reserved for playground politics and the chaos and cuteness of bringing up children.</p><p>But while the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years, in countless slummy-mummy columns and books by Allison Pearson or Gill Hornby (all influenced, of course, by Fielding herself). There's a beautifully judged scene where Bridget is pierced with ridiculous overwhelming love for her children, even as they poo and puke in the grip of illness, but mostly the crushed rice cakes, lost car keys and melon balls for the sports day picnic have been done to death.</p><p>Also, where Bridget in her 30s was an everywoman figure, here she's a very yummy mummy indeed. Darcy has left her financially secure, with no need to work on anything but her improbable screenplay, an updating of Hedda Gabler set in Queen's Park. It's up to Roxster, part of the impoverished younger generation, to introduce her to the delights of the night bus. It's odd how posh contemporary comic writing about motherhood tends to be, and Mad About the Boy is no exception. As Bridget floats fragrantly around her son's school concert at a stately home, or wells up at the choir service, all the while having heart-thumping encounters with a masterful teacher, the book starts to seem less like a satire on modern life and more like a good old Jilly Cooper.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194762|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f8ec11d3bcd3666462a225adeb532d6313f32a3c -->",

        "body":"<p>In the heart of ancient Palestine stood a six-foot-nine-inch giant. Against him was a five-foot-nothing midget. No one gave the midget a prayer. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/david-goliath-malcolm-gladwell-review\" title=\"\">The giant's name was Goliath. The midget's name was David.</a> You might have read about their battle in the Old Testament. But the Bible got it wrong. David was not the underdog.</p><p>Most people make assumptions about power and jump to ridiculous conclusions. Who does not think the country with the most men and weaponry will automatically win a war? Not counting those of you who lived through Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. Take the American invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/grenada\" title=\"\">Grenada</a>. Although Grenada was much the smaller country, it actually held all the aces. Had Grenada played its cards just a little better, the US would have been wiped off the face of the earth.</p><p>Vivek Ranadive decided to coach his daughter's basketball team. Vivek realised that most coaches had made the simple error of packing their teams with players who were at least 6ft 7in. His daughter's friends were 5ft&nbsp;3in. Vivek understood his team could run through the legs of the opposition before climbing on to each other's shoulders to score a slam dunk. They beat the Boston Celtics 89-12. In their dreams.</p><p>Can you have too much money? Personally, I don't think you can, or I would have stopped chancing my arm with counterintuitive anecdotes long ago. But research shows you can. Jim was very happy when he didn't have much money. Now he's a top Hollywood producer and not very happy. See what I mean?</p><p>Richard is dyslexic. Most people would consider it to be a disadvantage. But Richard worked very hard, got a bit lucky and founded his Virgin empire. Richard could not have done this had he not been dyslexic. Having dyslexia is actually a blessing and anyone who has the condition and has not become a billionaire should be ashamed.</p><p>Learning to understand when your disadvantage is an advantage and not a disadvantage can be tricky. Katy was devastated when her entire family was wiped out in an air crash. Then she realised that at least she was alive and would inherit all the money. She went on to become a moderately successful real-estate agent in Florida.</p><p>Terry was a large trout in a North American lake. After graduating top of the class from the lake's high school, Terry decided to travel to the ocean to make his fortune. He got gobbled up by Thomas the tuna. Sometimes, it really is better to be a big fish in a little pond, rather a little fish in a big pond.</p><p>In 1963, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/martin-luther-king-dream-speech-history\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a> went to Birmingham, Alabama. Martin Luther King was black. Birmingham, Alabama, was known to be the most racist city in the USA. Therefore, Birmingham, Alabama, was not a safe place for Martin Luther King. But Martin Luther King went anyway. If Martin Luther King had been white, no one would have noticed his presence in Birmingham, Alabama. But because Martin Luther King had the courage to be black and he did go to Birmingham, Alabama, the civil rights movement made significant progress.</p><p>Less is sometimes more. And more is sometimes less. It's all a question of perception. Bobby was a career criminal. When California introduced a three strikes and you go to jail policy, Bobby went on a killing spree. The penalties for murder were so severe, they made no difference to him. But when California reduced the maximum sentence from 238 years to 110 years, Bobby decided to go straight. Bobby went to Harvard and became a traffic cop in Iowa.</p><p>There was once a boy who looked a bit different. We'll call him Leo Sayer. Because that's his name. Some people laughed at Leo because he had silly hair. Others didn't want to be his friend because he was always telling them that he was right and they were wrong. Leo decided to use his odd hair and off-putting mannerisms to his advantage and changed his name to Malcolm. Malcolm wrote a book telling people how everything they knew was wrong. It became a bestseller. So Malcolm wrote another book just the same. And another. He even rewrote Aesop's Fables. Still no one noticed. Malcolm cultivated a persona of being an outsider while earning huge amounts of money from banks, tobacco and pharmaceutical companies. Malcolm earns more for a one-hour talk than you will earn in a year. So who is laughing now?</p><p><strong>Digested read, digested: </strong>You make me feel like snoring.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419070502|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8e742438c5ac11e7c559181ef723805b32c3ed32 -->",

        "body":"<p>There is no shortage of ambition at <a href=\"http://www.endeavourpress.com\" title=\"\">Endeavour Press</a>. The publishing startup may have a scruffy website and&nbsp;scruffier offices but when its founders tell you, not entirely joking,&nbsp;that they could be as big as Penguin, you almost believe them. Because this is a firm that – almost unheard of in this brave new digital world – knows how to make money from ebooks.</p><p>Endeavour began two years ago after&nbsp;Matthew Lynn grew frustrated when his publishers were reluctant to let him publish a digital single to promote his crime novel. Realising how easy it was to do it himself, he thought there could be a business in it&nbsp;and teamed up with publicist Richard Foreman.</p><p>Two-thirds of Endeavour's ebooks are cannily selected out-of-print titles, from <a href=\"http://www.endeavourpress.com/meet-the-authors/350-a-j-p-taylor.html\" title=\"\">AJP Taylor on the causes of the first world war</a> to <a href=\"http://www.endeavourpress.com/2012-05-09-07-55-12/major-endeavours/340-the-ulysses-voyage-by-tim-severin-publication-date-9-july-2013.html\" title=\"\">Tim Severin's nautical adventures</a>. It also publishes short, instantly updated, biographies of public figures such as Kate Middleton, and anthologies from writers including <em>Mail on Sunday</em> columnist Rachel Johnson.</p><p>Success in digital publishing, say Endeavour's founders, lies in volume (outsourcing editing and cover design,&nbsp;they publish eight titles a week and are hoping to reach 10 by Christmas) and flexibility with pricing.&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;splashing out on publicity campaigns, Lynn and Foreman play around&nbsp;with Amazon's algorithm, increasing an ebook's price (though never above £2.99) once it breaks into Amazon's charts. They make on average £1 a copy, &nbsp;with authors getting&nbsp;25% of the cover price, compared with 25% of revenue as with most publishers.</p><p>There are useful lessons here, especially for those who hope the ebook market is flattening out. As Lynn points out: \"A year ago you had to sell 250 copies to get into the Amazon top 100, now it's 450.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418759163|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b82466d3986f8c31b760070239e75a2a7efb2f32 -->",

        "headline":"The Story of Music by Howard Goodall – review",
        "body":"<p>There is a fascinating point made on the very first page of <a href=\"http://www.howardgoodall.co.uk\" title=\"\">Howard Goodall</a>'s snappily written journey through 40,000 years of music. Until the late 19th century, he writes, even the most devoted music lover might only hear their \"favourite\" piece three or four times in his or her life. And yet now, it's possible to download a comprehensive Spotify playlist to soundtrack each of Goodall's chapters. Music, he says, has become as \"ubiquitous as the air we breathe\".</p><p>The Emmy, Brit and Bafta award-winning composer leaves us in no doubt as to whether this is a good thing. One might expect him to bemoan the perceived chasm between classical music and pop. Not a bit of it: \"What used to be called 'classical music',\" he trumpets, \"has become a nursery for experiment, a whimsically creative laboratory… feeding into the general flow of musical activity.\"</p><p>It's one of the rare florid moments in <em>The Story of Music</em>, but Goodall has a point. From the clever appropriation of Mozart's <em>Magic Flute</em> on Kelis's brilliant <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeKIYw_cEms\" title=\"\">Like You</a> to the film music that Goodall writes and celebrates, for him classical is in the mainstream, just in a different way.</p><p><em>The Story of Music</em> was a BBC2 series first and foremost, and a book that could easily get bogged down in the endless possibilities for music down the ages maintains the kind of focus and popular approach television demands. So, when explaining the importance of the ancient Greeks to music's story, he refers to their tradition for singing competitions in front of judges and audience. The comparison with <em>The X Factor</em> might be something of an open goal, but it's one that Goodall scores with aplomb, calling Simon Cowell's talent show a 3,000-year-old format.</p><p>Which isn't to say such populism doesn't grate at times. It doesn't really seem necessary, in an otherwise captivating chapter on why Beethoven changed music, to shoehorn in Taylor Swift's hit single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xg3vE8Ie_E\" title=\"\">Love Story</a> as an example of romanticism. Even Goodall admits it has little in common, so why mention it in the first place?</p><p>But then, there is something compelling about Goodall asking his readers to compare and contrast the opening seconds of a Haydn and a Mozart aria – which of course we can now do with a click of a button – to make his point that the latter wasn't necessarily better than Haydn, just catchier. Despite the excursions into the Beatles and Beyoncé in its closing pages, <em>The Story of Music</em> ends up being, in many ways, the classical music book for people who don't think they like classical music – which is no bad thing at all.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418671575|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|a1fd5e54c34faad4825249c5b63c43150574d186 -->",

        "headline":"The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution 1945-1957 by Frank Dikötter – review",
        "body":"<p>Among the more startling claims that Frank Dikötter makes in his new book, <em>The Tragedy of Liberation</em>, is that there were no landlords in China. The landlord – a key symbol of historic cruelty and oppression – is the central character in Chinese communist mythology, vilified in epic verse, in film, in opera, literature and even in sculpture in the group work <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_Collection_Courtyard\" title=\"\"><em>Rent Collection Courtyard</em></a>. Land reform, the party's overthrow of the landlords and the sharing of the spoils among the peasants in the early 1950s remains for many a redemptive moment in the tortured story of the Chinese revolution.</p><p>Dikötter is a historian at the University of Hong Kong whose previous book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/05/maos-great-famine-dikotter-review\" title=\"\"><em>Mao's Great Famine</em></a>, a harrowing account of the mass starvation of the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and early 60s, won the Samuel Johnson prize in 2011. This book covers the period immediately preceding that – from the end of the second world war to 1957.</p><p>It is conventionally regarded as a relatively less awful period of communist rule, partly because we know what followed: brutal forced collectivisation, mass starvation, labour camps, enslavement in pointless grandiose projects and, after the briefest of respites, the Cultural Revolution.</p><p>Dikötter gives short shrift to this benign view: on every page, he confronts his reader with new instances of brutality as the regime eliminated its rivals and set in place its apparatus of terror. When it relaxed, it was only to prepare the next assault.</p><p>Land reform symbolised the overthrow of the old order and the peasants' reward for their service to the revolutionary cause. Dikötter, though, argues it was a sham. He explores in some detail the process in Yuanbao, a village in Manchuria that won fame as the setting of a novel, <em>The Hurricane</em>, which was zealous enough to win the Stalin prize for literature in 1951. In the fictional account, fervent revolutionary peasants rose as one against their oppressors. In reality, Dikötter writes, the villagers in this and other family villages in China were conservative, their people bound together by ties of kinship and obligation, each living at much the same level as his neighbour. Only \"a few ruffians and vagrants\" were attracted to communism and they became the party activists who badgered the villagers into believing there was a landlord class that they might overthrow.</p><p>It took weeks of indoctrination to generate sufficient hatred for people to beat their neighbour to death. This process was repeated across the country and, at different times, against different targets until Mao's death in 1976. The victims were distinguished by nothing more than their victimhood: they could be as poor as their accusers – or poorer – without being saved. By this account, there was never a moment when liberation  deliveredanything more than hunger, immiseration and servitude. Farmers were hungrier than before liberation, steadily reduced to a state-sponsored serfdom, tied to the land and rewarded in kind for their labour. Production plummeted, intellectuals, businessmen and petty shopkeepers were persecuted in turn.</p><p>Dikötter's work has aimed to demolish almost every claim to truth or virtue the Chinese Communist party ever made. He combines a vivid eye for detail with a historian's diligence in the archives., though he has been criticised by fellow scholars for his use of sources and attributions.  Powerful though his work undoubtedly is, it leaves some questions unanswered: the CCP established complete control in a huge&nbsp;country that had been torn apart&nbsp;by war for the best part of 50 years. Was terror the only explanation?</p><p>In the beginning, at least, faith and hope played a part, however misplaced both turned out to be. At times, the Chinese revolution resembled a religious crusade in which people sought sacrifice and even martyrdom for a cause they were convinced was transcendent. Even when the party was at its most implacable and abusive, turning on the faithful as traitors or counter-revolutionaries, the victims often criticised themselves rather than the party, and submitted to its judgments. Dikötter is unsparing in his account of the effects of communist rule. There is still room for a closer understanding of what they thought they were doing, and why they succeeded. <strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418746173|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9146c8a83250c54d579ad4651db85a59ed171f76 -->",

        "headline":"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy by Helen Fielding – review",
        "body":"<p>It's always a jolt to remember that the first two Bridget Jones books, published way back in the 90s, predated texting, tweeting, Facebook and internet dating: the constant stream of personal updates pinging between our devices in 2013. Her diary-style abbreviations, number-crunching obsessiveness over trivia and jokey combination of self-exposure and self-deprecation have had such an influence on the tone of social media that we all sound like Bridget now.</p><p>So it's no surprise that Helen Fielding was tempted to let Bridget loose on what looks like her natural terrain. Think what opportunities modern technology offers for embarrassment: the erroneously forwarded email, the ill-advised drunken text, the disastrous internet date. What's surprising, and cheering, is that rather than freeze-framing her as the eternal thirtysomething, Fielding has allowed Bridget to age in real time, making her 51 (and in need of glasses to operate her smartphone).</p><p>More shockingly, instead of the dissatisfied divorcee one might have expected, Bridget is now a tragic widow. Mark Darcy has died a typically noble death, leaving her with two small children, Billy and Mabel. These days, as well as counting calories and alcohol units, she's also totting up nits on the comb and bags of grated cheese scoffed&nbsp;from the fridge while making the kids' supper.</p><p>Having had children late, and been bereaved, she's once again out of step with her friends, just as she was with the \"smug marrieds\" of her 30s. Now Jude is on the internet dating not-so-merry go round, Tom is obsessed with boutique hotel bargains on Laterooms.com, and glamorous Talitha is refusing to countenance that 60 might be middle-aged. Time has turned Daniel Cleaver from bad boy into sad case, unable to talk to a woman without inquiring after the colour of her \"panties\" and only good for a spot of inept babysitting.</p><p>And Bridget, after five years' mourning, is looking to get back into the dating game. But will the old rules still apply? \"Everything has changed since you were single,\" says Talitha. \"There was no texting. There were no emails. People spoke on telephones. Plus, young women are more sexually aggressive now, and men are naturally more lazy. You have to, at the very least, … encourage.\"</p><p>After launching herself on Twitter as @JoneseyBJ (\"Cannot figure out how to put up photo. Is just empty egg-shaped graphic. Is fine! Can be photo of self before was conceived\") and waiting for the followers to flood in, she hooks a \"toyboy\", 29-year-old Roxster, whose \"ripped\" body makes her the envy of her drooping middle-aged friends. Cue many comic tweets and texts, and a surprising number of fart and vomit jokes. There's the familiar agonising, with why-hasn't-he-called replaced by why-hasn't-he-texted, but mostly Roxster is funny, sexy and adoring enough to fulfil any woman's wishes.</p><p>Which is part of the problem: Bridget has been given such a tragic backstory, and the very grown-up burden of young fatherless children, that there's less traction to be had from dating niggles; and with so much darkness there already, Fielding seems unwilling to write any more in. There's a new sentimentality, even slushiness, to her old subjects of love, sex and loneliness; the familiar jaunty tone is reserved for playground politics and the chaos and cuteness of bringing up children.</p><p>But while the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years, in countless slummy-mummy columns and books by Allison Pearson or Gill Hornby (all influenced, of course, by Fielding herself). There's a beautifully judged scene where Bridget is pierced with ridiculous overwhelming love for her children, even as they poo and puke in the grip of illness, but mostly the crushed rice cakes, lost car keys and melon balls for the sports day picnic have been done to death.</p><p>Also, where Bridget in her 30s was an everywoman figure, here she's a very yummy mummy indeed. Darcy has left her financially secure, with no need to work on anything but her improbable screenplay, an updating of Hedda Gabler set in Queen's Park. It's up to Roxster, part of the impoverished younger generation, to introduce her to the delights of the night bus. It's odd how posh contemporary comic writing about motherhood tends to be, and Mad About the Boy is no exception. As Bridget floats fragrantly around her son's school concert at a stately home, or wells up at the choir service, all the while having heart-thumping encounters with a masterful teacher, the book starts to seem less like a satire on modern life and more like a good old Jilly Cooper.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194762|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f8ec11d3bcd3666462a225adeb532d6313f32a3c -->",

No one gave the midget a prayer. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/david-goliath-malcolm-gladwell-review\" title=\"\">The giant's name was Goliath. The midget's name was David.</a> You might have read about their battle in the Old Testament. But the Bible got it wrong. David was not the underdog.</p><p>Most people make assumptions about power and jump to ridiculous conclusions. Who does not think the country with the most men and weaponry will automatically win a war? Not counting those of you who lived through Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. Take the American invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/grenada\" title=\"\">Grenada</a>. Although Grenada was much the smaller country, it actually held all the aces. Had Grenada played its cards just a little better, the US would have been wiped off the face of the earth.</p><p>Vivek Ranadive decided to coach his daughter's basketball team. Vivek realised that most coaches had made the simple error of packing their teams with players who were at least 6ft 7in. His daughter's friends were 5ft&nbsp;3in. Vivek understood his team could run through the legs of the opposition before climbing on to each other's shoulders to score a slam dunk. They beat the Boston Celtics 89-12. In their dreams.</p><p>Can you have too much money? Personally, I don't think you can, or I would have stopped chancing my arm with counterintuitive anecdotes long ago. But research shows you can. Jim was very happy when he didn't have much money. Now he's a top Hollywood producer and not very happy. See what I mean?</p><p>Richard is dyslexic. Most people would consider it to be a disadvantage. But Richard worked very hard, got a bit lucky and founded his Virgin empire. Richard could not have done this had he not been dyslexic. Having dyslexia is actually a blessing and anyone who has the condition and has not become a billionaire should be ashamed.</p><p>Learning to understand when your disadvantage is an advantage and not a disadvantage can be tricky. Katy was devastated when her entire family was wiped out in an air crash. Then she realised that at least she was alive and would inherit all the money. She went on to become a moderately successful real-estate agent in Florida.</p><p>Terry was a large trout in a North American lake. After graduating top of the class from the lake's high school, Terry decided to travel to the ocean to make his fortune. He got gobbled up by Thomas the tuna. Sometimes, it really is better to be a big fish in a little pond, rather a little fish in a big pond.</p><p>In 1963, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/martin-luther-king-dream-speech-history\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a> went to Birmingham, Alabama. Martin Luther King was black. Birmingham, Alabama, was known to be the most racist city in the USA. Therefore, Birmingham, Alabama, was not a safe place for Martin Luther King. But Martin Luther King went anyway. If Martin Luther King had been white, no one would have noticed his presence in Birmingham, Alabama. But because Martin Luther King had the courage to be black and he did go to Birmingham, Alabama, the civil rights movement made significant progress.</p><p>Less is sometimes more. And more is sometimes less. It's all a question of perception. Bobby was a career criminal. When California introduced a three strikes and you go to jail policy, Bobby went on a killing spree. The penalties for murder were so severe, they made no difference to him. But when California reduced the maximum sentence from 238 years to 110 years, Bobby decided to go straight. Bobby went to Harvard and became a traffic cop in Iowa.</p><p>There was once a boy who looked a bit different. We'll call him Leo Sayer. Because that's his name. Some people laughed at Leo because he had silly hair. Others didn't want to be his friend because he was always telling them that he was right and they were wrong. Leo decided to use his odd hair and off-putting mannerisms to his advantage and changed his name to Malcolm. Malcolm wrote a book telling people how everything they knew was wrong. It became a bestseller. So Malcolm wrote another book just the same. And another. He even rewrote Aesop's Fables. Still no one noticed. Malcolm cultivated a persona of being an outsider while earning huge amounts of money from banks, tobacco and pharmaceutical companies. Malcolm earns more for a one-hour talk than you will earn in a year. So who is laughing now?</p><p><strong>Digested read, digested: </strong>You make me feel like snoring.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419070502|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8e742438c5ac11e7c559181ef723805b32c3ed32 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thank you for your&nbsp;email. I am currently out of the&nbsp;office, and will respond on my return. I have been out of the office since the start of this year, attempting to conduct my correspondence offline, and although the attempt has been only partially successful I will continue to be, as far&nbsp;as possible, out of the office.</p><p>Of course, when I say I'm out of the office, what I actually mean is that I'm&nbsp;trying to write. At my desk. In my&nbsp;office. I'm as confused as you are about&nbsp;what is work and what isn't work. When is a writer – whose job is to&nbsp;notice, and think, and puzzle over the right words for the right thing – not&nbsp;at work? And all the other stuff that&nbsp;turns that work into work that pays –&nbsp;the invoices, the invitations, the&nbsp;follow-ups, the applications – is that work, or is that the work that stops the&nbsp;writer from getting to the work?</p><p>If your email is work-related, please contact my agent or my publisher. If you wish to contact me directly, you could write me a letter. Have you written a letter lately? This might be a&nbsp;good moment to rediscover the pleasures of doing so.</p><p>I wrote a lot of letters, years ago. From the age of 15 through to my final year at university, I spent much of my spare time writing – and waiting for replies to – letters. My correspondents were a combination of friends I had made at summer camps and people I'd&nbsp;connected with through fanzines. Some, I will concede, were girls I was trying to impress. One was a penpal in the traditional sense, from Prague, who sent me tapes of underground Czech punk rock in exchange for fey indie mixtapes I'd recorded off the radio. And it was in those letters that I&nbsp;first began to think consciously about&nbsp;how to write; to describe the world around me, to fictionalise and recreate, to play with different voices. The letters were handwritten and illustrated, usually on lined A4 sheets, and were often sent with additional material; tapes, photos, magazine cuttings. These were physical objects, which travelled a physical distance and&nbsp;maintained a physical presence in&nbsp;my life. I have them still, long after many of the friendships they document have faded away.</p><p>If your email is urgent then I would ask you to reconsider your definition of&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>Letters, even when sent by return of&nbsp;post, always give you time to reconsider. The inbuilt delay of the postal network reintroduces patience to a correspondence. A letter always comes from the past, from elsewhere, rather than from the ever-insistent here and now of the digital. Thinking about writing a letter is different from thinking about writing an email.</p><p>If you have emailed repeatedly since I first set up my out of office reply at the start of the year, you may wish to note that I am still out of the office. For&nbsp;a month or so after I first stepped away from my desk, the emails kept coming. I ignored them, with a Bartlebyesque thrill, and eventually they slowed to a trickle. Some people did redirect their messages to my agent&nbsp;or publisher (although many didn't, interestingly), and some people sent me postcards and letters. The letters I've written in reply have been the first for a long time. It's taken a while to get over the hurdle of feeling like finding an envelope and a stamp and a postbox is a hassle; it's really not.&nbsp;Our postal system is still intact (for&nbsp;a while at least). And once that hurdle's crossed, letter-writing can be as quick or as slow as you like. It can also be a very good way of turning a&nbsp;casual acquaintance into a friend; the&nbsp;aura of privacy which a letter carries, the sense that you're not just adding something else to the datastream that could be forwarded or copied at will, encourages a sometimes surprising level of revelation.</p><p>By semi-coincidence, this week I've&nbsp;launched a new literary journal, <a href=\"http://theletterspage.tumblr.com/about\" title=\"\">the&nbsp;Letters Page</a>, which invites submissions in the form of hand-written letters, and I've been struck by&nbsp;how many of those submissions have been personal and self-revealing. Even though the writers were knowingly writing for publication (with the possible exception of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/screwtop-thompson-magnus-mills-review\" title=\"\">Magnus Mills</a>, whose handwritten letter explaining at length why he couldn't submit a handwritten letter was so good that we published it anyway), there was clearly something about the form that encouraged openness; not the oversharing of social media, but a&nbsp;more unexpected intimacy. If you're interested, the journal, which I'm editing with the creative-writing students at the University of Nottingham, is published three times a&nbsp;year as a downloadable pdf. Yes. The&nbsp;irony. I know. The first issue, with&nbsp;letters from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/colum-mccann\" title=\"\">Colum McCann</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/06/fiction.roundupreviews\" title=\"\">Clare&nbsp;Wigfall</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/fiction1\" title=\"\">Gerard Donovan</a> and others is already out; you can subscribe for free at theletterspage.ac.uk.</p><p>Attempting to spend the whole year away from email hasn't been without its difficulties. Reactions have ranged from bemused or indifferent to hostile. One writer asked my agent to tell me that I was \"a pain in the ass and a diva&nbsp;and everything else\", which is probably fair comment. For a time, I was getting printouts of emails in the post, which was just a way of making life difficult for everyone else; and I've&nbsp;sent enough 500-word text messages to realise that sometimes email is the perfect tool for the job. I've&nbsp;enjoyed rediscovering letter writing, and will continue to work my&nbsp;way through the stamps and envelopes. But I will be using email, sparingly, while continuing to remain mostly out of the office. So that I&nbsp;can&nbsp;get to my desk. So that the work doesn't get in the way of the work.</p><p>Your email is important to me, and I&nbsp;will reply in due course. But I would prefer not to. Please consider the environment.</p><p>Jon McGregor is out of the office but still occasionally on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_mcgregor\" title=\"\">@jon_mcgregor</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418876184|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0eb1f85f9287aa88e0cfad6401cbdb57e9d65cd1 -->",

        "headline":"Penelope Lively: 'So this is old age'",
        "body":"<p>Years ago, I heard Anthony Burgess speak at the Edinburgh book festival. He was impressive in that he&nbsp;spoke for an hour&nbsp;without a single note, and was fluent and coherent. But of the content of his talk all I remember are his opening words: &quot;For me, death is already sounding its high C.&quot; This was around 1980, I think, so he was in&nbsp;his early 60s at the time, and died in&nbsp;1993. I was in my late 40s, and he seemed to me – not&nbsp;old, exactly, but getting on a bit.</p><p>Today, people in their 60s seem – not young, just nicely mature. Old age is in the eye of the beholder. I am 80, so I am old, no question. The high C is audible, I suppose, but I don't pay it much attention. I don't think much about death. I am not exactly afraid of&nbsp;it, though after reading, with admiration, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/08/biography.julianbarnes\" title=\"\">Julian Barnes's book <em>Nothing to Be Frightened of</em></a>, I felt that I&nbsp;had not sufficiently explored my own position on the matter. But perhaps I&nbsp;have arrived at the state of death-consciousness that he identifies – we cannot truly savour life without a regular awareness of extinction. Yes,&nbsp;I&nbsp;recognise that, along&nbsp;with the natural&nbsp;human taste for&nbsp;a&nbsp;conclusion: there has been a beginning, which proposes an end. I&nbsp;am afraid of the run-up to death, because I have had to&nbsp;watch it. But&nbsp;I&nbsp;think that many of us&nbsp;who are on&nbsp;the&nbsp;last lap are too busy with the baggage of old age to waste much time&nbsp;anticipating the finishing line. We&nbsp;have to get used to being the&nbsp;person we are, the person we have&nbsp;always been, but encumbered now&nbsp;with various indignities and disabilities, shoved as it were into some new incarnation. We feel much the same, but clearly are not. We have&nbsp;entered an unexpected dimension; dealing with this is the&nbsp;new&nbsp;challenge.</p><p>Old age is the new demographic, and&nbsp;you can't ignore the problems created by a group that has been getting steadily larger – alarmingly larger if you&nbsp;are in the business of allocating national expenditure. The poor have always been with us, and now the old are too.</p><p>We have not been, in the past, and we are not so much around still in some parts of the developing world. But in the west we are entrenched, bolstered by our pensions, brandishing our Freedom Passes, cluttering up the&nbsp;surgeries, with an average life expectancy of around 80. But our experience is one unknown to most of&nbsp;humanity, over time. We are the pioneers, as an established social group&nbsp;gobbling up benefits and giving grief to government agencies. Before the 16th century, few people saw 50, let alone 80. Scroll back, and average life expectancy diminishes century by century; 2,000 years ago, it stood at around 25. That said, the old have always been around – it seems that perhaps 8% of the population of medieval England was over 60 – but not as a significant demographic group, rather as noticeable individuals.</p><p>The Bible blithely allowed for threescore years and 10 – where on earth did they get that from? You'd be&nbsp;lucky indeed to make that in the Middle East in Roman times. Life expectancy is of course a slippery concept. The trick is to get through infancy, then the next four years; notch those up, and you're in with a fighting chance –&nbsp;if you are a medieval peasant (or in&nbsp;much of sub-Saharan Africa, or Afghanistan, today) you may well hang&nbsp;in there till 40 or beyond. But&nbsp;chances are you might not leave toddlerhood; the underworld is a teeming sea of tiny ghosts, with, dotted among them, out of scale, inappropriate and incongruous, the exhausted figures of the old. Think Sparta (babies exposed on hillsides), think Coram's Fields (London hospital for foundlings), think Hogarth, think Dickens. Think <em>Kindertotenlieder</em>.</p><p>A recent survey by the Department for Work and Pensions, which is somewhat obsessed with the question of old age, for good reason, found that most believe that old age starts at 59 while youth ends at 41. People over 80,&nbsp;on the other hand, believe 68 to herald old&nbsp;age, while 52 is the end of&nbsp;youth. Of&nbsp;course, of course – it depends&nbsp;where you happen to be standing yourself. And youth has expanded handsomely since Charlotte Bront&euml; wailed, &quot;I am now 32. Youth is&nbsp;gone – gone, – and will never come back; can't help it.&quot; It still won't come back, even after a century and a half of&nbsp;scientific advance, but there is plenty of remedial work on offer by way of nipping and tucking for those feeling a bit desperate. The rest of us&nbsp;settle for the inevitable sag and wrinkle, and simply adjust our concept of the climactic points. Actually, I'd step out of line and go for 70 rather than 68 as the brink of old age; I have too many vigorous and active friends in their late 60s and anyway the round number is neater.</p><p>By 2030 there will be 4 million people over 80 in the United Kingdom – out of a population of around 60 million. No wonder the Department for&nbsp;Work and Pensions is getting rattled&nbsp;on behalf of its successors. I&nbsp;will&nbsp;have handed in my dinner pail&nbsp;and my Freedom Pass by then, I&nbsp;sincerely hope, though I can't quite count on it.&nbsp;I&nbsp;come from a horribly long-lived family. My mother died at 93; her brother made it to 100; their mother reached 97. I look grimly at&nbsp;these figures; I do not wish to&nbsp;compete.</p><p>You aren't going to get old, of course, when you are young. We won't ever be old, partly because we can't imagine what it is like to be old, but also because we don't want to, and –&nbsp;crucially – are not particularly interested. When I was a teenager, I&nbsp;spent much time with my Somerset grandmother, then around 70. She was&nbsp;a brisk and applied grandmother who was acting effectively as a mother-substitute; I was devoted to her, but I&nbsp;don't remember ever considering what it could be like to be her. She&nbsp;simply was; unchangeable, unchanging, in her tweed skirt, her blouse, her Shetland cardigan, her suit for Sunday church, worn with chenille turban, her felt hat&nbsp;for shopping in Minehead. Her opinions that had been honed in the early part of the century; her horror of&nbsp;colours that &quot;clashed&quot;; her love of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Berlioz. I never thought about how it must be to&nbsp;be her; equally, I couldn't imagine her other than she was, as though she had sprung thus into life, had never been young.</p><p>Old age is forever stereotyped. Years&nbsp;ago, I was a judge for a national children's writing competition. They&nbsp;had been asked to write about &quot;grandparents&quot;; in every offering the grandparent was a figure with stick and&nbsp;hearing aid, knitting by the fireside or pottering in the garden. The average grandparent would then have been around 60, and probably still at work. When booking a rail ticket by phone recently, I found myself shifted from the automated voice to a real person when I had said I had a Senior Railcard, presumably on the grounds that I&nbsp;might get muddled and require help – which was kindly, I suppose, but I was managing quite well. We are too keen to bundle everyone by category; as a&nbsp;child, I used to be maddened by the assumption that I would get along famously with someone just because we were both eight.</p><p>The stereotypes of old age run from&nbsp;the smiling old dear to the grumbling curmudgeon. In fiction, they are rife –&nbsp;indeed fiction is perhaps mainly responsible for the standard perception of the old, with just a few&nbsp;writers able to raise the game. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/murielspark\" title=\"\">Muriel Spark</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/05/memento-mori-muriel-spark-novel\" title=\"\"><em>Memento Mori</em></a> is a black&nbsp;comedy, with a group of elderly people plagued by sinister phone calls:&nbsp;&quot;Remember you must die.&quot; No&nbsp;stereotypes, but a bunch of sharply drawn individuals, convincingly old, bedevilled by specific ailments, and mainly concerned with revisions of their pasts in terms of will-making and&nbsp;the machinations of relationships. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kingsleyamis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a> also went for comedy, in&nbsp;<em>Ending Up</em>, with a group cohabiting in a cottage and busy scoring points off&nbsp;each other – funny, but with a bleak undertone. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/22/fiction.saulbellow\" title=\"\"><em>Ravelstein</em></a><em> </em>is neither comedy (though not without humour) nor stereotype, but strong writing about the view both of and from old age. And he was old – 84 – when the book was published, whereas neither Spark nor Amis were – Spark was 41 when<em> Memento Mori</em> came out. Just three examples; they spring to mind simply because memorable and&nbsp;effective writing about old age is rare,&nbsp;though there are of course other instances. Old age seems to be a danger zone for many novelists, somehow even more of a challenge than the universal problem of writing about and&nbsp;from the point of view of a man if&nbsp;you are a woman, and vice versa; we&nbsp;all have to deal with that unless we&nbsp;are to be left with a very curiously populated novel. But the old and the young are, somehow, the elusive element; equally, few novelists are good at children.</p><p>&quot;What do they think has happened, the old fools, / To make them like this?&quot; Any reference to <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/best-poems/philip-larkin/the-old-fools/\" title=\"\">Philip Larkin's poem</a> in this context is almost a cliche. The poem marries perception of age with stark truth: &quot;Well, / We shall find out.&quot; He never did, of course, dying at 63. And the perception is of drooling, confused, incapable old age – not a stereotype so much as an evocation, both harsh and reflective.</p><p>Am I envious of the young? Would I&nbsp;want to be young again? On the first count – not really, which surprises me.&nbsp;On the second – certainly not, if it&nbsp;meant a repeat performance. I would like to have back vigour and robust health, but that is not exactly envy. And, having known youth, I'm well aware that it has its own traumas, that it is no Elysian progress, that it can be a&nbsp;time of distress and disappointment, that it is exuberant and exciting, but it is no picnic. I don't particularly want to go back there.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419138500\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380812980776/penelope-lively-008.jpg\" alt=\"penelope lively\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>‘This old-age self is just a top dressing’ … Penelope Lively. Photograph: Eamonn Mccabe</figcaption></figure><p>And in any case, I am someone else now. There are things I no longer want, things I no longer do, things that are now important. Writing survives, for me – so far, so far. Other pleasures – needs – do not. I was a gardener. Well, I&nbsp;am a gardener, but a sadly reduced one, in every sense. I have a small paved rectangle of London garden, full of pots, with a cherished 20-year-old corokia, and two pittosporums, and various fuchsias, and Convolvulus cneorum and hakonechloa grass and&nbsp;euphorbia and heuchera and a Hydrangea petiolaris all over the back wall. It gives me much pleasure, but is a far cry from what I once gardened – a&nbsp;half acre or so that included a serious vegetable garden. All I can do now is potter with the hose in summer, and do a bit of snipping here and there, thanks to the arthritis; forget travel, what I really do miss is intensive gardening. Digging, raking, hoeing. Pruning a shaggy rose: shaping for future splendour. Dividing fat clumps of snowdrops: out of many shall come more still. And that was – is – the miraculous power of gardening: it&nbsp;evokes tomorrow, it is eternally forward-looking, it invites plans and ambitions, creativity, expectation. Next year I will try celeriac. And that new pale blue sweet pea. Would Iris stylosa do just here? Gardening defies time; you labour today in the interests of tomorrow; you think in seasons to come, cutting down the border this autumn but with next spring in your mind's eye.</p><p>Can't garden. Don't want to&nbsp;travel. But can read, must read. For me, reading is the essential palliative, the daily fix. Old reading, revisiting, but new reading too, lots of it, reading in&nbsp;all directions, plenty of fiction, history&nbsp;and archaeology always, reading to satisfy perennial tastes, reading sideways too – try her, try him, &nbsp;try&nbsp;that.</p><p>This someone else, this alter ego who has arrived, is less adventurous, more risk-averse, costive with her time. Well – there is the matter of the spirit and the flesh, and that is the crux of it: the spirit is still game for experience, anything on offer, but the&nbsp;body most definitely is not, and unfortunately calls the shots. My mind seems to be holding out – so far, so far. My poor father had Alzheimer's; that shadow lies over all of my age group, with the number of sufferers now rising all the time – but that is of course a factor of the new demographic.</p><p>Professor Tom Kirkwood has written: &quot;There is a little progress with age-related diseases.&quot; But he went on to say that in his study of a group over 85 not one had zero age-related disease, and most had four or five. Doctors' surgeries and hospital waiting rooms are well stocked with those over 65; it is the old and the young who demand most attention. Over the last years, I have had surgery and treatment for breast cancer; hips and knees are holding out so far but my&nbsp;back gave in long ago: I have been in intermittent pain for 15 years – discomfort always, tipping into real pain. My sight is dodgy – myopic macular degeneration, which may get&nbsp;worse (but also – fingers crossed – may not). There is a shoulder problem – a torn tendon. The worst was a cracked vertebra, four years ago, which&nbsp;required surgery – balloon kyphoplasty – which left me in intense,&nbsp;unrelenting and apparently inexplicable pain for three and a half months. Pain that had the specialists shaking their heads, baffled, passing me around like the unwelcome parcel in that children's game – and I am sorry, apologetic, through the miasma of pain, sorry to be such a challenge, but sorrier still for myself.</p><p>I have sometimes wondered if an experience like that has some salutary value for any of us: it puts into perspective subsequent distresses. As&nbsp;for the rest of my continuing ailments, they seem more or less par for the course for an 80 year old; of those I know in my age group, most can chalk up a few, or more, with only&nbsp;one or two that I can think of maddeningly unscathed.</p><p>You get used to it. And that surprises me. You get used to diminishment, to a&nbsp;body that is stalled, an impediment. An alter ego is amazed, aghast perhaps – myself in the&nbsp;roaring 40s, when robust health was an assumption, a given, something you barely noticed because it was always there. Acceptance has set in, somehow, has crept up on you, which is just as well, because the alternative – perpetual rage and resentment – would not help matters. &quot;In 70 or 80 years a&nbsp;Man may have a deep Gust of the World. Know what it is, what it can afford, and what 'tis to have been a Man.&quot; Reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/18/religio-medici-thomas-browne-review\" title=\"\">Sir Thomas Browne</a>, today I'm in touch with a former self, who was discovering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/18/religio-medici-thomas-browne-review\" title=\"\"><em>Urne-Buriall</em></a> in&nbsp;Oxfordshire in the 1970s: &quot;The treasures of time lie high, in Urnes, Coynes and Monuments, scarce below the roots of some vegetables.&quot; Today, I&nbsp;am warming to Browne's discussion of the long view: &quot;such a compass of years will shew new examples of old things, parallelisms of occurrences through the whole course of Time, and&nbsp;nothing be monstrous unto him, who may in that time understand not only the varieties of Man, but the varieties of himself, and how many Men he hath been in that extent of time.&quot; Yes, yes – exactly. And how strange, how exciting, to find an echo&nbsp;of what I have been thinking about myself in that wonderful 17th‑century mind.</p><p>And it is of the varieties of myself that I am aware, seeing how today's response to Browne links me to that Oxfordshire self, in mid-life, busy with&nbsp;children, but essentially the same&nbsp;person. The body may decline, may seem a dismal reflection of what went before, but the mind has a healthy continuity, and some kind of&nbsp;inbuilt fidelity to itself, a coherence over time. We learn, and experience; attitudes and opinions may change, but most people, it seems to me, retain an essential persona, a caste of mind, a&nbsp;trademark footprint. A poet's voice will&nbsp;alter and develop, but young <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamwordsworth\" title=\"\">Wordsworth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alfred-tennyson\" title=\"\">Tennyson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin\" title=\"\">Larkin</a> are not&nbsp;essentially adrift from their later&nbsp;selves. There is this interesting accretion – the varieties of ourselves – and the puzzling thing in old age is to&nbsp;find yourself out there as the culmination of all these, knowing that&nbsp;they are you, but that you are also&nbsp;now this someone else.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/simonedebeauvoir\" title=\"\">Simone de Beauvoir</a> confronted the&nbsp;problem in her extensive study <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1972/mar/15/mainsection.fromthearchive\" title=\"\"><em>Old&nbsp;Age</em></a>: &quot;Old age is particularly difficult to assume because we have always regarded it as something alien, a foreign species: 'Can I have become a&nbsp;different being while I still remain myself?'&quot; What is at issue, it seems to&nbsp;me, is a new and disturbing relationship with time. It is as though you advanced along a plank hanging over a canyon: once, there was a long reassuring stretch of plank ahead; now&nbsp;there is plank behind, plenty of&nbsp;it,&nbsp;but only a few plank paces ahead.&nbsp;Once, time was the distance into which you peered – misty, impenetrable, with&nbsp;no&nbsp;discernible landmarks, but reassuringly there. In old age, that dependable distance has been whisked&nbsp;suddenly behind you – and it does seem to have happened suddenly. Not&nbsp;long ago, there was some kind of&nbsp;balance – a fore and aft, as&nbsp;it were. No&nbsp;longer; time has looped back, regressed, it no longer lies ahead,&nbsp;but behind. It has turned into something else, something called memory, and we&nbsp;need it – oh dear me, yes, we need it&nbsp;– but it is dismaying to have lost that sense of expectation, of anticipation. The mind does not always keep up – the subconscious, rather. In dreams, I&nbsp;am not always the self of today; I am often young, or younger, and if my children are present they have often become children again, obligingly – we&nbsp;have all jumped backwards. The mind cannot bear too much reality, it seems; in the same way, my husband Jack is nearly always present in my dreams – it&nbsp;is 12 years since he died, but&nbsp;at night he returns, not always recognisably himself, but a shadowy dream companion figure that I always know to be him.</p><p>When De Beauvoir published <em>Old Age</em> in 1970 she was 62, so from my viewpoint she was barely even on the approach road to the status itself. And, indeed, her own life experience is hardly cited at all in her long, densely researched, somewhat impassioned and rather wonderful book, which remains an illuminating investigation of the subject. She embarked on this, she says, because she saw a conspiracy of silence about old age, as though all were in denial, refusing to anticipate their own future, and, in consequence, choosing to ignore the situation of the old. She wanted to explore the way in which old age is not just a biological but a cultural fact. She ploughed through history to see how the old had&nbsp;got on, from classical Greece to the&nbsp;present day, she pursued evidence of attitudes towards old age. She searched out the voices of the old. The&nbsp;book is laced with references from&nbsp;art and literature, from sociology, psychology, philosophy. She died at 78,&nbsp;so she got there herself – in 1986 you would certainly be considered old&nbsp;at 78.</p><p>Whether or not she turned the analytic eye on her own old age, she had already had a grim experience of it, managing the care of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jeanpaulsartre\" title=\"\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> in his wretched decline into infirmity and blindness. A harsh diminishment, for these two intellectual heavyweights, and nicely reflecting all that she had written of the alienation from oneself that is the condition of old age.</p><p>I am sharing old age with friends, but not with a partner. In that, my situation is entirely average: three in five women over 75 in this country live&nbsp;alone. The men go first. Jack knew&nbsp;that, and expected it; after his&nbsp;retirement, he spent much time organising our affairs, and would talk routinely of a future that excluded him, to my irritation. I would remonstrate, and he would smile amiably: &quot;Statistics …&quot; Well, he was right – though cheated, statistically, since he died at 69. The world is full of&nbsp;widows – several among my closer friends. We have each known that grim rite of passage, have engaged with grief and loss, and have not exactly emerged but found a way of living after and beyond. It is an entirely changed life, for anyone who has been in a long marriage – 41 years, for me: alone in bed, alone most of the time, without that presence towards which you turned for advice, reassurance, with whom you shared the good news and the bad. Every decision now taken alone; no one to defuse anxieties. And&nbsp;a thoroughly commonplace experience – everywhere, always – so&nbsp;get on with it&nbsp;and don't behave as though you are uniquely afflicted. I didn't tell myself that at the time, and I&nbsp;doubt if it would have helped if I had, but it is what I have come – not so much to feel as to understand.</p><p>A common experience – like old age&nbsp;itself, for those fortunate enough (if that is the right word) to get there. Here we are – the eightysomethings – around 1.4 million of us in the UK, most of us with nothing much in common except the accretion of years, a historical context, and a generous range of ailments from which we have probably been allocated two or three. For each of us the experience is different, each of us endures – or challenges – it differently. Both endurance and challenge will of course&nbsp;be more successful from the vantage point of financial security, and&nbsp;if you are not too encumbered on&nbsp;the ailment front.</p><p>Old age costs; it costs the nation, it&nbsp;costs those going through it. We contribute nothing, but require maintenance – a winter fuel allowance,&nbsp;free TV licence, bus pass, free prescriptions, all the kindly state indulgences. Those don't add up to luxury, for anyone, any more than the state pension does other than provide basic subsistence. And old age has its needs, its greeds. You may not yearn for a Caribbean cruise – I don't – but&nbsp;certain comforts have become essential, the accustomed perks that make daily existence a bit more than just that. I can't start the day without a bowl of the right kind of muesli topped with some fruit and sheep's milk yoghurt; I can't end it without a glass (or two) of wine. I need the diversions of radio and television. I want flowers in the house and something tempting to eat – these are greeds, I think, rather than needs. And – high priority – there is reading, the daily fix, the time of immersion in whatever is top of my book pile right now. As demands, requirements, all of this is relatively modest. Much of it – the reading, the flowers – goes back to prelapsarian days before old age. The difference, though, is that then there were further needs and greeds, and those seem to have melted away, to have tactfully absented themselves as though to make things a bit easier because they would indeed be an encumbrance now.</p><p>Out with acquisition, excitement, and aspiration except in tempered mode. And, on another front, I don't in the least lament certain emotions. I&nbsp;can&nbsp;remember falling in love, being in love; life would have been incomplete without that particular exaltation, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;wouldn't want to go back there. I&nbsp;still love – there is a swath of people whom I love – but I am glad indeed to&nbsp;be done with that consuming, tormenting form of the emotion.</p><p>So this is old age. If you are not yet in it, you may be shuddering. If you are, you will perhaps disagree, in which case I can only say: this is how it is for me. And if it sounds – to anyone – a pretty pallid sort of place, I can refute that. It is not. Certain desires and drives have gone. But what remains is response. I am as alive to the world as I&nbsp;have ever been – alive to everything I&nbsp;see and hear and feel. I revel in the spring sunshine, and the cream and purple hellebore in the garden; I listen to a radio discussion about the ethics of selective abortion, and chip in at points; the sound of a beloved voice on the phone brings a surge of pleasure. I&nbsp;think there is a sea-change, in old age – a metamorphosis of the sensibilities. With those old consuming vigours now muted, something else comes into its own – an almost luxurious appreciation of the world that you are still in. Spring was never so vibrant; autumn never so richly gold. People are of abiding interest – observed in the street, overheard on a bus. The small pleasures have bloomed into points of relish in the day – food, opening the newspaper (new minted, just for me), a shower, the comfort of bed. It is almost like some kind of end-game salute to the intensity of childhood experience, when the world was new. It is an old accustomed world now, but invested with fresh significance; I've seen all this before, done all this, but am somehow able to find new and sharpened pleasure.</p><p>Those of us not yet in the departure lounge and still able to take a good look at what has made them – us – like this can find some solace in doing so. What has happened is such an eccentric mixture of immediate and long-drawn-out, the arrival of a condition that has been decades in the making but seems to have turned up this morning. The succession of people that we have been&nbsp;– Sir Thomas Browne's &quot;varieties of himself&quot; – are suddenly elided into this (final?) version, disturbingly alien when we catch sight of a mirror, but also evocative of a whole range of known personae. What we have been still lurks – and even more so within. This old age self is just a top dressing, it seems; early selves are still mutinously present, getting a word in&nbsp;now and then. And all this is interesting – hence the solace. I never imagined that old age would be quite like this – possibly because, like most, I&nbsp;never much bothered to imagine it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418866070|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|31f58860bd9f9332c9279753a91a85aa030ef574 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thank you for your&nbsp;email. I am currently out of the&nbsp;office, and will respond on my return. I have been out of the office since the start of this year, attempting to conduct my correspondence offline, and although the attempt has been only partially successful I will continue to be, as far&nbsp;as possible, out of the office.</p><p>Of course, when I say I'm out of the office, what I actually mean is that I'm&nbsp;trying to write. At my desk. In my&nbsp;office. I'm as confused as you are about&nbsp;what is work and what isn't work. When is a writer – whose job is to&nbsp;notice, and think, and puzzle over the right words for the right thing – not&nbsp;at work? And all the other stuff that&nbsp;turns that work into work that pays –&nbsp;the invoices, the invitations, the&nbsp;follow-ups, the applications – is that work, or is that the work that stops the&nbsp;writer from getting to the work?</p><p>If your email is work-related, please contact my agent or my publisher. If you wish to contact me directly, you could write me a letter. Have you written a letter lately? This might be a&nbsp;good moment to rediscover the pleasures of doing so.</p><p>I wrote a lot of letters, years ago. From the age of 15 through to my final year at university, I spent much of my spare time writing – and waiting for replies to – letters. My correspondents were a combination of friends I had made at summer camps and people I'd&nbsp;connected with through fanzines. Some, I will concede, were girls I was trying to impress. One was a penpal in the traditional sense, from Prague, who sent me tapes of underground Czech punk rock in exchange for fey indie mixtapes I'd recorded off the radio. And it was in those letters that I&nbsp;first began to think consciously about&nbsp;how to write; to describe the world around me, to fictionalise and recreate, to play with different voices. The letters were handwritten and illustrated, usually on lined A4 sheets, and were often sent with additional material; tapes, photos, magazine cuttings. These were physical objects, which travelled a physical distance and&nbsp;maintained a physical presence in&nbsp;my life. I have them still, long after many of the friendships they document have faded away.</p><p>If your email is urgent then I would ask you to reconsider your definition of&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>Letters, even when sent by return of&nbsp;post, always give you time to reconsider. The inbuilt delay of the postal network reintroduces patience to a correspondence. A letter always comes from the past, from elsewhere, rather than from the ever-insistent here and now of the digital. Thinking about writing a letter is different from thinking about writing an email.</p><p>If you have emailed repeatedly since I first set up my out of office reply at the start of the year, you may wish to note that I am still out of the office. For&nbsp;a month or so after I first stepped away from my desk, the emails kept coming. I ignored them, with a Bartlebyesque thrill, and eventually they slowed to a trickle. Some people did redirect their messages to my agent&nbsp;or publisher (although many didn't, interestingly), and some people sent me postcards and letters. The letters I've written in reply have been the first for a long time. It's taken a while to get over the hurdle of feeling like finding an envelope and a stamp and a postbox is a hassle; it's really not.&nbsp;Our postal system is still intact (for&nbsp;a while at least). And once that hurdle's crossed, letter-writing can be as quick or as slow as you like. It can also be a very good way of turning a&nbsp;casual acquaintance into a friend; the&nbsp;aura of privacy which a letter carries, the sense that you're not just adding something else to the datastream that could be forwarded or copied at will, encourages a sometimes surprising level of revelation.</p><p>By semi-coincidence, this week I've&nbsp;launched a new literary journal, <a href=\"http://theletterspage.tumblr.com/about\" title=\"\">the&nbsp;Letters Page</a>, which invites submissions in the form of hand-written letters, and I've been struck by&nbsp;how many of those submissions have been personal and self-revealing. Even though the writers were knowingly writing for publication (with the possible exception of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/screwtop-thompson-magnus-mills-review\" title=\"\">Magnus Mills</a>, whose handwritten letter explaining at length why he couldn't submit a handwritten letter was so good that we published it anyway), there was clearly something about the form that encouraged openness; not the oversharing of social media, but a&nbsp;more unexpected intimacy. If you're interested, the journal, which I'm editing with the creative-writing students at the University of Nottingham, is published three times a&nbsp;year as a downloadable pdf. Yes. The&nbsp;irony. I know. The first issue, with&nbsp;letters from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/colum-mccann\" title=\"\">Colum McCann</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/06/fiction.roundupreviews\" title=\"\">Clare&nbsp;Wigfall</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/fiction1\" title=\"\">Gerard Donovan</a> and others is already out; you can subscribe for free at theletterspage.ac.uk.</p><p>Attempting to spend the whole year away from email hasn't been without its difficulties. Reactions have ranged from bemused or indifferent to hostile. One writer asked my agent to tell me that I was \"a pain in the ass and a diva&nbsp;and everything else\", which is probably fair comment. For a time, I was getting printouts of emails in the post, which was just a way of making life difficult for everyone else; and I've&nbsp;sent enough 500-word text messages to realise that sometimes email is the perfect tool for the job. I've&nbsp;enjoyed rediscovering letter writing, and will continue to work my&nbsp;way through the stamps and envelopes. But I will be using email, sparingly, while continuing to remain mostly out of the office. So that I&nbsp;can&nbsp;get to my desk. So that the work doesn't get in the way of the work.</p><p>Your email is important to me, and I&nbsp;will reply in due course. But I would prefer not to. Please consider the environment.</p><p>Jon McGregor is out of the office but still occasionally on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_mcgregor\" title=\"\">@jon_mcgregor</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418876184|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0eb1f85f9287aa88e0cfad6401cbdb57e9d65cd1 -->",

        "headline":"Hanif Kureishi: in praise of adultery",
        "body":"<p>Marriage as a problem, and as a solution, has always been the central subject for drama, the novel and the cinema, just as it has been at the centre of our lives. Most of us have come from a marriage, and, probably, a divorce, of some sort. And the kind of questions that surround lengthy relationships – what is it to live with another person for a long time? What do we expect? What do we need? What do we want? What is the relation between safety and excitement, for each of us? – are the most important of our lives. Marriage brings together the most serious things: sex, love, children, betrayal, boredom, frustration, and property.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/06/le-week-end-review-toronto-2013\" title=\"\"><em>Le Week-End</em></a> is a film set in contemporary Paris that I developed alongside the director Roger Michell, with whom I've worked on a TV series, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/26/4\" title=\"\"><em>The Buddha of Suburbia</em></a>, and two films, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/17/fiction.hanifkureishi\" title=\"\"><em>The Mother</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/26/comedy.drama1\" title=\"\"><em>Venus</em></a>. The films were mostly concerned with a subject we believed was neglected in the cinema, the lives and passions of older people, whose anxieties and desires, we found, were as intense, if not more significant, than those of the young.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/29/lindsay-duncan-film-le-weekend-interview\" title=\"\"><em>Le Week-End</em></a><em> </em>concerns a late middle-aged couple, Nick and Meg, both teachers, who go to Paris to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. While there, they discuss the meaning and direction of their marriage now that their children have left home. Time and health are running out for them as they consider their impending old age and wonder what sort of future they might want, either together or apart. They think about how they might die; but this couple also need to talk about how they have lived: the way in which they have brought up their children, and how the family has worked, where it failed, and where there is regret, bitterness and even fury.</p><p>The film shows the depredations of time, but also the lability of the past, its different meaning and value for both parties, and how, now that the couple are talking, the past can seem as unstable as the future. They are looking in the same direction, but cannot see the same thing. There is no narrative they can agree on.</p><p>Their short sojourn, whatever else it is, will be a time of difficult conversations. What if it occurs to one or other of them that their relationship was a mistake, that it didn't resemble their original hopes at all, and that they could have had a far better life elsewhere? Meanwhile, what have they done to one another? Was there harm? What did they use one another for?</p><p>The couple are from a suburb of Birmingham where they have taught for decades. But \"Paris was where the twentieth century was,\" says <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Paris_France.html?id=3exaKEJ6or8C\" title=\"\">Gertrude Stein in <em>Paris France</em></a>. And Paris, in their provincial English imaginations, represents several desirable things: the fresh ideas and radicalism of the 60s and the barricades of 1968, along with the intellectual revolutions of their youth as exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/14/derrida-biography-benoit-peeters-review\" title=\"\">Derrida</a>, <a href=\"plato.stanford.edu/entries/althusser/\" title=\"\">Althusser</a>, <a href=\"http://www.egs.edu/library/jacques-lacan/biography/\" title=\"\">Lacan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theory.org.uk/ctr-fouc.htm\" title=\"\">Foucault</a>. There are also personal revolutions: the idea of the equal, committed, but \"open\" relationship, as practised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety\" title=\"\">Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir</a>, for whom \"the game of love\" – the rondo of seduction, rejection and change – never had to end.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/16/on-love-stendhal-nicholas-lezard\" title=\"\">Stendhal writes in <em>Love</em></a>, \"<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UbXlk3A1WmgC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=The+pleasures+of+private+life+ought+to+be+augmented+to+an+infinite+degree+by+recurrent+exposure+to+danger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l8ampKYcaN&amp;sig=DjBjxWHsZWy6xEm5myNDcEXj1mo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-K9KUqqlI4eW0AXgwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20pleasures%20of%20private%20life%20ought%20to%20be%20augmented%20to%20an%20infinite%20degree%20by%20recurrent%20exposure%20to%20danger&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">The pleasures of private life ought to be augmented to an infinite degree by recurrent exposure to danger</a>.\" But was it true that love could&nbsp;easily be turned into a form of sport or frivolous distraction? Surely love was no closer to sport than sex was to exercise?</p><p>As well as provoking these essential questions, Paris, for our couple, represents continuity, and an ideal of civilisation. It means a certain quality of living when it comes to clothes, sex, transgression, tolerance, conversation, bohemianism. This pair likes to eat well; it is in French restaurants that they find sensuous enjoyment together, perhaps the one place now where there is real collaboration and exchange between them.</p><p>In the London suburbs of the 50s and 60s, where, after the turbulence of war, I grew up in relative safety, all, apparently, was set for ever. Conventional marriage was the paradigm. My father, an exile from colonial India's religious strife and partition, was a commuter, and my mother was happy to call herself a housewife. The relation between work, marriage and play was perfectly arranged. Nothing was missing. All you had to do was fit in. That, at least, was the idea.</p><p>As Nick and Meg are aware, marriage frees a certain sort of companionable love, if you're lucky. But it domesticates sex. The couple are over-intimate. They know too much about one another. Without obstacles, there can be no fascination. How can you desire what you already have? That's not all: the arrangements that marriage requires to survive – security, duration, reliability, repetition – can seem liberating in their continuity, or stifling, according to your nature. The suburbs suited my father, since he'd come from a more dangerous place, and wanted contentment.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419077535'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/2/1380731043271/Hanif-Kureishi-010.jpg' alt='Hanif Kureishi' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'The film shows how the past can seem as unstable as the future' … Hanif Kureishi.  Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>But there was something about living there that could make you want to scream. For some, it would never be sufficient. You might learn, as Nick does in Paris with his wife – whom he still wants and needs – that the problem with desire is not that you cannot get rid of it, but that there is too&nbsp;much of it. It is ever-present, and ever-pressing, however much you want to discount it. You cannot wish it&nbsp;away, and it cannot be replaced by a&nbsp;substitute.</p><p>Either cannily or madly, the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/18/john-cheever-blake-bailey\" title=\"\">John Cheever</a> took up residence at the heart of the American Dream in a New York suburb,  a place more affluent than the one I came from. He was a homosexual alcoholic artist attempting to be a straight, married man. The mask and myth required to enact the gestures of servitude and constraint needed to live this kind of life, were disabling and humiliating. Cheever gave it a long try, and it enabled him to become an artist. But it never worked out; it was never going to. Chaos returned, as any fool could have predicted that it would, even Cheever himself in certain moods. Perhaps there is only so much about yourself you can bear to understand.</p><p>Many such preoccupations turn up in postwar American writing. And the question is always the same: was the repression worth it? Had too much that was essential been sacrificed for the ideal? How much of yourself could you give up and remain \"authentic\"? Couldn't there be less painful or difficult, more satisfying ways to live, more in line with \"human nature\", as the Romantics might have put it?</p><p>An interesting version of someone wondering about this was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/jul/24/william-reich-sex-pol-video-radical-thinkers\" title=\"\">Wilhelm Reich</a>, recently the subject of the  study <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron\" title=\"\"><em>Adventures in the Orgasmatron: Wilhelm Reich and the Invention of Sex</em> by Christopher Turner</a>. A psychoanalyst trained by Freud in Vienna, and living in the US in the fifties, Reich, like other \"liberationists\" of the times, such as Norman O Brown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\" title=\"\">Herbert Marcuse</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/rd-laing\" title=\"\">RD Laing</a>, was thinking about the ways in which desire could free people from oppressive and frustrating ways of living. According to Reich, the wrong life could make your body rigid, inflexible and awkward. He says, in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/adventures-in-the-orgasmatron-by-christopher-turner-book-review.html?_r=0\" title=\"\"><em>The Function of the Orgasm</em></a>, \"that the average human being of today has lost contact with his real nature\", and he writes of \"the incrustations and rigidities in human emotional life\".</p><p>Reich considered Freud conventional and pessimistic, and thought he didn't go far enough when it came to acknowledging the central place of sexuality in human life. For Freud, renunciation made some happiness possible, whereas Reich wanted to know why there had to be renunciation at all. Weren't human beings attacking that which in themselves was most alive, their capacity for love? Weren't fascist, authoritarian structures also inside the individual? Of course they were, argued Freud. But people loved their illness; they wanted to be unhappy; pleasure was the last thing they desired. A \"complete Eros\", or ultimate cure was impossible.</p><p>It wasn't long before Reich gave up on the idea of the \"talking cure\". Speaking took too long; it was indirect and inconclusive. He began to touch his patients, believing that more and stronger orgasms were the solution. A&nbsp;full blast of pleasure, of orgiastic potency, would enable you to see you'd been living badly, or not, according to your nature. This salvationist view, from our less credulous and more cynical time, might seem like the least of it. But Reich was on to something here. If pleasure isn't your guide, what will be? Reich had some grasp of the creativity of sexual desire, and the cost&nbsp;of constraining it. And numerous people have been awoken from relative slumber by the unexpectedness of love or sex, and by the sense of opening out to more life and possibility.</p><p>I can recall a student of mine, a&nbsp;woman in her mid-40s, telling me a&nbsp;long, moving story about being \"awakened\" emotionally, sexually and&nbsp;intellectually, when she fell in love with a friend of her husband. Their love caused a huge trauma for both families, but it was worth it, she said. There would have been more suffering all round – wasted energy, unused love, unemployed passion – had she remained in the status quo.</p><p>The revolutionaries of the 60s called for new ways of being and alternative forms of social interaction. What the adulterer usually wants, however, is better relationships, conversation, support, attention, pleasure. Her question is: how can we get what we want while behaving well, which means, at least, not being ashamed of ourselves?</p><p>The unhappy are no good to anyone. The unhappy are dangerous. The discontented and jaded become perverse or sadistic. Adulterers are not necessarily utopians: adultery merely shows the possibility of meaning, hope and love. My student didn't wish for anything like \"total liberation\" – a revolution, a new social set-up – just for a satisfying marriage. And it is worth noting about the classic heroines of literature, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/16/news.features11\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/21/translating-madame-bovary-adam-thorpe\" title=\"\">Madame Bovary</a>, or even the characters in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/brief-encounter-romance\" title=\"\">David Lean's <em>Brief Encounter</em></a>, that they are not compulsive transgressors. They are asking for very little, and for everything, which, for them, is a fuller, more satisfying love. Complete happiness is a fiction, but some happiness is possible; indeed, it is essential. There are some people you can \"realise\" yourself in relation to, and they are worth searching out. But there is a price. Something radical does have to change to make this possible – certainly, for women, in terms of the whole society – and there will be inescapable guilt.</p><p>Compared with Freud, Reich and his coevals prove to be the more limited, if not conservative, concentrating on too small a notion of human need and fulfilment. Freud had a novelist's capaciousness; Reich was a headline writer. If constraint of some sort is impossible to avoid, the question is: which constraint, when, where?</p><p>Nick and Meg go to Paris because love is the most considerable business of all, and they need to know&nbsp;what sort of relationships make life worth living, and, if they have a future together, what it might be like. Do they suffer less together than they would apart? The decision they make at the end of the film can only be provisional, and the questions they ask&nbsp;have to be confronted repeatedly, since there isn't one answer that can satisfy them.</p><p>• The screenplay of <em>Le Week-End</em> will be available as an e-book from Faber (£9.99). The film opens on Friday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418746165|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6a12fd18140cecc0715de7fe09045072aa6e38dc -->",

        "headline":"Herodotus: the first non-fiction",
        "body":"<p>Herodotus is the most entertaining of historians. Indeed, he is as entertaining as anyone who has ever written, historian or not. His great work is many things – the first&nbsp;example of non-fiction, the text that underlies the entire discipline of history, the most important source of information we have for a vital episode in human affairs – but it is above all a&nbsp;treasure trove. This, coming from a&nbsp;translator of <em>The Histories</em>, may sound like special pleading – but it is&nbsp;not. To spend as much time with Herodotus as I have done over these past years has been a&nbsp;rare privilege, a&nbsp;labour of love. The Father of History he may be, but he is also much more than that.</p><p>The ostensible goal of <em>The Histories</em> is to explain what would now be termed \"the clash of civilisations\": the inability of the peoples of east and west to live together in peace. Herodotus was writing within living memory of an event so epic that it continues to thrill and astonish to this day: the repulse in 480BC of a full-scale invasion of Greece, led by the King of Persia, Xerxes. Since the Persian empire was at the time the greatest power on the planet, its defeat struck the Greeks as a barely believable triumph: it was the most astounding victory of all time. Herodotus agreed with this judgment, and his account of the battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis makes for a narrative as thrilling as one could hope to read. Nevertheless, what is most striking about his history is not any tone of triumphalism, but how lacking it is in chauvinism. Not for nothing was he condemned in antiquity as a <em>philobarbaros</em> – a \"lover of barbarians\".</p><p>The same imperialists who had conquered Herodotus's own native city of Halicarnassus, and brought bloodshed and fire to mainland Greece, are&nbsp;shown in his narrative to possess qualities of nobility and courage. Herodotus notes the premium they set on telling the truth; he admires their hardiness and freely acknowledges that, man for man, they are in no way inferior as warriors to the Greeks. Even&nbsp;his portrait of Xerxes, who has come to serve us (in large part thanks to Herodotus himself) as the archetype of the overweening despot, is touched by moments of glory and pathos. Amid all the millions he led against Greece, Herodotus tells us, there was no one more handsome nor \"better fitted to wield supreme power than Xerxes himself\". As he watches his army crossing from&nbsp;Asia into Europe, the king feels himself truly blessed – and then begins to weep. When his uncle asks him the reason for his tears, Xerxes answers that he has been \"musing on how short is human life, and the pity of it pierced me through. All these multitudes here, and yet, in a hundred years' time, not&nbsp;one of them will be alive.\"</p><p>That the sentiment expressed by Xerxes owes more to the spirit of tragedy than to anything recognisably Persian in no way diminishes the significance of Herodotus's attempts to&nbsp;see events through eyes other than his own. The truth is that he was both intensely a man of his background, and inexhaustibly curious about the world that lay beyond it. What we get in <em>The&nbsp;Histories</em> – as its literal meaning, \"inquiries\", suggests – is a heroic attempt to push back the frontiers of knowledge on almost every conceivable front. This project, of subjecting the world to <em>historie</em> – \"inquiry\" – was one bred of the age. Herodotus lived in an intellectual environment that was heady with a sense of discovery, of an infinitude of wonders waiting to be identified and explained without recourse to the supernatural. Only the Enlightenment, perhaps, can compare. Herodotus wrote <em>The Histories</em> in the conviction that they far surpassed anything similar.</p><p>And he was right. In part, this&nbsp;was due to the fact that Herodotus was&nbsp;the first to apply to the study of&nbsp;the past the revolutionary new methods of inquiry that were simultaneously transforming how Greek intellectuals understood the natural world: the beginnings of what we now call \"science\". The premium that Herodotus set on providing sources for his material is now so often taken for granted by historians that it is easy to overlook just how revolutionary it once&nbsp;was. In his account of the buildup to the battle of&nbsp;Plataea, he describes what he has been told by a man called Thersander of Orchomenus, who in turn&nbsp;is reporting what he was told at a&nbsp;banquet by a Persian fellow guest. Men&nbsp;dead for 2,500 years are being given voice. We are witness to the birth pangs of historical&nbsp;method. History is twice‑over being made.</p><p>Not everything that Herodotus reports, though, can be so readily sourced. If his concern with the means of gathering evidence is something revolutionary, then so too are the scope&nbsp;and range of his interests. No one&nbsp;before him had ever thought to write on&nbsp;such a heroically panoramic scale. Herodotus understood, to a degree that seems exceptional for his time, that he was living in a&nbsp;globalised era. So vast was the empire of the Persians that its king could dream of leaving no lands beyond its frontiers \"for the sun to shine&nbsp;upon\". It&nbsp;was the world itself, in Herodotus's opinion, that had been at stake in the great war between the Greeks and the Persians. This was the reason why his inquiry, his <em>historie</em>, was of such universal scope. His ambition was an astonishing one: to&nbsp;encompass the limits of what could humanly be known. Inevitably, this meant that there were occasions when his ability to determine the veracity of&nbsp;information he had come by began to warp and buckle. No one was more&nbsp;aware of this than Herodotus himself.&nbsp;Often, when reporting some wondrous&nbsp;detail, he will surround it with qualifications – expressions of uncertainty or open doubt. Reporting the claim of a Phoenician expedition to&nbsp;have circumnavigated Africa (or&nbsp;\"Libya\", as he calls it), Herodotus does&nbsp;not conceal his own scepticism. \"One of&nbsp;their claims – which I personally find incredible, although others may not – was that, while sailing round Libya,&nbsp;they had had the sun on&nbsp;their right‑hand side.\"</p><p>This is precisely the detail that enables us to know that&nbsp;the Phoenicians were indeed telling the truth and had crossed the equator. That we have no reports of another naval expedition reaching the Cape of Good Hope, until&nbsp;the arrival there in 1488 of the Portuguese, serves to remind us of how Herodotus would operate at the extremes of knowledge. Unsurprisingly, not all the information he obtained was reliable. What are we to make, for instance, of his report of giant Indian ants, \"midway between dogs and foxes in size\", who dig up gold; or the griffins \"who stand guard over gold\" in the mountains beyond Scythia? These are the kind of stories that, while they add hugely to the enjoyment of reading <em>The&nbsp;Histories</em>, have resulted in a long tradition of dismissing Herodotus as gullible at best, and at worst a liar. But it's not surprising that he got&nbsp;his facts about India or the wilds beyond Scythia wrong; what's astonishing is that he had any reports about them at all. Only in the new era of Persian imperialism, which for the first time had brought Herodotus's city of Halicarnassus and lands fabulously far to the east under the same rule, would he ever have thought to write about these places. As&nbsp;it happens, a plausible case has been made for both stories being the result of Chinese whispers – in one case, perhaps, literally so. The giant ants, it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;argued, were in fact a&nbsp;breed of Himalayan marmots, which have been known to expose gold-bearing soil when they dig their holes;&nbsp;the griffins, perhaps, were the weathered skeletons of Protoceratops, a dinosaur whose fossils are to be found scattered everywhere in the Gobi desert. Or perhaps not. It is as well to admit, as Herodotus himself did&nbsp;on occasion, that&nbsp;we cannot be sure. Sometimes we simply have to&nbsp;acknowledge the limits of our knowledge. <em>The Histories</em> serve us&nbsp;as the well-spring of historical wisdom as&nbsp;well as of historical method.</p><p>Today, when the immensity of the world's learning is available to anyone with an internet connection, it can be harder than ever to think ourselves back into Herodotus's shoes, and a time when the concept of non-fiction writing was&nbsp;still being developed. Yet that is precisely why, now more than ever, it can be so moving to read him. The process of researching and recording facts on a would-be encyclopaedic scale begins with his history. If you have ever used the internet to check up on a fact, then you&nbsp;stand in a line of descent from him. \"But if I may digress here,\" Herodotus says at one point, \"as I have sought opportunities to do from the moment I&nbsp;started this account of my inquiries …\" This mode of presenting information, which 30 years ago appeared closer in style to <em>Tristram Shandy</em> than to any conventional work&nbsp;of history, will strike most readers as being very familiar. The internet, with its seemingly infinite web of hyperlinks, has provided a whole new metaphor for Herodotus's discursive style of relaying information. When he refers to the capture of Nineveh by the Medes as \"an episode I will recount in a later chapter\", and then never does so, the frustration for the reader is akin to&nbsp;that of clicking on a broken link. Similarly, the experience of never quite knowing where Herodotus's narrative may lead – to a laugh-out-loud story of&nbsp;a drunk man dancing on a table, perhaps, or to&nbsp;the chilling account of&nbsp;a&nbsp;eunuch's revenge on the man who had him castrated as a child – will be familiar to&nbsp;all who have surfed the&nbsp;web. One definition of a classic, wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/18/sir-frank-kermode-obituary\" title=\"\">Frank Kermode</a>, is that it \"subsists in change, by being patient of&nbsp;interpretation\" – and, we might add, patient of translation, too. That alone, I&nbsp;hope, is sufficient justification for my version of <em>The Histories</em>. Herodotus, that most ancient of historians, has always had the capacity to renew himself, and to seem fresh to succeeding generations.</p><p>I like to think this would not have surprised him. He knew the scale of what he had embarked on, and the value of what he had achieved. His ambition, as he declared in the opening sentence of the first work of&nbsp;history ever written, was to ensure that \"human achievement may be spared the ravages of time\". Literally, he spoke&nbsp;of not allowing them to become <em>exitela</em>, a word that could be used in a&nbsp;technical sense to signify the fading of paint from inscriptions or works of&nbsp;art. Today, the colours applied by Herodotus to his portrait of the long-gone world in which he lived remain as exuberant as ever. The ravages of time have indeed been defied.</p><p><em>• Herodotus: The Histories</em>, a new translation by Tom Holland with an introduction by Paul Cartledge, was published last week by Penguin Classics.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418753502|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|af97cc3f23acdd900bc9e319932e12c8df8af9b1 -->",

        "headline":"Poster poems: anything goes for National Poetry Day",
        "body":"<p>Today is <a href=\"http://www.forwardartsfoundation.org/national-poetry-day/\">National Poetry Day</a>, a day on which people <a href=\"http://poetryireland.ie/poetryday/\">across Britain and Ireland</a> are invited to celebrate the art and fun of verse. At the heart of National Poetry Day is the belief that poetry can and should be for everyone, everywhere. As our contribution to this aspiration, this month's Poster Poems challenge is not tied to the usual idea of a single theme, topic, form or style. This time you are invited to post whatever kind of poem you want, and as many of them as you like. </p><p>You might well ask why would anyone want to write a poem in the first place? Well, poems allow us to express ourselves in ways that would never ordinarily occur to us and to say things that we can't say as well in prose. As <a href=\"http://www.handpickedpoems.com/tag/from-the-figure-a-poem-makes-frost/\">Robert Frost once wrote,</a> the initial delight in writing a poem is \"remembering something I didn't know I knew\". What Frost meant was, I think, that you may start out with an idea for a poem, something you want to say, but the act of writing it down, of playing with the rhythm, the wording and the sound can lead you to discover things about yourself and your world that you didn't really know where there before the poem was written.</p><p>People are moved to write poems for any number of different reasons: you might have seen something that strikes you as particularly beautiful, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/12/poster-poems-love-valentine\">be in love with someone</a>, or be really <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/10/poster-poems-poverty\">angry about a social injustice</a>. Perhaps you want to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/17/poster-poems-childhood\">share a memory</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/dec/12/poster-poems-billy-mills-limericks\">make people laugh with a Limerick</a>. Perhaps, <a href=\"http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/03/10/dylan-thomass-love-affair-with-words.htm\">like Dylan Thomas,</a> you have \"fallen in love with words\". There are as many reasons to write a poem as there are people writing them, and every one of them is valid. </p><p>The American writer Robert Creeley once wrote an essay called \"Is that a real poem, or did you just make it up\", a title that came from a question that was asked once after a reading. It's a funny question, but one that reflects the all-too-common view that poems are written by odd, distant, vaguely glamorous and frequently dead people, \"real poets\". The reality is, however, somewhat more prosaic. </p><p>Most poets are ordinary people living normal lives who happen to have \"fallen in love with words\" and who have, as a result, this uncomfortable itch that can only be scratched by writing poems. They have something they want to say and poetry provides them with a wide range of possible ways of saying it. Some use rhyme and traditional forms like the sonnet or ballad. Others may prefer to write in free verse or even more experimental forms. Some may even use a mixture of both. The poems they write can be as long as a book or no longer than three lines and they are often about the most ordinary events depicted in the most everyday language imaginable. It doesn't really matter what style you use once it allows you to write the poem you want to write and say the thing you want to say.</p><p>And so, this National Poetry Day, why not have a go yourself? Poster Poems has always welcomed poems from everyone, and nobody here is going to pass judgment on what you write. The whole idea is to enter into the spirit of the day, enjoy the process, and maybe learn something along the way, and that last bit is optional. Let's celebrate poetry in the best possible way, by writing and sharing poems.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418875316|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|170f3e0271af051847451ad0c08c99adc9e3c1cd -->",

        "headline":"The Beatles – All These Years: Volume One: Tune in by Mark Lewisohn – review",
        "body":"<p>\"I declare that the Beatles are mutants,\" the LSD evangelist Timothy Leary once said: \"prototypes of evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with a mysterious power to create a new human species, a young race of laughing freemen.\" In the frazzled mind of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/21/manson-life-times-guinn-review\" title=\"\">Charles Manson</a>, the&nbsp;Beatles were equally supernatural, but sent to Earth with rather darker intentions: they were seeding their songs with messages of apocalypse.</p><p>Where did these four incredibly talented people actually come from, and how did they find each other? There are so many of us, forever fascinated by the story, who still cannot quite fathom how the band managed to make music so endlessly full of interest, while also embodying the idea that as the world was changing at an unprecedented rate, they were always ahead of everyone else.</p><p>The Beatles themselves, in order to stay halfway sane, always denied that anything out-of-the-ordinary had gone on. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\" title=\"\">Paul McCartney</a> still talks of them as \"a good little band\". When they went their separate ways at the end of the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon\" title=\"\">John Lennon</a> had stern words for anyone who thought their demise was tragic, or even significant. \"People talk about it as if it was the end of the world,\" he said. \"It's just a rock group that split up. It's nothing important.\"</p><p>But it was, and still is – so much so that they are now surely the most analysed musicians in history. The books written about the Beatles cover every aspect of their story – and they keep coming, from unwieldy works of&nbsp;culture studies, to the drab memoirs of fans, aides and hangers-on. The story as told by the group themselves is collected in a misnamed, door-stopping oral history called <em>Anthology</em>; in terms of prose style, the best all-purpose biography has long been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philip-norman\" title=\"\">Philip&nbsp;Norman</a>'s <em>Shout!</em>, first published in 1981. In an age as nostalgia-soaked as&nbsp;ours, and in the case of a group so dissected and deconstructed, the one really pertinent question remains: is there anything left to add?</p><p>Mark Lewisohn's new book <em>Tune in</em> is the best part of 1000 pages long. The product of at least eight years' writing and research, and full of information sourced even before that, it runs from the band members' family prehistories to the release of their first proper single in 1962. Two further volumes will appear, all under the umbrella title \"All&nbsp;These Years\". Should you have £120 to spare, each book will also be published in an extended special edition which includes \"hundreds of thousands of words of extra material, as well as many extra photographs\". This is the story told in Proustian detail: we will presumably at last know what Lennon actually shouts at the start of \"It's All Too Much\", the history of a company owned by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ringo-starr\" title=\"\">Ringo Starr</a> called Bricky Builders and the full life-story of McCartney's sheepdog Martha. I have been a Beatles obsessive since the age of seven, but even for people like me, this all sounds as if it might be&nbsp;a little unnecessary.</p><p>The first edited-down volume, though, is largely a delight, and the story is told so definitively that, after this, that really should be it. Secondary sources are comprehensively mined; letters, public records and business documents have been found in places no one else ever thought to look; friends, associates and acquaintances have been interviewed over what seems to be a quarter-century. All that is lacking is substantial new testimony from the Beatles themselves, a point to which there are two responses: first, that the two most candid and iconoclastic Beatles have been dead for&nbsp;a number of years; and second, that the last people you should ask about the detailed history of the Beatles are the Beatles themselves.</p><p>McCartney, for example, remains of&nbsp;the immovable opinion that they refused to entertain the idea of visiting&nbsp;the US until they had a number one record on the Billboard charts: a&nbsp;nice story, but he should try booking Carnegie Hall at 10 days' notice. His own accounts of his life have long been&nbsp;blurred and rose-tinted: a good biographer, by contrast, has to avoid the pull of legend, and be prepared to coldly debunk as much as they lionise and celebrate. But it is a token of how astonishing the story of the Beatles remains that even a telling as particular as this one dispels none of the magic.</p><p>Any account of the band members' lives before fame and success will be as&nbsp;much social history as musical biography. The roots of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison are tangled up&nbsp;with migration to Liverpool from Ireland. All four Beatles were war babies, and blessed by two strokes of&nbsp;luck: their fathers were either in reserved occupations or, in the case of&nbsp;Jim McCartney, excused the call-up owing to impaired hearing. And they escaped the dreaded national service, which was phased out from 1957. All, apart from Starr, were grammar school boys, educated in institutions holding fast to tradition, but from 1956 on, at least some of that tradition was undermined by a seditious noise pressed into black vinyl.</p><p>The excitement of early rock'n'roll records – not least in a city still smattered with bombsites – can only begin to be imagined. When Lennon heard <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/elvispresley\" title=\"\">Elvis Presley</a>'s \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"it just broke me up. I mean, that was the end. My whole life changed from then on, I was just completely shaken by it.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/little-richard\" title=\"\">Little Richard</a>'s \"Long Tall&nbsp;Sally\", he said, was \"so great I&nbsp;couldn't speak\". McCartney's first record was Gene Vincent's \"Be Bop A-Lula\", all nonsense-words and space‑age echo. \"The whole song is purple in my mind because of the purple Capitol label,\" he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Their world was quickly moving out&nbsp;of monochrome: mere records were enough to revolutionise their lives. Mid-50s Britain was hit by two pop-cultural waves: the boom in skiffle, which drew on country, blues and folk music, and emphasised home-made instruments and enthusiasm rather than technique; and rock'n'roll, which was much more transcendent. Aged 16 when he formed the Quarrymen – or Quarry Men: he and his fellow band members never seemed sure – in late 1956, Lennon started using skiffle's modus operandi to deliver an approximation of rock, and he was off. McCartney joined him six months later, after their famous meeting at a church fete, and Harrison was recruited in early 1958 – he was just short of his 15th birthday. \"It took me years to come round to him, to start considering him as an equal,\" Lennon later admitted, but the chemistry was obviously right: after a spell in 1960 as&nbsp;the Silver Beatles (regularly spelled \"Beetles\"), by the summer of that year, they were the Beatles, for keeps.</p><p>Ordinary tragedies are magnified into unrivalled dramas by the knowledge of how they feed into the Beatles' myth – most notably in the case of John Lennon's mother, Julia. She was an untamed spirit whose maternal role in his life was soon taken by her sister Mimi; Julia's relationship with her son was rekindled in his adolescence, and given extra spark by a&nbsp;sense of oedipal attraction. She was, Lewisohn says, \"very much the girl of John's dreams … the kicker of convention and bucker of trends … an&nbsp;older version of himself … irreverent, iconoclastic, uninhibited, witty, with a&nbsp;huge personality\". By the time Lennon&nbsp;was five, Julia's partner was a waiter called John Dykins, an alcoholic. For the first time, a Beatles book goes deep into her death in the summer of 1958: a year-long driving ban for Dykins that led her to walk to a&nbsp;bus-stop near Mimi's house, where she was&nbsp;run over by an off-duty policeman.&nbsp;\"To&nbsp;my mind, she'd been killed instantly,\" said Lennon associate Nigel Walley. \"I can still see her gingery hair fluttering in the breeze, blowing across her face.\"</p><p>Nine years later, Lennon wrote the beautiful song \"Julia\": \"Her hair of floating sky is shimmering/Glimmering, in the sun.\" As Lewisohn says, he had always been silent about her death, but when he finally voiced his feelings via music, it was obvious that, for his entire adult life, the bereavement had been at the core of&nbsp;who he was.</p><p>There are other tragedies, more than&nbsp;would perhaps usually afflict four young lives. The death of McCartney's mother, Mary – from breast cancer, when he was 14 – doesn't get nearly the&nbsp;same level of attention here as Julia Lennon's, which is surprising given its likely profound effect on him, hinted at but not explored. He remains someone with a carefully cultivated exterior, who tends to talk about his personal history in soundbites, and rarely gives the sense of someone who is troubled. But \"Paul was far more affected by Mum's death than any of us imagined,\" said his younger brother, Mike. \"His very character seemed to change, and for a while he seemed like a hermit.\" McCartney said he quickly \"learned to&nbsp;put a shell around me\", which is telling. \"Paul was so 'nice' you couldn't get close. He was like a diplomat,\" one of their early associates tells Lewisohn.</p><p>The sadnesses go on. The talented painter Stuart Sutcliffe, who became the band's less-than-brilliant bass player, died of a brain haemorrhage at&nbsp;21, leaving McCartney feeling guilty about his habitual digs at Sutcliffe's musical abilities (in the wake of his death, Lewisohn reveals, Lennon and Harrison made a point of visiting his photographer fiancee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/the-beatles-look\" title=\"\">Astrid Kirchherr</a>; McCartney stayed away). By&nbsp;this point, one gets the sense that losing people close to him had become for Lennon a kind of inexplicable curse (his Uncle George, Mimi's husband and&nbsp;his de facto father, had also died). Richy Starkey, later Ringo Starr, faced his own challenges – a 10-week coma&nbsp;and a year in hospital after he contracted peritonitis (when he was six); and, just to test him, a further long spell in hospital after pleurisy turned into tuberculosis, when he first&nbsp;resolved to play the drums. The idea of talent flowering as if to avenge past suffering is a cliche, but here feels&nbsp;undeniable.</p><p>As the story goes on, there are further revelations, both minor and major. Starr's later problems with drink are implicitly traced to his family: \"My&nbsp;parents were alcoholics and I didn't realise it,\" he says. George Harrison's lifelong distrust of anyone prying into his business might have originated in the behaviour of his maternal grandparents, who had seven children but were secretly unmarried.</p><p>During an early phase of their band's progress, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were billed as \"Japage 3\" – a reference to their first names, and pronounced \"Jay-page\". When they first played in Hamburg, Lennon, Harrison and Sutcliffe slept in one squalid backroom, while McCartney was billeted with their drummer, Pete Best, and thereby relegated to the bottom of the hierarchy. A letter home written by Sutcliffe acknowledged this with brutal simplicity: \"Paul has turned out the real black sheep of the trip. Everyone hates him and I only feel&nbsp;sorry for him.\" Two years later, they were signed by George Martin's Parlophone label, not because – as previous accounts have suggested – he&nbsp;fell hopelessly in love with their irreverent northern wit, but thanks to a&nbsp;convoluted set of agreements that climaxed with Martin being handed them merely as a sort of punishment for having an affair with his secretary (soon to be his second wife). There is a&nbsp;great deal of such happenstance.</p><p>Best, the drummer sacked just as the Beatles began to break big, was always at one remove from the rest of&nbsp;them. He apparently shared little of&nbsp;their humour, was kept away from some of their closest friends – and, just to seal his fate, the other three combed their hair forward, while he stubbornly retained his Tony Curtis quiff. During 1961, Lewisohn says, he had settled \"into a role he hardly ever varied … night after night – playing with his head down, avoiding eye contact, not&nbsp;smiling, projecting the study in moody shyness he knew would win girls' hearts. Fine, but it was bound to&nbsp;wear thin for the other Beatles. Sometimes they wanted to see a spark&nbsp;when they turned around, some&nbsp;vibrancy, emotion, an engagement of eyes or mind.\"</p><p>By far the most compelling sections of the book detail the time the Beatles spent in Hamburg between 1960 and 1962 – Starr was there, too, as the drummer with a Liverpool troupe called Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Tales of shared intimacy (as Harrison lost his virginity in a backstage bunk, they all applauded), petty crime, and drinking and drugging are explored, and either confirmed, or debunked: contrary to legend, Lennon never peed on a party of churchgoing nuns. The picture section includes an image of them gurning as they hold up silver tubes of Preludin, the German diet drug that allowed them to play punishingly long sets at the Indra, Kaiserkeller, Top Ten and other clubs, and which the ever-marginal Best always refused to touch. After their second trip to Hamburg, Lewisohn says, they were \"bursting with the experience that only another 503 extraordinary hours on the Hamburg stage could have given them\"; in a footnote, he calculates that the total time spent onstage on their first two German visits was 918 hours: \"the equivalent of 612 90-minute shows… in&nbsp;just 27 weeks.\" As he points out, this probably made them the most seasoned rock'n'roll group in the world, even before most people had heard of them.</p><p>Lewisohn is a Beatles oracle: he is&nbsp;the author of such exhaustive reference books as <em>The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</em> and <em>The Complete Beatles Chronicle</em>, as well as reams of sleeve notes. He had a cameo in <em>Shout!</em>, not only as the self-styled Beatle Brain of Britain, but as a seven-year-old in his native Middlesex, so taken with <em>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> that he \"stood in the garden as it played, shaking his head wildly while trying not to dislodge the cardboard moustache lodged under his&nbsp;nose\". Some of his prose betrays a&nbsp;slightly Pooterish sensibility: two non-white characters in the story are described as \"swarthy\" and \"dusky-skinned\"; and their manager and mentor Brian Epstein, whose closeted life provides the story with another fascinating strand of social history, is constantly described as \"homosexual\". Here and elsewhere, perhaps you miss the flights of critical fancy of a pop-cultural theorist such as Greil Marcus, the sturm und drang of Elvis's definitive biographer Peter Guralnick, or the grasp of rock music's romance possessed by the Rolling Stones's greatest biographer, Stanley Booth. Yet&nbsp;it takes a certain kind of person to&nbsp;write a history as thorough as this – and <em>Tune in</em> is only the start.</p><p>It ends as Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and, at last, Starr play their final club performances in Hamburg, recorded by another Liverpudlian musician and eventually put out as a double album – before the Beatles' legal representatives thrust it into the realm of bootleggers. It is a shame this music has never been given an official release: despite its low-fi quality, it showcases exactly what you'd hope to hear: four people evidently delighted to have found each other, playing supercharged versions of Chan Romero's \"Hippy Hippy Shake\", Chuck Berry's \"I'm Talkin' About You\" and \"Twist and Shout\", as the nightly German bacchanal swirls around them. On occasion, the recordings sound like an early variety of punk rock – vivid, muscular music, made by a quartet who are simply on fire: four laughing freemen, as Leary would have it, on their way to something incredible.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418765145|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|bc801f6135c50fff114eade4c21f5985298b354e -->",

        "headline":"In It Together: The Inside Story of the Coalition Government by Matthew D'Ancona – review",
        "body":"<p>How do you tell a story, without yet knowing where it ends?</p><p>That's the challenge facing Matthew d'Ancona in this book, which represents the first really serious attempt at hitting the biggest moving target in contemporary politics. Like an&nbsp;impatient scientist trying to second‑guess an experiment before the&nbsp;test-tube has stopped fizzing, the&nbsp;author can inevitably draw only limited conclusions about a coalition that still has nearly two years to run. He can describe what he has seen in lurid, expletive-ridden detail, but can't&nbsp;yet be sure whether it changes the laws of electoral physics. Has this bold constitutional experiment actually worked? Does it have a future, after 2015? Has it changed the British political landscape and voters' expectations of government for good? You won't find definitive answers to such questions here.</p><p>But then in fairness, perhaps D'Ancona never really set out to provide them. The conscious model for this book is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewrawnsley\" title=\"\">Andrew Rawnsley</a>'s rollicking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/30/politics\" title=\"\"><em>Servants of the People</em></a>, which relentlessly exposed the below-stairs shenanigans of the early Blair-Brown years, and if his aim was to serve up some similarly juicy gossip D'Ancona has succeeded. By comparison with the tortured psychological dramas of New Labour, the coalition inevitably seems almost Zen-like. But there's still some dirty linen to air, even if the best titbits – that the chancellor thinks welfare secretary Iain Duncan Smith is&nbsp;thick, that Boris Johnson vowed to quit politics after his second term as London mayor to \"go and earn some money\" – have already tumbled out in published extracts. And who knew Angela Merkel liked nothing better than watching old episodes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/17/tv-matters-midsomer-murders\" title=\"\"><em>Midsomer Murders</em></a>, so much so that Downing Street once tried (and failed) to engineer an unlikely meeting with actor John Nettles?</p><p>Yet what made the Rawnsley book indispensable is that all the muckraking illustrated a bigger truth; the relationship between Labour's prime minister and chancellor was so hideously dysfunctional that, with hindsight, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a miracle that the government ever&nbsp;got out of bed in the&nbsp;morning. If&nbsp;the anecdotes in this book add up to&nbsp;anything bigger, it is less the inside story of the coalition – the Lib&nbsp;Dems appear mainly as bit players bumbling through someone else's drama – than a&nbsp;snapshot of one turbulent moment in&nbsp;Conservative history. And the dominant figure isn't David Cameron but George Osborne, portrayed here as the political and economic heart of this administration.</p><p>On paper, there are few journalists better placed to make such judgment calls. D'Ancona is one of the shrewdest, most engaging observers of the Cameron phenomenon, yet, unusually among rightwing columnists, he takes the other parties seriously too. He is&nbsp;an&nbsp;insider's insider, having known Michael Gove since Oxford and most of&nbsp;the set around Cameron since their 20s. But then, as he points out, this government is intensely social: they're friends who fell into politics together, rather than politicians whose friendships were forged through the party.</p><p>The book certainly gets the cliquey, breezy, carefree Cameron vibe that so infuriates MPs outside the inner circle; the sense that they are just a gang of mates on a marvellously exciting adventure from which they could walk&nbsp;away if necessary: after all, their friendships will likely endure, even if&nbsp;the <em>grand projet</em> doesn't. As D'Ancona says of Osborne's decision to swan off to Washington with the prime minister days before what would become the \"omnishambles\" budget, the chancellor might be a Roundhead on policy but \"he was a Cavalier by temperament, determined to experience everything that politics had to offer … the choice between going to America to hang out&nbsp;with Obama or lingering in London to monitor Twitter and the blogs in case of budget leaks was no choice at all.\" What larks! Yet one wonders if Tory MPs in marginal seats, still smarting from the damage done by pasty taxes, would agree with D'Ancona's generous verdict that the budget trainwreck probably wouldn't have been avoided even if Osborne had stayed at the helm. And therein lies an awkward problem.</p><p>The book skips oddly lightly over episodes that were not Osborne's finest hour. If the chancellor harbours any regrets – or his colleagues had any recriminations – about that shambolic budget, or his failure to reduce the deficit on target, they are barely examined here. Similarly, when the crowd at the Olympic stadium boos Osborne, it is presented not as a&nbsp;humiliation but a testament to his steeliness, in comparison with the shamelessly cheap, populist Boris. (D'Ancona's fascinating analysis of the rivalry between mayor and chancellor, more bitter and yet less examined than Boris's relationship with the prime minister, reads like an essential primer for the next Tory leadership contest.)</p><p>By comparison with such insights, the Lib Dem side of the story feels almost two-dimensional. \"Needy Nick\", as the Lib Dem leader is dubbed early on by exasperated Tory colleagues, emerges as a faintly petulant figure, and business secretary Vince Cable as an irritant to pretty much everyone. We get little sense of who Danny Alexander is beyond his closeness to&nbsp;his boss, the chancellor. The spectacular downfall of Chris Huhne is&nbsp;shoehorned a little awkwardly into a&nbsp;chapter on gay marriage. And while the subsequent by-election in his seat was a turning point for Clegg – the moment at which his MPs began to believe the next election needn't inevitably wipe them out – in this book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/01/eastleigh-byelection-results-2013\" title=\"\">Eastleigh</a> becomes mainly a cautionary tale about the rise of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\" title=\"\">Ukip</a>.</p><p>What is perhaps more surprising, however, is that Cameron also emerges as a rather lonely and elusive figure, defined largely in the space between his great friend Osborne and his great rival Boris. He clings for so long to his damaged press secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-coulson\" title=\"\">Andy Coulson</a> at least partly because, D'Ancona writes, he \"did not make close friends easily\". Besieged on all sides by furious&nbsp;Tory backbenchers, whingeing Lib&nbsp;Dems, pesky Ukip and sly old Boris, one wonders at times why he bothers. Would he go into coalition again?</p><p>D'Ancona doesn't directly address the question, but it is clear from the odd aside that Cameron's determination to keep Clegg on board reflects, at least partly, the feeling that he might be needed a second time. There are glimpses too, of what a post-2015 round of horsetrading might look like. D'Ancona describes a set of welfare reform negotiations in which Clegg says his price for agreeing more benefit cuts would be reducing handouts to&nbsp;wealthy pensioners, something Cameron glumly describes as \"my tuition fees\". But we learn little more about how both sides might disentangle themselves from coalition, or what they expect to happen next.</p><p>Perhaps it is too early to say. The election is still 19 months away and events are unfolding unpredictably and at great speed. But if journalism is&nbsp;the first rough draft of history, then such books must at least be a fairly advanced revision, stepping back from the sound and fury to place events in their broader context. D'Ancona has certainly gathered together an impressive pile of jigsaw pieces. But the picture remains far from complete.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418962015|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|986c993f300786b4289056584559ac08bc07bc3e -->",

        "headline":"Quesadillas by Juan Pablo Villalobos – review",
        "body":"<p>André Breton declared Mexico to be <a href=\"http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/the-sacred-and-the-profound-surrealism-and-colour-schemes-in-mexico/\" title=\"\">\"a&nbsp;surrealist country\"</a>. The observation was something of a backhanded compliment – the French artist was fed&nbsp;up because the organisers of the conference he was attending had failed to pick him up from the airport. Yet Juan Pablo Villalobos's second novel seems to&nbsp;bear this out: \"Weren't fantastic, wonderful things meant to happen to us&nbsp;all the time? Didn't we speak to the dead? Wasn't everyone always saying we were a surrealist country?\"</p><p>There's no shortage of surrealism in Villalobos's world. The climax of the book is an orgiastic dream vision featuring copulating cattle, flying tortillas and an alien invasion, which piles absurdity upon improbability with gleeful abandon. Yet the book is as much a coruscating parody of Mexican culture as Villalobos's debut, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/13/down-rabbit-hole-villalobos-review\" title=\"\"><em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em></a>, which was shortlisted for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-first-book-award-2011\" title=\"\">2011 Guardian first book award</a>.</p><p><em>Quesadillas,</em> translated&nbsp;by&nbsp;Rosalind Harvey, does for magic realism what <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> did for \"narco-literature\" – the popular South American genre of drugs, gangs and guns. That first book was a short, shocking exercise in sophisticated pulp, in which the violence of contemporary Mexican society was&nbsp;filtered through the limited comprehension of Tochtli, the prepubescent son of a narcotics baron. While Tochtli claimed to know \"thirteen or fourteen people\" in total, the teenage narrator of <em>Quesadillas</em> has almost as many brothers and sisters, and faces the rather more common experience of bumping along the poverty line.</p><p>Orestes, named after the Greek hero but known as Oreo, like the biscuit, is the second eldest of a clan idealistically named by their classics-teacher father: \"Aristotle, Archilochus, Callimachus, Electra … we were more like the index of an encyclopaedia than a family.\" There's so many of them that when the twins Castor and Pollux go missing, Orestes treats their disappearance less as a matter of concern than a cause for celebration that there will be more food to go round.</p><p>The proximity of starvation, constant even within a family theoretically belonging to the professional classes, is&nbsp;calculated by Orestes according to an economic formula that might be known as the quesadilla index: \"We were all aware of the roller-coaster that was the national economy due to the fluctuating thickness of the quesadillas my mother served at home. We'd even invented categories – inflationary quesadillas, normal quesadillas, devaluation quesadillas …\" At the very bottom of the pile come the dreaded \"poor man's quesadillas\", in which \"the presence of cheese was literary: you opened one and instead of adding melted cheese my mother had written the word 'cheese' on the surface of the tortilla\".</p><p>The high-keyed domestic comedy is&nbsp;enjoyable for its own sake, but provides cover for a satirical assault on&nbsp;the mendacity of Mexican politics. Villalobos sets the action at the beginning of the 1980s, a&nbsp;period of rampant inflation and devaluation of the peso, and ends in 1988, when the notoriously corrupt <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/family/carlossalinas.html\" title=\"\">Carlos Salinas</a> became president amid suspicions of election fraud. By telling the story in retrospect, Villalobos endows Orestes with a credible combination of insight and ignorance. He admits that he would have a more secure grasp of the&nbsp;country's malaise \"if it weren't for&nbsp;the fact I was living through that period of supreme selfishness known as adolescence\". At the same time he&nbsp;is&nbsp;capable of such astute, adult reflections as the notion that Mexico's problems stem from the 1920s, \"when the government decided that the things in heaven belonged to heaven and the things on earth belonged to the&nbsp;government\".</p><p>He is in many respects an even more impressive creation than the bookishly unworldly preteen persona Villalobos sustained throughout <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em>. The 1980s setting of <em>Quesadillas</em> is as retro as a Rubik's cube, but it draws attention to the fact that Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary party actually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/world/a-disgraced-mexican-leader-is-making-a-comeback.html?ref=carlossalinasdegortari\" title=\"\">returned to power in 2012</a>. And&nbsp;though it is always dangerous to hunt for autobiographical reasons for a&nbsp;novel's success, it cannot be wholly coincidental that the town in which Orestes lives, Lagos de Moreno, happens to be where Villalobos was himself brought up: \"a place where there are more cows than people, more charro horsemen than horses, more priests than cows, and the people like to believe in the existence of ghosts, miracles, spaceships, saints and so forth\". Breton may have been right to&nbsp;observe that Mexico is a surrealist country. Villalobos suggests that it's nothing to be proud of.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418662611|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d2378a5773dcadbc8377471fd932957f6b2ea14e -->",

        "trailText":"David Plante's diary of his friendship with Stephen Spender is a powerful portrait of love set in the liberal London of the 60s, writes <strong>Lara Feigel</strong>",
        "headline":"Becoming a Londoner: A Diary by David Plante – review",
        "body":"<p>When David Plante began to write his diary in 1966, he was self-consciously in dialogue with Stephen Spender. At this stage the 26-year-old aspiring American novelist knew the older poet only by proxy. Plante had read Spender's memoir <em>World Within World</em> and had stolen his lover, the sculpturally beautiful Greek poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\" title=\"\">Nikos Stangos</a>. In early diary entries, Plante speculated about when he and Spender would cross paths. Within weeks, they were friends. Spender adopted the young couple, introduced them to a staggering quantity of famous men and quickly became their closest ally. Plante was not introduced to Spender's wife, Natasha.</p><p>A few months into the friendship, Spender set off to plant trees in Natasha's garden in France. He secretly took Plante with him, presenting him to luminaries including Francis Bacon and Louis Aragon in Paris along the way. Spender found it characteristically hilarious that someone called Plante was planting trees for him. He doesn't seem to have found it especially problematic that these were Natasha's trees that he was conspiratorially planting with a young man. The two men even shared a room, although the beds were carefully placed apart.</p><p>It is sad but not surprising that this episode is absent from Spender's own journals. Instead of writing about it, Spender made sure that Plante was recording it for him. \"You can put this in your diary,\" Spender says early on. Plante correctly wonders \"if he wants me to write in my diary events in his life that he himself would not write in&nbsp;his\". So Plante's diary emerges as the story left out of Spender's more carefully self-censored journals. And&nbsp;Spender becomes the central character in a diary that he orchestrates, both by&nbsp;staging the events and by commanding that they be recorded. \"What worlds within worlds am I living&nbsp;in?\" Plante asks.</p><p>It is Plante and Stangos's relationship with the Spenders that gives this book its narrative drive. As is often the case in diaries, most of the action is episodic. The cast is impressive: there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\" title=\"\">Francis Bacon</a> in the Colony Room, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\">WH Auden</a> buying carpet slippers in the Strand, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a> and Claire Bloom. But in selecting from his diaries, Plante seems to have decided that the momentum of&nbsp;the book should come from his relationship with Stangos and the couple's relationship with the Spenders. This was a good decision – it&nbsp;saves the book from reading as a catalogue of lunching and dining, and creates the sense of a plot unfolding. At&nbsp;first Spender is scrupulous about keeping the young men apart from his&nbsp;wife; it transpires that she is angry&nbsp;when he sees them. When he commissions a painting of them naked in bed, he rushes home to hide it. Phone conversations are interrupted by a click on the line informing them that Natasha has been ostentatiously listening in upstairs.</p><p>Then after about 10 years (frustratingly almost no dates are given), Plante bumps into Natasha at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. She is in the middle of a conversation; Plante interrupts to introduce himself; Natasha pretends never to have heard his name before. Plante is left awkwardly interjecting \"how nice!\" at regular intervals while Natasha and her friend studiously ignore him. Here begins a social game in which Natasha out-manoeuvres Plante, Stangos and her husband. Shortly afterwards, the two couples meet at another party and Natasha moves from ignoring him to charm. Stangos is about to go into hospital to&nbsp;have a rectal polyp removed. Apparently unembarrassed, Natasha inquires in detail about the operation, urging him to arm himself with an eye-mask and to call on her assistance. Within weeks Plante and Stangos are&nbsp;guests in her home, pretending uncomfortably they have&nbsp;never been there before.</p><p>A wholly new picture of the Spenders' marriage materialises. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/03/stephen-spender-journals-feigel-review\" title=\"\">Having co-edited Spender's journals</a>, I&nbsp;assumed that he would have left Natasha if he'd been more courageous. But the madness was obviously a folie à deux. Natasha needs her husband to affirm her saintliness by testing the limits of her love; Stephen needs his wilful wife to set down rather absurd boundaries for him to transgress. Hence the intrusiveness of her surveillance, the clumsiness of his lies&nbsp;and the ill-thought-out gifts (at one&nbsp;point Spender gives Plante one of their&nbsp;Picassos, instructing him to hide it if Natasha visits). Plante assumes that he and Stangos are exploiting the Spenders and potentially damaging their marriage; in fact perhaps the Spenders need the younger couple to&nbsp;enliven their own marital games.</p><p>The book also offers a window on to a changing world. \"I wish that when I&nbsp;was your age I had had what you have now with Nikos,\" Spender tells Plante. He believes that happy gay love was impossible for his generation. Instead he takes a vicarious pleasure in the happiness of the young. In their early years together, Plante and Stangos occasionally remember that they are technically criminals, but find that \"it is as if all the conventions of sex and clothes and art and music and drink and drugs don't apply here in London\". This wasn't true for Spender, and the sense of an older, more formal and class-based world giving way to a new order is movingly portrayed.</p><p>The book is also powerful as a portrait of mutual love. Plante has come to Europe seeking promiscuity; instead, he is surprised into monogamous happiness. \"Is this love?\" he asks. \"Is it love to want to be with him when he dies, and close his eyes?\" And Plante is generous in seeing Spender as&nbsp;the creator of all that is best in this relationship: \"in discovering the world he has opened to us we are discovering one another.\"</p><p>• Lara Feigel's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408830444\" title=\"\"><em>The Love-charm of Bombs: Restless Lives in the Second World War</em></a> is published by Bloomsbury.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418628795|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|237bca40536c296b4803ac6072a4112116518a36 -->",

        "headline":"Johnny Alucard by Kim Newman – review",
        "body":"<p>Kim Newman's cult series is a mashup of vampire legend and alternate history. In the fourth instalment, we&nbsp;are introduced to an undead waif called Ion Popescu, an outcast from Romania's virulently anti-vampire communist regime. Ion infiltrates the&nbsp;filming of Francis Ford Coppola's <em>Dracula</em> (not the version in our timeline, but a vampire-infested burlesque of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>) and follows the film-makers to America, where he's discovered by Andy Warhol in Studio 54. After making a fortune from a blood-based drug that gives its human addicts the powers of the undead, he changes his name to Johnny Alucard, becomes a Hollywood film producer, and vows to inherit the empire of his vampire father-in-blood: Count Dracula.</p><p>The aristocratic top predators of the horror genre have evolved considerably from the grotesque monsters of early gothic shockers. There have been outlaw vampires, space vampires, virus-crazed vampires, and (their most popular contemporary incarnation) vampires as tragic romantic heroes. Kim Newman's version of the enduring bloodsuckers is rooted in an ingenious twist to the ending of Bram Stoker's novel, with Dracula defeating Van Helsing and becoming Prince Consort to Queen Victoria. A loose trilogy of novels originally published in&nbsp;the 1990s charted the rise and fall of Dracula, and elaborated a witty and densely imagined alternate history in which ordinary people (\"warms\") must&nbsp;learn to coexist with long-lived supernatural creatures whose politics are based on rigid hierarchies ordered by age and who-bit-whom lineages. Newman's vampires are out in the open, agents of change who have infiltrated every part of society.</p><p>A patchwork of previously published stories and new material, the narrative of <em>Johnny Alucard</em> is episodic, occasionally uneven, but compulsively readable, a bitingly satirical version of the excesses of the 1980s laced with a deft blend of comic irony and Grand Guignol slapstick. Setpieces borrowed from history – Live Aid, the Iranian embassy siege, the fall&nbsp;of the Soviet empire – are given vampiric makeovers; versions of real&nbsp;people jostle with versions of characters borrowed from works of fiction. Newman is a film critic as well as a novelist, and his depiction of a vampire-infested Hollywood is both authentic and imaginatively redrawn.</p><p>Alucard's plans to assume the vampire throne intersect with the lives of several undead women who played leading roles in the previous novels. Kate Reed, a leftwing journalist, and Geneviève Dieudonné, a vampire elder \"older than the name 'America'\", find themselves in direct opposition to Alucard and a colourful cast of minions. While most vampires die and&nbsp;come back \"as different people, caricatures of their former selves compelled to extremes by an inner drive\", Kate and Geneviève have \"turned\" without dying inside. Despite being vampires, they are the most fully human characters in the novel.</p><p>Serious ideas about the nature of power and evil emerge from the antic blend of postmodern intertexuality, pop culture and pulp fiction. Alucard exploits the dark side of the American dream, but is consumed by something older and deeper. His sleek avatar of the \"Greed is Good\" decade is really just another aspect of Dracula, who \"saw that blood, like life, was not enough. Always, he fed on gold …\" It's&nbsp;a testament to Stoker's power of myth-making and Newman's sparkling&nbsp;reinvention that the old monster is still as relevant as ever.</p><p>• Paul McAuley's latest book is <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780575100787\" title=\"\"><em>Evening's Empires</em></a><em> </em>(Gollancz).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418656933|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|086e80dadd0be4d11ebbb4253b9990c810875392 -->",

        "headline":"Solo by William Boyd – review",
        "body":"<p>Several unusual incidents occur during the course of <em>Solo</em>, the latest attempt to prolong the literary existence of James Bond. The secret agent pays his first recorded visit to the cinema, to see <em>Bob&nbsp;&amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice</em> (this is 1969), although he gets bored and leaves before the end. He considers changing his hairstyle, for aesthetic reasons rather than as a disguise, and wonders whether the short fringe favoured by&nbsp;a&nbsp;television presenter (he can't remember his name, but it sounds like David Frost) might suit him. During a long car journey he stops to relieve himself in a wood, which will come as a&nbsp;shock to those who believe that 007, like the Queen, exists in a realm above such crude bodily functions. Perhaps most disturbing of all, while getting dressed for the final scene he selects a knitted silk tie in pale blue rather than his customary black or navy.</p><p>There would be no fun in writing a James Bond book without heading off-piste every now and then, risking the aficionado's wrath. These are William Boyd's gestures of independence as he follows in the tracks of Ian Fleming, but he is also careful to comfort the 007 fan by ticking a few hallowed boxes: the knitted ties, the vintage wines. Someone's crew-cut is described using Fleming's preferred phrase: en brosse. There is an obsession with breakfast exceeding even that of the original Bond, who was finicky about his eggcups and his marmalade. And within the first half-dozen pages the hero has met a fine-bodied woman wearing a zippered catsuit and a dab of Guerlain's Shalimar (his own mother's favourite, Bond rather sweetly observes).</p><p><em>Solo</em> treads a path already negotiated by Kingsley Amis, writing as Robert Markham (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/comics/9781845761752/james-bond-colonel-sun\" title=\"\"><em>Colonel Sun</em></a>, 1968), John Gardner (14 books between 1981 and 1996, starting with <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781409137078\" title=\"\"><em>Licence Renewed</em></a>), Sebastian Faulks (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/devil-may-care\" title=\"\"><em>Devil May Care</em></a>, 2008), and Jeffery Deaver (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/26/carte-blanche-jeffery-deaver-review\" title=\"\"><em>Carte Blanche</em></a>, 2011). However genuine the enthusiasm of those authors, and however much in thrall to an adolescent infatuation with the myth of Bond they&nbsp;may have been, they write in the knowledge that the result of their labours will never share the pantheon with Fleming's own 12 novels and half a dozen short stories. Perhaps the best they can hope for is that their Bond story – even just the title – will be taken up as the basis of the next movie.</p><p>Yet it is an honour few would refuse. If you can't actually be 007, the fantasy of so many men now heading for old age, then surely a consolation prize is to be selected by Fleming's estate to write the next \"continuation\" volume; it's almost an office of state, a bit like being the poet laureate or the master of&nbsp;the Queen's music. But this is a tough gig: each of your phrases will be&nbsp;scrutinised for the most minute lapses&nbsp;of authenticity.</p><p>Boyd's response is to create a plot that hurtles between Chelsea, Richmond upon Thames, Washington DC and the fictional west African republic of Zanzarim, the author's African expertise earning the reader's trust during the increasingly tense central section of a tale in which the global struggle for oil takes the place of Fleming's cold war. Commissioned by M to assassinate the head of a breakaway government, 007 almost gets himself killed before ignoring orders and setting off to resolve the matter – and to achieve a measure of personal revenge – in a freelance capacity. Boyd's Bond is more impulsive, less emotionally guarded, and also more sadistic, as the requisite picturesque villain ultimately discovers: \"Bond stepped back, breathing heavily, a little astonished at his own savagery.\" He is not alone in that.</p><p>With Fleming, God was in the details and nuances, and Boyd posts a respectable score, not least when he deploys a Flemingesque phrase such as \"the creeping melancholy of hotel life\" or echoes the short story \"From a View to a Kill\" while vividly summoning a memory of Bond's wartime experiences. He uses the obituary of Bond confected for <em>You Only Live Twice</em>, the last 007 book to be published in Fleming's lifetime, as a datum, meaning that in 1969 his spy is 45 years old and noticing the signs of a&nbsp;changing world. As Bond sits at a pavement table outside the (now much missed) Cafe Picasso on&nbsp;the King's Road, his advancing age lends an undertone of poignancy to his almost detached observation of the bra-less, mini-skirted cavalcade. Later a young woman gives him precise instructions in bed; he appears to enjoy this encounter with feminist sexual assertiveness.</p><p>A <em>Downton</em>-style search for anachronisms and solecisms is, of&nbsp;course, irresistible. In 1969, did anyone&nbsp;\"drizzle\" their food with the juice of a quartered lime, begin an explanation with \"Here's the thing, James\", or divert the course of a conversation by&nbsp;saying \"Don't go there\"? Was \"partner\" used as a verb? Did Morland&nbsp;&amp; Co really sell their handmade cigarettes in cartons of 200, as well as boxes of 50 and 100? Would the \"real\" Bond have bothered to test-drive a humble MGB before setting his sights on a Jensen Interceptor?</p><p>At his best, Fleming had a gift for the precise evocation of time, place and emotion. He would not have made the lazy assumption that commuters on Richmond station are universally \"jaded\", or begun two consecutive episodes, separated by a couple of pages, with the same bland phrase: \"The next morning …\" And did he not once state very precisely that the word \"actually\" was not a part of Bond's vocabulary? Boyd has him using it on page 142: \"'I did, actually,' Bond said with a modest smile.\"</p><p>And yet, all things considered, Boyd's attempt entertains far more than it exasperates. His approach, he has said, was to write his own novel using Fleming's characters, and his gift for sustaining narrative momentum is the key to its success. Next time it would be fun to ask a woman.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418653270|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|aa983bd797c0c19754e92548ba0d429b99f319e5 -->",
