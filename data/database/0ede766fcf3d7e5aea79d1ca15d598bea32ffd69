        "headline":"The Grand Budapest Hotel: first look at Wes Anderson's new movie",
        "body":"<p>Nothing gets us going more than the promise of a new Wes Anderson film. Will it be a funny as Rushmore? As inventive as Fantastic Mr Fox? As ambitious as The Royal Tenenbaums? Well, another one is on the way: The Grand Budapest Hotel, which despite its title seems to have less to do with Anderson's tenderly mysterious short film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z4Vzw0yo8I\">Hotel Chevalier</a> than an amalgam of Anderson's predilection for jewel-box environments, giant major-name casts, and arch pseudo-professional patter.</p><p>That's not to say The Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't look great: we can safely say this is a return to the mentor/apprentice relationship that Anderson has done so well before. Here, Ralph Fiennes, not immediately recognisable in a rather impressive 'tache, is chef d'hotel Gustave H, a devil with the mature guests and, as the trailer, reveals, the beneficiary of one such in her will. His pupil is the yet-to-be-heralded <a href=\"http://Tony Revolori\">Tony Revolori</a>. Anderson's plan here seems to be to jam together Rushmore's institution-reverence with Moonrise Kingdom's chase histrionics - but I could be wrong, of course. That's the beauty of trailers. And what's with the Academy ratio - is he trying to get some of that Meek's Cutoff/Wuthering Heights roughness?</p><p>What do you think? Does this trailer make you desperate to see Anderson's new film? Or break out in hives at the exquisiteness of it all?

        "headline":"Blue's lesbian lovemaking doesn't hit the spot – for better sex head for the lake",
        "body":"<p>Blue might be the warmest colour, but Abdellatif Kechiche's new film is more like the Black and White Minstrel Show of lesbian films. This is lesbian life painted so that straight people can understand it: the traumatic coming-out scenes at school, the nervous sortie into the provincial lesbian bar (I have travelled the dyke world, by the way, and this Sapphic Studio 54 only exists in a horny chick's dreams).</p><p>I was hoping things might improve when we got to the sex scenes, but although they are, as the press has excitedly reported, long and relentless, they are also muted and unsweaty. No deranged cries of \"<em>Bouffe ma chatte, putain!</em>\" No damp, desperate skin. Léa Seydoux, who plays art student Emma, has complained that Kechiche made her wear a prosthetic vagina for hours, so maybe that's why the sex feels so vanilla.</p><p>The characters keep talking about the \"great sex\" they're having, but you think, \"What great sex?\" Sure, they rim each other, but that just makes you think back to the gratuitous food scenes littering this film. What's with all the shots of Adèle sucking strands of spaghetti coated in nasty-looking bolognaise sauce? It's not as if Adèle, played by Adèle Exarchopoulos, has the <em>pulpeuse </em>mouth of Beatrice Dalle in her Betty Blue heyday. Exarchopoulos is bovine in appearance, although actually everything is ugly in this film: the houses, the food, the weather.</p><p>Which brings me to the other big French film of 2013:  L'Inconnu du Lac, or Stranger by the Lake.  It is also a gay film and its director, Alain Giraudie, also won a prize at this year's Cannes (it's out here next March). It's beautifully shot and its subject matter is gayboy cruising. Giraudie doesn't feel the need to explain that gay men often have sex in bushes in secluded places. He just gets on with the story, powerful in its simplicity, about how one of the cruisers turns out to be a murderer.</p><p>A top subject on this summer's Parisian terrasses was how the sex was \"too realistic\". Pornographic even. Such comments reveal the truth that just as the French often eat crap food (this was the only thing Kechiche got right in Blue) they are also not the libertines we think of. Lesbian frolics are the meat and <em>pommes de terre </em>of movieland but proper man-on-man action is still viewed as shocking.</p><p>Stranger by the Lake is clever and sexy. Occasionally you see erect cocks bathed in late afternoon sunlight by a shimmering lake and hypnotic sounds of cicadas mixed with men grunting as they shoot their load. Stranger is also better than Blue because there's humour in it, such as the hissy fit from one of the regular cruisers who's too late to get the man he wants.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420259368'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382015355287/Go-Fish-010.jpg' alt='Go Fish' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Real lesbian life: VS Brodie and Guinevere Turner in Go Fish! (1994). Photograph: Rex/Moviestore Collection</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to see a credible film about lesbian life, then get a copy of 1994's Go Fish! Like Lena Dunham's Girls but more realistic and with black women in, Guinevere Turner (later to make her name as the screenwriter of American Psycho) plays the cool 90s New York dyke in back-to-front baseball cap and big boots trying to get laid.  Mainly it's about the great feeling of having a lesbian gang of friends you feel at home with and don't have to explain yourself to. Some of the script is terrible but at least a dyke can watch it and not have to wade through a bunch of blacked-up lesbians.</p><p>If you're looking for something French, try Les Biches. Claude Chabrol's 1968 piece of total French art house madness, is the tale of sadistic bourgeoise Stéphane Audran's obsession with moody art student Jacqueline Sassard. They never have sex but the unrequited encounters, like the one with Sassard in the bath as green-eyeshadowed Audran looks lubriciously on, are worth all the prosthetic vaginas Kechiche could throw at you.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420254303|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|5ea2450867cff3e0f66992bb71f9bfb2e82ee93b -->",

A romantic comedy that is romantic and funny and not simply an insult to the intelligence of all carbon-based life forms. Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said is a step up for this director, in whose previous work I have sometimes heard a few false notes – inaudible, I&nbsp;should however confess, to many others. She has created a thoroughly likable and genuinely funny film and its stars, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, are a revelation, singly and together. Like their director, they unassumingly but decidedly took it to the next level on this movie. The fact that Gandolfini still had so much to offer as an actor is&nbsp;desperately sad.</p><p>Enough Said is about what love means in middle age and what it means to decide that some other divorced person is The One, or rather The New One, when the rational side of you knows that this person must surely be culpable, at least in part, for the death of their previous relationship. They must have awful habits that sunk the first marriage – habits that will only become clear once you have made a commitment to them. And by the same token, you too must have relationship-killing tendencies. Is the triumph of hope over experience a viable thing to wish for, the second time around?</p><p>Louis-Dreyfus plays a physical therapist called Eva, while Gandolfini is Albert. They meet at a swanky party and there is a connection: both are divorced and facing the same kind of loneliness; each lives with a grownup daughter who is about to leave home for college. But the comic frisson that sparks the film into life is something that predates this scenario – it's the initial hallucination or optical illusion: when Elaine Benes met Tony Soprano!</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419688220\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid/131011EnoughSaid.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Holofcener is clearly aware of the baggage these actors bring to the movie, and even playfully pre-empts and undermines our expectations by making Albert an archivist in an audio-visual library of TV classics. He supervises a viewing area where people watch TV gems on video with headphones. Albert can recite what was on TV on any given day in the 1970s but says, tongue in cheek, that he is not interested in contemporary television.</p><p>In fact, Enough Said's great second-act plot development has a Seinfeldian ingenuity, and the comic discomfort surrounding a vocal tic of Albert's is something Jerry Seinfeld or Larry David might have been proud to have written. In her scene pointing out this appalling tic at a dinner party, Louis-Dreyfus is very funny, with all of Elaine's satirically wide-eyed astonishment and incredulity and theatrically suppressed laughter, but with a new undertow of sadness.</p><p>As for Gandolfini, he only becomes Sopranoesque, with that menacing deadness of eye, at a dark stage towards the end, and then not for long. The rest of the time he is quite different, and Enough Said brings home how much other directors have been in thrall to his small-screen mobster creation. Even Gandolfini's performance in Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly opposite Brad Pitt, though a great piece of work, was an obvious variation on the Soprano theme. But here he seems reserved, droll, self-deprecating, a thoughtful and even cerebral figure. That trademark Gandolfini mannerism, the laborious nasal wheezing, is almost entirely absent, though Holofcener cleverly alludes to this by having Eva ask him about it in bed. Albert just shrugs and says he broke his nose a&nbsp;couple of times.</p><p>Albert and Eva's relationship has to be negotiated within a tricky network of loyalties. Eva knows people like Sarah (Toni Collette) and Marianne (Catherine Keener), who for various reasons are flawed as confidantes. She has her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway) – but she is about to leave home and is looking forward to emotional independence, and is moreover baffled and irritated at Eva's new quasi-maternal friendship with her best friend, Chloe (Tavi Gevinson). This is not really a supportive female chorus: it is just something making Eva's life more complicated than it already is.</p><p>After Nora Ephron, it hasn't been clear who will take over the grownup rom-com mantle: Nancy Meyers has looked far too escapist, with lovelorn fantasies that seem to exist only for the smugly wealthy. With Enough Said, it looks like Holofcener is a contender. This film is a smart and winning story about what is involved in the painful re-illusionment of middle-aged love.</p><h2>More on Enough Said</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://\">Enough Said: watch the trailer</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/14/enough-said-dangers-obesity-james-gandolfini\">David Cox: Is Enough Said about the dangers of obesity?</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181294|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|0ea052901ea60d56f19153922979f25c2d4013a7 -->",

        "headline":"Rags and Tatters – London film festival review",
        "body":"<p>Egyptian film-maker Ahmad Abdalla has given us a complex, nuanced, humane drama about the Tahrir Square protests. Having seen this movie so soon after Ibrahim el-Batout's superb but very different film on the same topic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/winter-of-discontent\" title=\"\">Winter of Discontent</a>, it came home to me that contemporary Egyptian cinema may be giving us more information about the Egyptian uprising than we'll ever get from the TV news.</p><p>Rags and Tatters refuses the easy answers – actually, it refuses the difficult answers, or any answers, in favour of a more open and questioning approach, which borders on a distinctive kind of mystery. The movie haunts the peripheries, away from the central action, intuiting the ambient rage and confusion and anxiety swirling around Cairo, and draws on the aesthetics and the rhetoric of YouTube and the mobile-phone videoclip, famously of course the medium in which people in a sense consumed and made sense of these events as they happened.</p><p>The film centres on one man, played by Asser Yassin, a prisoner who along with dozens of others in jail or temporary police custody finds that events have suddenly given him his freedom. Jail warders have fled and cops and soldiers have deserted their posts or been reassigned duties in the chaos. Yassin now wanders free, witnessing the city's uprising like a judicial ghost, unsure if at any moment he might get taken back inside, or if in the new feverish atmosphere of violence, he might be suddenly beaten up. He stays briefly with his family – but it is too dangerous to linger, so Yassin roams among friends and contacts, witnessing scenes and vignettes from all over the city, among Christian and Sufi communities.</p><p>Cairo itself is like a De Chirico landscape of trauma and violence; the people themselves are in an invisible pressure cooker as they attempt to live daily lives as best they can, and although not actively participating in the protests or appearing to take a view on them, these events have put the fabric of their normality under intolerable stress. A man harangues others on a street corner about the police brutality he has witnessed, but his words become inaudible under the revving of a motorbike: we can see but not hear his rage, and he becomes like a figure in a lucid dream. Two figures calmly witness two columns of smoke rising distantly from the city centre and this tableau reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/9/1315591116568/Thomas-Hoepker-911-photo-007.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/9-11-changed-world-forever&amp;h=276&amp;w=460&amp;sz=37&amp;tbnid=NfBf3N39zKx6fM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=150&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__9sS6wytfZrEkMknDyW9TBoJinYU=&amp;docid=owMcSv88lBnVbM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o6BfUqGQFoGThQfuroG4BQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ9QEwAQ\" title=\"\">Thomas Hoepker</a>'s famous, controversial 9/11 photo of people apparently chatting amiably in a Brooklyn park, while across the river a plume of dust and flame arises from the devastated World Trade Centre towers.</p><p>The periodically unreal or surreal sensation of an entire order being questioned and upended is a little like the work of Iranian director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/02/critics-notebook-peter-bradshaw\" title=\"\">Mohammad Rasoulof</a> – but there is something else, there, too, something oddly apolitical. Rags and Tatters almost has something of Jean Vigo: an À Propos de Cairo – a collage of moods and scenes and moments that perhaps could not be captured in this way were it not for a seismic event which is breaking everything up. Rags and Tatters is a difficult film which does not render up its meaning easily, but it is a serious and absorbing piece of work.</p><h2>London film festival 2013</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2013/oct/12/london-film-festival-pictures\">The London film festival's opening week - in pictures</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/london-film-festival-2013\">More from LFF 2013</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420231498|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|907139855d990ab1d7d40445e37fbb1f2bd36f21 -->",

        "body":"<p>Charlie Hunnam walked away from a high-profile role as kinky billionaire Christian in Sam Taylor-Johnson's upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie after being denied extensive script approval, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-charlie-hunnams-script-648778\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Further details are now beginning to emerge about the Sons of Anarchy star's surprise last-minute departure from the much-hyped adaptation of EL James' bestselling \"mommy porn\" literary sensation at the weekend. Hunnam officially cited a lack of time to prepare for the role of Christian Grey due to his busy TV schedule, and there have also been suggestions he got \"cold feet\" due to overwhelming attention from the 70 million or so fans who have bought James' book or its two sequels. Now it's being reported (in the latest edition of the US trade bible's print issue) that the British actor quit after his demands for creative input eventually caused a rift with producers.</p><p>\"Hunnam, who also is a writer (he penned the gothic horror screenplay Vlad for Brad Pitt's Plan B and Summit Entertainment), is said to have submitted his own very detailed script notes on Kelly Marcel's adaptation of the runaway best-seller,\" according to the Hollywood Reporter's article. \"The notes were well received, according to sources, but that only led to Hunnam seeking further script approval, which was denied.</p><p>\"According to another source, Hunnam, who was to be paid about $125,000 for the film, began butting heads with the creative team, including Taylor-Johnson. The conflict reached a fever pitch in early October, though everyone involved thought the issues had been resolved. </p><p>\"But the discord spiked again [on] October 11. Hunnam's team at CAA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners strongly advised him to stay on the project for fear that his exit would burn a bridge with one of the major studios. That same day, Universal hired writer Patrick Marber - no stranger to taboo sex themes with his Oscar-nominated screenplay Notes on a Scandal - to do a polish and bolster the characters. But by then, Hunnam, whose heart it seems never was in the project, had decided to decamp.\"</p><p>Alexander Skarsgard of the supernatural-themed HBO television series True Blood and Jamie Dornan of Belfast-set BBC drama The Fall were reported earlier this week to be the new frontrunners to replace Hunnam. Universal may also return to previous candidates for the role of Christian, who include Theo James, Christian Cooke and Garrett Hedlund. Dakota Johnson, best known for small roles in the Oscar-winning The Social Network and comedy The Five Year Engagement, remains in the lead female role of Anastasia Steele.</p><p>In James' novels, business magnate Christian recruits blushing virgin Anastasia to be his well-remunerated sex-slave. Fifty Shades of Grey is expected to be the first in a trilogy based on the British author's triptych of books, which also include Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/15/fifty-shades-of-grey-movie-crisis-new-lead-actor\">• Alexander Skarsgard and Jamie Dornan in running to take over lead</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232935|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|3bf4a022dbbe80cee09791bd2f7904920eae82a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dear Mister Cranston,</p><p>I've just finished a marathon of watching 'BREAKING BAD' – from episode one of the First Season – to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing. I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant! Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen – ever.</p><p>I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really. But this work of yours is spectacular – absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers... every department – casting etc... managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is awesome.</p><p>From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.</p><p>If you ever get a chance to – would you pass on my admiration to everyone – Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada – everyone – everyone gave master classes of performance... The list is endless.</p><p>Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence. You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen. That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.</p><p>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Tony Hopkins</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad: full coverage<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/23/anthony-hopkins-composing-music\">Anthony Hopkins interviewed last year</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223164|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|6924f394adc30799a12e8bf83da94afef30f3659 -->",

Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said is a step up for this director, in whose previous work I have sometimes heard a few false notes – inaudible, I&nbsp;should however confess, to many others. She has created a thoroughly likable and genuinely funny film and its stars, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, are a revelation, singly and together. Like their director, they unassumingly but decidedly took it to the next level on this movie. The fact that Gandolfini still had so much to offer as an actor is&nbsp;desperately sad.</p><p>Enough Said is about what love means in middle age and what it means to decide that some other divorced person is The One, or rather The New One, when the rational side of you knows that this person must surely be culpable, at least in part, for the death of their previous relationship. They must have awful habits that sunk the first marriage – habits that will only become clear once you have made a commitment to them. And by the same token, you too must have relationship-killing tendencies. Is the triumph of hope over experience a viable thing to wish for, the second time around?</p><p>Louis-Dreyfus plays a physical therapist called Eva, while Gandolfini is Albert. They meet at a swanky party and there is a connection: both are divorced and facing the same kind of loneliness; each lives with a grownup daughter who is about to leave home for college. But the comic frisson that sparks the film into life is something that predates this scenario – it's the initial hallucination or optical illusion: when Elaine Benes met Tony Soprano!</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419688220\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid/131011EnoughSaid.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/11/131011EnoughSaid_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Holofcener is clearly aware of the baggage these actors bring to the movie, and even playfully pre-empts and undermines our expectations by making Albert an archivist in an audio-visual library of TV classics. He supervises a viewing area where people watch TV gems on video with headphones. Albert can recite what was on TV on any given day in the 1970s but says, tongue in cheek, that he is not interested in contemporary television.</p><p>In fact, Enough Said's great second-act plot development has a Seinfeldian ingenuity, and the comic discomfort surrounding a vocal tic of Albert's is something Jerry Seinfeld or Larry David might have been proud to have written. In her scene pointing out this appalling tic at a dinner party, Louis-Dreyfus is very funny, with all of Elaine's satirically wide-eyed astonishment and incredulity and theatrically suppressed laughter, but with a new undertow of sadness.</p><p>As for Gandolfini, he only becomes Sopranoesque, with that menacing deadness of eye, at a dark stage towards the end, and then not for long. The rest of the time he is quite different, and Enough Said brings home how much other directors have been in thrall to his small-screen mobster creation. Even Gandolfini's performance in Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly opposite Brad Pitt, though a great piece of work, was an obvious variation on the Soprano theme. But here he seems reserved, droll, self-deprecating, a thoughtful and even cerebral figure. That trademark Gandolfini mannerism, the laborious nasal wheezing, is almost entirely absent, though Holofcener cleverly alludes to this by having Eva ask him about it in bed. Albert just shrugs and says he broke his nose a&nbsp;couple of times.</p><p>Albert and Eva's relationship has to be negotiated within a tricky network of loyalties. Eva knows people like Sarah (Toni Collette) and Marianne (Catherine Keener), who for various reasons are flawed as confidantes. She has her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway) – but she is about to leave home and is looking forward to emotional independence, and is moreover baffled and irritated at Eva's new quasi-maternal friendship with her best friend, Chloe (Tavi Gevinson). This is not really a supportive female chorus: it is just something making Eva's life more complicated than it already is.</p><p>After Nora Ephron, it hasn't been clear who will take over the grownup rom-com mantle: Nancy Meyers has looked far too escapist, with lovelorn fantasies that seem to exist only for the smugly wealthy. With Enough Said, it looks like Holofcener is a contender. This film is a smart and winning story about what is involved in the painful re-illusionment of middle-aged love.</p><h2>More on Enough Said</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://\">Enough Said: watch the trailer</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/14/enough-said-dangers-obesity-james-gandolfini\">David Cox: Is Enough Said about the dangers of obesity?</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181294|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|0ea052901ea60d56f19153922979f25c2d4013a7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dear Mister Cranston,</p><p>I've just finished a marathon of watching 'BREAKING BAD' – from episode one of the First Season – to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing. I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant! Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen – ever.</p><p>I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really. But this work of yours is spectacular – absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers... every department – casting etc... managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is awesome.</p><p>From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.</p><p>If you ever get a chance to – would you pass on my admiration to everyone – Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada – everyone – everyone gave master classes of performance... The list is endless.</p><p>Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence. You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen. That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.</p><p>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Tony Hopkins</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad: full coverage<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/23/anthony-hopkins-composing-music\">Anthony Hopkins interviewed last year</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223164|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|6924f394adc30799a12e8bf83da94afef30f3659 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Peter Bradshaw on sci-fi</h2><p>Science fiction has produced some of cinema's boldest and most glorious flights – in every sense. Sometimes patronised as kids' stuff, the genre seeks to look beyond the parochialism of most realist drama: to see other worlds and other existences, and therefore to look with a new, radically alienated eye at our own. Maybe something in the limitless possibilities of cinema itself spawned sci-fi.</p><p>George Meliès's A Trip to the Moon (1902) was one of early cinema's biggest hits. In the middle of the 20th century, sci-fi inhabited the B-picture world of monsters and rockets and intuited a \"red scare\" anxiety about aliens. At the end of the 60s, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey broke through into a new level of poetry and wonder. Films like Dark Star and Alien worked a satirical, pessimistic darkness into sci-fi, but George Lucas and Steven Spielberg together expressed its lighter, more hopeful strain.</p><p>In the 21st century, the Wachowskis' The Matrix sequels and Christopher Nolan's Inception have explored new, interior landscapes: the inner world of the mind may be the genre's new frontier.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\">10. The Matrix</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167325'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/06/06/matrix460.jpg' alt='The Matrix' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Matrix is a teenage boy's dream. There's action, fighting, cutting-edge special effects, murderous robots, evil authority figures, an overriding pseudo-conspiracy theory and, most wonderful of all, an ineloquent social outcast who eventually becomes a flying kung fu Jesus. What's missing? Girls in skin-tight PVC catsuits? Nope: The Matrix has those, too. </p><p>By cherrypicking as many key ingredients from action films as they could (the us-against-the-machines mentality from The Terminator, the wire work from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the star from Johnny Mnemonic), and shooting it through with a timely dose of pre-millennial unease, the directors single-handedly managed to reinvigorate an entire genre. The sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger lunkheadedly charging through armies of ineffectual goons started to look embarrassingly tired. The Matrix marks the point where fans demanded more – they wanted to see themselves on screen. And that's why the casting of Keanu Reeves was a masterstroke. He might be pretty, but he's no one-man army. Plus: Neo is totally an anagram of \"One\". Woah. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88018/terminator\">9. The Terminator</a>/<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77483/terminator.2.-.judgment.day\">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167326'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/06/kobal_arnieterminator2460.jpg' alt='Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A $7m outlay brought spectacular returns of over $70m for James Cameron's first great sci-fi action thriller, which spawned a three-sequel franchise, a powerhouse directorial career, and made robotic, former iron-pumping Teuton Arnold Schwarzenegger an unlikely 80s superstar. A time-travel thriller, whose closed-circuit-in-time mechanism is a straight lift from Chris Marker's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76696\">La Jetée</a>, its more cerebral notions – man versus machine, grey matter versus computer, past versus present versus future – are cleverly pondered alongside some of the most visceral and exciting action sequences ever filmed. And the monster, unstoppable and remorselessly murderous, can take on the voices of others, and later (in the sequel), even adopt their outward fleshly appearance, allowing it to take on the form of LAPD cops, step-moms, pet dogs, and who knows what else.</p><p>The follow-up, made for zillions more dollars, was a smash on a far larger scale, offering a metal-based morphing psycho robot (Robert Patrick) and a more sympathetic Schwarzenegger cyborg, this time assigned to protect, not destroy future rebel leader John Connor (Edward Furlong). One of the most likable aspects of this and several other Cameron features is his eagerness to put a tough, resourceful and sexy woman at the head of the cast – look at the muscle tone on that Sarah Connor in Judgment Day! – and never permit anyone to rescue her. State-of-the-art in their day, they still pack a knockout punch. <strong>John Patterson</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36315/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind\">8. Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167327'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/19/close10a.jpg' alt='Close encounters of the third kind, directed by Steven Spielberg (1977)' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Steven Spielberg revived and revitalised the alien-invasion genre after the 50s rush of raygun-wielding creature features. In his luminous 1977 special-effects extravaganza, he saw alien contact as a gateway to new knowledge, new experiences and a higher consciousness.</p><p>Its suburban hero Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is both an everyman and a prophet, a family guy who is haunted by sounds – the film's signature five-note whale call – and images of a rock formation in Wyoming, to the horror of his wife and their children. Spielberg flirts with thriller conventions, though this is ultimately a cosy ride, lightened by a spirit of evangelical zeal concerning Neary's obsession, while the encounter itself plays out like an intellectual version of the rapture, in which only true believers are taken by the sylph-like visitors.</p><p>The film is also as close as Spielberg gets to social comment, and the ending – expanded for the 1980 \"special edition\" – sees Neary, after an unpleasant grilling by the government and the military, turning his back on a US where Watergate and Vietnam were still recent and painful memories. <strong>Damon Wise</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars\">7. Star Wars</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167328'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380216066648/Mark-Hamill-as-Luke-Skywa-007.jpg' alt='Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars film' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The original Star Wars (let's not bother with this Episode IV: A New Hope subheading nonsense) lays its cards on the table with its opening shot: a gigantic, evil-looking spaceship chasing down a far smaller craft. Like the rest of the movie, you could watch it with the sound off and completely follow what was going on. It's the purity of the story that has made this film endure, the classic themes handed down through the ages. It may be dressed up with robots, spaceships and trash compactors, but it's the old-as-time hero journey – George Lucas has said he consciously modelled his screenplay on Joseph Campbell's study of comparative mythology The Hero With a Thousand Faces.</p><p>In the cynical 70s, the notion of making a movie that mixed Kurosawa and Flash Gordon must have sounded as ludicrous as it does today. The film industry wasn't ready for such an ambitious technical feat (at such a modest budget) as Star Wars, so Lucas changed it by bringing in untested youngsters from experimental and indie movies, or from fields like industrial design. Lucas had a talent for mixing disparate influences and making them fit perfectly. He shepherded together acting stalwarts like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, experimental film-makers like Adam Beckett (who supervised the effects), and military uniform historian John Mollo; it would otherwise be inconceivable that these people would have all worked on the same project.</p><p>Much has been made of Lucas's repeated direction to his cast (\"Faster and more intense\") or that the dialogue was easier to type than say. Guinness, Cushing and James Earl Jones give it all the gravitas it needs, with the younger members fitting their roles perfectly: Mark Hamill's wide-eyed earnestness, Carrie Fisher's dignity and, perhaps best of all, Harrison Ford looking so mortified and embarrassed to be there. For audiences it resulted in a film unlike any before or since. <strong>Phelim O'Neill</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92910/e.t.the.extra-terrestrial\">6. ET: The Extra-Terrestrial</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167329'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/kobal_ET460.jpg' alt='Henry Thomas in ET the Extra-Terrestrial' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After 1977's Close Encounters (see no 8), director Steven Spielberg reversed the alien encounter formula to wonder not what we would make of them but what they would make of us. The result was this 1982 blockbuster, which eclipsed even the original Star Wars and received nine Oscar nominations (winning four) – a feat unheard of for a film with such overt sci-fi content.</p><p>Despite its genre trappings, ET balanced its fantasy content with an Academy-pleasing dose of sentiment, played out in the home life of Elliott (Henry Thomas), a lonely 10-year-old whose parents are separating. Little time is spent revealing where the film's ET has come from, or how he came to be left behind. Instead, Spielberg focuses on the film's unlikely-buddy story; the middle child of three (Drew Barrymore is the sweet but clingy younger sister, Robert MacNaughton the cynical teenage big brother), Elliott takes in the ET as the friend and confidant he doesn't have.</p><p>Largely filmed from an adult-waist-height perspective, the film prioritises this world of children and indulges them in their harmless naivety. So when the mean-minded authorities find out about the presence of ET, the effects are doubly shocking. The faceless hordes of uniformed, flashlight-toting militia make an intimidating and brutal sight. After a light-hearted first half, the film takes a plunge into darker drama in the second, when ET is captured and quarantined. Pale and half‑dead, the creature draws uncanny performances from its child cast, and the religious parallels in ET's subsequent \"resurrection\" have never gone unnoticed. However, they are likely accidental; Spielberg has said he sees his film more as a \"minority story\" about two outsiders who join forces in isolation.</p><p>There is also more than a hint of fairytale about ET, notably in the film's final, famous chase sequence, in which Elliott takes to his bicycle with ET on the handlebars and soars, Peter Pan-like, up into the sky. As in Close Encounters, there is a healthy scepticism about authority on show, but ET: The Extra Terrestrial is a less worldly film. Like much of Spielberg's work, it was heavily influenced by his parents' divorce and based on an imaginary friend he created at the same age as Elliott. \"A friend,\" he said, \"who could be the brother I never had, and a father that I didn't feel I had any more.\" <strong>DW</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76558/solaris\">5. Solaris</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167330'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2010/10/20/1287586012881/Solaris-006.jpg' alt='Solaris' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Andrei Tarkovsky started work on an adaptation of Stanisław Lem's philosophical science-fiction novel in 1968 in an attempt to find a popular cinematic subject. After the usual labyrinthine negotations with the Soviet authorities over the script, what emerged was a space film unlike anything before or since. Lem's novel posited the existence of solaristics; the study of an outlying star system that had bizarre effects on human psychology. Tarkovsky took this idea, and turned it into a dreamlike interrogation of faith, memory and the transfiguring power of love.</p><p>Tarkovsky begins his version of the story with some of the most magically earthbound images ever filmed, as his protagonist, a psychologist called Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), contemplates his garden. He then embarks on a voyage to the space station circling Solaris, there to investigate the reports of eccentric behaviour of previous visitors. Kelvin undergoes an ordeal by memory, as Solaris' psychoactive properties trigger the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk). The space station becomes a place of mysterious hauntings and apparitions. His colleagues hardly inspire trust, and Kelvin attempts to make sense of what is happening to him as he retreats further into an internal world.</p><p>Tarkovsky was barely interested in Lem's main preoccupation: to theorise about what might constitute alien life. Solaris, and its apparently animate \"oceans\", are simply a conduit to, and externalisation of, deeper spiritual matters. It's fair to say that no other director can have got anywhere near the mystic uplift of this film - and that includes the Steven Soderbergh remake with George Clooney. Lem didn't like the way his novel had been adapted; Tarkovsky himself considered it a less than successful film. But the clarity and beauty of Solaris ensures its majesty lives on. <strong>Andrew Pulver</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75860/alien\">4. Alien</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167331'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/20/1287591219675/Alien-006.jpg' alt='Alien' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Alien is a perfect storm of talents: Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's lean screenplay; Derek Vanlint's moody cinematography; Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score; Brian Johnson's miniature effects, and a cast including Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm and John Hurt.</p><p>The most noticeable and revolutionary work on this film was, of course, on the design side. O'Bannon had previously worked on Alejandro Jodorowsky's ill-fated adaptation of Dune (a project that also fell through Ridley Scott's grasp). For that he had assembled an incredible assortment of artists, who he regrouped for Alien, with talents such as Moebius from the Métal Hurlant magazine, Ron Cobb from Star Wars and Swiss artist HR Giger. Years before, Giger had a vivid nightmare where a lavatory and surrounding plumbing came to queasy, pulsating life – and so his \"biomechanical\" style was born. His creations were bizarre, organic machines and his designs for Alien, such as the huge derelict spaceship the astronauts investigate, seem as much grown as constructed.</p><p>Alien uses a similar story framework to the 50s cheapo monster flick It! The Terror from Beyond Space, but adds so much to it that it becomes a far deeper film. There are plenty of subtexts at play here, such as having the lead role played by a woman (the script just used surnames in a non-gender specific manner), or the male Kane giving \"birth\" to the creature in the still-powerful \"chestburster\" scene. However you approach it, this is a wonderfully immersive and terrifying film. It was such a shock to the system when it was released (and a huge hit to boot) that you can still see its influence in countless sci-fi and horror films decades down the line. <strong>PON</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76627/blade-runner\">3. Blade Runner</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167332'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2011/1/25/1295958042496/1982-BLADE-RUNNER-007.jpg' alt='1982, BLADE RUNNER' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Most directors who have finished a science-fiction film tend to choose something a little more down to earth for their next project. Ridley Scott, coming off Alien, launched himself into something even more stylised and visually dense.</p><p>Based on Philip K Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and borrowing the title from William S Burroughs, Blade Runner follows a detective called Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as he hunts down a group of replicants. These synthetic humans – almost impossible to discern from the real thing – have escaped from one of the \"off-world\" colonies and returned to Earth. Deckard's mission is to \"retire\" them, but the reason behind the replicants' return is interestingly emotive: they wish to lead their own lives, as is the right of any sentient being.</p><p>Blade Runner, notoriously, was completely misunderstood when it was released. Ford was an action man and audiences could be forgiven for thinking this was going to be a sort of Indiana Jones and the Flying Police Car. It wasn't helped by the clumsy voiceover and coda that the studio insisted upon.</p><p>Now, though, there's no denying its classic status. There are several versions available, each showing that with even a few minor differences, this film can be read in different ways. (Is Deckard a replicant? Even Scott and Ford can't agree.) Designer Syd Mead also pulled his weight. Mead was a visual futurist, a designer of advanced concepts for companies like Chrysler and Philips. However, it is Rutger Hauer's final speech, as the dying replicant leader Roy Batty, that people remember the most. It's an emotional end, adding unexpected heartbreak to a film that may have seemed almost baffling at first viewing. <strong>PON</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75782/metropolis\">2. Metropolis</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167333'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/2/27/1330340687923/Metropolis-007.jpg' alt='Metropolis' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Although many sci-fi films followed, none have had the lasting, seemingly self-regenerating appeal of Fritz Lang's silent classic – perhaps because, after its Berlin premiere in 1927, it is arguable that no authoritative version of it has ever really been established. Originally clocking in at two hours and 33 minutes, Metropolis has since become a movable feast, with new scenes and scores – Giorgio Moroder issued a derided, colour-tinted synth version in 1984 – that have kept Lang's epic current.</p><p>For its time, the film was a milestone, innovative miniatures and camera tricks to create its city of the future, taking two years to shoot and bankrupting its producers (in modern money, the budget was close to $200m). But the real key to its longevity is its thematic content: more a warning than a romance, it deals with issues of modernity that have never gone away. Class conflict is its main thread: when Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), the idle son of a rich businessman, discovers the primitive conditions the city's workers are living in, the scenes of a dehumanised proletariat – a cast of more than 30,000 extras – still have power today. Lang's fetishising of machinery scarily foregrounds the cost of heavy industrialisation. But what many remember most is an extraordinary sequence in which the woman who pulls the scales from Freder's eyes – Maria (Brigitte Helm), a good-hearted workers' rights agitator – is kidnapped and replaced with a sinister, violence-inciting robot double by evil scientist Rotwang, at Freder's father's command. This hydraulic beauty, with cantilevered breasts, morphs into a wide-eyed, unblinking Maria in a moment of pure magic.</p><p>Many of Lang and writer Thea von Harbou's original subplots have been lost. But even in its shortest form (90 minutes) Metropolis remains a timeless tale. Though made to fit a genre that showcases the possibilities of the future, Lang's film never loses sight of its rights and wrongs. <strong>DW</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36269/2001\">1. 2001: A Space Odyssey</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167334'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2011/12/12/1323693328754/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-007.jpg' alt='2001: A Space Odyssey' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released, few would have predicted it would still be feted nearly half a century later. In fact few would have tipped it for even short-lived glory. At its premiere – its premiere – there were 241 walkouts, including Rock Hudson, who asked: \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?\"</p><p>Even its champions were stumped. \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring,\" thought the New York Times; \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" reckoned Newsday. But bafflement was the intention, explained its creators. Said Arthur C Clarke, whose 1948 story The Sentinel was the starting point for Stanley Kubrick (Clarke's novelisation postdated the film): \"If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.\"</p><p>A cop-out? Far from it: 2001 is magisterial. Its impeccable serious-mindedness is nothing to scoff at; what some saw as ponderous now seems merely prescient. It was both the last space-travel movie shot before men actually landed on the moon, and the first to turn a genre that had been the preserve of B-movie cheese into the highest form of art.</p><p>It looks not just as fresh as the day it was made but as fresh as the day you first saw it: iffy ape costumes aside, it's one of the few 60s movies that stands up to contemporary technical scrutiny. At the time, it must have marked a quantum leap forward: suddenly, space seemed credible. To watch even now is to be awestruck: all those exacting details (the 700-word instructions for using a zero-gravity toilet), the pacing – at once lulling and urgent, the audio – soaring Strauss waltzes spliced with dead air. In space, of course, no one can hear you speak.</p><p>And so to the difficult matter of what on earth it's about. On a bare-bones level, it concerns three artefacts: one left on Earth at the dawn of man by space explorers keen to steer the evolution of the apes, another buried deep in the lunar surface, and programmed to signal word of man's first journey into the universe (in Kubrick's words, \"a kind of cosmic burglar alarm\") and the third in orbit around Jupiter – another alarm, this time for when man breaks out of his own solar system.</p><p>And that's what happens in the film, when a team of five men (three in hibernation) jet off to investigate the second. But the mission goes awry – arguably the fault of the chatty command computer, Hal – and the sole surviving astronaut is swept into a force field that hurls him on a journey through the galaxy. From there it's to a human zoo, built from his own subconscious, where he ages fast, dies, is reborn and enhanced – \"a star child, an angel, a superman\" (said Kubrick) – before returning to Earth to advance evolution.</p><p>2001 is a film whose ambition is only matched by its achievement in pulling it off. It was the world's first – and perhaps only – metaphysical exploration of the workings of humanity, from the beginning of time to the far-flung future, and it's small wonder sci-fi has never really recovered. It has really only been going backwards, relying either on splashy effects or psychological conundrums handled so tritely that they barely seem related to 2001 at all.</p><p>Some complain that it is chilly, inhuman. Perhaps. But the dying song of Hal, warbling out Daisy Bell (A Bicycle Made for Two) as his plug is pulled, must be one of the most haunting scenes in cinema, mechanic or not.</p><p>Not to mention, of course, that 2001 provides the most open-and-shut case for cinema being primarily a visual medium: from the twirling, dancing orbits to the extended acid(ic) trip at the end, it is, quite simply, a knock-out. And it features Leonard Rossiter as a Russian astronaut. The question back in 1968 would have been: how could this possibly be number 1?
