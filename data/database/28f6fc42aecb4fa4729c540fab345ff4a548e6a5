        "body":"<p>A man wielding a machete carried out a terrifying attack which left one man dead and another seriously injured in a butcher's shop in Rotherham.</p><p>South Yorkshire police arrested a 27-year-old man shortly after the attack on Tuesday  afternoon. A murder investigation has been opened.</p><p>Officers were called to the city centre after receiving reports of a man brandishing a machete in the Eastwood area of Rotherham and the town centre.</p><p>The victims were stabbed in the freezer room at the back of a halal butcher's shop in Eastwood, according to local councillor Jahangir Akhtar, who said he had spoken to witnesses.</p><p>He said the Bismillah Food Store was busy with shoppers stocking up for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. A man with a blood-covered machete was seen running out of the shop and smashing car windows, said Akhtar, before heading towards a Tesco store in the town centre where he was eventually cornered by police.</p><p>He said the arrested man used to work at the shop on Grosvenor Road, which is owned by the family of the dead man, who has not been formally named.</p><p>Akhtar said: \"I've known the family for decades. They are one of the longest retailers of halal food in the area. [The dead man's] father opened the shop on Grosvenor Road at least 30 years ago. [The victim] was a much loved, integral part of the community – a lovely lad. It's a sad and tragic loss.\"</p><p>The man who was seriously injured also worked at Bismillah, Akhtar added.</p><p>Omar Mehrban, a local Conservative spokesman who works in banking, said the dead man was in his 40s, and was married with children.</p><p>Mehrban said: \"He was a family friend. This is such a shock and I feel really deeply for his family.</p><p>\"He should be celebrating Eid with his wife and kids – instead they are faced with this. He was such a wonderful person, always courteous and kind. All the times I went in his shop, I can never recall him not smiling. It's absolutely devastating.\"</p><p>Others wrote on Twitter of seeing a man running away through Rotherham covered in blood.</p><p>Richard Cattley wrote: \"A man has just ran past me in Rotherham town centre wielding a machete covered in blood shouting move!! Police everywhere!\"</p><p>He added: \"All I saw him run past me with knife in hand shouting move adjacent to where the buildings are being knocked down opp market.\"</p><p>Ben Shepherd tweeted: \"Lunatic running through Tesco, Rotherham, brandishing a huge knife, frightened the life out of our secretary. Taken out by 10 police.\"</p><p>A police spokeswoman said: \"Emergency services were called to the Grosvenor Road area of the town, shortly after 2pm today [Tuesday 15 October].</p><p>\"On arrival at the scene, one man was found dead and a second man seriously injured. The second man has been taken to hospital where he remains undergoing treatment.\"</p><p></p><p>The incident was believed to have happened near a Tesco store in the town.</p><p>A Tesco spokesperson said: \"This is a matter for the police and we are supporting them with their investigation.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420049784|2013-10-16T18:19:27Z|d7b8bfed50bf95d24fd1c7f73b450565a5a87991 -->",
