        "body":"<p>Twenty years after she saddled up her first runner in the Melbourne Cup, Gai Waterhouse has fulfilled her destiny with Fiorente taking out Australian racing's biggest prize.</p> <p>Te Akau Nick finished second in the 1993 Cup which changed the face of the race for the future when the winner Vintage Crop began the European raid.</p> <p>Two decades on and Waterhouse won the Cup at Flemington with a horse purpose-bought in England and one who ran second in the 3,200m endurance test a year ago.</p> <p>Fiorente was the most popular with punters, starting the $7 favourite, and Waterhouse, who also had a second placing with Nothin' Leica Dane in 1995, admitted to feeling some pressure.</p> <p>\"I went into the race with a real live chance for the first time ever,\" said Waterhouse, who has emulated her father Tommy Smith as a Cup-winning trainer.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to let people down. I kept saying to (husband) Rob 'God I hope we win it'. It is every trainer's dream and yes, it has been a burning desire to win.\"</p> <p>It was a third Cup win for jockey Damien Oliver, a replacement for Nash Rawiller who was sacked after Fiorente's fourth in the Turnbull Stakes. It was also Oliver's first race ride on Fiorente after he missed his Cox Plate third through suspension.</p> <p>The shareholders of Fiorente are many and varied, but managing owner Andrew Roberts spoke for the group.</p> <p>\"I had shares in other horses Gai has bought from overseas, Glencadam Gold and Julienas, but it's very special to be part of Gai's journey,\" he said. \"I don't know all the owners. Some have smaller shares than others but we all celebrate.\"</p> <p>Waterhouse fought off interest from other Australian groups to buy Fiorente and said she had bought another three horses from Europe in the past week to get ready for next year.</p> <p>Her other horse in the Cup, Tres Blue, faded to finish 22nd, beating only Ruscello home.</p> <p>Fiorente became the first horse since Empire Rose in 1988 to back up a year later from a place in the Cup but Waterhouse said it would be too hard for him to have another go.</p> <p>\"Apart from the great mare (Makybe Diva) horses are weighted out of it,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Weight in terms of numbers did little to help owner Lloyd Williams, with Fawkner the first of his runners home in sixth place.</p> <p>Seville finished 12th, Sea Moon 13th, Mourayan 15th, Masked Marvel 18th and last year's winner Green Moon 21st.</p> <p>Waterhouse sought the advice of four-time winner Williams ahead of Tuesday's race.</p> <p>\"I rang Lloyd to ask him what I should do,\" she said. \"It's all very well saying you know how to do it but then people ask why you haven't done it.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421677250|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|a175a27c7dd6659d1e7fa8c8a33842301968bac9 -->",

It’s the one day a year Australian office spaces and social media circles become consumed by horse racing, and for the uninitiated it’s tempting to hide in a corner. Or chuck a sickie and watch reruns of Neighbours all day.</p> <p>But you don’t need to be the one gazing blankly into the distance as learned friends and associates ponder the Flemington track condition and whether the Cox Plate or the Caulfield Cup is the key form race for this year’s event.</p> <p>Even if you digest only one of the eight ways we’ve listed to help you sound like an expert, you’ll still have something to contribute to Tuesday’s endless Cup conversations. And you can’t say neigh to that.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Import</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’re not talking about the Melbourne Cup’s significance, though arguably it is Australia’s single greatest sporting event. We’re talking about runners in the race who were brought from overseas to compete – and there are so damn many of them that you will hear the term ‘import’ so frequently you’ll think you’re hearing things. European stables have been sending their horses down under for years, but recently it has become <em>de rigeur</em> for Aussies to buy tried gallopers from that part of the world and campaign them here for a tilt at the Cup. This year, at the time of writing, of the 47 horses vying for a spot, 12 are trained overseas and 18 ‘locals’ started their careers overseas. Which, in a field of 24, doesn’t leave much room for the locals. Boo hoo.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/01/melbourne-cup-bluffers-guide-horse-racing\">For the full article, click here</a></p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421536295|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|a8a080134e9d4ae715a24e7964497787eee87c46 -->",

        "body":"<p>Alastair Cook has conceded that Shane Warne may have had a point when criticising a lack of imagination in his captaincy, but is happy to be judged on the results of his England team.</p> <p>Cook spoke to the media ahead of his first appearance of the tour against Australia A in Hobart on Wednesday, and Warne's latest barbs in the direction of the England team were always likely to dominate the agenda.</p> <p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem times have changed at all does it since last summer?&rdquo; said the England captain, who missed the first warm-up game in Perth with a back problem but insisted that he is now feeling fine. &ldquo;It's old news, not surprising, and we don't expect it to exchange in the next couple of months either.</p> <p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, it's results that are the most important thing. That's how you are judged as a captain.</p> <p>&ldquo;At times I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;m trying to learn on the job from experience and there will be times where I could be slightly more imaginative and think slightly differently if the situation arises. [But] we&rsquo;ve had a pretty good run so far as a Test side. In my first year as a Test captain we&rsquo;ve won away in India which wasn&rsquo;t done for a long time, won a series against Australia and I think those are things we can be very proud of as a side. I keep saying it, it&rsquo;s all about results.&rdquo;</p> <p>Cook also backed Joe Root, the other England player to find himself in Warne's pre-series targets, to be unfazed by suggestions he does not have the technique to handle the new ball in Australia &ndash; although he refused to say whether Root will be opening with him in Hobart, stressing that \"all options are open\".</p> <p>&ldquo;Joe's a fantastic player...and he's a pretty unflappable guy,&rdquo; added the captain. &ldquo;So yes, I'm sure it's slightly new to him. But that's where hopefully the experience of people like myself, KP [Kevin Pietersen] who've been there as batters in the top order can give him some advice. But he can handle himself, I've got no worries about that.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669844|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|c12592d418acdb0de6beace3c7eb0da6d040db45 -->",

        "body":"<p>Favourite Fiorente rode to Melbourne Cup victory under Australian jockey Damien Oliver in front of a full house at a sunny Flemington racecourse.</p> <p>The Gai Waterhouse-trained five-year-old, who took full advantage of a good barrier draw, stormed down the home straight to pip Red Cadeaux by three-quarters of a length in front of over 100,000 spectators.</p> <p>In one of the most open races in recent Cup history, Fiorente&nbsp;held off the tough field to become the first favourite, at 6-1, to win since Makybe Diva triumphed in&nbsp;2005.</p> <p>The Irish stallion went one better than his second place in last year's race, proving too strong for his rivals in the final 200m of the 3,200m course. It was Oliver&rsquo;s third Melbourne Cup victory, while Waterhouse &ndash; one of the most prominent figures in Australian racing - picked up her first win in the \"race that stops a nation\".</p> <p>Red Cadeaux, who started at 60-1, mirrored his performance in 2011 by coming in second, with Mount Athos third. The results prolonged British-trained horses' frustration in&nbsp;the Cup, in which victory remains elusive. Simenon finished fourth and and a third British-trained horse Dandino fifth. With the top five all hailing from foreign climes, it was left to Australian Fawkner to break up the international domination with sixth.</p> <p>Brown Panther, owned and bred by former England footballer Michael Owen and the subject of much interest before the race, claimed eighth behind Ethiopia.&nbsp;But following Fiorente&rsquo;s heroics, focus was firmly on the winner, Oliver and Waterhouse.</p> <p>\"It&rsquo;s amazing, it&rsquo;s a dream come true,\" Oliver told Channel Seven. \"I&rsquo;m so rapt that I could be part of Gai&rsquo;s first one. She&rsquo;s done so much for racing and it&rsquo;s a great honour for me to help bring home her first one.</p> <p>\"Gai was one of the first people to get behind me when I came back and I can&rsquo;t thank her enough for helping me get going again and we have been a great team together.\"</p> <p>Waterhouse was equally congratulatory to her jockey.</p> <p>\"He rode him a treat,\" Waterhouse said. \"He got back to about 12th and it was quite a solidly run race and then he just kept tracking up and tracking up. He was just fantastic, it&rsquo;s a dream come true.\"</p> <p>Apart from the jubilation in the winner's enclosure, there was also sadness after it emerged that the Aga Khan's five-year-old French mare Verema had to be put down after the race.</p> <p>\"It is with regret that we confirm that Verema had to euthanised after suffering a fracture to its right foreleg during the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup,&rdquo; Dr Brian Stewart,&nbsp;Racing Victoria's head of veterinary and equine welfare, said.</p> <p>\"This was an unfortunate accident that happens infrequently in racing and our sympathies are extended at this time to the Aga Khan, Alain de Royer Dupre and the connections of Verema.\"</p> <p>Pre-race, there was a whiff of controversy when previous winner Dunaden and another Waterhouse-trained horse, Tres Blue, were found to have been treated for ailments on race morning.</p> <p>Race officials cleared both horses to compete, despite treatments of any kind being outlawed on race days.</p> <p>\"We're satisfied that these horses are drug free,\" chief steward Terry Bailey said. \"We're satisfied that, particularly on our veterinary advice, no prohibited substances have been involved.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421667732|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|6ebce8a091bd6ecf72ca3f0a1e882e999dc9a9cd -->",

These are at the minor, in our view, end of the scale when it comes to race-day treatment.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, both stables will face a Racing Victoria inquiry later in the week.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669491|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|dda1cc67e2b762adcb37901230cd082ef8996459 -->",

The 30-year-old will seek further medical advice to determine whether he requires shoulder surgery, which could threaten his availability for the start of next year's NRL season.</p> <p>A World Cup spokesman said Australia had not registered any safety concerns about advertising hoardings after Lewis' injury.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421668561|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|aca51f58f26fd3c780cbbd470f75abcdeedd8068 -->",

        "body":"<p>CSKA Moscow's manager, Leonid Slutsky, has branded the fallout from Yaya Touré being racially abused by a section of fans an \"overreaction\" and said the situation had been exaggerated, though he was clear the club is against all racism.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/23/manchester-city-yaya-toure-racist-chanting\" title=\"\">Touré suffered monkey chants during Manchester City's 2-1 win at CSKA in a Champions League group game a fortnight ago</a>. Although the Russian club initially denied that Touré had been the subject of the abuse, Uefa has ruled that a section of their ground should be closed for their next home match in the competition, against Bayern Munich.</p><p>During a press conference in which CSKA tried to keep questions away from the issue, Slutsky was finally moved to make a statement regarding the incident. \"It is normal we are against racism in our team,\" he said. \"We have black players and we give them support. We did not hear any racist chants [so] it is difficult to comment.</p><p>\"The club is categorically against racism but we think the situation has been very exaggerated and there was an overreaction. We have received our punishment – it was up to Uefa to impose it.\"</p><p>Although there was no confirmation that CSKA will not appeal against the verdict, Slutsky indicated the club will abide by the ruling. \"That is a question for the bosses in our club – I do not deal with appeals,\" he said. \"The sooner we finish [speaking about it the better].\"</p><p>Although Slutsky offered no apology the CSKA captain, Sergei Ignashevich, did so. But after first stating only that he was sorry some fans would not be able to attend the Bayern game.</p><p>\"We are very sorry some of the fans won't be at this game but at the moment we are thinking about the [City] game,\" he said.</p><p>When pressed if he was apologetic over the abuse Touré suffered, Ignashevich said: \"We are sorry that such unpleasant incident took place.\"</p><p>When Slutsky was asked how bad it would be if there were a repeat during Tuesday's match at the Etihad Stadium, the club's media officer intervened, saying: \"Let's wait for them to repeat it and then feel sorry for that.\"</p><p>Manuel Pellegrini earlier warned the CSKA fans that there should be no repeat and that they should remember the 2018 World Cup is being held in their country. In light of CSKA's denial that Touré had been subjected to the chants, the City manager was asked how relations were between the two clubs.</p><p>\"I don't know about the relations of both clubs,\" he said. \"The fans of CSKA made an important mistake. The club, I don't know why they denied at the beginning or what their reaction is now but Uefa acted and gave them the punishment they deserve. I hope we can leave it in the past and [the same] for Russian fans because they have a World Cup in their country.\"</p><p>Pellegerini will not say anything special to Touré before the game. \"I think Yaya is an experienced player,\" he said. \"What happened in Russia, maybe he can't forget but tomorrow is a special match for him, not because of that but because Manchester City can go to the next stage of the Champions League. I think he will only be thinking about football.\"</p><p>The City defender Pablo Zabaleta said: \"What happened in Moscow was really hard for Yaya. We are all behind him and any time we see something like that we try to help the players.</p><p>\"Hopefully Uefa is always on it. As players we can do nothing; we just need to give a massive support to the black players when they have some problems like that. Let me talk about football, that is the most important thing.\"</p><p>Is the right-back concerned there may be a repeat on Tuesday evening? \"I don't know. As I said before, I don't want to talk too much about racist chants or problems because I think we need to be more focused on football. That is the most important thing. And let Uefa take decisions about it.\"</p><p>Pellegrini confirmed that Joe Hart will again be left out for Costel Pantilimon but the manager does not believe his decision has affected the England goalkeeper's confidence. \"No, I think Joe reacted very well. He is a professional player,\" he said.</p><p>\"For him, it is also a good thing to have a rest after playing so many matches. He is working without any problem, supporting Costel Pantilimon.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to be out but he thinks it will be useful for him.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421652119|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|5927fc2172aebd5cc4201f259b0fca8ca146a27d -->",

        "body":"<p>Alastair Cook has conceded that Shane Warne may have had a point when criticising a lack of imagination in his captaincy, but is happy to be judged on the results of his England team.</p> <p>Cook spoke to the media ahead of his first appearance of the tour against Australia A in Hobart on Wednesday, and Warne's latest barbs in the direction of the England team were always likely to dominate the agenda.</p> <p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem times have changed at all does it since last summer?&rdquo; said the England captain, who missed the first warm-up game in Perth with a back problem but insisted that he is now feeling fine. &ldquo;It's old news, not surprising, and we don't expect it to exchange in the next couple of months either.</p> <p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, it's results that are the most important thing. That's how you are judged as a captain.</p> <p>&ldquo;At times I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;m trying to learn on the job from experience and there will be times where I could be slightly more imaginative and think slightly differently if the situation arises. [But] we&rsquo;ve had a pretty good run so far as a Test side. In my first year as a Test captain we&rsquo;ve won away in India which wasn&rsquo;t done for a long time, won a series against Australia and I think those are things we can be very proud of as a side. I keep saying it, it&rsquo;s all about results.&rdquo;</p> <p>Cook also backed Joe Root, the other England player to find himself in Warne's pre-series targets, to be unfazed by suggestions he does not have the technique to handle the new ball in Australia &ndash; although he refused to say whether Root will be opening with him in Hobart, stressing that \"all options are open\".</p> <p>&ldquo;Joe's a fantastic player...and he's a pretty unflappable guy,&rdquo; added the captain. &ldquo;So yes, I'm sure it's slightly new to him. But that's where hopefully the experience of people like myself, KP [Kevin Pietersen] who've been there as batters in the top order can give him some advice. But he can handle himself, I've got no worries about that.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669844|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|c12592d418acdb0de6beace3c7eb0da6d040db45 -->",

        "trailText":"England's coach Stuart Lancaster, who will announce his team on Thursday, has backed Billy Twelvetrees to get it right against the Pumas",
        "headline":"England's Stuart Lancaster backs Billy Twelvetrees against Argentina",
        "body":"<p>Stuart Lancaster will not confirm England's lineup to face Argentina until Thursday but has already made clear he is not planning major surgery to the team which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/england-australia-autumn-international-rugby-union\" title=\"\">battled to victory over Australia</a>. Billy Twelvetrees, accordingly, looks set to retain his place in midfield with Lancaster backing the Gloucester centre to deliver against the Pumas.</p><p>While England clearly lacked attacking fluency against the Wallabies at the weekend, Lancaster was happy with the way his young side came back to secure a confidence-boosting victory. With the All Blacks due at Twickenham on Saturday week, he wants to give the bulk of his starting XV another chance to gel, rather than chopping and changing for the sake of it.</p><p>There may yet be a couple of alterations, not least in the front row with Alex Corbisiero set to train fully for the first time on Tuesday following a knee injury, but Twelvetrees has been publicly reassured by the management that he is not about to be instantly jettisoned.</p><p>\"Billy's done pretty well for us and deserves another chance I think,\" stressed Lancaster. \"He is disappointed with one or two areas of his game, but a lot of areas were pretty good. We have to give him credit for that. We'll make the decision over the next 24-48 hours but I'm not envisaging too many changes. There's definitely more in us and we feel we can improve in that [midfield] area.\"</p><p>There is a bigger picture to be considered, too, with Lancaster still a fan of picking an inside-centre with a range of footballing skills as opposed to an up-and-down battering ram. When Twelvetrees, on his debut against Scotland last season, played alongside Manu Tuilagi he was outstanding but Saturday's win over the Wallabies was a completely different style of contest, with few opportunities for England's centres to stretch their legs in attack.</p><p>Northampton's powerful back Luther Burrell would clearly dent a few opponents but Twelvetrees is a better passer and kicker of a ball and plenty of variety will be required in the long term if England are to forge a team capable of winning the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>Privately, the view within the England camp is that Saturday's victory showcased the growing character within the team and that their individual talents will also flourish given more time.</p><p>Lancaster is particularly optimistic about his pack – with an average age of under 25 – which, between them, did not miss a tackle during the entire game. While England may not have achieved much with ball in hand, their defence was mostly excellent and their fitness and strength off the bench contributed to the Wallabies' second-half downfall.</p><p>\"When you look at the young age of the pack and some of the size and athletic ability we have in the forwards we have some good options building now,\" said Lancaster. \"If you put Tom Croft back into the equation along with some of the young lads coming through, we should have a good pack for a while.\"</p><p>Corbisiero and his Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley are also under consideration to start against the strong-scrummaging Pumas but Geoff Parling, a Test Lion against Australia in the summer, looks set to miss out again in the second row as Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury prepare to be reunited for a second week in a row. Mako Vunipola is recovering from a bang to the knee and Marland Yarde has a sore hip but both are expected to be fit for the weekend.</p><p>The maturing Lawes also reckons England are making strides and thinks the Wallaby victory will prove significant in terms of boosting morale.</p><p>\"As a team it was really good to get the win because we could easily have lost. To not play well and win against an experienced side like that is promising. There's a hell of a lot more to come.\"He also senses England are developing a set of forwards who, physically, can stand toe to toe with anyone. \"When you have got one big hitter in a team it can make a difference. When you have two, three and four big hitters, sides really start to think about who they are going to be running at?</p><p>\"I would probably be the smallest enforcer in the world but I've always had the mindset that you give your body to the fans, to the rugby and the team. What happens, happens. I am not going to back out of a tackle because a guy is bigger.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421641901|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|df0296ffdbd44f0ead1df2cb82c82311f885872f -->",

        "body":"<p>Favourite Fiorente rode to Melbourne Cup victory under Australian jockey Damien Oliver in front of a full house at a sunny Flemington racecourse.</p> <p>The Gai Waterhouse-trained five-year-old, who took full advantage of a good barrier draw, stormed down the home straight to pip Red Cadeaux by three-quarters of a length in front of over 100,000 spectators.</p> <p>In one of the most open races in recent Cup history, Fiorente&nbsp;held off the tough field to become the first favourite, at 6-1, to win since Makybe Diva triumphed in&nbsp;2005.</p> <p>The Irish stallion went one better than his second place in last year's race, proving too strong for his rivals in the final 200m of the 3,200m course. It was Oliver&rsquo;s third Melbourne Cup victory, while Waterhouse &ndash; one of the most prominent figures in Australian racing - picked up her first win in the \"race that stops a nation\".</p> <p>Red Cadeaux, who started at 60-1, mirrored his performance in 2011 by coming in second, with Mount Athos third. The results prolonged British-trained horses' frustration in&nbsp;the Cup, in which victory remains elusive. Simenon finished fourth and and a third British-trained horse Dandino fifth. With the top five all hailing from foreign climes, it was left to Australian Fawkner to break up the international domination with sixth.</p> <p>Brown Panther, owned and bred by former England footballer Michael Owen and the subject of much interest before the race, claimed eighth behind Ethiopia.&nbsp;But following Fiorente&rsquo;s heroics, focus was firmly on the winner, Oliver and Waterhouse.</p> <p>\"It&rsquo;s amazing, it&rsquo;s a dream come true,\" Oliver told Channel Seven. \"I&rsquo;m so rapt that I could be part of Gai&rsquo;s first one. She&rsquo;s done so much for racing and it&rsquo;s a great honour for me to help bring home her first one.</p> <p>\"Gai was one of the first people to get behind me when I came back and I can&rsquo;t thank her enough for helping me get going again and we have been a great team together.\"</p> <p>Waterhouse was equally congratulatory to her jockey.</p> <p>\"He rode him a treat,\" Waterhouse said. \"He got back to about 12th and it was quite a solidly run race and then he just kept tracking up and tracking up. He was just fantastic, it&rsquo;s a dream come true.\"</p> <p>Apart from the jubilation in the winner's enclosure, there was also sadness after it emerged that the Aga Khan's five-year-old French mare Verema had to be put down after the race.</p> <p>\"It is with regret that we confirm that Verema had to euthanised after suffering a fracture to its right foreleg during the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup,&rdquo; Dr Brian Stewart,&nbsp;Racing Victoria's head of veterinary and equine welfare, said.</p> <p>\"This was an unfortunate accident that happens infrequently in racing and our sympathies are extended at this time to the Aga Khan, Alain de Royer Dupre and the connections of Verema.\"</p> <p>Pre-race, there was a whiff of controversy when previous winner Dunaden and another Waterhouse-trained horse, Tres Blue, were found to have been treated for ailments on race morning.</p> <p>Race officials cleared both horses to compete, despite treatments of any kind being outlawed on race days.</p> <p>\"We're satisfied that these horses are drug free,\" chief steward Terry Bailey said. \"We're satisfied that, particularly on our veterinary advice, no prohibited substances have been involved.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421667732|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|6ebce8a091bd6ecf72ca3f0a1e882e999dc9a9cd -->",

        "body":"<p>England are to work with Leeds to support Zak Hardaker who has pulled out of the World Cup for personal reasons.</p><p>The 22-year-old centre or full-back did not play in either of England's first two matches and his absence from  at Huddersfield was put down to illness by the coach, Steve McNamara.</p><p>A statement from England said: \"Due to personal issues, Zak Hardaker is unable to commit to the England Rugby League programme and has informed the England RL management team that he wishes to withdraw from the squad and will not play any further part in Rugby League World Cup 2013.\"</p><p>Hardaker's withdrawal leaves England with a squad of 23 for the last group game against Fiji in Hull on Saturday and the knockout stages.</p><p>McNamara had been angered by speculation that Hardaker was set to become the second player to be thrown out for a breach of discipline and, in an interview with the BBC before the kick-off against Ireland, accused the media of \"making up stories to try to disrupt my squad\".</p><p>Hardaker was thought to be among the group of players who broke an alcohol ban in the aftermath of England's shock defeat by Italy in a warmup match at Salford on 19 October.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/22/gareth-hock-england-rugby-league-world-cup\" title=\"\">second-row forward Gareth Hock</a>, who was expelled from the tournament after sleeping in and missing the following morning's recovery session, revealed in a television interview that \"six or seven\" players were involved in the drinking session and claimed McNamara had told him they would also be punished.<strong> </strong></p><p>The prop forward James Graham was a notable absentee when McNamara named his team for the World Cup opener against Australia in Cardiff but returned to face Ireland.</p><p>Hardaker won his only cap as full-back in the absence of Sam Tomkins for the opening match of the 2012 autumn international series against Wales in Wrexham, where he scored two tries in an 80-12 victory.</p><p>He fought his way into contention for a World Cup spot with a man-of-the-match performance in England Knights' 52-16 win over Samoa last month but was not selected for the game against Australia.</p><p>Hardaker, who joined Leeds from Featherstone as a three-quarter before making a successful switch to full-back following the departure of Brent Webb, was seen as a potential centre partner for his Rhinos' team-mate Kallum Watkins but two impressive displays by Leroy Cudjoe look to have secured him the No4 jersey.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642314|2013-11-05T11:23:00Z|b04ebb74ab7d4c6d52ecebd02c02083c04349a6b -->",
