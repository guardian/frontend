Dip into any bike website and the word &quot;stiffness&quot; occurs with such alarming regularity you&apos;ll be clearing your search history. Either way, &quot;structural rigidity&quot; is essential – a stiffer frame yields a better power transfer with each stroke (phnaar).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">The Idol</a>, made of Super Hi-Modul carbon fibre, is both rigid and virtually weightless – the holy grail of bike building. Lift it with your finger and it&apos;s more hologram than bike. The mix of tube shapes blends aerodynamics with power and good looks with comfort. The slim rear stays feed into the top tube like the straining tendons of an athlete&apos;s neck. The gear and brake cables are all internally routed, which keeps the lines clean and uncluttered. The Idol comes with an 11-speed <a href=\"http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Campagnolo</a> Athena groupset. &quot;Oh, a Campag…&quot; muttered my neighbour reverentially. &quot;So mechanical…&quot;</p> <p>I tested the Idol on the Surrey hills in last Sunday&apos;s London Cycle Sportive. On the flat it unfurled itself with pace and precision. On the hills it turned me into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/mar/07/cycling.features\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>… Well, you&apos;ve got to have an &quot;idol&quot;. But best of all, it was so comfortable. It&apos;s not often you climb off a bike after 100 miles with a bottom that isn&apos;t the bright pink of the Maglia Rosa. If I had the money I&apos;d buy this bike in a shot.</p> <p>For more information on the De Rosa, go to <a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">i-ride.co.uk</a></p> <h2>Capital ride</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-436889175\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400076502328/FT-cycle-ride-011.jpg\" alt=\"FT cycle ride\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right, bring on Box Hill: a competitor in the London Cycle Sportive.  Photograph: Matt Alexander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keen cyclists from the mean streets of south London are a familiar sight on the leafy hills of Surrey, but last Sunday&apos;s second annual <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/london-cycle-sportive\" title=\"\">FT London Cycle Sportive</a> turned the quite lanes into a busy cycle track. Torrential rain and gale-force winds threatened to de-rail the ride, I even checked the website before I left home in the vain hope that the event would be cancelled. But cyclists are a hardy bunch and it was clearly going to take more than rain and 30mph gusts to send us back to bed. In the end almost 2,300 turned out to tackle either the 48km, 100km or 100-mile distances of the sold-out sportive organised by Human Race in support of Access Sport. As I was on the De Rosa (reviewed above) it seemed the least I could do was to tackle the longer loop. We started at 7.30am in Dulwich Park, puzzled dog walkers wondering what was going on as hundreds whirred out of the gates, before climbing up towards Crystal Palace and then along the edge of the North Downs with amazing views over Kent and Surrey. As always it is a surprise just how quickly London goes green when you are on two wheels whisking along empty Sunday-morning roads. Eventually we returned through the suburbs and were rewarded with a victory lap of the Herne Hill velodrome – the one used in the 1948 London Olympics and now being restored by the <a href=\"http://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/friends/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. It was a great and testing day – competitive yet filled with camaraderie. The London Cycle Sportive is part of the Human Race Sportive Series. The next event is the Chiltern 100 on 1 June.

Called <em>Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist</em>, it explores the startling truth behind his remarkable descent from being among the finest athletes on earth to his tragic end in a sport riven by intrigue. Based on two years of extensive research and inspired by Matt Rendell&apos;s excellent book <em>The Death of Marco Pantani</em>, the film combines scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani&apos;s friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. Known as Il Pirata thanks to his head scarf and gold hoop earrings, the film celebrates the rise of a man born in 1970 to a humble family in Cesanatico in northern Italy to become the most successful, flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era. In 1998, he won both the Tour de France and Giro d&apos;Italia – he was the last man to accomplish the titanic feat. Yet, less than six years later, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room – destroyed by the sport to which he had given so much. It&apos;s a sad, humbling film which shines a light on the extraordinary pressures the riders faced at the height of the doping scandals.
