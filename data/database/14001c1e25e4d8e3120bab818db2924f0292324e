        "body":"<p>Glastonbury has announced the lineup for this year, and about bloody time.  As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself.

        "headline":"Glastonbury 2013 lineup proves: you can always get what you want",
        "body":"<p>If it's anything like their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/nov/26/rolling-stones-o2-arena-review\" title=\"\">flatly brilliant 50th anniversary shows</a> last year, the Rolling Stones' success in the Saturday night slot at Glastonbury looks guaranteed.</p><p>Anyone who enjoyed the guest appearances by former members may note with interest that Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings are also performing at the festival, on the Acoustic stage.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Stones are a slightly surprising booking for the festival. For one thing, Glastonbury famously doesn't pay the kind of sky-high fees that you can expect at similar events; and the Stones are famously keen on the business of making money. For another, you would expect the band to have started taking a rather dim view of festivals with an ostensibly hippyish aura to them around the time they launched into Sympathy for the Devil at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/may/17/woodstock-altamont-40th-anniversary-hippie-generation\" title=\"\">Altamont</a> in 1969.</p><p>Even so, perhaps the most striking thing about this year's Glastonbury bill isn't so much the appearance of Mick Jagger on Worthy Farm as its sheer diversity. You could argue that the main-stage lineup feels a little safe, majoring in mainstream guitar rock, pop-rap and singer-songwriters, with Kenny Rogers in the traditional elder statesman slot.</p><p>There certainly isn't anything there destined to cause the kind of controversy provoked by the appearance of Jay-Z or Beyoncé in previous years. But the sheer size of Glastonbury means you seldom get the most out of it by staying put in front of the main stage for the weekend. This year's bill rather invites you to head off and explore.</p><p>If you think the appearance of the Stones represents an unacceptable capitulation to nostalgia, you can always take yourself off to see post-dubstep stars <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/chase-and-status\" title=\"\">Chase &amp; Status</a> on the Other stage.</p><p>If you find Mumford &amp; Sons' brand of tweed-clad, bunting-strewn folk rock a little too twee for its own good, and the notion of them headlining over Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds too much to bear, then provocative and adventurous R&amp;B auteur <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/25/weeknd-review\" title=\"\">The Weeknd</a> is playing at the same time on the West Holts stage, an impressive booking, given that his next UK appearances are in arenas.</p><p>Furthermore, the experimental electronic duo Fuck Buttons – whose thrillingly intense music exists resolutely outside the mainstream, despite its <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/09511-fuck-buttons-played-in-olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">unexpected appearance during the Olympics opening ceremony</a> – will be over on the Park stage.</p><p>If Arctic Monkeys don't appeal, then you've got a choice of, among other things, disco pioneers Chic or Portishead, the latter a genuinely superb live band whose music has become ever more leftfield over the years.</p><p>Elsewhere, the dance lineup is strong (Disclosure, Rudimental and Skream and Benga) while the festival's take on pop tends to the admirably skewed: Beyoncé's younger sister Solange  and AlunaGeorge are artists unafraid to experiment. Hip-hop is never normally Glastonbury's strongest suit, but this year it variously boasts Nas, Azaealia Banks and the Odd Future frontman Tyler, The Creator – as well as the dancehall act Major Lazer.</p><p>You'd be hard pushed to argue the lineup is anything other than eclectic: armed with a certain resolve and a willingness to tramp around the vast site, you can always get what you want, whatever Saturday night's headliners may tell you.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406348741|2013-04-04T15:58:59Z|07715a68635a59d8ee56c2ddf9068f7d02b81f62 -->",

        "headline":"Glastonbury 2013: Rolling Stones 'can't wait' to headline",
        "body":"<p>After months of rampant rumour and febrile speculation the organisers of this summer's <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Glastonbury</a> have confirmed that the Rolling Stones will headline the festival in June.</p><p>\"It is about as big a coup as we ever thought would be possible,\" said Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis. \"It is something we never thought we'd be able to pull off – a dream booking. We've tried or talked about getting the Rolling Stones to play Glastonbury throughout my entire life – I can't remember a year it hasn't been wished upon.\"</p><p>The band, who last year marked their 50th anniversary with concerts in London, New York and New Jersey, will be Glastonbury's headline act on Saturday night.</p><p>They are the biggest name in a bill that will also see Arctic Monkeys headlining on Friday and Mumford &amp; Sons taking to the Pyramid stage on Sunday. Other names on the main stage include Dizzee Rascal, Primal Scream, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Elvis Costello, Rita Ora and man of the moment Ben Howard, the winner of best breakthrough and best male solo artist at last month's Brit awards.</p><p>Around 200 performers have been announced for the festival but it is three words – the Rolling Stones – which leap out from the list.</p><p>The rumour mill has been at full throttle since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/16/keith-richards-glastonbury\" title=\"\">Keith Richards last year said there would be more to come</a> after the band's five 50th anniversary concerts in London and the US.</p><p>He told BBC 6 Music: \"On a good day, if the weather's fine, [Glastonbury] is an interesting proposition.\"</p><p>Then in February Ronnie Wood said he would twist his bandmates' arms until they agreed to play Glastonbury. He told journalists: \"Wouldn't it be nice. We've got a meeting next month and that's going to be my first question to them. It's something I've always been interested in. I'm going to twist their arms.\"</p><p>Evidently it worked. Mick Jagger said on Wednesday: \"Can't wait to play Glastonbury. I have my wellies and my yurt.\"</p><p>Wood said: \"I've been using all my persuasive charm on the boys for a few weeks now, really pleased to be doing it, can't wait to be getting out on that stage at Worthy Farm.\"</p><p>Richards said: \"We all had such a ball last year, and the energy between the band is so good, we can't wait to play Glastonbury, see you on a summer's day in England.\"</p><p>Eavis said it had been a \"straightforward booking\". Of the rumours, some of which have been of the \"it's on, it's off' variety, Eavis said: \"It's rumoured every year, but we've never even really had a serious conversation about it until this year.</p><p>\"It is a major coup for us and it so exciting to be able to say they are playing, it is such an honour to have them. I get the sense they are excited too, there's been a real buzz about it from both camps.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Some final tweaking going on here at the farm... <a href=\"http://t.co/8fhoiYl5HZ\" title=\"http://twitter.com/emilyeavis/status/316978567550484482/photo/1\">twitter.com/emilyeavis/sta…</a></p><p>&mdash; Emily Eavis (@emilyeavis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilyeavis/status/316978567550484482\">March 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>She said getting the Stones was the kind of thing that kept her awake at night, thinking: \"God, if this is possible we've really got to try to make it happen. It has seemed such a shame that they haven't done Glastonbury but we had to wait until they were ready for it. This is the right time, the right time for them and the right time for us.\"</p><p>This year's festival sold out in record time, an almost absurd one hour and 40 minutes after tickets went on sale last October. About 135,000 people will attend.</p><p>Arctic Monkeys, who are expected to release their fifth album this year, are returning to Worthy Farm after last appearing in 2007. Eavis said she was delighted they were back: \"They are one of our great British bands.\"</p><p>On the Sunday night it will be Mumford &amp; Sons, which is particularly pleasing, said Eavis, because it was only four years ago that they were playing at 11am on the Park stage. \"That's always really exciting and really important for us to have those bands coming through to do these huge slots and make that transition to becoming a headlining band. It has been an important part of our history.\"</p><p>Eavis said it felt \"particularly British\" this year, in contrast to previous years that have seen big American headliners such as Beyoncé in 2011, Scissor Sisters and Stevie Wonder in 2010, Jay-Z in 2008 and the Killers in 2007.</p><p>In the acoustic tent this year will be artists including Sinead O'Connor, Martha Wainwright, KT Tunstall, Lucinda Williams, Stevie Winwood and the Proclaimers.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-402590597\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/1/17/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011/130118GlastonburyBestOf2011.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>One unquestionably big US star will be there on Sunday, however, with country and western giant Kenny Rogers filling the teatime slot, possibly with guests. At 74, he seems to be the oldest star on the bill, older than even the Rolling Stones (Jagger and Richards will celebrate their 70th birthdays this year while Stones drummer Charlie Watts is 71 and Wood 65).</p><p>Glastonbury returns after a two-year gap, having timed its regular \"fallow year\" to coincide with the Olympics in 2012. \"We are coming back with a lot of energy and excitement and enthusiasm,\" said Eavis. \"We all feel really fired up.\"</p><p>• Glastonbury 2013 runs from 28-30 June.
