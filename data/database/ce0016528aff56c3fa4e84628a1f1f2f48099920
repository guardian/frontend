McCain is perhaps the loudest voice in US politics in favour of intervention on behalf of the Syrian rebels. Yesterday, he said that that the president should threaten to take out Assad, warning that &quot;pinprick&quot; cruise missile strikes are unlikely to have much effect. He also warned against the possibility of Congress defying the president.&nbsp;</p> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-obama-meet-mccain-over-support-military-action-live?commentpage=1#block-5224796ce4b0c622abecf4c6\"><strong>Russia has warned that a planned Geneva&nbsp;peace conference to end the conflict in Syria could be put off &quot;forever&quot; if the US goes ahead with military action, as it was reported that Russia&nbsp;is sending a reconnaissance ship to the eastern Mediterranean</strong>.</a>&nbsp;Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who issued the warning about Geneva, also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-obama-meet-mccain-over-support-military-action-live?commentpage=1#block-5224445de4b074ec233921c7\">described the evidence shown to Moscow by the US alleging&nbsp;that the Syrian regime was behind an alleged chemical weapons attack is &quot;absolutely unconvincing&quot;</a>&nbsp;and said that the US has refused to share some information, saying it is classified.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-obama-meet-mccain-over-support-military-action-live?commentpage=1#block-5224959ee4b0b6f34d589f4a\">Russian members of parliament will urge the US Congress not to approve military strikes on Syria</a></strong>, the speaker of the upper house of parliament told President Vladimir Putin today.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament has spoken. The government has absolutely no plans to go back to parliament. In response to the use of chemical weapons, the government made the case for a robust response. It put before the house the joint intelligence committee paper.

Parliament has made clear its will that there be no British involvement in military action and we will respect that.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/egypt-judges-recommend-dissolving-brotherhood\"><strong>A judicial official says a panel of judges has recommended the dissolution of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest political group, from which ousted President Mohamed Morsi hails</strong></a>.&nbsp;The panel said today in a recommendation to Egypt's administrative court that the Brotherhood has operated in violation of the law.The recommendation isn't binding to the court, which holds its next hearing on 12 November.

Welcome to Middle East Live.</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/obama-seeks-syria-support-from-former-foe-mccain-13273.html\"><strong>President Barack Obama is meeting Senator John&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>McCain</strong></strong><strong> at</strong><strong> the White House, today hoping his foe in the 2008 presidential election will help sell the idea of a US military intervention in&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>Syria</strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;.</strong></a> The meeting is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama is not doing enough to punish&nbsp;Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, which the US says was behind an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that it claims included sarin gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children. McCain is perhaps the loudest voice in US politics in favour of intervention on behalf of the Syrian rebels. Yesterday, he said that that the president should threaten to take out Assad, warning that &quot;pinprick&quot; cruise missile strikes are unlikely to have much effect. He also warned against the possibility of Congress defying the president.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/us-members-congress-syria-briefing\"><strong>After a</strong><strong> classified briefing was held on Capitol Hill yesterday, </strong><strong>it was clear that the Obama administration could not be sure of the outcome of the vote on military action.</strong></a> In particular, Obama could not count on his own party to deliver the votes. &quot;I don't know if every member of Congress is there yet,&quot; said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat who said she would vote no on authorising a military strike. &quot;The room was sceptical,&quot; said Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/obama-strike-syria-congress-kerry\"><strong>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, expressed confidence that Congress would back Obama but said the president could go ahead with military strikes even without its approval.</strong></a>&nbsp;&quot;We don't contemplate that the Congress is going to vote no,&quot; Kerry said, but he stressed the president had the right to take action &quot;no matter what Congress does&quot;.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/02/ministers-face-questions-chemicals-syria\"><strong>British ministers are to face further questions over the decision to allow the export of substances used to make&nbsp;</strong><strong>chemical weapons</strong><strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</strong><strong>Syria</strong><strong>, months after the country descended into civil war. </strong></a>In a letter to the business secretary,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a>, to be sent on Monday, a member of the House of Commons' committee on arms export controls will demand to know who was allowed to sell the chemicals and what other licences for the export of dangerous materials to Syria have been granted.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279620/Pressure-on-Cameron-for-new-vote-on-Syria-strikes.html\"><strong>David Cameron is under increasing pressure to return to parliament for another vote on British military action against Syria after the US postponed missile strikes for at least a week, the Daily Telegraph writes.&nbsp;</strong></a>Lord Howard, a former Conservative leader, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, and Lord Ashdown, a former Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday led calls to vote again. The London mayor, and potential future Tory leader, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279546/The-delayed-attack-on-Syria-is-good-for-Britain-and-the-PM.html\">Boris Johnson, writes in the Telegraph</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is new and better evidence that inculpates Assad, I see no reason why the government should not lay a new motion before Parliament, inviting British participation.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416301924|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|0117263fdd8241d690e25615f20fa31ab60e46ea -->",

        "body":"<p>Firefighters in California gained ground on Monday against a massive wildfire burning part of Yosemite National Park, although complete containment may be weeks away, officials said. </p><p>Crews working through the night got an edge on the so-called Rim Fire, a 350-square mile (906-square km) blaze that has charred the California park's Northwest, said Andrea Capps, spokeswoman for the Rim Fire command center. They connected containment lines near the fire's northwestern and western borders, where most of the 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze are located, she said. </p><p>The fire was 60% contained by early Monday, a 15% increase from the night before. </p><p>\"Last night is when it all really tied together,\" Capps said. \"It's looking really good over there right now. They're calling that containment line secure.\" </p><p>Despite the jump in containment, Capps said fire analysts estimate that it could take until 20 September to contain the Rim Fire fully. Steep terrain and high, unpredictable winds will likely pose the main challenges in digging and burning containment lines around the blaze. </p><p>\"The majority of the containment lines will probably be really strong by the middle, end of this week, but they just want to give themselves enough time to make sure it's fully contained,\" Capps said. </p><p>Wet weather expected in the area on Monday raised hopes, but the possibility of thunderstorms kept officials wary. </p><p>\"Rain is good, but the winds that come with the pressure changes with the thunderstorms could lead to some unpredictable [fire] behavior,\" Capps said. \"We have had a few sprinkles this morning, and so we're all waiting to see what happens.\" </p><p>While the majority of the fire was burning on Stanislaus National Forest, 60,214 acres or about 27% of the fire has crossed the Yosemite National Park border. </p><p>The massive blaze has scorched an area larger than many US cities and is the fourth-largest on record in California, burning more than 220,000 acres (89,000 hectares) over the past two weeks. </p><p>Over the past several years, wildfires in the US West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416369867|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|ab9bcb5416f192d3d392798b35d4fdd5e9dc953b -->",

        "body":"<p>Syrian military commanders are continuing to redeploy forces away from sensitive sites  ahead of a postponed US air strike that many in Damascus believe is still likely.</p><p>Residents of the Syrian capital said on Monday that troops had moved into schools and universities, which officials calculate are unlikely to be hit if Barack Obama orders an attack following a congressional vote next Monday.</p><p>After a week of deep anxiety, his declaration that he would ask Congress to debate his plans to attack led to intense relief in the past 48 hours among many in Damascus, and well beyond.</p><p>Damascenes reported more checkpoints than usual in regime-held areas, but said the capital continued to function as it had during the past two years of ever more entrenched war. In rebel-held districts, where siege and deprivation have bitten deeper, locals claimed a sense of despair had descended after Obama's speech.</p><p>\"They were so close to doing something,\" said Umm Latifa, the widowed head of a household of six children in east Damascus. \"Anything to make [the regime] scared would have been a blessing.\"</p><p>In Beirut, where last week's buildup was also acutely felt, the streets were at their busiest in several weeks and a palpable air of tension appeared to have lifted slightly. But by nightfall on Monday, reminders of what might lay ahead resurfaced as Lebanese media carried reports of Hezbollah ordering thousands of its members to switch off their phones and report to fighting positions.</p><p>The reaction to a strike from the powerful Shia militia, a resolute ally of the Assad regime, will be instrumental in determining whether the stated US goal of a narrow operation can be achieved.</p><p>Many in Lebanon fear that some form of retribution from Syria's allies is inevitable, unless they are convinced that the propaganda value of riding out a short, sharp attack that changes little is higher than the cost of not responding.</p><p>\"This is a very big decision for Hezbollah – make that Iran,\" said a Lebanese political leader who did not want to be named. \"They want to create the impression that it's all on the line for the Americans. But it's bluff at this point. A game with very high stakes.\"</p><p>Their fates long seen as indelibly tied, Lebanon's fortunes, and the confidence of its residents, have risen and fallen roughly in line with those of the Syrian government. Two large car bombs in Tripoli, Lebanon, and a relatively rare rocket attack against Israel quickly followed the suspected chemical weapons attack in Damascus of 21 April, prompting some Beirut-based political foes of the Assad regime to suggest the attacks were planned as a diversion.</p><p>The Lebanese Internal Security Forces have charged two clerics in the north, who they allege had confessed to dealings with Syrian intelligence figures in the days before the blasts and knew that the two bomb-laden cars had been driven to Tripoli from the Syrian city of Tartus.</p><p>They have also charged in absentia the head of Syria's General Intelligence Bureau, General Ali Mamlouk, as well as a junior intelligence officer.</p><p>It emerged on Monday that Russia had dispatched a military reconnaissance ship to the eastern Mediterranean, where five US warships are operating in the lead-up to a widely expected air strike in Syria.</p><p>The Priazovye departed for the Syrian coast on Sunday to keep tabs on the situation there, Russia's state news agency Itar-Tass quoted a military source as saying. Russia's foreign minister has previously said his country was not planning to become involved in a military conflict over Syria.</p><p>\"This is the normal policy of any fleet in the case of an increase in tensions in any ocean or sea,\" the source said.</p><p>The Russian deployment follows the arrival last week of the USS Stout, a guided missile destroyer, sent to relieve the USS Mahan. A US defence official told AFP that both destroyers might remain in the area for now. Along with the Ramage, the Barry and the Gravely, the destroyers could launch Tomahawk missiles at targets in Syria if Obama orders an attack.</p><p>A group of US ships led by the aircraft carrier Nimitz have been deployed in the Arabian Sea.</p><p>On Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said a US strike would put the proposed Geneva II peace conference in serious doubt, Itar-Tass reported.</p><p>\"If the action announced by the president of the US unfortunately occurs, it will put off prospects for the forum for a long time, if not for ever,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>Lavrov said Moscow remained unconvinced by US allegations that the Assad regime was behind the chemical attack after a meeting between the US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, and a senior Russian diplomat. The material presented by the US contained no facts and \"absolutely does not convince us\", Lavrov said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416366273|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|7580b7b2c8406ad4c0f135a2930c02bac060b11b -->",

        "headline":"John McCain: rejection of Syria strikes by Congress would be 'catastrophic'",
        "body":"<p>John McCain, a leading hawk on the issue of American military intervention in Syria, has warned Congress that a \"no-vote\" next week against President Obama's plans for airstrikes would have \"catastrophic\" consequences that would weaken the US for years to come.</p><p>McCain delivered his comments at the front entrance of the White House, having just emerged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-obama-meet-mccain-over-support-military-action-live\">from a meeting with Obama</a>. Flanked by his fellow Republican senator and ally, Lindsey Graham, he said that if Congress withholds its authorisation of military action \"the credibility of this country among friends and adversaries alike would be shredded, and the impact would last not only for this presidency but for future presidencies as well.\"</p><p>He added: \"The consequences would be catastrophic\".</p><p>McCain, a former Republican presidential candidate with an influential voice on US foreign affairs, is seen by the Obama administration as a potentially important intermediary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/obama-persuade-congress-syria-intervention-strikes\">in its intensive push to persuade Congress to swing behind the plan for airstrikes</a>. But it is a sign of Obama's precarious position that even McCain remains uncommitted about his voting intentions next week.</p><p>Asked by a reporter whether he intended to use his influence to convince other senators to back military action, McCain replied: \"I am already talking to a lot of my colleagues, but before I can persuade them I have to be persuaded. The president made sense in a lot of things he said, but we are a long way from a coherent strategy.\"</p><p>A direct question about whether McCain himself would vote in favour of the resolution authorising airstrikes, given his warnings about the catastrophic results of a \"no-vote\", produced a less than definitive answer. \"A weak response [to Syria] would give us a similar dilemma as that would also be catastrophic,\" McCain said.</p><p>McCain has been calling for US military intervention to topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, non-stop since the Syrian civil war began, in March 2011. He has also been a persistent critic of Barack Obama's stance on the Syrian crisis, accusing the president, who defeated him in the 2008 presidential race, of dithering on the issue.</p><p>It is not yet known what Obama told the two senators in their White House meeting, but by McCain's own account of proceedings the president indicated that he was considering a stronger form of intervention in Syria than he has previously indicated. \"We have been given some reason to believe that some very serious strikes may take place as opposed to cosmetic ones,\" the senator said.</p><p>McCain said a successful round of airstrikes could help to \"upgrade\" the Syrian rebel forces and \"degrade\" those of Assad. Any move to destroy Syria's Scud missiles would not only make the deployment of chemical weapons more difficult but also impede the delivery of conventional bombs, and thus give rebel groups a greater fighting chance.</p><p>The figure of John McCain standing on the driveway of the White House and offering less than full support to Obama just days away from crucial Congressional votes also underlines the double bind that the president is in. While Obama has been labouring to convince hawks like McCain and Graham that the planned airstrikes would be serious and robust, he is also struggling to convince (largely Democratic) members of Congress that military action in Syria would be limited and run no risk of miring the US in prolonged conflict.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416367650|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|af3180308b6b562ec24f9d07428101c0f81e53b3 -->",

        "headline":"Vladimir Putin under new pressure over Syria",
        "body":"<p>Vladimir Putin is to be confronted at the G20 summit of world leaders in St Petersburg this week with an array of western intelligence including damning new French evidence directly linking Syrian government forces with a massive and co-ordinated chemical attack on 21 August that led to hundreds of civilian deaths.</p><p>The Russian president will also be urged to show a new diplomatic flexibility and come closer to accepting that the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, has to stand aside.</p><p>A nine-page declassified French intelligence report was released on Monday which claimed to show Assad forces had launched an attack on Damascus suburbs held by opposition units using a combination of conventional weapons and \"the massive use of chemical weapons\".</p><p>The report follows similar documents from British and American intelligence.</p><p>The Nato secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen also insisted that \"personally I am convinced, not only that a chemical attack has taken place … but I am also convinced that the Syrian regime is responsible.\"</p><p>The French intelligence includes satellite imagery showing the attacks coming from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus and targeting rebel-held zones. The report said Assad's forces had since bombed the areas to wipe out evidence.</p><p>\"Unlike previous attacks that used small amounts of chemicals and were aimed at terrorising people, this attack was tactical and aimed at regaining territory,\" the report said.</p><p>Nearly 47 amateur video clips reportedly filmed on the morning of the attack and showing the impact on civilians had been authenticated by French military doctors, according to the intelligence. French evidence gave details of other suspected chemical attacks, in the towns of Saraqib and Jobar in April, which now appeared to have killed about 280 people, the report said.</p><p>The fresh information will also help Barack Obama in his uphill efforts to persuade Congress next week to back a punitive military strike against Assad.</p><p>Assad, in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, again denied the use of chemical weapons. \"Whoever makes accusations must provide proof,\" he said. \"We have challenged the US and France to put forward a single piece of proof. Mr Obama and Mr Hollande have been incapable of doing so. The Middle East is a powder-keg, and today the spark is getting closer.\"</p><p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, also rejected the western intelligence as absolutely unconvincing, saying that there was \"nothing concrete, no geographical co-ordinates or details … and no proof the test was done by professionals\".</p><p>He urged the west to lift the veil of secrecy over its allegations.</p><p>British sources said Putin, host of the G20, will face a concerted challenge at the summit on Thursday and Friday both to accept the intelligence, and propose a fresh diplomatic solution to the crisis by easing his support for the Assad regime.</p><p>Some senior Tories continued to put pressure on Downing Street to say it might be willing to hold a second Commons vote on whether Britain would in some circumstances participate in an attack on Syria in retaliation for the chemical attack.</p><p>Cameron unexpectedly lost the vote last week, but the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell led calls for Britain to keep an open mind. \"I believe taking legal and proportional action will be better than doing nothing – I think it will be more likely to bring this catastrophe to a close,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's why I think it's very important in this rapidly moving situation that we don't rule anything out and it may be, for example, that after lengthy and careful consideration, Congress affirms its support for the President's plans and in the light of that our Parliament may well want to consider this matter further\"</p><p>Advocates of a second vote were briefly given succour when the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said there might be a second vote if there were a very significant change in circumstances.</p><p>But Labour sources poured cold water on a second vote, saying the government had ruled out military action. Apparently raising the bar on military action higher than last week, Labour sources said a second vote could only be countenanced if there was evidence that al-Qaida had got hold of significant stocks of chemical weapons, or there was a direct threat to national security.</p><p>The Labour motion last week was less specific about the trigger for action, and it was not clear if all shadow cabinet members were aware of this hardened stance.</p><p>Labour instead tried to refocus on diplomacy, with the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, telling the Guardian: \"An objective for the G20 summit in St Petersburg should be to establish a Syria contact group, like that which helped end the civil war in Lebanon. Unlike the Friends of Syria group, which was established as a forum for supporting the Syrian opposition, a Syria contact group could bring together those countries that are currently backing opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, of course including Russia, but also key sponsors within the region such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.\" The contact group would work to bring the participants in the two-year civil war to talks in Geneva. Washington, with British backing, has opposed Iranian involvement in talks.</p><p>Plans to stage a second round of peace talks on Syria in Geneva have been stalled since March, partly over the US veto on Iranian attendance, and partly due to disputes in the Syrian rebel forces over the composition of its delegation, and the presence of forces loyal to Assad. Cameron will not have been emboldened by the publication of three separate polls on Monday showing strong opposition to British involvement in military action. A BBC/ICM poll found 71% supporting the Commons decision to stop British involvement in military action with 67% saying that \"the special relationship is not relevant to the modern age\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416366247|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|e64d931b6ebf48155ca44145718448511d4b18b7 -->",

        "headline":"Afghan government abandons Taliban's uniformed victims and their families",
        "body":"<p>When Khodadad and Mohammad Yasim, police officers and cousins, were shot by the Taliban, there was no knock on the front door, no colleagues in uniform to break the news, not even a phone call from the government they died protecting.</p><p>Instead, as days without contact lengthened into a week, their families grew concerned, then uneasy, then terrified about why the pair's mobile phones were switched off. When news filtered out that policemen had been shot in the area where they served, a family group set off for insurgent territory.</p><p>\"We went in a small group so the Taliban wouldn't notice or arrest us. We were very worried, but as our family members were missing, we had to go,\" said Habibullah, a younger cousin of the two men who joined the group heading for Ghazni province, south of the capital.</p><p>As Nato forces withdraw, and Afghan forces take the brunt of the Taliban's assault, casualty rates have soared. Often this summer the weekly toll of police and soldiers has been more than 100 dead, and sometimes it has risen above 150, figures that are alarming both foreign commanders and the military top brass in Kabul, who are focused on morale and recruitment.</p><p>But for those families who lose sons, brothers or husbands in the fighting, the soaring death rate has had a more immediate, painful and expensive impact. Bodies that once travelled back on Nato planes now come occasionally by a rare Afghan air force flight, more often on a slow road journey, and sometimes not at all, forcing families to add a dangerous and bitter search for a loved one's remains to the burden of their grief.</p><p>\"Not just me, all of the police have the feeling that if something happens, the government will not do anything,\" said one police officer who knew the dead cousins. He asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to journalists. \"We only do this job as there are no other options.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most high-profile case so far, taken up by an opposition politician, was that of Yoldash, a police cook. After he was killed by insurgents when he went to fetch water from a stream, his comrades left the body there so long that when <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2013/08/12/the-dead-afghans-tale-how-afghanistans-poorest-are-bearing-the-brunt-of-the-war/\" title=\"\">his family found him, only a blanched skeleton remained</a>.</p><p>That was not a unique incident, some government officials and senior soldiers admit. Top Afghan officials for the first time this year spent much of the Eid al-Fitr holiday visiting the injured, and families of the dead and serving soldiers, as they try to build national support for the security forces and boost morale in the face of the rising death&nbsp;toll.</p><p>Detailing the Eid visit, General Joseph Dunford, the American commander of the International Security Assistance Force, told the Guardian in an interview this week: \"I believe the Afghans … are now as gripped with casualties as we are, and they also recognise that they need to recognise the families of the fallen as&nbsp;well.\"</p><p>Still, for Habibullah's family, those efforts meant nothing. The first hint they had of the bad news about Khodadad and Mohammad was simply silence. \"They were always in touch with us, and suddenly their phones were off for a week, then we heard eight police were dead in their area … the government didn't tell us&nbsp;anything.\"</p><p>The cousins had served in the police for three years, mostly in Ghazni city, which is still relatively safe. But months before their death, an uncle took a job as district prosecutor in Jaghuri, and they agreed to be his bodyguards, considered reliable because of their blood ties.</p><p>It is not clear exactly what happened to the group, who appear to have been ambushed while travelling. Roads through Ghazni province are now often dominated by insurgents and criminals. One member of parliament was kidnapped there earlier this month, and days later another barely survived an ambush that killed her young daughter.</p><p>When the searchers found the men's  remains, it was in an unstable area where scared villagers avoided the outsiders. \"The local people were afraid, they wouldn't come near us or help us. When we arrived, two people told us there were some bodies in an old house, we could check if they were ours, but nothing&nbsp;else.\"</p><p>Death at least appeared to have been merciful in a country where beheading is still used as a form of execution. The bodies had just a few bullet wounds each, and the group carried them down to restive Helmand province, not normally a place of safety, but no one knew them or their jobs there.</p><p>\"When they were burying someone killed by the Taliban in Ghazni [a few weeks earlier], they attacked again, so we were frightened they would target the burial there,\" said Habibullah, who spent at least a month after his return from the gruesome mission crying then laughing uncontrollably, and haunted by the bodies in recurring nightmares.</p><p>The search and funerals cost the family about $4,000 (£2,500), and the government has provided no funds or other support for their widows and children. But the view from the frontlines of Afghanistan's war is apparently so grim that they did not expect it.</p><p>\"Of course they don't pay anything for a dead soldier,\" Habibullah said. \"Every day around the country over 100 people die [in the Afghan army and police]. If the government pays for all their bodies, there will be no money left.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416352445|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|135bf84586c1edb9957089298565198574418f42 -->",

        "headline":"Afghan forces suffering 'unsustainable' casualties, says top Nato commander",
        "body":"<p>Afghanistan's police and army are losing too many men in battle, and may need up to five more years of western support before they can fight independently, the top US and Nato commander in the country has told the Guardian.</p><p>General Joseph Dunford also said in an interview that it was too early to judge whether Nato had been right to end combat operations in Afghanistan this spring. Western forces have officially offered only training and support to the Afghan army and police during the brutal fighting season of the summer months.</p><p>Dunford admitted that Nato and Afghan commanders are concerned about Afghan casualty rates, which have regularly topped more than 100 dead a week. \"I view it as serious, and so do all the commanders,\" Dunford said. \"I'm not assuming that those casualties are sustainable.\"</p><p>The rapidly expanded security forces, now 350,000 strong, did not need help in basic battle skills, Dunford told the Guardian. But they still struggle to support themselves in areas varying from logistics and planning to intelligence-gathering and back-up from planes and helicopters in difficult battles.</p><p>The west officially stopped fighting in Afghanistan in June, shifting to a \"train, advise, assist\" role. Asked whether he thought that transfer was premature, given the problems that Afghan forces face, Dunford said it was too early to judge. \"I think time is going to tell – I don't think you can tell that today.\"</p><p>Dunford's comments highlighted an apparent rift between western politicians keen to wrap up a messy war that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars, and military commanders on the ground who are seeing a newly formed police force and army struggling against a hardened insurgency.</p><p>Barack Obama has made it clear that he does not want American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan after 2014, when all Nato combat troops are due to leave. \"By the end of next year – in just 17 months – the transition will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security and our war in Afghanistan will be over,\" Obama told Marines at their Camp Pendleton base last month. A follow-up Nato training mission, Resolute Support, has been promised, but with a lower profile and far fewer soldiers than the nearly 90,000 still scattered around Afghanistan.</p><p>There is no firm end-date for the assistance however, and Dunford said western troops may need to stay in the country until as late as 2018 to tackle problems from the air force to intelligence.</p><p>\"I look at Afghan security forces development as really kind of three to five years,\" Dunford said. \"That doesn't mean they can't do things today; I'm just talking about before they get to the standard where they may not need assistance and support any more.\"</p><p>Dunford also did not rule out a combat role for Nato troops after 2014, particularly in the form of close air support – the planes and helicopters that aid troops caught in fierce fighting, which is a capacity that Afghanistan is only starting to develop.</p><p>\"There are three words in the mission: train, advise and assist. In a Nato context 'assist' would include things like providing combat support, which is specifically the aviation piece, and a policy decision would have to be made about that,\" he said.\"</p><p>The planned Nato mission, however, will founder without backing from the US, currently negotiating a long-term security deal with Kabul to pave the way for wider western co-operation.</p><p>The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has said he is in no hurry and an agreement could take months. But Washington has set an informal October deadline and warned that if no pact is signed there is a \"zero option\" to send all US troops home. Along with the total departure of western military power, that would be likely to bring dramatic cuts in promised funds for police and army salaries, and given the fragile state of both the economy and the security forces, could pave the way for all-out civil war. Dunford said he was confident there would be a western mission, but the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) needed to be signed within months to reassure both Afghans and their neighbours of US commitment to the country.</p><p>\"We'll have forces here post-2015,\" he said. \"In my mind the BSA is about addressing the environment of uncertainty here in Afghanistan, the fear that people have about 2015 and beyond.\"</p><p>Despite the shortfalls in police and army abilities, heavy security force casualties and a leap of about a quarter in civilian deaths and injuries in the first half of 2013, Dunford said the troops had defied the Taliban, who had started the summer aiming to crush the government's spirit and will. \"The Afghans actually have been resilient,\" he said. \"They have prevented the Taliban from accomplishing their goals. If you look at where the violence is occurring, 80% of the population is secured from violence.</p><p>\"I still believe that we will be able to look back in October … and look at this fighting season as an important fighting season and a foundation for the Afghan forces moving forward.\"</p><p>Progress has come at a heavy cost in lives. The Afghan defence ministry no longer publishes monthly death tolls because of concerns about morale, and the interior ministry said on Monday  that 1,792 police officers had been killed since March, Reuters reported. That was equivalent to losses in the 12 preceding months, so in effect a doubling of the death toll.</p><p>However, Dunford said Afghan and Nato commanders were determined to make sure next year's battles were less bloody for government forces by focusing on better leadership, planning, equipment and training. \"There is a wide range of causes – it's not just enemy activity,\" he said of the high death rate. \"Some of it reflects a very busy summer, but some of it also reflects a force that is still developing capability.\"</p><p>The country's leaders were also doing more to show families of the dead and injured that their sacrifices were valued, he said. Other senior western commanders had warned that the security forces needed to feel stronger backing from the people they were risking their lives to defend.</p><p>\"They are now as gripped with casualties as we are,\" Dunford said. \"What I have seen increasingly is Afghan leaders actually having the same appreciation we have for a need to take care of their people and the families of the fallen.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416364342|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|309744fcb0a0e166a62a2152d5abda16096b8fbc -->",

        "body":"<p>The Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, used his first state-of-the-nation address to defend and promote his government's shakeup of the economy and public sector, which has already triggered demonstrations paralysing the capital, Mexico City, accompanied by outbreaks of violence.</p><p>\"We knew beforehand that it would be complex and that there would be inertia and resistance,\" Peña Nieto said during his speech on Monday, exactly nine months into his administration. \"The great transformation of Mexico is possible, and it has started.\"</p><p>The president put particular emphasis on his education plans, twice celebrating Sunday night's approval by the lower house of congress of a law tying teachers' jobs to evaluation of their performance.</p><p>Opposition to the bill, which now goes to the senate, has been at the centre of two weeks of protests by teachers from some of Mexico's poorest states who are camping out in the city's main Zocalo plaza. They claim the changes unfairly blame them for the substandard quality of state schools and contain a hidden privatisation agenda.</p><p>As well as causing traffic chaos on multiple occasions, the teachers' protests have included blocking access to the international airport for nine hours, and occasional clashes with police. Violence during marches at the weekend was primarily attributed to groups of anarchists that tagged along.</p><p>Teachers' leaders reacted to the passage of the law by announcing a \"teachers' insurrection\" beginning with the promise of massive protests on Wednesday.</p><p>Tension over education policy feeds into deep suspicion of other parts of the new government's shakeup plans, particularly a proposal to open Mexico's state-owned energy section to more participation by the private sector that strikes at the heart of nationalist sentiment. Thousands marched against that proposal on Saturday, with a more ambitious demonstration planned for this weekend.</p><p>As well as promoting his agenda as the road to showing the world that \"this is the year that Mexico dared to take off,\" Peña Nieto used his speech to claim major advances towards pacification of the drug wars still raging around Mexico.</p><p>The president boasted of a 13.7% reduction in homicides since he took office, achieved through improved co-ordination within the different branches of law enforcement, and issued a warning to self-defence groups springing up in some beleaguered states that vigilante justice would not be tolerated.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363211|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|2227a8cb32ff3ca1099432fe8d0d7f82bf8acf44 -->",

It stated Damascus had more than 1000 tonnes of chemical agents making it %E2%80%9Cone of the most important operational stocks in the world%E2%80%9D.

These it said included SCUD C, SCUD B, M500 missiles, bombs and artillery rockets with a range of up to 500 km.\" title=\"\">intelligence dossier</a> that it says shows the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, carried out a &quot;massive and co-ordinated&quot; chemical attack that is believed to have killed hundreds of people.</p><p>A nine-page document, published at around 7pm French time on Monday, stated the information had come from &quot;France's own sources&quot; and was based on a detailed technical analysis of evidence supplemented by &quot;additional elements gathered in co-operation with our principal partners&quot;.</p><p>It was reportedly shown to French ministers and heads of parliamentary groups during an emergency meeting on Syria at the offices of the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, at Matignon early on Monday evening.</p><p>The report and a video, drafted by French intelligence services, purports to show that forces loyal to Assad were responsible for the chemical attack that came from east and west Damascus and targeted rebel-held zones on 21 August, a source told Reuters.</p><p>On Monday, Ayrault summoned the defence and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale and the upper house, the S&eacute;nat, as well as the heads of various parliamentary groups and commissions, to present the &quot;proof&quot; before a parliamentary debate on Wednesday.</p><p>Before the meeting Ayrault had promised &quot;total transparency&quot; on the situation in Syria and evidence that the regime in Damascus had used chemical weapons, reportedly sarin, against its own people.</p><p>Ayrault was reported to have handed over &quot;declassified&quot; documents to those gathered that &quot;clearly identify&quot; that Assad's regime was responsible for the attack.</p><p>The Assad regime denies this. It blames rebel forces for using the chemical bombs.</p><p></p><p>The document states: &quot;Syria has one of the most important operational stocks of chemical weapons as part of an old and diversified programme that has been the subject of surveillance by the French [intelligence] services, and those of our principle partners, for a long time. This programme is one of the primary threats in terms of the proliferation of arms of massive destruction&nbsp;…</p><p>&quot;In its battles engaged against the opposition to the regime of President Assad, Damascus has already employed such arms, namely sarin, in limited attacks against its own population, particularly in April 2013.</p><p>&quot;The analysis of information that we have today leads us to believe that on 21 August 2013 the Syrian regime launched an attack on certain areas of the Damascus suburbs held by opposition units, using a combination of conventional weapons and the massive use of chemical weapons.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The report details the Syrian chemical weapons programme, which it says began in the 1970s with the importing of chemical weapons. It states that Damascus has more than 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents making it &quot;one of the most important operational stocks in the world&quot;. It describes Syria's chemical arsenal as &quot;particularly massive and diverse&quot;, including Yperite, VX (one of the most toxic chemical agents known) and &quot;several hundred tonnes of sarin&quot;.</p><p></p><p>&quot;The sarin and the VX … are partly stocked in a binary form, that is to say kept in the form of two chemical products called precursors, that are mixed just before use. This technique and the associated procedures show a great knowledge of the technology of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.&quot;</p><p></p><p>The report continues: &quot;Damascus is capable of delivering its chemical weapons with a very large range of several thousand vectors.&quot; These, it says, include Scud C, Scud B, M500 missiles, bombs and artillery rockets with a range of up to 500km.</p><p></p><p>&quot;Certain missiles can carry up to several hundred litres of toxic agent.&quot;</p><p></p><p>It adds that intelligence reports suggest the Syrians are looking at new ways of dispersing chemical weapons.</p><p></p><p>&quot;Notably, since the beginning of the conflict, our intelligence confirms the regime's use of munitions carrying smaller amounts of chemical agents adapted for tactical use as they are more accurate and localised.</p><p></p><p>&quot;We cannot rule out that these trials have also been conducted using other types of chemicals normally meant for civil use and employed at a lethal dose.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Under the heading: &quot;The chain of command and the responsibilities&quot;, the report says the Syrian Centre for Scientific Research Study (CERS) is responsible for producing toxic agents for use in war, pinpointing &quot;Branch 450&quot; as being responsible for filling munitions with chemicals and also the security of sites where the chemical agents are stocked. This branch, it claims, is &quot;composed only of Alawite military personnel … distinguished by a high level of loyalty to the regime&quot;.</p><p></p><p>&quot;Bashar al-Assad and certain influential members of his clan are the only ones permitted to give the order for the use of chemical weapons. The order is then transmitted to those responsible at the competent branches of the CERS. At the same time, the army chiefs of staff receive the order and decide on targets, the weapons and the toxic agents to put in them,&quot; it states.</p><p></p><p>The French report claims the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons against areas held by opposition forces &quot;with the aim of taking territory or causing terror&quot; for several months.</p><p></p><p>&quot;The competent French services have recuperated biomedical samples (blood, urine), environmental samples (earth) and materials (munitions) taken from victims or sites of attacks on Saraqeb, on 29 April 2013, and Jobar, in mid April 2013. The analysis carried out confirms the use of sarin.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The document's publication is aimed at swaying public opinion. While France, along with the United States, is pushing for military action against the Assad regime, a poll at the weekend showed that 64% of French people were opposed to a military intervention.</p><p></p><p>After the United Nations sent in an inspection team to verify the claims and counter-claims, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato secretary general, said he was personally convinced that Assad was responsible for the attacks.</p><p>The former French prime minister Alain Jupp&eacute; told French journalists France could not act alone, but must act. He said: &quot;To do nothing would be a dishonour for democracy. On the other side, to act is a very big risk given the international context.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416359897|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|9280525ca1aa8202a0b46f36551a7236f221c634 -->",

        "headline":"Vladimir Putin under new pressure over Syria",
        "body":"<p>Vladimir Putin is to be confronted at the G20 summit of world leaders in St Petersburg this week with an array of western intelligence including damning new French evidence directly linking Syrian government forces with a massive and co-ordinated chemical attack on 21 August that led to hundreds of civilian deaths.</p><p>The Russian president will also be urged to show a new diplomatic flexibility and come closer to accepting that the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, has to stand aside.</p><p>A nine-page declassified French intelligence report was released on Monday which claimed to show Assad forces had launched an attack on Damascus suburbs held by opposition units using a combination of conventional weapons and \"the massive use of chemical weapons\".</p><p>The report follows similar documents from British and American intelligence.</p><p>The Nato secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen also insisted that \"personally I am convinced, not only that a chemical attack has taken place … but I am also convinced that the Syrian regime is responsible.\"</p><p>The French intelligence includes satellite imagery showing the attacks coming from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus and targeting rebel-held zones. The report said Assad's forces had since bombed the areas to wipe out evidence.</p><p>\"Unlike previous attacks that used small amounts of chemicals and were aimed at terrorising people, this attack was tactical and aimed at regaining territory,\" the report said.</p><p>Nearly 47 amateur video clips reportedly filmed on the morning of the attack and showing the impact on civilians had been authenticated by French military doctors, according to the intelligence. French evidence gave details of other suspected chemical attacks, in the towns of Saraqib and Jobar in April, which now appeared to have killed about 280 people, the report said.</p><p>The fresh information will also help Barack Obama in his uphill efforts to persuade Congress next week to back a punitive military strike against Assad.</p><p>Assad, in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, again denied the use of chemical weapons. \"Whoever makes accusations must provide proof,\" he said. \"We have challenged the US and France to put forward a single piece of proof. Mr Obama and Mr Hollande have been incapable of doing so. The Middle East is a powder-keg, and today the spark is getting closer.\"</p><p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, also rejected the western intelligence as absolutely unconvincing, saying that there was \"nothing concrete, no geographical co-ordinates or details … and no proof the test was done by professionals\".</p><p>He urged the west to lift the veil of secrecy over its allegations.</p><p>British sources said Putin, host of the G20, will face a concerted challenge at the summit on Thursday and Friday both to accept the intelligence, and propose a fresh diplomatic solution to the crisis by easing his support for the Assad regime.</p><p>Some senior Tories continued to put pressure on Downing Street to say it might be willing to hold a second Commons vote on whether Britain would in some circumstances participate in an attack on Syria in retaliation for the chemical attack.</p><p>Cameron unexpectedly lost the vote last week, but the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell led calls for Britain to keep an open mind. \"I believe taking legal and proportional action will be better than doing nothing – I think it will be more likely to bring this catastrophe to a close,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's why I think it's very important in this rapidly moving situation that we don't rule anything out and it may be, for example, that after lengthy and careful consideration, Congress affirms its support for the President's plans and in the light of that our Parliament may well want to consider this matter further\"</p><p>Advocates of a second vote were briefly given succour when the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said there might be a second vote if there were a very significant change in circumstances.</p><p>But Labour sources poured cold water on a second vote, saying the government had ruled out military action. Apparently raising the bar on military action higher than last week, Labour sources said a second vote could only be countenanced if there was evidence that al-Qaida had got hold of significant stocks of chemical weapons, or there was a direct threat to national security.</p><p>The Labour motion last week was less specific about the trigger for action, and it was not clear if all shadow cabinet members were aware of this hardened stance.</p><p>Labour instead tried to refocus on diplomacy, with the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, telling the Guardian: \"An objective for the G20 summit in St Petersburg should be to establish a Syria contact group, like that which helped end the civil war in Lebanon. Unlike the Friends of Syria group, which was established as a forum for supporting the Syrian opposition, a Syria contact group could bring together those countries that are currently backing opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, of course including Russia, but also key sponsors within the region such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.\" The contact group would work to bring the participants in the two-year civil war to talks in Geneva. Washington, with British backing, has opposed Iranian involvement in talks.</p><p>Plans to stage a second round of peace talks on Syria in Geneva have been stalled since March, partly over the US veto on Iranian attendance, and partly due to disputes in the Syrian rebel forces over the composition of its delegation, and the presence of forces loyal to Assad. Cameron will not have been emboldened by the publication of three separate polls on Monday showing strong opposition to British involvement in military action. A BBC/ICM poll found 71% supporting the Commons decision to stop British involvement in military action with 67% saying that \"the special relationship is not relevant to the modern age\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416366247|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|e64d931b6ebf48155ca44145718448511d4b18b7 -->",

Welcome to Middle East Live.</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/obama-seeks-syria-support-from-former-foe-mccain-13273.html\"><strong>President Barack Obama is meeting Senator John&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>McCain</strong></strong><strong> at</strong><strong> the White House, today hoping his foe in the 2008 presidential election will help sell the idea of a US military intervention in&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>Syria</strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;.</strong></a> The meeting is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama is not doing enough to punish&nbsp;Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, which the US says was behind an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that it claims included sarin gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children. McCain is perhaps the loudest voice in US politics in favour of intervention on behalf of the Syrian rebels. Yesterday, he said that that the president should threaten to take out Assad, warning that &quot;pinprick&quot; cruise missile strikes are unlikely to have much effect. He also warned against the possibility of Congress defying the president.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/us-members-congress-syria-briefing\"><strong>After a</strong><strong> classified briefing was held on Capitol Hill yesterday, </strong><strong>it was clear that the Obama administration could not be sure of the outcome of the vote on military action.</strong></a> In particular, Obama could not count on his own party to deliver the votes. &quot;I don't know if every member of Congress is there yet,&quot; said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat who said she would vote no on authorising a military strike. &quot;The room was sceptical,&quot; said Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/obama-strike-syria-congress-kerry\"><strong>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, expressed confidence that Congress would back Obama but said the president could go ahead with military strikes even without its approval.</strong></a>&nbsp;&quot;We don't contemplate that the Congress is going to vote no,&quot; Kerry said, but he stressed the president had the right to take action &quot;no matter what Congress does&quot;.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/02/ministers-face-questions-chemicals-syria\"><strong>British ministers are to face further questions over the decision to allow the export of substances used to make&nbsp;</strong><strong>chemical weapons</strong><strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</strong><strong>Syria</strong><strong>, months after the country descended into civil war. </strong></a>In a letter to the business secretary,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a>, to be sent on Monday, a member of the House of Commons' committee on arms export controls will demand to know who was allowed to sell the chemicals and what other licences for the export of dangerous materials to Syria have been granted.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279620/Pressure-on-Cameron-for-new-vote-on-Syria-strikes.html\"><strong>David Cameron is under increasing pressure to return to parliament for another vote on British military action against Syria after the US postponed missile strikes for at least a week, the Daily Telegraph writes.&nbsp;</strong></a>Lord Howard, a former Conservative leader, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, and Lord Ashdown, a former Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday led calls to vote again. The London mayor, and potential future Tory leader, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279546/The-delayed-attack-on-Syria-is-good-for-Britain-and-the-PM.html\">Boris Johnson, writes in the Telegraph</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is new and better evidence that inculpates Assad, I see no reason why the government should not lay a new motion before Parliament, inviting British participation.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416301924|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|0117263fdd8241d690e25615f20fa31ab60e46ea -->",

The defence ministry declined to comment.</p><p>Barack Obama said on Saturday he would seek congressional authorisation for punitive military action against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after what the US says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people.</p><p>Russia says the US has not proved its case and that it believes the attack was staged by rebels to provoke intervention in the  civil war.</p><p>Russia is one of Assad's biggest arms suppliers and has a naval maintenance facility in the Syrian port of Tartous. Moscow opposes any military intervention in Syria and has shielded Damascus from pressure at the UN security council.</p><p>Interfax said the Priazovye would be operating separately from a navy unit permanently stationed in the Mediterranean in a deployment that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said is needed to protect national security interests.</p><p>The defence ministry said last week that new warships would be sent to the Mediterranean to replace others in a long-planned rotation of  ships based there.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416308910|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|f0dfe0c2f7c83b902a1c8b789d12404580be1d88 -->",

        "headline":"Syria crisis: Obama 'has the right' to strike regardless of vote, says Kerry",
        "body":"<p>The US has evidence that sarin nerve gas was used in chemical attacks outside Damascus last month and could go ahead with military strikes against Bashar al-Assad's regime even without the backing of Congress, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has said.</p><p>A day after Barack Obama vowed to put any intervention in Syria to a vote of both the Senate and House of Representatives, Kerry said the administration was confident of winning a motion of the kind that David Cameron unexpectedly lost last week. \"We don't contemplate that the Congress is going to vote no,\" Kerry said, but he stressed the president had the right to take action \"no matter what Congress does\".</p><p>In a round of appearances on the Sunday political shows in the US, Kerry said the evidence of sarin came from samples from first responders who had helped victims of the attacks. \"[We have] blood and hair samples that have come to us through a secure chain of custody from east Damascus – it has tested positive for signatures of sarin. So each day that goes by this case is even stronger,\" he said.</p><p>Kerry said America's evidence for the use of sarin nerve gas had not come from the UN. He gave no further details of the source of the samples, or where or when they had been tested.</p><p>He said the Obama administration's clear preference was to win a vote in Congress, which could come as early as next week, after politicians return from their summer recess on 9 September. He could \"hear the complaints\" about presidential abuse had Obama not gone to Congress, and its backing would give any military action greater credibility: \"We are stronger as a nation when we act together.\" But he added: \"America intends to act.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Britain definitively ruled out any involvement in military strikes against Syria even if further chemical attacks take place. </p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, said Britain would offer only diplomatic support to its allies. \"Parliament has spoken. I don't think it is realistic to think that we can go back to parliament every week with the same question having received no for an answer.\"</p><p>His remarks were echoed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who said he did not think more evidence or more UN reports would have convinced the MPs who voted against intervention. He also ruled out a rerun of the vote.</p><p>Syrian opposition figures have reacted angrily to what they perceive as America's delay in striking against Assad. While the Obama administration insists that military intervention would be a punishment for the chemical weapons attack and a deterrent against future incidents rather than an attempt at regime change, many in the fractured opposition hope it will tip the military balance in their favour after a two and a half year civil war that has killed about 100,000 people.</p><p>Samir Nishar, of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, called Obama a \"weak president\", according to CNN. </p><p>The mood among government forces in Syria was triumphant after Obama's speech, with claims in the state-run media that the west had backed down because it was afraid of a confrontation. </p><p>Syria's permanent representative to the UN, Bashar al-Jaafari, said Obama and Cameron had decided to seek approval before military action because they were looking for a way out after banging the drums of war, the official news agency Sana reported. Jaafari said the two leaders had \"climbed to the top of the tree and don't know how to get down\".</p><p>The UN said it had asked the chemical weapons team to expedite its report into the use of the weapons. \"The secretary general took note of the announcement by President Obama yesterday on the referral to Congress. He regards it as one aspect of an effort to achieve a broad-based international consensus on measures in response to any use of chemical weapons,\" UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said. </p><p>\"Use of chemical weapons will not be accepted under any circumstances,\" he added, asking that the investigation mission \"should be given an opportunity to succeed\".</p><p>Kerry also suggested that Obama will not limit US involvement in Syria's civil war to cruise missile strikes provoked by the use of chemical weapons. The administration \"may even be able to provide greater support to the opposition\", he said. Obama began providing weapons to Syrian rebels after determining earlier this year that Assad had carried out a smaller-scale chemical attack.</p><p>But there is a deep reluctance within the US military to bless even a one-off military strike. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a multi-tour veteran of Iraq, has voiced such fears for more than two years. </p><p>Some leading figures on Capitol Hill predicted that Obama would win. \"At the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion,\" Representative Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, told CNN.</p><p>But others were less sure. Senator Rand Paul, a libertarian Republican, put the chances of an authorisation vote in the House of Representatives at 50-50. \"I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants but the House will be a much closer vote,\" he told NBC.</p><p>Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain said the administration needed a more decisive plan to topple the Assad regime. But he warned against the possibility of Congress defying the president. \"The consequences of a Congress of the United States overriding a decision of the president of the United States on this magnitude are really very serious,\" he told Face the Nation on CBS.</p><p>Meanwhile Labour MP Thomas Docherty, a member of the House of Commons' committee on arms export controls, criticised the government after it emerged that British firms were granted licenses in January 2012 to sell chemicals to Syria that could be used to make nerve gas including sarin.</p><p>The chemicals never left the UK as the European Union imposed tough new sanctions on Assad's regime and the licenses were revoked.</p><p>But Docherty has written to the business secretary Vince Cable demanding to know more details about the deals.</p><p>In his letter he asked: \"How many licenses for the export of chemicals have been issued not only in the period in question but in the wider period since the start of the Syrian civil war?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416267093|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|8305202e37579e3f8049459320f6fca8326d2aa2 -->",

        "headline":"Afghan forces suffering 'unsustainable' casualties, says top Nato commander",
        "body":"<p>Afghanistan's police and army are losing too many men in battle, and may need up to five more years of western support before they can fight independently, the top US and Nato commander in the country has told the Guardian.</p><p>General Joseph Dunford also said in an interview that it was too early to judge whether Nato had been right to end combat operations in Afghanistan this spring. Western forces have officially offered only training and support to the Afghan army and police during the brutal fighting season of the summer months.</p><p>Dunford admitted that Nato and Afghan commanders are concerned about Afghan casualty rates, which have regularly topped more than 100 dead a week. \"I view it as serious, and so do all the commanders,\" Dunford said. \"I'm not assuming that those casualties are sustainable.\"</p><p>The rapidly expanded security forces, now 350,000 strong, did not need help in basic battle skills, Dunford told the Guardian. But they still struggle to support themselves in areas varying from logistics and planning to intelligence-gathering and back-up from planes and helicopters in difficult battles.</p><p>The west officially stopped fighting in Afghanistan in June, shifting to a \"train, advise, assist\" role. Asked whether he thought that transfer was premature, given the problems that Afghan forces face, Dunford said it was too early to judge. \"I think time is going to tell – I don't think you can tell that today.\"</p><p>Dunford's comments highlighted an apparent rift between western politicians keen to wrap up a messy war that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars, and military commanders on the ground who are seeing a newly formed police force and army struggling against a hardened insurgency.</p><p>Barack Obama has made it clear that he does not want American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan after 2014, when all Nato combat troops are due to leave. \"By the end of next year – in just 17 months – the transition will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security and our war in Afghanistan will be over,\" Obama told Marines at their Camp Pendleton base last month. A follow-up Nato training mission, Resolute Support, has been promised, but with a lower profile and far fewer soldiers than the nearly 90,000 still scattered around Afghanistan.</p><p>There is no firm end-date for the assistance however, and Dunford said western troops may need to stay in the country until as late as 2018 to tackle problems from the air force to intelligence.</p><p>\"I look at Afghan security forces development as really kind of three to five years,\" Dunford said. \"That doesn't mean they can't do things today; I'm just talking about before they get to the standard where they may not need assistance and support any more.\"</p><p>Dunford also did not rule out a combat role for Nato troops after 2014, particularly in the form of close air support – the planes and helicopters that aid troops caught in fierce fighting, which is a capacity that Afghanistan is only starting to develop.</p><p>\"There are three words in the mission: train, advise and assist. In a Nato context 'assist' would include things like providing combat support, which is specifically the aviation piece, and a policy decision would have to be made about that,\" he said.\"</p><p>The planned Nato mission, however, will founder without backing from the US, currently negotiating a long-term security deal with Kabul to pave the way for wider western co-operation.</p><p>The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has said he is in no hurry and an agreement could take months. But Washington has set an informal October deadline and warned that if no pact is signed there is a \"zero option\" to send all US troops home. Along with the total departure of western military power, that would be likely to bring dramatic cuts in promised funds for police and army salaries, and given the fragile state of both the economy and the security forces, could pave the way for all-out civil war. Dunford said he was confident there would be a western mission, but the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) needed to be signed within months to reassure both Afghans and their neighbours of US commitment to the country.</p><p>\"We'll have forces here post-2015,\" he said. \"In my mind the BSA is about addressing the environment of uncertainty here in Afghanistan, the fear that people have about 2015 and beyond.\"</p><p>Despite the shortfalls in police and army abilities, heavy security force casualties and a leap of about a quarter in civilian deaths and injuries in the first half of 2013, Dunford said the troops had defied the Taliban, who had started the summer aiming to crush the government's spirit and will. \"The Afghans actually have been resilient,\" he said. \"They have prevented the Taliban from accomplishing their goals. If you look at where the violence is occurring, 80% of the population is secured from violence.</p><p>\"I still believe that we will be able to look back in October … and look at this fighting season as an important fighting season and a foundation for the Afghan forces moving forward.\"</p><p>Progress has come at a heavy cost in lives. The Afghan defence ministry no longer publishes monthly death tolls because of concerns about morale, and the interior ministry said on Monday  that 1,792 police officers had been killed since March, Reuters reported. That was equivalent to losses in the 12 preceding months, so in effect a doubling of the death toll.</p><p>However, Dunford said Afghan and Nato commanders were determined to make sure next year's battles were less bloody for government forces by focusing on better leadership, planning, equipment and training. \"There is a wide range of causes – it's not just enemy activity,\" he said of the high death rate. \"Some of it reflects a very busy summer, but some of it also reflects a force that is still developing capability.\"</p><p>The country's leaders were also doing more to show families of the dead and injured that their sacrifices were valued, he said. Other senior western commanders had warned that the security forces needed to feel stronger backing from the people they were risking their lives to defend.</p><p>\"They are now as gripped with casualties as we are,\" Dunford said. \"What I have seen increasingly is Afghan leaders actually having the same appreciation we have for a need to take care of their people and the families of the fallen.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416364342|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|309744fcb0a0e166a62a2152d5abda16096b8fbc -->",

        "body":"<p>Thai prosecutors have said they will issue an arrest warrant for an heir of the Red Bull energy drink creator who failed to show up to hear charges against him in a fatal hit-and-run case that sparked nationwide outrage.</p><p>Vorayuth Yoovidhya, 28, is accused of being behind the wheel of his Ferrari sports car when it collided with an on-duty policeman in the early hours of 3 September 2012.</p><p>\"Investigators will issue an arrest warrant for the suspect tomorrow and he can be arrested anywhere in Thailand,\" Reuchai Krairerk, a senior public prosecutor at Bangkok South criminal court, said on Monday.</p><p>Vorayuth faces charges of causing death through reckless driving and failing to stop and assist the victim.</p><p>Vorayuth, nicknamed \"Boss\", left Thailand on Thursday for a business trip, said his lawyer, and was unable to travel back to hear the charges against him.</p><p>\"He suddenly fell ill which made it impossible for him to travel back today,\" said his lawyer, Tanit Buakeaw, adding that Vorayuth planned to return to Thailand within three days and would co-operate with prosecutors.</p><p>The Yoovidhyas, ranked Thailand's fourth-richest family in 2013 by Forbes magazine, paid the victim's family $97,000 (£62,000) after the accident, police said.</p><p>The case prompted a backlash in online forums where people questioned the justice system and its leniency towards those with money and connections.</p><p>Vorayuth is the grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, who rose from poverty to become one of Thailand's richest men. Chaleo formulated an energy drink called Krathing Daeng, or Red Bull, that proved popular among labourers and in 1987 he went into business with Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz, who helped turn Red Bull into the world's most popular energy drink.</p><p>Chaleo, who died in March 2012, left his heirs a 49% stake in the drinks brand.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416360464|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|8bfde961dc8f2023e7c91ab17955ceaf66b2ae0e -->",

She succeeded in making the 110-mile (180km) journey through treacherous waters, currents and the constant threat of attack from what she once described as \"Mother Nature on steroids\".</p><p>At lunchtime on Monday Nyad, 64, was just a couple of miles off the coast of Florida, her extreme dream finally within her grasp. Though she was said by her team to be \"really hurting\", she took time out to deliver a euphoric message to her 35-strong support crew.</p><p>She began by saying that she had trouble talking as a result of abrasions in her mouth caused by a silicone mask she has been wearing to protect herself from jellyfish stings and apologised for being hard to understand. Then she said: \"I am about to swim my last two miles in the ocean.</p><p>\"This is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very, very glad to be with you. Some on the team are the most intimate friends of my life and some of you I've just met. But I'll tell you something, you're a special group. You pulled through; you are pros and have a great heart. So let's get going so we can have a whopping party.\"</p><p>In the course of her prolonged struggle to cross the Florida Strait, Nyad has proved herself to be a supreme embodiment of the adage \"perseverance works\". She first attempted the crossing in 1978, then aged 28 and swimming within a shark cage, though she was blown off course and gave up after about 76 miles.</p><p>Her fourth attempt, made in August 2011, was called off early after she was stung in two separate attacks by box jellyfish whose deadly venom has claimed more human lives in the past 50 years than shark bites. Nyad said the stings felt like having her entire body submerged in hot, burning oil. \"I was yelling: 'Fire, fire, fire!'\" she recalled.</p><p>Nyad made clear that this fifth attempt would also be her last – success or failure. She made the 110.36-mile swim without the protection of a shark cage, surpassing the only previous person to negotiate the strait, Susie Maroney, who made the crossing in 1997 with the benefit of the cage.</p><p>She started out at 8.59am on Saturday, jumping into the water at the Marina Hemingway in Cuba with a shout of: \"Courage!\" From there it was front crawl all the way, broken only by feeds every 40 minutes of nutrition gels and water through a tube.</p><p>Even as Nyad came close to achieving her decades-long goal, she was in deep peril. Just hours before she was due to arrive on land, the crew <a href=\"http://www.diananyad.com/blog\" title=\"\">spotted and collected the first box jellyfish</a> of the trip.</p><p>The swimmer wore a specially designed jellyfish suit to offer some protection against the box jellyfish's tentacles, covering all exposed flesh but adding to her burden by slowing her. For added security she used a cream called Sting Stopper on her face and her crew helped steer her safely through the ocean by travelling in front of her and laying a trail for her to follow through un-infested waters.</p><p>After about 46 hours in the water, Nyad had to suffer the disappointment of being told by her team that a change in the currents meant that her final stretch would take much longer to complete than expected. By then she was just 6.5 miles off coast, but tiredness was already setting in.</p><p>Doctors who accompanied her reported that her tongue and lips were swollen – hence the difficulty she had in talking. They were worried about the impact that would have on her breathing, but decided not to intervene and allowed her to go on to make something that had eluded her for so long a reality.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416361390|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|debad30b40140ccc6c7163c042cb6fee6725e872 -->",

        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency spied on the communications of the presidents of Brazil and Mexico, a Brazilian news program reported, a revelation that could strain US relations with the two biggest countries in Latin America. </p><p>The report late Sunday by Globo's news program Fantastico, was based on documents that journalist Glenn Greenwald obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, was listed as a co-contributor to the report. </p><p>Fantastico showed what it said was an NSA document dated June 2012 displaying passages of written messages sent by Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was still a candidate at that time. In the messages, Pena Nieto discussed who he was considering naming as his ministers once elected. </p><p>A separate document displayed communication patterns between Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and her top advisers, Fantastico said, although no specific written passages were included in the report. </p><p>Both documents were part of an NSA case study showing how data could be \"intelligently\" filtered, Fantastico said. </p><p>Justice minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told the O Globo newspaper that the contents of the documents, if confirmed, \"should be considered very serious and constitute a clear violation of Brazilian sovereignty.\" </p><p>\"This [spying] hits not only Brazil, but the sovereignty of several countries that could have been violated in a way totally contrary to what international law establishes,\" Cardozo said. </p><p>Cardozo traveled last week to Washington and met with US vice president Joseph Biden and other officials, seeking more details on a previous, seemingly less serious set of disclosures by Snowden regarding US spying in Brazil. Rousseff is scheduled to make a formal state visit in October to meet US President Barack Obama in Washington, a trip intended to illustrate the warming in Brazil-US relations since she took office in 2011. </p><p>A spokesman for Rousseff would not comment on the new spying allegations. Officials at Mexico's presidential palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>On Monday, the US ambassador to Brazil met with his Brazilian counterpart. Ambassador Thomas Shannon arrived and left Brazil's foreign ministry without speaking to reporters. There was no comment from Brazil's foreign ministry either.</p><p>Snowden, an American who worked as a contractor for the NSA before leaking the documents, currently lives in asylum in Russia. Fantastico said it contacted Snowden via internet chat, and that Snowden said he could not comment on the content of the report because of his asylum agreement with Russian authorities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416333628|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|d2e7ef85df53707f5b2d53e36717c0bac50a10d2 -->",

The USS Stout, a guided missile destroyer, was sent to relieve the USS Mahan, but a defence official told AFP that both ships might remain in the area for now. Along with the Ramage, the Barry and the Gravely, the destroyers could launch Tomahawk missiles at targets in Syria if the US president, Barack Obama, orders an attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, a group of American ships led by the aircraft carrier Nimitz are deployed in the area of the Arabian Sea.</p><p>The US has been preparing for possible air strikes against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in retaliation for an alleged gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people outside Damascus. While the US has blamed the Syrian government, Russia has argued that rebel forces probably staged it to provoke foreign intervention against Assad.</p><p>At a press conference last Monday, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, again denounced any foreign intervention but said Russia was \"not planning to go to war with anyone\" over Syria.</p><p>On Monday, Lavrov said a US strike would put the proposed Geneva II peace conference in serious doubt, Itar-Tass reported.</p><p>\"If the action announced by the president of the United States unfortunately occurs, it will put off prospects for the forum for a long time, if not forever,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>Also on Monday, Lavrov said Russia remained unconvinced of US allegations that the Assad regime was behind the chemical attack after a meeting between the American ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, and a senior Russian diplomat. The material presented by the United States contained no facts and \"absolutely does not convince us\", Lavrov said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416348392|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|720d3bd35143db897435e47ae0b1822dc980bd84 -->",

        "headline":"Afghan government abandons Taliban's uniformed victims and their families",
        "body":"<p>When Khodadad and Mohammad Yasim, police officers and cousins, were shot by the Taliban, there was no knock on the front door, no colleagues in uniform to break the news, not even a phone call from the government they died protecting.</p><p>Instead, as days without contact lengthened into a week, their families grew concerned, then uneasy, then terrified about why the pair's mobile phones were switched off. When news filtered out that policemen had been shot in the area where they served, a family group set off for insurgent territory.</p><p>\"We went in a small group so the Taliban wouldn't notice or arrest us. We were very worried, but as our family members were missing, we had to go,\" said Habibullah, a younger cousin of the two men who joined the group heading for Ghazni province, south of the capital.</p><p>As Nato forces withdraw, and Afghan forces take the brunt of the Taliban's assault, casualty rates have soared. Often this summer the weekly toll of police and soldiers has been more than 100 dead, and sometimes it has risen above 150, figures that are alarming both foreign commanders and the military top brass in Kabul, who are focused on morale and recruitment.</p><p>But for those families who lose sons, brothers or husbands in the fighting, the soaring death rate has had a more immediate, painful and expensive impact. Bodies that once travelled back on Nato planes now come occasionally by a rare Afghan air force flight, more often on a slow road journey, and sometimes not at all, forcing families to add a dangerous and bitter search for a loved one's remains to the burden of their grief.</p><p>\"Not just me, all of the police have the feeling that if something happens, the government will not do anything,\" said one police officer who knew the dead cousins. He asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to journalists. \"We only do this job as there are no other options.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most high-profile case so far, taken up by an opposition politician, was that of Yoldash, a police cook. After he was killed by insurgents when he went to fetch water from a stream, his comrades left the body there so long that when <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2013/08/12/the-dead-afghans-tale-how-afghanistans-poorest-are-bearing-the-brunt-of-the-war/\" title=\"\">his family found him, only a blanched skeleton remained</a>.</p><p>That was not a unique incident, some government officials and senior soldiers admit. Top Afghan officials for the first time this year spent much of the Eid al-Fitr holiday visiting the injured, and families of the dead and serving soldiers, as they try to build national support for the security forces and boost morale in the face of the rising death&nbsp;toll.</p><p>Detailing the Eid visit, General Joseph Dunford, the American commander of the International Security Assistance Force, told the Guardian in an interview this week: \"I believe the Afghans … are now as gripped with casualties as we are, and they also recognise that they need to recognise the families of the fallen as&nbsp;well.\"</p><p>Still, for Habibullah's family, those efforts meant nothing. The first hint they had of the bad news about Khodadad and Mohammad was simply silence. \"They were always in touch with us, and suddenly their phones were off for a week, then we heard eight police were dead in their area … the government didn't tell us&nbsp;anything.\"</p><p>The cousins had served in the police for three years, mostly in Ghazni city, which is still relatively safe. But months before their death, an uncle took a job as district prosecutor in Jaghuri, and they agreed to be his bodyguards, considered reliable because of their blood ties.</p><p>It is not clear exactly what happened to the group, who appear to have been ambushed while travelling. Roads through Ghazni province are now often dominated by insurgents and criminals. One member of parliament was kidnapped there earlier this month, and days later another barely survived an ambush that killed her young daughter.</p><p>When the searchers found the men's  remains, it was in an unstable area where scared villagers avoided the outsiders. \"The local people were afraid, they wouldn't come near us or help us. When we arrived, two people told us there were some bodies in an old house, we could check if they were ours, but nothing&nbsp;else.\"</p><p>Death at least appeared to have been merciful in a country where beheading is still used as a form of execution. The bodies had just a few bullet wounds each, and the group carried them down to restive Helmand province, not normally a place of safety, but no one knew them or their jobs there.</p><p>\"When they were burying someone killed by the Taliban in Ghazni [a few weeks earlier], they attacked again, so we were frightened they would target the burial there,\" said Habibullah, who spent at least a month after his return from the gruesome mission crying then laughing uncontrollably, and haunted by the bodies in recurring nightmares.</p><p>The search and funerals cost the family about $4,000 (£2,500), and the government has provided no funds or other support for their widows and children. But the view from the frontlines of Afghanistan's war is apparently so grim that they did not expect it.</p><p>\"Of course they don't pay anything for a dead soldier,\" Habibullah said. \"Every day around the country over 100 people die [in the Afghan army and police]. If the government pays for all their bodies, there will be no money left.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416352445|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|135bf84586c1edb9957089298565198574418f42 -->",

        "headline":"Election 2013: Kevin Rudd gives passionate defence of gay marriage on Q&A",
        "body":"<p>Kevin Rudd has insisted his views in favour of same-sex marriage are compatible with his Christian faith, saying a literal interpretation of the bible that opposed gay unions would also dictate support for slavery.</p> <p>Challenged by a pastor and Christian radio announcer on the ABC&rsquo;s Q&amp;A program on Monday night as to why as a Christian he did not follow the teaching of the bible that marriage was between a man and a woman, Rudd replied: &ldquo;Well, mate, if I was going to have that view, the bible also says that slavery is a natural condition because St Paul said in the new testament: &lsquo;slaves be obedient to your masters,&rsquo; and therefore we should all have fought for the confederacy in the US civil war.&rdquo;</p> <p>He added: &ldquo;I mean, for goodness sake, the human condition and social conditions change. What is the central principle of the new testament? It is one of universal love, loving your fellow man,&rdquo; Rudd said, during a passionate performance in which he insisted he was still not contemplating losing Saturday&rsquo;s election despite Labor&rsquo;s declining standing in the opinion polls.</p> <p>Rudd seemed to find his campaigning mojo on Sunday at Labor&rsquo;s launch in Brisbane, where he crystallised his pitch to voters into a choice between Labor&rsquo;s commitment to protect jobs and the allegation that the Coalition intended cuts to services, and a plea to voters not to vote for Tony Abbott if they still harboured doubts about the Coalition leader&rsquo;s capacity to lead the nation.</p> <p>Rudd changed his stance on gay marriage before returning to the Labor leadership this year, publishing an essay to explain his views. He has promised to re-submit legislation legalising same sex marriage within 100 days if Labor is re-elected.</p> <p>Abbott believes marriage is between a man and a woman and has said it would be up to the Liberal party room to decide whether, unlike the last vote on the issue, Liberal MPs would allowed a conscience vote on the issue.</p> <p>&ldquo;I do not believe people choose their sexuality; they are gay if they are born gay,&rdquo; Rudd said during Monday night&rsquo;s program. &ldquo;It is how people are built, and therefore the idea that this is somehow an abnormal condition is wrong &hellip; If you accept it is natural and normal to be gay, then it follows from that &hellip; people should not be denied the opportunity for legal recognition ... of their relationship.&rdquo;</p> <p>Rudd said his greatest mistake as prime minister was deferring the original emissions trading scheme, and held up the stimulus package at the time of the global financial crisis as his greatest achievement.</p> <p>But he refused to entertain a question about what he would do if he lost on Saturday, saying he was &ldquo;not going to engage in hypothetical land&rdquo; because he was &ldquo;not in that frame of mind&rdquo;.</p> <p>In implicit criticisms of Julia Gillard&rsquo;s time as leader he said he had never liked the idea of &ldquo;class rhetoric&rdquo; and had always supported a floating carbon price rather than a fixed carbon tax, even though his original emissions trading scheme also began with a one-year fixed price.</p> <p>And Rudd appeared to tone down his attack of the coverage of the election campaign by News Corp papers, saying it was obvious Rupert Murdoch preferred Abbott as prime minister but he had &ldquo;great confidence that the Australian people make up their own mind, they know whether the reporting is balanced and fair, they will work it out for themselves are both sides of politics being put under real scrutiny.&rdquo;</p> <p>He said he believed &ldquo;freedom of the media goes to a lifeblood of a democracy&rdquo;, but rejected the idea of further media regulation, saying that &ldquo;you have to be very careful about getting the government directly involved in the regulation of the media, because where does the slippery slope stop, I am not quite sure.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416313038|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|16a7d21b8ceb5547cf1747bd1a3cbde0d31d4f91 -->",

        "body":"<p>With preparations for this year's Oktoberfest under way and the Franconian medieval festival season in full swing, German traditionalists say a piece of their heritage is threatened by a fad for cheap, \"sexy\" dirndl-style dresses made in China.</p><p>The traditional German costume has its  roots in Franconian and Bavarian culture and the three-piece outfit – usually consisting of a low-cut white blouse, a long skirt and an apron – can cost several hundred euros. When hand-sewn and properly tailored it will last for decades. Many southern Germans still keep either a pair of lederhosen or a dirndl in their cupboards for festivities and special&nbsp;occasions.</p><p>But traditional makers are concerned that a trend among the young for off-the-peg party dirndls is an affront to their heritage. \"Young people aren't necessarily aware of tradition,\" Monika Bürks told the German dpa news agency at a dirndl and lederhosen fair this weekend in the Bavarian town of Greding.</p><p>Unlike her clients, who can pay up to €700 for a custom-fitted costume to be worn at weddings and family celebrations, Bürks said young girls \"just want to look nice and sexy in their fantasy dirndls\".</p><p>Usually dirndls carry distinguishing marks that are specific to a particular region, but cheap imports from China or Bangladesh available on the high street for less than €30 are often a mishmash of several, Bürks complained.</p><p>Purists from the Franconian Fränkische Bund association said they hoped it was just a fad that would run its course. \"At the very latest [the craze will be over] when a dirndl-making factory burns down in Pakistan,\" said board member Joachim Kalb, a long-time critic of the cheap imitation costumes.&nbsp;</p><p>Sandra Abt, of Alpenherz, which sells dirndls made in Germany and Austria, told the Handelsblatt newspaper: \"There are lace aprons from China costing not even a tenth of our aprons, which we only source in Europe.\"</p><p>Traditionalists may take some comfort from the fact that this year's dirndl fashions are said to be heading towards quality materials and pastel shades. After a crop of brash, clashing dresses at last year's festivities, bright and neon colours are an absolute taboo in 2013, according to Abt.</p><p>Short mid-thigh mini-dirndls were also out, she advised: the proper length is a skirt that ends below the knee. Big nostalgic prints are said to be in this year, showing anything from strawberries to farmyard scenes, deer or flowers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416277479|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|20339882e64d0b9ec146bda84a28eca9676dac6f -->",

        "body":"<p>The sun is setting over the sea at Vagator beach and the smell of marijuana drifts from a grubby bar a little way up the road, where the flotsam and jetsam of Goa are gathering for their evening descent into oblivion. A retired western couple pick their way between the cows and the rubbish, pausing to glare grumpily at the young Indian tourists who swoop around them on hired mopeds, whooping and passing bottles of beer.</p><p>Goa is India's good-time state, the hedonistic hippy haven whose promises of sun, sand, cheap beer and drugs transformed it into a magnet for backpackers and budget tourists looking for an alternative to the Spanish costas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/manmohan-singh-indian-economy-speech\" title=\"\">With the collapse of the Indian rupee</a> this year, it has never been more affordable. But the love affair is waning. Years of mismanagement and decline have prompted many British tourists to go elsewhere.</p><p>Good riddance, says Goa. It doesn't want them any more. Nor does it want anyone else on who's on a tight budget, including Indian tourists. Tired of being India's answer to Blackpool, it wants to go upmarket.</p><p>\"The image of Goa is being destroyed,\" says John Lobo, who speaks for owners of the state's popular beach shacks. \"What Goa should try to do is stop cheap Indian tourists as well as cheap foreign tourists. I would say the middle-income plus the rich tourists should be welcome. There are a lot of European tourists who come here who hardly spend any money.\"</p><p>Now, with the season about to get under way, the talk is of a cleanup and a new direction. Drinking hours have been slashed, dance bars banned, raves raided, drinking on the beach forbidden. The ministry of tourism has allocated £7.5m for tourism projects, including a golf course, helicopter tours and a cruise ship terminal. There is talk of oceanariums and theme parks.</p><p>It may be too late. International tourist arrivals are down 23% since 2010. Visa fees have soared this year from £32 to £82, plus a processing fee of £10.20, and even with the collapse of the rupee, tourists are eyeing other Asian beach destinations such as Thailand and Vietnam.</p><p>Figures released by the tourist ministry last week show the state falling behind many of India's less well-known destinations. Tourism grew by only 0.08% in the past five years. Even Bihar, the country's poorest state, recorded a more impressive rise last year. The number of British tourists has fallen from 154,122 in 2010 to 119,891 last year.</p><p>Goa's critics say it has only itself to blame for its predicament and that it has a mountain to climb if it is to attract well-heeled visitors. They argue that successive governments have failed to look after an industry that is now the state's biggest earner. The result is that rubbish is mounting up – huge drifts of it lie at the roadsides – because there is nowhere to dispose of it. The beaches are filthy, strewn with broken glass and soaked in oil discharged by tankers off the coast.</p><p>The state is in the grip of drug and property mafias, and low alcohol prices have drawn in large gangs of men who drink heavily and whose presence makes it feel less safe for local women and female tourists. The Foreign Office travel advisory notice to Britons thinking of visiting Goa warns: \"Throughout Goa there have been reports of drinks being spiked and travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, sexually assaulted or dying. In 2012, 29 British nationals died in Goa. Some of these deaths were attributed to drug/alcohol abuse. There has been a series of high-profile incidents in Goa of alleged rape against foreign nationals, including Britons. Avoid beaches after dark. There is a risk of being attacked by packs of stray dogs, robbed or sexually assaulted.\"</p><p></p><p>There is little confidence in the justice system. Five-and-a-half years after the death of British teenager Scarlett Keeling on Anjuna beach, the stop-start <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/05/keeling-death-police-contradictory-evidence\" title=\"\">trial of two men in connection with her death</a> drags on with no sign of a conclusion.</p><p>John McGinley, a retired Scot living in an apartment complex in the beach town of Calangute, says tourists feel helpless. \"Corruption within the police and their failure to record crimes makes getting justice for foreigners virtually impossible,\" he says, \"because the police quite simply refuse to record crime involving foreigners.\"</p><p>Some of the problems reported in the local papers verge on the bizarre: eunuchs harassing tourists and demanding money on the beaches, and police cutting up sunbeds with chainsaws to clear space on the sand. Many British tourists who normally return year after year have had enough.</p><p>One former bar owner, now back in Britain, says his customers were tired of being taken for granted. \"We found most Goans only want Brits for their money,\" he says. \"We couldn't stand it any longer: people urinating in the streets, constant spitting, and rubbish dumped everywhere. There are lots of our customers who feel the same way and are not going back.\"</p><p>Good riddance, says Lobo, general secretary of the Shack Owners' Welfare Society. Goa needs a better class of tourist, he says, not Indian men who start fights and chase women because they cannot hold their drink, and not parsimonious foreign pensioners. He smiles wryly as he describes two of his typical customers: \"A retired British couple come in every day. The man nurses a single beer, the woman buys nothing, because on the way to the beach they stop off to buy a bottle of water and some pastries from a local shop. When she thinks nobody is looking she stuffs her head into her bag and eats it, then closes her bag.\"</p><p>Others buy one cup of tea, then ask for a separate cup of hot water and share the tea bag between them. \"There are a lot of pensioners coming here,\" he says. \"They cannot afford to live back home, but they are telling me: 'We are retired. We spend the heating allowance that the government gives us – that money is enough for us to buy our accommodation. The pension money is more than enough for us to live.'</p><p>\"It is not that we don't welcome them, but you can't expect everything to be perfect if you don't contribute anything to the running of the state.\"</p><p>Even so, the state authorities now accept that change must come. \"After drugs and prostitution, garbage has proved to be the third-biggest hurdle that is keeping away high-spending tourists from Goa,\" the state's chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, said in a recent speech.</p><p>Parrikar, who previously pledged to rid Goa of garbage within three months of his election last year, now promises that three rubbish treatment plants will open within a year. But most of the projects exist only on paper. A long-delayed airport terminal, finally due to open this month, will do so without a mains sewage connection.</p><p>There are plans to position hundreds of armed guards on beaches to improve security, but when a police superintendent launched a series of drug raids on rave parties, he found himself chastised by a government minister and transferred to traffic duties.</p><p>Actions are harder than words, says Lobo: \"There is a lot of nexus between the politicians and the police and the antisocial activities that are going on. If this nexus between the police and politicians stops, things can change for Goa. India is known all over the world as a corrupt country. This corruption cannot be weeded out in a short time.\"</p><p>The slump in the value of the rupee means more Indians will be taking their hoidays at home this year. That could be a shot in the arm for Goa. But Francisco de Braganca, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, says what it really needs is more tourists who can afford to stay in the state's few five-star hotels.</p><p>\"We need to make Goa a peaceful destination, not an overcrowded destination where the high spending tourist does not wish to be,\" he says. \"Hedonism is not something I would like Goa to be associated with. If that is the view a tourist is holding, I think we are better off without such tourists.\"</p><p></p><p>• The photo caption on this story was amended on 31 August 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416186377|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|6da19787dbba7690d355abcd2463b371bef3157d -->",

        "body":"<p>President Obama began an uphill struggle on Monday to persuade Congress of the need for US military action in Syria, reaching out to hawkish Republicans in the hope of building bipartisan consensus before key votes next week.</p><p>Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been calling for greater intervention to support Syrian rebels for several months, were due to meet the president at the White House on Monday afternoon, to hear his plan for a response to alleged chemical weapons use by government forces. Both Republicans were expected to press the administration to strengthen the language in its proposed military authorisation order and detail what the consequences of the expected missile attack might be for the government of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president.</p><p>But any toughening of his authorisation order may make it harder for Obama to persuade sceptical members of his own party that the US is not seeking \"regime change\" and will not become embroiled in another intractable Middle East commitment.</p><p>Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving Senate Democrat, has already criticised the proposed White House authorisation to use military force as \"too open-ended\". Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, is thought to be drafting revisions that would limit the time frame for action and make it clearer that no US ground troops can be used.</p><p>White House aides held another conference call with Democrat lawmakers on Monday morning, but the mood that followed a similar briefing on Capitol Hill on Sunday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/us-members-congress-syria-briefing\">suggested that substantial scepticism remains among politicians in both parties</a>.</p><p>A growing isolationist wing in the Republican party, led by the libertarian senator Rand Paul, has declared its opposition to military intervention.</p><p>The next key step in Obama's frantic efforts to shore up support will come on Tuesday, when defence secretary Chuck Hagel and secretary of state John Kerry are due to testify in a Senate committee hearing. Lawmakers will want to hear more about what military options are available and what they would achieve, particularly in light of acknowledged scepticism in the Pentagon, expressed most recently by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Martin Dempsey.</p><p>Given scepticism about the possible strikes abroad, on Capitol Hill and in sections of the military, the White House has been working flat out to press its case. Obama, vice-president Joe Biden and the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have been making personal phone calls throughout the Labor Day weekend.</p><p>Meanwhile, Washington is trying to keep up pressure on the Assad government by moving another warship into the Red Sea; four destroyers are already in the Mediterranean. Kerry has also upped his rhetoric in favour of action, claiming in appearances on all the key Sunday political talkshows that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/sep/01/syria-sarin-gas-used-john-kerry-video\">\"signatures\" of sarin gas have been found </a>in samples taken from the scene of the biggest alleged chemical attack, which took place in a suburb of Damascus on 21 August.</p><p>Political campaigning is likely to continue all week, with a vote scheduled in the House of Representatives during the week of 9 September. It is not yet clear when the Senate vote will take place, but Reid has said it would be no later than the week of 9 September.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416352703|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|a0c058408cd74d156011c4c4ca9e9ffe32e4c211 -->",

Of course, there were a lot of problems, especially in the last two years,\" he said, according to the Ansa news agency, hitting out at \"a combination of crows and vipers\".</p><p>\"But this should not cloud what I consider to be a positive record,\" he added. The Italian word <em>corvo</em> (crow) is used pejoratively to describe informants or people who leak secrets.</p><p>The final years of Benedict's papacy were overshadowed by scandal, most prominently the so-called \"Vatileaks\" affair that depicted the Vatican's swollen bureaucracy as a hotbed of conspiracy and cronyism.</p><p>Bertone, who was appointed by Benedict in 2006 to occupy a role often described as the Vatican's prime minister, was blamed for much of the papacy's disfunction and poor decision-making. The German pontiff came under pressure from some senior clerics to fire Bertone, but refused.</p><p>\"I always gave everything but certainly I had my shortcomings,\" said Bertone, 78, on Sunday. \"But this does not mean that I did not try to serve the church.\"</p><p>He said it was not true that the secretary of state \"decides and controls everything\" within the Vatican.</p><p>Announced on Saturday, the move to replace Bertone – which had been widely expected – has been greeted as a vital step forward in Francis's agenda for reforming the Vatican.</p><p>However, observers said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/pope-francis-vatican-secretary-of-state\" title=\"\">the appointment of Pietro Parolin</a>, a career diplomat who will return from his posting as nuncio in Venezuela to start the job on 15 October, signalled less a desire for wholesale reform than the wish to revive the old-style Vatican system that flourished under John Paul II.</p><p>Bertone had no diplomatic background when he was appointed, while Parolin served as Vatican undersecretary for relations with states – effectively deputy foreign minister – from 2002 to 2009.</p><p>He has worked in Nigeria and Mexico, and is known as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue who stayed out of the tense exchanges between the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and the Catholic church.</p><p>\"A veteran Vatican diplomat, Parolin … has been on the front lines of shaping the Vatican's response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades,\" wrote John L Allen, of National Catholic Reporter, <a href=\"http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/francis-reboots-vatican-system-new-secretary-state\" title=\"\">on his blog</a>.</p><p>\"By naming a consummate insider, Francis appears to want to 'reboot' the Vatican's operating system back to a point when it was perceived to operate efficiently, rather than scrapping it entirely.\"</p><p>Parolin, a 58-year-old Italian archbishop, <a href=\"http://attualita.vatican.va/sala-stampa/bollettino/2013/08/31/news/31610.html#Traduzione%20in%20lingua%20inglese\" title=\"\">said in a statement</a> he would give Francis \"complete availability to work with him and under his guidance for the greater glory of God, the good of the holy church and the progress and peace of humanity, that humanity might find reasons to live and to hope\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416332870|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|6b527f11cbb7f6f2582dab6fdadcf3a71e5a9bd8 -->",

        "headline":"Gareth Bale's arrival at Real Madrid brings mixed feelings in crisis-hit Spain",
        "body":"<p>Like the astronomical salaries of CEOs, the world of top footballers appears to be recession-proof. Never mind that most Spanish clubs are hugely in debt and many haven't paid taxes for years, Real Madrid have coughed up €100m for the Welsh winger Gareth Bale. Bale will be paid €6m a year – €1 for each of Spain's 6 million unemployed. He is 24 but he won't be among the 56% of Spain's under-25s who are out of work, nor the others who are stuck at home on salaries of €600 a month.</p><p>\"It's a sad day,\" said Toni, a waiter in Barcelona. \"While the country is sunk in misery, families are ruined and children are growing up in poverty, this guy turns up and we pay €91m for him. Really, we've lost the plot.\"</p><p>\"I think Spanish clubs should stop spending on foreign players and instead invest in youth teams,\" said Miguel, a student from Tarragona. \"Besides, Barcelona have won 16 cups spending half what Madrid have. And if this money is a loan guaranteed by Bankia, as it was when they signed Ronaldo, maybe we'll all end up paying for it, not Madrid.\"</p><p>Despite Spain's dire economy and colossal unemployment, reading through the hundreds of readers' comments in the Madrid sports daily Marca, the prevailing argument is not that paying such a fee is scandalous or whether Bale is worth it, but whether he will be successful and, above all, if he will help the club to overtake Barcelona.</p><p>\"The crisis is over, Bale is here,\" quipped one reader. \"There's no bread on the table but no worries, we've got Bale.\"</p><p>After the anticipation of an on-off transfer story that has been running all summer, about 30,000 fans turned out at Real Madrid's Bernabéu stadium to welcome the player. Bale, accompanied by his family, won the fans over by kissing the team's badge. He then said, in Spanish: \"It's always been my dream to play for Real Madrid. Thank you for such a warm welcome.\"</p><p>In his first press conference Bale said the money wasn't an issue. \"I would have signed for a cent,\" he said. He was also quick to praise his fellow player Cristiano Ronaldo, who many believe is jealous of Bale. While the talk is of Bale signing for €100m, the figure released by Madrid is €91m, ensuring it is not higher than the €96m they paid for the prickly Ronaldo.</p><p>Prof Sandalio Gómez of IESE Business School's centre for sports business management, an expert on Real Madrid, said that when it came to football you had to look at the investment from both an economic and a sporting perspective. \"Trophies aren't worth much economically, but winning attracts sponsors and TV rights. Real Madrid paid the same amount of money for Cristiano Ronaldo as for Bale and no one disputes that it was money well spent because of the attention it brings the club. Or look at David Beckham. They didn't sign Beckham to play football because they didn't need him for that; they needed him because the media love him and for that reason he was a profitable signing. Bale is not a media star, but if he's successful as a player, he could become one.\"</p><p>In Spain, the bakery may have shut down but the circus is still hiring, it's paying top dollar, and the public love it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416356330|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|ac66f07b192f9e3893e4551ef8573c0336e07634 -->",

The government has absolutely no plans to go back to parliament. In response to the use of chemical weapons, the government made the case for a robust response. It put before the house the joint intelligence committee paper.</p><p>\"The government made its case and parliament expressed its view. Parliament has made clear its will that there be no British involvement in military action and we will respect that.\"</p><p>The comments came as a poll for the BBC revealed almost three-quarters of people believe MPs were right to reject British military intervention in the two-year civil war.</p><p>The spokesman also appeared to rule out the use of government bases for any attack, but in practice no decision will be made until the US Congress has debated the issue next week.</p><p>Cameron was informed by the White House of Obama's surprise decision to consult Congress minutes before the American president made the announcement on Saturday.</p><p>Mitchell, a former international development secretary, told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"I think it's very important in this rapidly moving situation that we don't rule anything out.</p><p>\"It may be, after lengthy and careful consideration, Congress affirms its support for the president's plans and, in the light of that, our parliament may want to consider this matter further.\"</p><p>He added that there had been further evidence and a reported attack on a school using a napalm-like substance since the vote.</p><p>\"I think, in the light of that, not least given the fact that the House of Commons declined to support either the government motion or the opposition motion, we should certainly keep our options open and that would certainly include the possibility of this returning to the House of Commons for further discussion and a further decision.\"</p><p>The delay in any military action pushes the focus in the short term on to whether Assad's chief ally, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, will launch any diplomatic initiative at the G20 summit that he hosts on Thursday and Friday. Putin arguably has a responsibility to show how a diplomatic route could work.</p><p>Cameron attempted to restart the Geneva diplomatic talks on Syria at the G8 summit he hosted in Northern Ireland, but little emerged save an agreement to start talks leading to a transitional government.</p><p>Numerous stumbling blocks remain, including the lack of agreement about the attendance list at any conference and whether Iran should be allowed to attend. Britain is not discounting Iranian involvement.</p><p>Cameron, forced to rule himself out of military action, will go to the G20 summit with less to offer. His spokesman said Britain would use all institutions to try to find a political solution that brings an end to the conflict.</p><p>Relations between the US and Russia are at a low partly due to the Syrian impasse, and partly due to the Russian decision to grant a visa to Edward Snowden, the US contractor responsible for leaking reams about the US intelligence operation. A planned bilateral meeting between Obama and Putin has been cancelled, and Obama will need to use the G20 to make the case to Congress of the need to punish Assad for the use of chemical weapons.</p><p>The prime minister's spokesman said the G20 would be an opportunity to persuade the Russian president about Assad's use of chemical weapons. So far Putin has said there is no concrete evidence.</p><p>UN weapons inspectors left Syria on Saturday and are due to report within a fortnight. They have not been asked to assign responsibility for the use of the weapons, only to say whether they were used in Syria on 21 August.</p><p>The mood in the Cameron camp appears to be that there is little purpose given the mood in the country and in his own party to press the case for further military action, and the onus now shifts to Obama.</p><p>Almost three-quarters of people believe MPs were right to reject UK military action in Syria, a poll commissioned by the BBC suggests.</p><p>Voters appeared split on their opinion of the way the prime minister was handling the situation, with 42% disapproving and 40% approving it.</p><p>Labour leader Ed Miliband's handling of the situation was disapproved of by 39% of the public, while 33% approved. Seventy-one percent of people thought MPs were right to stop the government participating in an international military response, while 20% thought they were wrong.</p><p></p><p>The poll also suggested 72% did not think the move would damage Britain's relationship with America – and two-thirds said they would not care if it did. ICM Research spoke to 1,000 adults in England, Scotland and Wales by telephone between Friday and Monday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416328462|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|2711153d6f8d9f3c2bb8d21f9fbd99415dbdd124 -->",

        "body":"<p>Across the camp, five miles inside Jordan, Syrian refugees gathered in small groups to listen to Barack Obama. Some watched on al-Jazeera TV, others tuned in to the radio, many followed on Twitter or online news sites. Expectations were high.</p><p>\"We thought, when he began to speak, the strikes on Bashar al-Assad's regime were going to start immediately,\" said one refugee, Abu Assam. \"Then he said 'but'.\" In Arabic \"but\" is <em>\"wa lakin\"</em>, but in both languages the implication is the same. \"It was when he said that word that everything came crashing down.\" He added: \"Obama lied to us.\"</p><p>A member of the Free Syrian Army, who walks on crutches after an accident inside Zataari, Abu Assam said he immediately decided to cross the border back to Syria to rejoin the fighters on the other side, despite his injury. \"I can fire a weapon on a pick-up truck,\" he said.</p><p>The Zaatari refugee camp is home to about 120,000 Syrians who have fled the war next door, the sound of which, on still nights, can be heard from across the border. The mood on Sunday was uniformly bleak. The news of the chemical attack in Damascus was devastating for those in the camp, said a UN official. Residents asked for no visits from journalists or dignitaries for three days. After that period of grief, amid all the tough talk by western leaders, refugees believed that something would be done to punish the Syrian regime.</p><p>Abu Atum, who left his village near Dara'a after seeing his son and nephew shot dead in front of him, said he had listened to the speech on the radio in his shelter.</p><p>\"Afterwards I called my family who are still in Dara'a. They had listened to it too. They were so happy when he started speaking. Afterwards they were so disappointed.\"</p><p>Abu Atum said he would never forget his son's final moments. \"He was bleeding; he told me he didn't want to die.\"</p><p>He believes America has deserted Syrians. \"We know what this means,\" he said. \"It means nothing is going to happen. Not in a day, not in a week, not in a month. He said it didn't matter if it was a week or a month. But it will never happen.\"</p><p>Another resident, Mohamed Mahdi, said: \"We know only 25% of Americans back the strike. We know that in Europe people are also split. But this is the third year of the war for us. America and the Europeans are not standing with the Syrian people. It feels as if nobody cares about what is happening to us.\"</p><p>Most of the men in this area of the camp arrived in the last five months with their families, fleeing killings by the regime and by the Shabiha militia.</p><p>Of all of them, Mahdi is the most optimistic. He thinks that Russia might change its mind and push for the removal of Assad. Abu Assam laughs bitterly and calls him \"crazy for dreaming\".</p><p>The men say they follow the news, the analysts on television and social media. They have watched the world's reaction and believe it has let them down, and not for the first time.</p><p>There are families here from Ghouta in east Damascus too, the site of the devastating chemical attacks that claimed hundreds of lives and led Obama to the brink of ordering cruise missile strikes in retaliation.</p><p>In another hut, crowded with men, is Abu Mohamed al-Taibi, 38. His brother and his wife, he says, were exposed to gas in a previous attack near Ghouta in March. Another brother was hit in the leg by a fragment of an anti-aircraft cannon round. He shows a picture on his phone.</p><p>\"We know that many people are sympathetic to what is happening to us. It is the politicians and the British opposition, like Obama, who don't seem to care. We will never forgive them for what they are doing.\"</p><p>Abu Reban, 56, is the last to speak, an older man with a heavily lined face. He tells the story of how he escaped during an attack on his neighbourhood. He managed to flee with some of his family. Then he bursts into tears.</p><p>\"I have other children. I lost them then as we fled. I don't know what has happened to them. I've had no news. No one does a thing. How can a person be like this? How could I have escaped and not know where my children are? How could this happen to us?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416278293|2013-09-02T21:32:47Z|904b5ac0d589a4eac2de0804ffabbb551edcb1df -->",
