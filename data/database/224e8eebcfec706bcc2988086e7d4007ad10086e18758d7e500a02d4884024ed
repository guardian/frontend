</xml><![endif]-->The first thing I thought when I saw the artist's impression of <a href=\"http://www.australia108.com.au/\">the planned Australia 108 skyscraper</a> for Melbourne’s Southbank district was that it reminded me of a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Perhaps it’s the contorted angular form, or the metallic purple spire and detailing. Whatever it is, I wondered whether, like our <a href=\"http://www.dyson.com.au/vacuumcleaners/handstick/dc59/dc59-animal.aspx\">Dyson DC59 Animal</a>, Australia 108 comes with two-tier radial cyclone technology. Or is its ugliness simply a monument to putting too much trust in computer aided design? <br></p><p>Australia 108 will be Melbourne’s tallest building, a fact that isn’t lost on the folks <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/grand-designs-for-southern-skyline/story-fnko7zi0-1226809042139#mm-premium\">hubristically marketing the project</a>. And while the developer – Singapore’s <a href=\"http://www.aspial.com/\">Aspial Corporation</a> – had high hopes of sending it soaring 388 metres above the Yarra, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/skyscraper-plans-cut-down-to-size-20130710-2pqfv.html\">aviation authorities had other ideas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Architect Nonda Katsalidis (of <a href=\"http://www.fkaustralia.com/\">Fender Katsalidis</a>) has had to rejig the design, bringing it down a peg or two, to allow planes to make an emergency landing at Essendon without whacking into somebody’s lurid purple balcony.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/grand-designs-for-southern-skyline/story-fnko7zi0-1226809042139#mm-premium\">And so Aspial will have to make do with 312 metres instead</a>, still a good 15 metres above the city's current mine-is-bigger-than-yours champion, <a href=\"http://www.eurekaskydeck.com.au/\">Eureka Tower</a> at 297m (though 13m shorter than <a href=\"http://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=http://buchan.com.au/images/tbg-projects/residental/q1/q1_hero_day_rgb.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://buchan.com.au/projects/q1&amp;h=275&amp;w=183&amp;sz=1&amp;tbnid=vbSy4D1xgg-xKM:&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=106&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__zsQKB84q-062denwW0mdYrbyF-E=&amp;docid=qK0232btFbrsJM&amp;itg=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jhXiUubmA6mu7AbU-4HIBA&amp;ved=0CM4BEPwdMAs\">the Gold Coast's Q1</a>). Indeed, Eureka is just down the road from the proposed Australia 108, meaning they will be flopped out almost side-by-side for an easy comparison of size.&nbsp; <br></p><p>It is tempting to point the finger at Aspial chief executive Koh Wee Seng. He has been quoted saying he wants his erection to stand among the world’s most iconic. However, somebody should have told Koh that it’s not how big it is, it’s how you use it. And setting out to create an icon never really works out; just look towards James Packer with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/12/barangaroo-and-darling-harbour-are-civic-failures\">Barangaroo casino</a>. Aspial hopes to create a mixed-use development, incorporating apartments, a hotel, and some retail. However this is currently being reviewed. <br></p><p>Architecture critic and author <a href=\"http://architectureau.com/contributors/Drew-Philip/\">Philip Drew</a> believes Australia 108 is “totally unnecessary.</p><p>“What’s the point of yet another tower claiming it is higher than the rest?” he says. “The simple fact is that we really do not need buildings more than 10-storeys high, and pushing them up over 300 metres is extremely energy inefficient, highly expensive to maintain, and inconvenient for the people who live in the buildings.” <br></p><p>As for the design, Drew is less than impressed: “It’s a tortured shape, pretending to be a meaningful sculpture,” he says. “Whereas something such as the <a href=\"http://www.willistower.com/\">Willis Tower</a> in Chicago is actually a rational design, this is just junk crying out to be labelled as an icon. It will be Melbourne’s tallest residential building, until some other godawful thing supplants it.” <br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person2902\">Philip Goad</a>, professor of architecture at the University of Melbourne, believes Australia 108 will make Melbourne’s Southbank almost an equal partner in the visual weight of the city’s overall skyline.</p><p>“This has been happening over the last decade where south of the Yarra has now become an almost high-rise residential suburb of Melbourne,” says Goad. “Southbank is rapidly becoming Melbourne’s Manhattan.” <br></p><p>And he believes that Southbank is a city of 21st century where the vertical has precedence over the horizontal. “That part of Southbank is physically bound by freeways and overpasses, so it is a contained little knot that’s very, very tall. It’s not necessarily my idea of place to live but to many people it will be just across the river from the city proper.” <br></p><p>And what does he think of the tower itself? “Well, Nonda Katsalidis's interests are sculptural and so the building is meant to read like a piece of constructivist sculpture,” he says.</p><p>“I think tall buildings in Australia talk about aspirations for personal legacy at the level of the skyline, and that’s not unusual. It’s interesting thought that once skyscrapers were symbols of corporations. Now they’re no longer that because of the complexity of tenancies. They have become visual landmarks rather than bearers of meaning. It’s no surprise then that the architects these days are treating them like sculptural totems.” </p><p></p>","headline":"Does Melbourne need Australia 108?","trailText":"<b>Stephen Lacey:</b> Plans for a new skyscraper in Melbourne have been unveiled; Australia 108 will become the second tallest in Australia.

If convicted on all charges they could face at least 42 years in prison.<br></p><p>According to the indictment, Moore allegedly instructed Evens to hack into the victims’ email accounts, to obtain nude or sexually explicit photos. Moore paid Evens for the photos, which were then posted on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/us-news-blog/2012/dec/06/hunter-moore-isanyoneup-revenge-porn-website\">Moore’s website, isanyoneup.com</a>,&nbsp;without the subjects’ permission.<br></p><p>Seven victims are identified by initials in the federal indictment, which says that each person “maintained email accounts that contained, among other things, nude pictures of themselves and others”. The victims' email services were provided by Google and Yahoo.<br></p><p>Moore and Evens&nbsp;allegedly “worked with others unknown to the jury”.</p><p>Federal officials did not known when the alleged hacking began, though in October 2011&nbsp;Evens and Moore exchanged emails discussing “how to hack emails” and Moore offering to pay Evens $200 per week. At one point, Evens sent Moore an email asking for $250 for nude pictures of “6 guys and 6 girls”.</p><p>The indictment said the alleged acts occurred through May 2011 and charged the pair with conspiracy, unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting and causing an act to be done.</p><p>Moore, a DJ, built his revenge porn empire from his home in an area of northern California best known for agriculture and its&nbsp;politics scene.

Moore said to Bieber he was “comin to bust you out”.&nbsp;</p><p>In March 2013, the&nbsp;anti-bullying website founder James McGibney won a $250,000 defamation suit against Moore, who accused McGibney of pedophilia after McGibney purchased and shut down isanyoneup.com in April 2012. </p><p>Evens and Moore were due to appear in California courtrooms on Thursday afternoon –&nbsp;Moore in a federal court in Sacramento and Evens in a US District Court in Los Angeles.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/201777072/Hunter-Moore-Charles-Evens-Revenge-Porn-Indictment\">The indictment</a> was unsealed on Thursday.

Having just released <a href=\"http://themusic.com.au/listen/all/2013/10/02/archie-roach-creation/\">Creation</a>, a remastered collection of his first four albums along with previously unreleased songs, he says that he is at &ldquo;a turning point&rdquo; in both his life and his work.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in this place now where I&rsquo;m no longer confused,\" Roach says from his chair at his manager&rsquo;s dining table in Melbourne. \"I don&rsquo;t have to write the type of songs that people might expect of me. I can be a lot freer now.&rdquo;</p> <p>Roach has enjoyed over two decades as a well-loved Australian roots and folk musician. His career took off in 1990 with the album <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQgl88uL3xA\">Charcoal Lane</a>, which brought him national attention and two Aria awards.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/sound/sounds-australia/2013-registry/\">his song Took the Children Away was added to the Sounds of Australia registry in the National Film and Sound Archive</a>. The song gave voice to the collective Australian conscience regarding <a href=\"http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/politics/stolen-generations-timeline\">the government&rsquo;s prior policy of forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families</a>. The song was made even more powerful by the knowledge that it came from Roach's personal experience. He and his sisters were taken from their parents when they were small and placed in an orphanage; Roach was eventually fostered by a family of Scottish immigrants in Melbourne.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywDT6yHMmo\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aywDT6yHMmo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>These days, Roach says many of his fans &ldquo;are surprised and some people are a bit unsure of what it is I am doing&rdquo; with his latest music. His 2012 album <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/music-review-archie-roach-into-the-bloodstream-20131021-2vwzk.html\">Into the Bloodstream</a> had a gospel feel, for the first time using horns, violins and choirs.</p> <p>While there may be fans who prefer his old folk and roots sound, Roach is unfazed. He is encouraged by those who have reached out to tell him they have enjoyed the new direction. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more people who have come up to me now and have said that they have enjoyed it. They enjoy the positiveness of it and that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is this exact kind of certainty and maturity that permeates his latest music. Creation is a historical look at a hard life, which has become even harder in recent years. With<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/singer-ruby-hunter-dies-20100218-oelz.html\"> the death of his wife and musical collaborator Ruby Hunter in 2010</a>, followed by a stroke later the same year and a battle with lung cancer the year after that, Roach has his sights firmly set on the future. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to still be making music. Things are looking up and I&rsquo;m looking at other ways to present my music.&rdquo;</p> <p>At his upcoming performance as part of the <a href=\"http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/Whatson/Festivals/ArtsandCulture/Pages/58ec9bc1-9fc4-469c-8c43-427ac2074a12.aspx\">Melbourne Indigenous Arts Festival</a>, Roach will perform his well-loved classics as well as newer works, collaborating on stage with other musicians and artists.</p> <p>Like the pioneering Aboriginal musician <a href=\"http://www.jlf.org.au/jimmy-little/\">Jimmy Little</a> before him, Roach is a crossover artist whose music resonates with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.&nbsp;Yet Roach's music has had a more overtly political voice which speaks directly to issues affecting Australia&rsquo;s Indigenous people, drawing on stories from his life.</p> <p>Roach credits forerunners like Little and <a href=\"http://www.globalonenessproject.org/people/bob-randall\">Bob Randall</a> &ndash; whose 1970 song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3ytJioxKzI\">Brown Skin Baby (They Took Me Away)</a> is credited with helping to end the government's child-removal policy &ndash; as well as his contemporaries like the band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/03/yothu-yindi-singer-kidney-disease\">Yothu Yindi</a>, for breaking down barriers and inspiring him and other Aboriginal people to become performers.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZjtQFjanBo\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZjtQFjanBo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>Roach remembers a time when the Aria awards had Indigenous-specific categories and &ldquo;people weren&rsquo;t quite sure where to place Aboriginal musicians. But I remember the first time I won best contemporary album, and that was a big step for Australian music.&rdquo;</p> <p>These days, Roach is excited to push his musical boundaries by surrounding himself with the new crop of Indigenous musicians. He recently recorded with Torres Strait Islander rapper <a href=\"http://www.triplejunearthed.com.au/Mau-Power\">Mau-Power</a>. &ldquo;The song with him has a lot do with what I&rsquo;ve sung about through the years &ndash; the struggles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is through these fresh voices in music that a new generation of Australians will become more familiar with Australia&rsquo;s first peoples.\"</p> <p>Roach firmly insists that he gains more from the association with younger musicians than they do. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much deeper and more rewarding than what I could possibly give them.&rdquo;</p> <p>Musicians such as <a href=\"http://www.dansultan.com/\">Dan Sultan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cynEO9RyZhs\">Jessica Mauboy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.marcuscorowa.com/\">Marcus Corowa</a> all get the gold star from Roach, who also mentions rappers such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pOW9w8PguM\">Tjimba and the Yung Warriors </a>and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmTg4T7o_vE\">Yung Nooky</a>.</p> <p>&ldquo;People are more accepting of the music that we [Aboriginal people] do and I think people will look and say &lsquo;Wow, this is great music&rsquo; not &lsquo;Check out this Aboriginal guy', or 'this Torres Strait Islander woman&rsquo;. I think it is good for Australia as a whole.&rdquo;</p> <p>While Australia may be more accepting of Indigenous Australians as musicians, Roach is quick to point out that there is more work to do in society. He says that while he is unlikely to write another song like Took the Children Away, there is still a time and place for politics in his own music.</p> <p>&ldquo;The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/indigenous-health-survey-intervention\">NT Intervention</a> [the Australian government&rsquo;s controversial welfare measures enacted only on Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory] is something I still want to address &hellip; to find the right words to help people to understand that <a href=\"http://stoptheintervention.org/past-events/6-dec-2012-the-struggle-against-the-nt-intervention\">it&rsquo;s a very oppressive policy</a>.&rdquo;</p> <p>Roach may currently be working on more reflective pieces, but he continues to understand the role that his music can play in changing the political landscape. &ldquo;If I believe that there&rsquo;s a better way &hellip; that&rsquo;s something in my music that I need to address.&rdquo;</p> <p>Rather than giving voice to issues as he does, Roach suggests that newer Indigenous musicians are looking inwards to their communities rather than writing songs to bridge the gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous listeners. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s where the future lies, especially with the [Aboriginal] communities &hellip; our young people are looking at ourselves.&rdquo;</p> <p>He looks firmly towards the future of Indigenous music with them.</p> <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to address the damage that it [previous government policies] has done to families, the children of the children, the grandchildren of the children that were taken away and how we can bring about some sort of change and some sort of hope in those people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p> <p>Just like Roach, Indigenous musicians are now faced with freedom to make the kind of music that addresses their own people while still resonating with the wider community.</p> <p><em>Archie Roach plays the <a href=\"http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/Whatson/MIAF/Pages/MIAF.aspx\">Melbourne Indigenous Arts festival</a> on 9 February</em></p>","headline":"Archie Roach still a powerful voice for Indigenous justice","trailText":"While a new crop of Indigenous artists are inspiring the singer to push his musical boundaries, mixing music and politics is something Roach won't be straying far from","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m39p","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390443367123/e1c90e1b-0613-4c99-a8f5-22b3878e672c-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390443367123/e1c90e1b-0613-4c99-a8f5-22b3878e672c-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427594787","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52ddfaf0e4b0832332116866","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Eugenia Flynn","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2029804","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T04:01:29Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/23/archie-roach-still-a-powerful-voice-for-indigenous-justice","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/23/archie-roach-still-a-powerful-voice-for-indigenous-justice","tags":[{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog","webTitle":"Australia culture blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"world/indigenous-australians","webTitle":"Indigenous Australians","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-australians","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/indigenous-australians","references":[]},{"id":"world/indigenous-peoples","webTitle":"Indigenous peoples","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-peoples","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/indigenous-peoples","references":[]},{"id":"world/australia","webTitle":"Australia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/world/australia","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"profile/eugenia-flynn","webTitle":"Eugenia Flynn","r2ContributorId":"60643","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390436614716/Eugenia-Flynn-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Eugenia Flynn is a Tiwi, Larrakiah, Chinese and Muslim woman living and working in Melbourne.

Weir achieved that and then some. Infused with a dark and recondite beauty, his superb 1975 adaptation has played a huge role in sustaining the legend of Lindsay's story about a group of female private school students who vanish at the eponymous Victorian location in the early 1900s.</p> <p>It has been remembered, celebrated and misunderstood since readers first turned the pages of Lindsay's book four and a half decades ago. To this day great uncertainty remains about its veracity. Were some events true and others not? Was the central premise real or invented? Did anyone actually go missing?</p> <p>That such a large question mark<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukebuckmaster/status/423030340928548864\"> still hovers over the truthfulness of the story</a> &ndash; which, for the record, is fiction &ndash; is a result of several factors. The fantastical final chapter of the book, which involves a time warp and a character who transmogrifies into a lizard, was intentionally omitted from the original version and published at Lindsay's request three years after her death. In addition, the Macedon Ranges turned the location into a tourist attraction, making the most of Hanging Rock's made-up mystery. But it was Weir's film, a critical and box office success, that almost certainly had the greatest impact in solidifying the legend's place in popular Australian culture.</p> <p>Picnic at Hanging Rock opens with a text insert: &ldquo;On Saturday 14 February 1900 a party of schoolgirls from Appleyard College picnicked at Hanging Rock near Mt Macedon in the state of Victoria. During the afternoon several members of the party disappeared without a trace.&rdquo;</p> <p>Almost two and a half decades later, a low-budget American horror film became an unlikely smash hit by also insinuating that a lost-in-the-woods style missing persons story was real. Advertisements for The Blair Witch Project featured realistic missing persons posters and a website that made no mention of the movie. Both were enormously effective in generating hype, but in a sense Weir got there first, embellishing a legend that went viral well before the word as we know it existed.</p> <p>Given the film's misperceived foothold in reality, it is ironic, perhaps, that some of its most memorable moments involve dreams and dream-like imagery. Shortly after the opening shot, in which the credits appear while a slow whistling wind rumbles on the soundtrack, one of the girls recites Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem: \"All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.\"</p> <p>After they have gone missing, a young man (John Jarratt) asks his sad but hopeful friend if he's still thinking about \"that bloody rock\". He responds: \"It keeps coming back to me in my dreams.\"</p> <p>The last time we see the girls feels like a dream, too. It's one of the moments in which Weir brilliantly corrodes the film's realism with a creeping sense of the unexplainable. Edith, the young and geeky member of the group, watches her companions shuffle off like robots, as if they're being led by a supernatural force. The camera switches to a shaky crane shot as she screams &ndash; the rest of them never to be seen again.</p> <p>Their disappearance relatively early in the film leaves Picnic at Hanging Rock with a gaping sense of emptiness; a feeling that part of the film's heart and soul have disappeared with the group. Weir shoots subsequent scenes as if characters are engaged in psychological confrontation with their surroundings; the rocks framed in ominous ways, like monoliths from another world.</p> <p>As for that memorable wail that bursts from Edith's lungs, more than a hint of mystery was involved in its creation. Christine Schuler, who played the character, never made that noise.

The Smiths: nothing if not resourceful.</p> <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/dhatu/5-feat-jaden\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F129388680&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=900\"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52dfe39de4b07eba157a79df\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-22T15:38:05.959Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yorkshire news</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A Murder She Wrote update (of sorts):</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YorkshireTea/status/426011401061404672/photo/1\"data-alt=\"Angela Lansbury drinks Yorkshire Tea\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Lansbury drinks Yorkshire Gold – and we&amp;#39;ve got the proof! &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/0rx2KtRcgS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0rx2KtRcgS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yorkshire Tea (@YorkshireTea) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/YorkshireTea/statuses/426011401061404672&quot;&gt;January 22, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> <p>In other Yorkshire-related content, here's new track Rush from Sheffield shoegaze duo Nai Harvest .

If you're after something more substantial, and <del>possibly</del> definitely more thought out, then have a look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/22/death-in-paradise-the-naked-rambler-tv-review\">Sam Wollaston's views on Death In Paradise and The Naked Rambler</a>.</p> <p>We had a look at the big three from last night's selection, namely Holby City, The Taste and Rococo: Travel, Pleasure, Madness.</p> <p>First up, Holby City:</p> <ul> <li>The storyline about the boy who drank too much energy drink and nearly died is a damning indictment of the stresses we put on youth.</li> <li>Nigel from Eastenders is looking great nowadays.</li> <li>Doctor Jac Naylor is truly the queen of merging pithy one liners with a curt bedside manner: last night she told a patient that his baby daughter wasn't, in fact, a parrot.</li> </ul> <p>Secondly, The Taste:</p> <ul> <li>First point is a bit of a moan really. Why do the producers insist on making the judges eat food out of those massive spoons that look like a scale model of the Big Dipper? Poor Anthony Bourdain almost choked on Clare's rank bit of beef for goodness sake.</li> <li>Nigella's mantra of: \"Give pleasure, but don't impress\" makes no sense whatsoever and isn't really working, especially seeing as most of her contestants seem to end up in the bottom three.</li> <li>Inviting a chef on called Michael Caines was a masterstroke. Mainly because it meant that&nbsp;Ludo Lefebvre would keep referring to him as Michael Caine. Ha.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, Rococo: Travel, Pleasure, Madness (this is where the rhino comes in):</p> <ul> <li>Meanwhile the real shit was going down on BBC 4. Quite literally! Well not quite literally but there was a long bit where art critic Waldemar Januszczak during <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03sg830/Rococo_Travel_Pleasure_Madness_Travel/\">his history of the Rococo</a>&nbsp;(in summary: the chintziest art you've ever seen) dwelt longingly on a painting of some rhino poop. The poop belonged to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_(rhinoceros)\">Carla the rhino </a>who, in the early 18th century, went a European tour, preening and plopping in front of Europe's ponciest. Pretty much half of those ponces chose to paint Carla too, something which Januszczak claimed made the odd-toed ungulate a more popular subject for portraiture than any king or hero of the rococo period.</li> </ul> <p>(Thanks to my colleague Paul MacInnes for the final <del>poopcap</del>, recap. If you're thinking: what about House Of Fools? We'll have more on that later.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52df8b22e4b0f7ffe46e714b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-22T09:30:15.346Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to ... your pop culture Wednesday</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Morning!

She bought me a little <sup></sup>accordion and a flute, and I concentrated on making as much noise as possible. But the violin came to me by chance: when I was five, she took me to a music school to study the accordion, but the only place left was on the violin course. So the violin became my favourite toy.</p><p><strong>What was your big breakthrough?</strong></p><p>The first concert I gave, aged nine. I'd started studying with my first teacher, Zakhar Bron <strong><a href=\"#1\">(1</a><a name=\"1back\">)</a></strong>, when I was seven. His&nbsp;method was to have his students perform on stage, in front of other people, as soon as possible. I was still a&nbsp;child, but I began to think of myself as a musician.</p><p><strong>Is it important to get children interested in classical music from such a young age?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. You don't need to set them career goals: the experience of playing classical music is a broad one. Like anything beautiful, it should be in the arsenal of education.</p><p><strong>Your wife </strong><a href=\"#2\">(2</a><a name=\"2back\">)</a><strong> is a ballerina. Does watching her dance influence your understanding of your own art form?</strong></p><p>I believe music and movement are very&nbsp;much connected. Last year, we performed together for the first time, at a festival in Switzerland. It was a very special experience to create a dialogue not with a musician, but with somebody telling a story through movement. Both music and dance are about storytelling, really.</p><p><strong>Do you suffer for your art?</strong></p><p>Yes – and it doesn't get any easier. I'm constantly thinking about whatever piece of music I'm performing, day and night. I never switch off.</p><p><strong>Which artists do you most admire?</strong></p><p>I love everything, but am particularly interested in architecture. Classical music is founded, really, on creating an architectural structure with sound. Pieces are very logical, governed by strict rules.</p><p><strong>What work of art would you like to own?</strong></p><p>I don't really believe in owning art: it's like owning a person. But for me, the greatest work of art is the violin, so the fact I'm able to play one of the most beautiful Guarneri violins on the planet <strong><a href=\"#3\">(3</a><a name=\"3back\">)</a></strong> is overwhelming. I don't own it, but it's enough to just have the chance to play it and look at it.</p><p><strong>Is there an art form you don't relate to?</strong></p><p>I haven't yet met an art form I wasn't&nbsp;attracted to. I even consider chess an art form. I do play, though I'm&nbsp;not very good. One of my oldest friends, Vladimir Kramnik, is a world champion <strong><a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>What piece of music would work as the soundtrack to your life?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Brahms's first violin sonata</a>. It's as if it&nbsp;was dictated by God.</p><p><strong>What's the biggest myth about being a&nbsp;violinist?</strong></p><p>That we have some kind of special, innate charisma. Special things do happen on stage, but that's usually the product of a particular concert and a particular moment. Recently, I played a&nbsp;concert in Paris with Ashkenazy <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5</a><a name=\"5back\">)</a></strong>. It&nbsp;felt like time had stopped. For 35 minutes, it was as if nobody in the room dared to breathe.</p><p>• Vadim Repin performs with the Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra of Moscow Radio at the <a href=\"http://www.thsh.co.uk/event/gala-opening-concert-of-the-anglo-russian-year-of-cultural-exchange-2014/\" title=\"\">Symphony Hall, Birmingham</a>, on 22 February, and the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/russian-soul-81174\" title=\"\">Royal Festival Hall, London</a>, on 24 February.</p><h2><strong>In short</strong></h2><p><strong>Born:</strong> Novosibirsk, Siberia, 1971.</p><p><strong>Career: </strong>Has performed with many of the world's greatest orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra, and released several acclaimed recordings.</p><p><strong>Low point: </strong>\"The times when I haven't felt right physically.\"</p><p><strong>High point: </strong>\"Every time the stars are aligned and I give a successful concert.\"</p><h2><strong>Footnotes</strong></h2><p><strong><a name=\"1\">(1)</a></strong> The violinist and <a href=\"http://www.zakharbronchamber.com/index.php?page=737\" title=\"\">teacher</a>is, originally from Kazakhstan, now runs an academy in Switzerland.

But here&rsquo;s a recap of Sunday, the final day.</p> <p>It started for me in the late afternoon with <a href=\"http://www.psycroptic.com/\">Psycroptic</a>, who (according to their T-shirts) claim to be Tasmania&rsquo;s foremost <a href=\"http://technicaldeathmetal.com/\">technical death metal</a> band, a genre which was new to me but which basically seems to mean death metal with complicated bits in the vein of prog rock. The band were watched by a small but passionate coterie of metal fans and a few interested onlookers as singer Jason Peppiatt prowled the stage topless, pausing only to lean over and whip his hair around (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymKLymvwD2U\">and not in the Willow Smith sense</a>). It was invigorating in a brutal kind of way.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHbu2xKP59A\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHbu2xKP59A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>Afterwards the mildly shellshocked the crowd decanted to the festival&rsquo;s second stage, where <a href=\"http://ngaiire.com.au/\">Ngaiire</a>, a tiny singer based in Sydney but from Papua New Guinea, provided much more conventional Sunday afternoon festival fare. She specialises in a kind of soaring electronic soul which can sometimes flirt with blandness but is compelling when it hits its stride. Ngaiire had a startling line in onstage banter, admitting to the crowd that while they were the least experimental band on the bill &ldquo;I was constipated today so I&rsquo;ve taken four laxatives. I&rsquo;ll probably do an experimental shit onstage.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t get that at an Ellie Goulding gig.</p> <p>As her half-hour set concluded with a torrid piano ballad and finally a slinky, strutting tune that sounded like an obvious single, it was clear that Ngaiire had won the crowd over &ndash; and fortunately the laxatives didn't prove too powerful. Here she is in a state of post-gig euphoria with local hero Gotye.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/p/jXh_bRrsDO/#\"data-alt=\"Nagaiire, her mum and Gotye\"> <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/jXh_bRrsDO/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> <p>It&rsquo;s the job of a festival like Mofo to confront people as well as entertain them, and I have to say that I was challenged by the following act, <a href=\"http://colinstetson.com/\">Colin Stetson</a>, to the point that I had to leave the room. A saxophonist who has played with Bon Iver and Arcade Fire, as a solo artist his thing seems to be to play, at deafening volume, a few notes over and over, drench them in reverb and the repeat relentlessly for what seemed like hours. For extra discomforting effect, occasionally there a roaring sound in the background.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7ed033d9-5782-460e-8c03-bcbee88f1ba4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/20/1390189543764/461b957a-45ce-4e48-9c8e-54ec27463bfb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Colin Stetson at Mofo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sax appall ...

As I left the hall, another guy came out behind me literally clutching his ears, but there were also plenty of hardy souls who seemed to be enjoying it.</p> <p>Stetson started a second song by telling the audience that Sydney airport had lost his bass saxophone (&ldquo;fuck those guys&rdquo;) so he&rsquo;d have to continue playing the tenor. The ensuing song sounded much the same as the first to me, at which point I fled the venue and festival ground, the sound following me right to the end of the harbour.</p> <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/constellation-records/among-the-sef\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F74516652&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=900\"></iframe> </figure> <p>I returned for John Grant &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/17/john-grant-john-murry-review\">my colleague Martin Farrer reviewed his Sydney show of a few days ago here</a>. I was knocked out by Grant's Mofo performance, which started strongly with You Don&rsquo;t Have To, but took a turn for the extraordinary with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/07/john-grant-pale-green-review\">Pale Green Ghosts, the title track of his current album</a>. On record an electro, existential Bond theme, live Grant and his band gave the song staggering punch and power.</p> <p>The combination of Grant&rsquo;s warm, affable stage presence with the agony revealed in his lyrics, mostly directed at a mysterious ex-boyfriend but also dealing with his own feelings of self-hatred, is very moving. Unless they're very lucky, everyone&rsquo;s felt like Grant at some stage and having those emotions expressed by someone else in a song is one of the greatest and most cathartic things pop can do. Not that the show is all doom and gloom &ndash;&nbsp;Grant has a good line in gags (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_oNylzsY7I\">even his most bitter songs have some funny lines</a>) and at one point, after riffing on how excited he was by the keyboard player's solo on the majestic and deeply sad <a href=\"http://www.stereogum.com/1630862/john-grant-glacier-video/video/\">Glacier</a>, he kindly informs us of the Icelandic phrase that means &ldquo;I have a semi-erection&rdquo;. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/03/john-grant-interview-singer-songwriter\">Grant lives in Iceland now</a> and half his band are from there.

Being a pom, I wasn&rsquo;t totally au fait with all the reference points &ndash; I was told that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUFOVu1CurM\">Icehouse </a>is a particular inspiration &ndash;&nbsp;but still had fun. It&rsquo;s hard not to warm to a band who perform with a water cooler onstage and a computer bearing the original stripy Apple logo, and whose singer Monte Morgan, with <a href=\"http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/brian-may/images/31190594/title/brian-may-photo\">an astonishing bouffant hairstyle last seen on Queen&rsquo;s Brian May</a>, throws such astonishing, karate-chopping shapes.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a3e81a73-f4f1-4ab3-b380-3b84a75332be\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/20/1390189809966/77b33bd1-2505-4938-9638-bcd0753c7b59-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Client Liason play Mofo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Watercooler moment ...

Musically meanwhile, Client Liaison employed crashing drums, heroic synthesizers and the kind of expensively thrumming guitar you can hear on umpteen mid-80s records (I thought of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzAO9A9GjgI\">Madonna&rsquo;s Live to Tell </a>at one point) in the service of songs called things like Groove the Physical while signifiers of 80s aspiration (planes, skyscrapers, cocktails) played on the screen above them.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8qieJJw4Y\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ir8qieJJw4Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure> <p>The Orb were also a nostalgic experience for me &ndash;&nbsp;the last time I saw them, I was a teenager, blown away by their 19-minute single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qexS5hBB1C0\">A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld</a> after hearing John Peel play it. Not being tremendously exciting to look at in themselves (though they were responsible for a great Top of the Pops performance <a href=\"http://5against4.com/2012/06/08/20-years-on-the-orb-blue-room/\">when they played chess on stage while an even longer song, The Blue Room, played</a>), the Orb also make full use of the screen, playing a succession of images, from mystic symbols to twerking dancers, while they fiddle with their laptops.</p> <p>For ambient house, the genre they pioneered, the whole show is danceable and euphoric. I was reminded of how much reggae there is in songs like Perpetual Dawn, while A Huge Ever-Growing etc still sounded glorious. Naturally, they concluded with Little Fluffy Clouds, but I felt slightly threw it away &ndash;&nbsp;such a landmark single surely deserves a more expansive live treatment than it received.</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/p/jWZwafuupT/#\"data-alt=\"The Orb and Mofo\"> <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/jWZwafuupT/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Finally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/22/dj-mylo-q-and-a\">Mylo</a> (who is here playing with Conrad Shawcross&rsquo;s robot) ended the whole festival with a DJ set which turned the venue into a full-on rave.

It was the perfect conclusion, and I had to tear myself away reluctantly at 1.30am while my fellow mofos danced on into the night, ears ringing, faces covered in glitter and minds happily blown.

While the voice is a little wobbly, Collins is an incredible songwriter, and themes of recovery and finding personal peace were a common theme. He was self-deprecating and jolly, and candid about his stroke and life since, telling the crowd his depression disappeared afterwards and now he&rsquo;s &ldquo;happy all the time!&rdquo;.</p> <p>As Collins frequently teased Walbourne about retuning and missing notes it seemed like we were watching banter between brothers, and it was easy to forget the musical legacies of star of the show Collins, Walbourne the former Pretenders guitarist, and Ellis who has played with everyone from Oasis to Little Barrie to UNKLE. Until they played that is, and then I sat in awe. It was a fantastic contrast between the light mood and furious talent.</p> <p>Forsooth, introduced as &ldquo;kind of like Velvet Underground&rdquo;, to which Walbourne joked &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo;, was a favourite. I&rsquo;d written down that this block of songs was the highlight, but looking at my notes later I realised the \"block\" was the last three quarters of the show. There were new songs and old hits, including the punkish Blue Boy, Ghost of a Chance, the moody Dilemma and One track Mind, a sweet and laidback folky track which ended with Collins remarking in his Scottish burr &ldquo;nice one\". It sure was.</p> <p>Classic Orange Juice Track, Rip it Up, allowed Collins to banter a little more with the audience, querying if it did as well in Australia as the number eight in reached on UK charts. &ldquo;Imagine that!&rdquo;. But then, &ldquo;you know what&rsquo;s coming next, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Collins, laughing again. A Girl Like You was the loudest, and most energetic of all the songs performed during the night, and this was where Walbourne and Ellis really let loose as Collins sang those famous lyrics through the tent. Collins said his thank yous, shook his cane at the crowd, and departed as Walbourne and Ellis kept the crowd clapping with a duelling hillbilly guitar battle before leaving themselves.</p> <p>The three returned for the encore obviously, which, rather than being something extra, or a sad rewarming of a fine gig already finished, seemed to hit rewind on the last 20 minutes. The trio ripped through an anguished Home Again, Orange Juice favourite Felicity, filled with more teasing and banter, and then ended on Don't Shilly Shally, an acoustic pub rock song with a strong sense of hope. Collins again waved his cane to the music, Walbourne and Ellis again saw him out with duelling guitar solos, and the crowd left happy and satisfied into a still light early Sydney evening.</p> <p>&bull; This article was amended on 20 January 2014. An earlier version incorrectly called the song Don't Shilly Shally a new track.&nbsp;</p>","headline":"Edwyn Collins – review","trailText":"<strong>Helen Davidson: </strong>banter between Edwyn Collins and his band underscored what proved to be relaxed, intimate and deceptively high-calibre show","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m282","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/20/1390180872506/524ad7f7-d38f-4902-ba3a-b180f054bcc0-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/20/1390180872506/524ad7f7-d38f-4902-ba3a-b180f054bcc0-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427495489","starRating":"4","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52dc7664e4b0d68a166e479e","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Helen Davidson","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-20T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2029025","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-23T12:30:42+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/20/edwyn-collins-review","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/20/edwyn-collins-review","tags":[{"id":"culture/sydney-festival-2014","webTitle":"Sydney festival 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/sydney-festival-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/sydney-festival-2014","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/music/music","references":[]},{"id":"music/blues","webTitle":"Blues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/blues","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/music/blues","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/australia-culture-blog","webTitle":"Australia culture blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/australia-culture-blog","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helen-davidson","webTitle":"Helen Davidson","r2ContributorId":"56484","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/23/1369271907292/Helen-Davidson(1).jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Davidson is a reporter for Guardian Australia.

In I, Malvolio, written and performed by Tim Crouch, he is being given the stage. But is this Twelfth Night character happy to finally be taking centre stage, or is the whole thing just too uncomfortable to bear?</p> <p>Flittering between the character of Malvolio and a character of himself as performer, Crouch is masterful. With direction by Karl James and Andy Smith, his performance is demanding: he rolls over and speeds through words, insisting his audience keep up.</p> <p>With the house lights on through the performance, Crouch is constantly watching and reacting, intricately controlling the space. Each late entry, each unexpected or perhaps inappropriate laugh is a chance for him to go off script &ndash; but you wonder if even these moments have been tightly crafted, too.</p> <p>We laugh at him, and then he tells us off for laughing at him. As the audience sits quietly after a sad, introspective moment for Malvolio, he berates us. It was supposed to be funny, he tells us. Won&rsquo;t we keep up?</p> <p>Crouch&rsquo;s text offers much for those familiar with Twelfth Night, observing the weaving of plot strands into the plight we follow here of Malvolio. &ldquo;If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction,&rdquo; he proclaims, before admonishing the &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; for thinking themselves so smart for laughing at the reference.</p> <p>But I, Malvolio still stands stunningly as its own piece, unfolding to become less about Shakespeare&rsquo;s work and more about the audience witnessing this play. Our Sunday matinee audience shouldn&rsquo;t be having fun, he tells us, and really should be at home reading the Bible.</p> <p>Of course, as he says this, the performance we are watching is crude, crass, and a downright joyous celebration of theatre.

Photograph: /The Redux Project</figcaption> </figure> <p>As part of the About an Hour festival at Carriageworks, Richard DeDomenici has been showing the result of his work in the city over the last couple of weeks. He's been remaking scenes from popular movies originally shot in Sydney &ndash; and this was an opportunity to show them off. Whether that quite amounts to a show is however, a moot point. Van Badham went to see the show, and left feeling that it didn't quite amount to a performance.

And there were not very many people. He started out slowly, but by the end of it - what a guitarist! He did September Gurls, and it was just so beautiful to watch. What an amazing rhythm and lead guitarist he was! [At the Big Star Enmore show] I&rsquo;m doing Downs. (Sings) &ldquo;Take downs, things sinkin&rsquo; with a melody, dah de dah dah dah&rdquo; - see, I don&rsquo;t know the lyrics at all! It&rsquo;s going to be trouble.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Ken Stringfellow</strong>:&nbsp;For my money, I come back to Nighttime. It's as elegant as a sonnet; it seems to be borne on winds wintry yet humanist, and yet the song calmly deals with thoughts of alienation and paranoia, and responds to them&hellip;sweetly. All of this in a musical tapestry that mixes a Scott Walker&shy; level of darkly ornate orchestration, but centered on a bare track of just Alex and his 12-string acoustic. The sounds that enter&shy;&shy; - an odd tambourine beat, slide guitar accents, feedback - are all beautiful, but the song's lack of a strong rhythmic center makes it disturbing to some.</p> <p>When I first heard the song, it had a bad dream quality to it. Now, it just sounds like life -&shy;&shy; it's organic, and largely comprised of shadow, making the moments of light all the sweeter. In the recording, there's something interesting that happens, a curious change in the audio feel.</p> <p>In the verse that begins with \"I'm walking down a freezing street,&rdquo; the quality of the vocal sound, which had been sweet and intimate to this point, inexplicably grows metallic and thin, but then just as quickly reverts back to its former state.</p> <p>It's these details ... that make this song much more complex than it initially appears. There's subtext galore, or so we're inclined to think. With every listen I discover new layers, and have ever more and different emotions, and I've listened to this song many times since I first heard a quarter century ago.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T07:17:17.487Z\">at 6.17pm AEST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52db6d71e4b040bca45b4ba1\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T06:48:08.490Z\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Review: Hot Dub Time Machine</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-feaf6fe4-4229-4a04-ba21-791c9ab8013c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/19/1390113380157/d87eb50d-7ac2-4575-b6bc-a25f9c152e91-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Never seen a DJ enjoying himself more: Tom Loud of Hot Dub Time Machine.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Never seen a DJ enjoying himself more: Tom Loud of Hot Dub Time Machine.

People apparently danced a hole in the floor &ndash; and not for the first time. Here's what Helen made of the evening.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While Sydney Festival has been largely impressive, it has also been occasionally full of it. Which is absolutely fine and it does provide a challenging, intelligent, boundary pushing experience. But pushing boundaries does wear one down, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to have a night of dancing in a tent to songs that are played simply because because absolutely everybody knows them and they&rsquo;re fast and there&rsquo;s nothing left to do but move and laugh and sweat.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was no pretension. There was no aim to shock or challenge. The sole purpose of DJ Tom Loud&rsquo;s chronological journey through one hit song from every year between the fifties and now is fun. And it was &ndash;&nbsp;Saturday night between midnight and 2am was the most fun I&rsquo;ve had yet at this year&rsquo;s festival.</p> <p>I have never seen a DJ having a better time than Tom Loud. Partying harder than most people in the crowd, and endlessly (perhaps too frequently?) urging people to dance, put their hands up, or simply respond to an enthusiastic &ldquo;Fuck yeah, Sydney!&rdquo; this was <a href=\"http://www.mobydisc.com.au/\">Moby Disc</a> from every high school dance you went to but cranked up, with a bar, no chaperoning teachers, Grease Megamix, or awkward slow dances.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each song snippet across varied genres goes for 30 seconds or so. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t like it, because it&rsquo;s over soon. TThe only complaint I have is that from the late nineties onwards there&rsquo;s a lot of hip hop and R&amp;B, which isn&rsquo;t my bag. Except that apparently I remember all the words to Gangsta&rsquo;s Paradise, so at some point in life I guess it was a little bit my bag.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything was pure cheese - from the on screen time-travel hostess, to guilty pleasures such as Coolio and Spice Girls, confetti guns, glowsticks and a balloon drop from the ceiling during 99 Luftballons (obviously). No one was being cool about anything. It&rsquo;s pretty impossible when you&rsquo;re belting out Bon Jovi and sharing sweat and laughter with strangers.

Here's what she thought of it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the centre Bidwill, an hour west from Sydney&rsquo;s CBD by train, is Bidwill Square, a never-opened mall except for one Kebab shop. The mall looks out over a large car park to the pub and bottle-o, the only shop in the suburb. In this car park this weekend is Funpark, an event that sets out to both provide fun for the community, and to reframe and reclaim perspectives on the area.</p> <p>It is a strange and wonderful collision of ideas. I speak to Dorothy Overton about her extensive collection of The Wizard of Oz memorabilia. I watch dozens of children haphazardly play with hula-hoops, while eating Ethiopian food and listening to the roar of Harley Trikes.</p> <p>I listen to the Darug Elders as one man tells us difficult stories about his life, but also about the love he has for his community in Mount Druitt. &ldquo;I think there is nothing better then when you walk down the street and children want to talk to you,&rdquo; he says proudly.</p> <p>At Applespeil and Learning Ground&rsquo;s Sexy New Urban Design I look at the reimagining of the suburb: an arts centre, bicycle lanes, a police station, &ldquo;a swimming pool in the middle of my street.&rdquo;</p> <p>Two community choirs, a community drumming group, a guitarist on a four-wheel drive and a drummer on a shed come together for Girls Light Up: The Rock Opera. We&rsquo;re told <a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-QRzB9UOECQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=bidwill+riot+1981&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tDgYvFmmT3&amp;sig=dXI-YR8QNZ1kyLkMTJui4Dhh4AI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GmnbUvLDLIOP7AaCtYH4DQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bidwill%20riot%201981&amp;f=false\">the story of the 1981 Bidwill &ldquo;riot&rdquo;</a> &ndash;&nbsp;the community argues it was no such thing; just a fight between two young women over a boy framed by the media in such a way that it still impacts outsiders&rsquo; perspectives today.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Mt Druitt Press Conference makes my heart sing. The Social Revolutionaries, seven teenagers share their lives, dreams, and the community they love. They repeat a stream of oft-repeated derogatory jokes about the area, criticise media coverage, and speak about being judged for where they&rsquo;re from instead of who they are.</p> <p>The Social Revolutionaries speak passionately about their love of community. They speak about their lives and their futures: futures they demand be better for them and their peers. They demand the standards of literacy be higher, and the sharing of resources be equitable. They demand the creation of a medical centre, a youth centre, an arts centre.</p> <p>&ldquo;We demand a revolution!&rdquo; they proclaim. And if anyone is going to make that revolution possible, it&rsquo;s them.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52db6680e4b040bca45b4b9a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T05:52:42.362Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Review: Sun Ra Arkestra</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-56901f44-85a7-4f27-97b5-e7f8cae54f63\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/19/1390110604289/6fb3bd69-b84b-4591-8759-70024d4f8a18-460x276.png\" alt=\"Sun Ra Arkestra: Bandleader Marshall Allen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sun Ra Arkestra: Bandleader Marshall Allen Photograph: /PR</figcaption> </figure> <p>We have a glut of five-star reviews today, which is a rather lovely way to end our live coverage of the festival.

The Arkestra were playing to a less than capacity crowd &ndash; who also were rather subdued &ndash; but Helen still had a fantastic experience &ndash; but argues they deserve better on their next appearance in Sydney. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/19/sun-ra-arkestra-review\">You can read her review in full here</a>. But first a quick extract:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Arkestra make their way on stage to tinkling piano from Farid Abdul-Bari Barron, take their place next to piles of torn and dogeared sheet music, pick up their instruments and begin an upbeat Interplanetary Music.</p> <p>Bandmembers, decked in the famous space-age tribalistic sequinned costumes, look to Marshall Allen for a gesture before launching into solos, while the rest of the band groove along. Sometimes they&rsquo;re asking Allen&rsquo;s permission, other times he seems to be challenging them to a duel. Watching Sun Ra Arkestra is akin to seeing a group of people have a religious experience, with each individual pouring their soul into their music to shouts of joy from their colleagues.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T05:54:03.225Z\">at 4.54pm AEST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52db5c04e4b040bca45b4b95\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T05:09:31.510Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Review: So Frenchy, So Chic</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-aac7d227-2d18-4568-a475-c010265bf657\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/19/1390107671468/3e54a41e-292b-4dd5-ba7f-92614a0387f4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Guardian Australia's Jessica Reed at So Frenchy, So Chic.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Guardian Australia's Jessica Reed at So Frenchy, So Chic: 'I left the festival secretly proud that some Australians seem to like my country so much' Photograph: The Guardian/Anna Kucera</figcaption> </figure> <p>Who better to send to review a French festival than a French woman? Jessica Reed went down to So Frenchy, So Chic yesterday to find out what a French festival in Australia looks like. She wasn't sure what to expect:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Would everyone be speaking with a fake accent, spear-fighting with baguettes? Would festival goers wear, god forbid, ironic berets and garlic necklaces? Would anyone make jokes about the French losing wars?

Maybe they could include it next year. In fact, Jessica had a great time amid the crowds of blue-and-white stripey t-shirt-wearing revellers. Great food, good wine and some surprising rap: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/19/so-frenchy-so-chic-sunshine-great-food-and-rap-from-the-banlieues\">you can read more about that here</a>, but here's a quick extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Entire families flocked to the face-paint stand, with children excitedly showing off the Eiffel Tower painted on their cheeks, while others played games of p&eacute;tanque and croquet in the grass - a quaint touch.&nbsp;Picnic blankets were laid on the floor under the baking sun, with every single patch of shade quickly staked and claimed. Most intriguingly&nbsp;of all, artisan florists offered charming flowery headbands (an accessory which became famous after the controversial feminist group Femen&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/femen-leader-inna-shevchenko-interview\">started wearing them&nbsp;in France</a>&nbsp;- a fact probably lost on the booth manager). They sold like hot cakes.</p> <p>I quickly headed to the food and drinks stand for refreshments.&nbsp;The selection at the drinks stand was small but well curated: a very nice Ros&eacute; D'enfer from south west France, champagne (of course!) was available for those feeling flush, and ice-cold cranberry and blood orange sodas. The food &ndash; mini strawberry tarts, saucisson sandwiches, cr&ecirc;pes and macarons &ndash; was quite delightful. I settled on a food truck offering ratatouille proven&ccedil;ale on a crispy, cheesy polenta bread; a tour de force with perfect texture and, yes, authentic flavours.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52db5287e4b040bca45b4b8c\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T04:47:12.330Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">In pictures: So Frenchy, So Chic</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>We have a report coming on yesterday's So Frenchy, So Chic festival shortly.

Photo: The Guardian/Anna Kucera Photograph: The Guardian/Anna Kucera</figcaption> </figure> <p>Theatre with a dash of danger &ndash; Van Badham's been to see Rob Drummon's Bullet Catch, which takes the infamous trick of catching a bullet in your teeth, and builds a fascinating piece of theatre about a magician called William Wonder around it. You can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/19/bullet-catch-review\">her four-star review in full here</a>, and an extract below.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Drummond is explicit in using magic's tried-and-trues to build an onstage relationship with his volunteer. This relationship is crucial, for the climax of both the William Wonder story and Drummond's own show depend on the magician persuading the volunteer to actually shoot a loaded gun into his face.</p> <p>Drummond manipulates the emotional tensions of this premise expertly; it does become too much for some people, there were walk-outs in anticipation of the climactic trick. The real performance triumph of the piece, however, is not the trick but the relationship crafted by Drummond with his volunteer, who divulges much in public one suspects is unspoken in private. It's this bond - shared so intimately with the audience - that suffuses Bullet Catch with a human warmth unexpected of magic show and rare in other forms of theatre. The result is a touching, clever and unique performance experience.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52db3ccae4b0d68a166e467b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T03:12:50.445Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sydney festival podcast: episode five</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1e1ca9af-a5b8-430b-b0c9-1e8d8b931e7e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/19/1390100605108/24d53195-e4e3-44db-a678-bc48cccb2075-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane Howard, Van Badham and Miles Martignoni - The Guardian team at work at Carriageworks Markets, Eveleigh.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jane Howard, Van Badham and Miles Martignoni - The Guardian team at work at Carriageworks Markets, Eveleigh.

But here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is ambitious ground to cover in a 100-minute performance. The choice to tell the experience through a series of vignettes is a brave one, running the risk of giving too little substance to each perspective and confusing the audience with the plethora of characters that come and go. Wesley Enoch and playwright Tony Wright deftly avoid this trap. They capture the emotion heart of the material, don&rsquo;t shy from the horror of the war, and weave through humour and comradeship to raise the spirit at the darkest moments.</p> <p>The execution of the production is enhanced by an ensemble cast who competently tackle multiple characters and ethnicities, also crossing genders. Seasoned performers David Page and Luke Carroll steer the confident performances of a cast of emerging talents, particularly Hunter Page-Lochard. Meyne Wyatt steps into his own, showing the range and versatility that his performance in Belvoir&rsquo;s Peter Pan promised</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52db30dee4b040bca45b4b7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-19T02:06:09.624Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Interview: Edwyn Collins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77f072ec-3b1f-4d1c-8f3e-c25ce2e3c637\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/19/1390097063813/0c296ded-9434-4413-bc1f-40c8768b7ae0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Edwyn Collins \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Edwyn Collins: I just want to get better and better and better.

Their aim: to act as an antidote to the usual slate of ceremonies. Their method: to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-film-awards/categories-film-awards-2014\"> cook up slightly different categories</a>, and to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-film-awards/vote-now\"> involve readers in the voting</a>. </p><p>A brief recap, for those who missed<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/17/guardian-film-awards-longlist\"> last week's story</a>. We've launched longlists of 10 nominees in each category. We want you to vote for your favourite in each - and the top five reader choices will form our shortlist. Voting ends at noon GMT on 16 February and we'll reveal the shortlists three days later. </p><p>The top reader choice in each category will also count for the casting vote when the judges <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-film-awards/judges-film-awards-2014\">(Claudia Winkleman and Adam Curtis, plus Alan Rusbridger, Peter Bradshaw, Xan Brooks and me)</a> confer towards the end of February. The winners will then be revealed at a ceremony on 6 March. </p><p>There's also a couple of categories voted solely by readers - best cinema and best so-bad-it's-good film - and one (lifetime achievement) that's just down to the judges. Remember, too: you can vote wherever you are in the world, though you're only eligible for one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-film-awards/prizes-film-awards-2014\">(pretty snazzy) prizes</a> if you live in the UK. </p><p>For the next 12 days, we'll be breaking down each of the categories. For starters: best picture. This is one of the most apparently straightforward, but there is a little spin, for our best film award is open to fact, fiction and foreign language.

Danie Mellor</a>&rsquo;s practice at the University of Queensland Art Museum, deals with the ongoing legacies of colonialism. More charmer than pretender, Mellor&rsquo;s art disarms the viewer with glamour and beauty while probing the flaws in our accepted view of history.</p> <p>Mellor, a Queenslander by birth, has European and Aboriginal ancestry. The artist is descendant on his mother&rsquo;s side from the Mamu, Ngagen and Jirrbal peoples of the Atherton Tablelands in far north Queensland. Andrew Bolt<a href=\"http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/the_artist_needs_coloring_in/\"> infamously debated Mellor&rsquo;s (and others) Aboriginal &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo;</a> five years ago &ndash; arguing that Mellor should not have won the 26th Telstra National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award for his work as it demonstrated &ldquo;no real Aboriginal techniques or traditions&rdquo;.</p> <p>Bolt&rsquo;s commentary,<a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/1103.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=title(bolt%20)\"> which was ruled to have contravened the Racial Discrimination Act</a>, also entirely missed the point about Mellor&rsquo;s art. Mellor has said that he admires the work of Aboriginal desert artists such as the late<a href=\"https://www.artlink.com.au/articles/1390/rover-thomas/\"> Rover Thomas</a>, and &ndash; while his art may appear at odds with those of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Indigenous art such as Thomas, it is essentially allied with fellow Indigenous artists. Operating in a different manner, Mellor remains preoccupied with identifying ties to his ancestral culture and spiritual connection to the land.</p> <p>The exhibition, curated by Maudie Palmer, divides more than 50 paintings, sculptures and installations into expansive themes. Opening the display is an entire wall of Mellor&rsquo;s early sculptured &ldquo;shields&rdquo; cast in various mediums.</p> <p>Large quasi-romantic landscapes and post-colonial scenes in east-meets-west tones of blue and white are hung opposite. Meticulously drawn and/or painted, most of these strangely familiar scenes are laced with glitter, Swarovski crystals and traditional flower borders set inside opulent gold frames. They emulate scenes from the original underglaze printing designs adopted from the Chinese and later used on English chinaware, particularly that manufactured by Josiah Spode in the 18th and 19th centuries. As illustrations go they&rsquo;re superbly done but what more do they reveal?</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0665db22-d2a3-4234-9956-96422d18e9f8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/22/1390356513776/dbe80f3d-a190-4c28-9854-7982785fc563-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"daniel mellor\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Culture Warriors, 2008.</figcaption> </figure> <p>For Mellor, blue is a colonising colour &ndash; not used by Indigenous artists in pre-settlement art. (The paintings in this show were all made after 2007 when Mellor adopted<a href=\"http://www.craftaustralia.org.au/library/interview.php?id=danie_mellor_layering_histories\"> it as his signature colour</a> ). His art turns the tables on the colonisers. Using ideas drawn from historical images he quietly substitutes his own narratives and overlays the pictures with colourful and kitschy Australian native animals &ndash; kangaroos, wombats, dingoes, koalas and birds. Aboriginal people also appear, semi-naked as in early colonial landscapes by Joseph Lycett, John Glover and others.</p> <p>With few exceptions, Mellor&rsquo;s theatrical animal characters are not threatening. Rather, they act as chaperones encouraging you into the picture. Mellor&rsquo;s scenes look palatable but the suggested anecdotes are strange and awkward: &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; European-style landscapes dotted with these exotic creatures from other worlds. Conversely, in<a href=\"http://daniemellor.com/portfolio/?p=43\"> Et in Arcadia Ego</a> (of landscape and memory) Mellor places a well-dressed, rifle-toting settler inside an Arcadian-styled rainforest, as native fauna and an Aboriginal man look on appearing to disapprove. In<a href=\"http://daniemellor.com/portfolio/?p=75\"> From Rite to Ritual</a> &ndash; for which he won the<a href=\"http://www.artsandmuseums.nt.gov.au/museums/natsiaa\"> Telstra Art Award</a> &ndash; he employs Masonic symbols to draw parallels and contrasts between the traditions and ceremonies of European and Indigenous cultures.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-69161b93-4e28-4fa5-b2e6-8665dd443d37\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/22/1390356907310/b87fba76-61bd-479c-aab3-ad895e755619-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"daniel mellor\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The promised land, 2009.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The pathway through the exhibition mirrors Mellor&rsquo;s subtle persuasive technique. The uninitiated viewer may be midway through this large body of work before the reality begins to dawn. There&rsquo;s a lot going on in here &ndash; references and symbols abound.</p> <p>Escorted by gold mosaic kangaroos and colourful earthenware dogs the devilish grin of the smiling skull in<a href=\"http://daniemellor.com/portfolio/?p=143\"> Piccaninny Paradise</a> greets me as I round a corner. Likewise, the Aboriginal men in Bayi Minyjirral stare out from their peaceful rainforest setting. Witty installations such as Hundreds &amp; Thousands and Take my Bones and Paint Them draw on themes in international contemporary art with their Damien Hirst-like crystal and glass encrusted skulls, while<a href=\"http://daniemellor.com/portfolio/?p=149\"> Red Blue and White </a>and Exotic Lies Sacred Ties &ndash; from which the show takes its title &ndash; amplify Mellor&rsquo;s concerns about our blindness to history and lies of the past. The show screams softly of injustices, Indigenous displacement and carnage, cultural war, environmental degradation and other horrors &ndash; all the time hiding behind glitzy mosaic skins and shiny disguises.</p> <p>The display comes to an end in a sort of imaginary wonderland, delivering a level of optimism, but Mellor&rsquo;s newly completed bronze sculpture, Anima, marks a dramatic change. The sculpture appears as a malformed kangaroo without ears, tails or feet. Despite its mirrored chrome-plated finish, the work bears no resemblance to Mellor&rsquo;s more glamorous output. The catalogue suggests that Anima &ldquo;forces us to begin a dialogue about the parallel histories of Australia and to call for an acknowledgement of their truth&rdquo;. In Exotic Lies Sacred Ties Mellor cleverly drags you into his conversation.</p> <p>The exhibition is at University of Queensland Art Museum until 27 April.</p> <p><a
