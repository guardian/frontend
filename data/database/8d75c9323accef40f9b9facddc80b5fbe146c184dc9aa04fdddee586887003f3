Books and coffee are social media’s best friends, and readers are starting to share pictures of their shiny new copies – together, of course, with a variety of mugs, breakfasts and other beautiful Instagrammable backgrounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IG\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/5CTBP2ML_i/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;\uD83D\uDE01\uD83D\uDE01\uD83D\uDE01 There are a lot of things I want to happen in this book - I want Scout and Dill to be married, I want to get to know Boo Radley better and I want Atticus to be the charming and brave man he was in &amp;#39;to kill a mockingbird&amp;#39;.

It’s going to be a lot more blunt, it’s going to be completely different, but it can be used for good.” <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/07/14/atticus-finch-mockingbird-watchmen-harper-lee-don-lemon-cnn-tonight.cnn?sr=twtonight071315atticusfinchwatchmenmockingbird10pvodlink\">See the full discussion here</a></p>"}}]},{"id":"55a4b09ae4b07b3a9dbc7628","bodyHtml":"<p>Not everyone sees Atticus’s character development as a failing on the part of the novel itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joynazzari/statuses/620846624223428609\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Turning an aged Atticus into a bigot seems a master stroke to highlight that many people do become more intolerant with age. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a></p>&mdash; Joy Nazzari (@joynazzari) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joynazzari/status/620846624223428609\">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Helen Razer, writing for the Australian arts site, Daily Review, goes one step further in a post entitled, <a href=\"http://dailyreview.crikey.com.au/razer-on-the-so-called-lost-innocence-of-that-hot-liberal-daddy-atticus-finch/26827\">THE SO-CALLED LOST INNOCENCE OF THAT HOT LIBERAL DADDY, ATTICUS FINCH</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Claims that a new, racist Finch are “difficult” or that these represent a “lost innocence” strike me as abundantly stupid on two counts.

Those wishing to avoid such kicks, the presenters suggested, should go and make a cup of tea - but with the behaviour and attitudes of fictional characters from half a century ago now headline news, it’ll have to be a slow-boiling kettle to avoid spoilers today.</p> <p>Chevalier had tried - impossibly - to read the book on its own merits, she said, describing it as the story of a young southern woman having to become her own moral compass, now that her revered father has let her down.</p> <p>“I can see why an editor in the 50s said ‘Let’s go back to childhood, as that’s what you write best’ - those are by far the strongest scenes,” she continued. “What little plot there is dwindles in the second half, and it becomes this big moral debate about racism and southern politics that is a little obscure to us now”, even if the issues burn as fiercely today.</p> <p>The Atticus of Watchman is a terrible disappointment to his daughter, but it’s “maybe not nuanced enough”, said Chevalier, to call him, as so many have been, a racist - it’s more that he’s “a man of his time in the 50s who [says] ‘black people are not yet ready to accept the freedoms that changing laws are giving them, and I’m afraid of what’s going to happen to our society and I want to preserve our southern society’.”</p> <p>All this, she concluded, flawed though the book may be, makes for “a more realistic look at race relations and the issues of race in the States than Mockingbird”, the book that presented him - to readers’ enduring satisfaction - in such saintly terms.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a4c9a9e4b07b3a9dbc7671\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T09:09:09.716Z\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read along with us on Twitter, chapter by chapter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So now you’ve got your copy – or you will have soon.

Books and coffee are social media’s best friends, and readers are starting to share pictures of their shiny new copies – together, of course, with a variety of mugs, breakfasts and other beautiful Instagrammable backgrounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IG\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/5CTBP2ML_i/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;\uD83D\uDE01\uD83D\uDE01\uD83D\uDE01 There are a lot of things I want to happen in this book - I want Scout and Dill to be married, I want to get to know Boo Radley better and I want Atticus to be the charming and brave man he was in &amp;#39;to kill a mockingbird&amp;#39;.

I think the Mockingbird book was sanitised back in the 60s when they told Harper Lee to redo it four or five times over two years, because I don’t think the Atticus Finch we are now finding out exists would have been accepted back then. This shows the Atticus that truly would have existed: Very complex, growing up in the 30s 40s and 50s in the South you would not have had a person as sanitised. I like the fact that its coming out now.” </p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Lamont_Hill\">Marc Lamont Hill</a>: </p> <p>“This is a quintessentially American thing: this white liberal crusader who turns out to be racist. People are sad because they are invested in the idea that we can be changed, we can be better, that white people can crusade for justice for black people and I think that’s true but this book can be a more powerful tale – that even in the midst of that, we still have a moral complexity with biases underneath.”</p> <p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ferguson\">Ben Ferguson</a></p> <p>“The first book inspired people to want to be a better version of themselves and inspired them to help others and do great things so this is kinda like a letdown, it’s like finding that someone you looked up to is a fraud and a phony.

And Go Set A Watchman makes the point emphatically. Scout can’t go home. She isn’t even Scout any more. She’s now Jean Louise. Her childhood is long gone, so is her innocence and now she has to come to terms with the fact that her beloved father isn’t half the man she thought he was. It’s a sad story: often poignant, emotional, deeply felt. </p> <p>But any reader hoping to go back the glories of To Kill A Mockingbird is likely to feel some disappointment. It won’t take you to the same places. It isn’t the same. </p> <p>It probably isn’t as good, either. </p> <p>It’s way past my bed time and I’ve read in rather a hurry. I reserve the right to change my mind - and more simply to later on admit that I’m wrong. But at this stage it seems to me that To Kill A Mockingbird is a better story, better told. Here the plot is flatter and slower and the writing more ponderous. There’s none of the drama of the court case, or the mystery of Boo Radley... There’s hardly any plot at all. It isn’t helped by the long bits of internal monologue from Jean Louise. It feels didactic and laboured where the other is light as air...</p> <p>But hell. It’s probably unfair to complain that a book isn’t as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. What is? And while Go Set A Watchman does feel like a first draft at times, and does have a few rough edges, it’s also full of anger, complexity and moral challenges. What’s more, it contains a few fine jokes as well as some pretty weird slapstick. Much of it is appealing. I don’t regret spending time on it. I can think of far worse books to stay up the night reading. I’ll look forward to reading it again, in fact.</p> <p>Does it merit such scrutiny? Well, I hope so. <br /></p> <p>Would we all be reading it if if weren’t for To Kill A Mockingbird? Probably not.<br /></p> <p>But is it an interesting addition to that book and one worth reading for that reason? Most definitely. </p> <p>Okay... time for bed! <br /> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T04:01:40.806Z\">at 5.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a48085e4b0710add77511e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T03:22:58.162Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I’m done! </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a48030e4b0710add77511c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T03:21:45.599Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/statuses/620794599209074688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the last chapter.

In fact, things have got pretty nasty. Atticus has been reading racist pamphlets and attending pro-segregation meetings where odious racist views are given a full airing. Scout feels he has “failed her”. Bad Atticus! </p> <p>Interestingly, this ignoble racism is presented as a present failing. The Atticus in the To Kill A Mockingbird was more noble than the man we’re reading about now. Scout used to think better of him...</p> <p>All of this is very interesting. The book is also shot through with dazzling humour and some fine writing. But I’d be lying if I tried to pretend it’s all pleasure. There’s a lot of exposition to get through. It feels like reading the deep background to To Kill A Mockingbird – like this was the setting and material Harper Lee had to set down and work through before she was able to write that novel. Perhaps part of the reason the world in that book feels so fully-formed is that she went through so many of the details in her head here... But To Kill A Mockingbird’s gain is this novel’s loss. It can be slow going...</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T03:39:27.177Z\">at 4.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a46104e4b0710add7750c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T01:21:50.624Z\">2.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The title explained</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s the theology behind the title:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/statuses/620762514872250368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">Aha! <a href=\"http://t.co/3rSKqQ5g7k\">pic.twitter.com/3rSKqQ5g7k</a></p>&mdash; Sam Jordison (@samjordison) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/status/620762514872250368\">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T03:22:45.061Z\">at 4.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a45e2be4b07b3a9dbc7586\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T00:58:52.012Z\">1.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another shot in the sunny Southern weather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"357651a5f2a80a06e562161d438cd1a4df1ee6c4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436835472745/dcc6d46f-a259-4be6-a197-15a69423bb95-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Satellite van, Monroeville\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite van is parked on the main town square in Monroeville in anticipation of the launch of the book.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Pilkington/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The courthouse, which includes a renovated version of the original courtroom which Harper Lee used as the setting for Atticus Finch’s defence of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird, can be seen in the background.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a45cbbe4b0710add7750ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T00:55:38.093Z\">1.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ed Pilkington has sent an image from Harper Lee’s hometown, Monroeville.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d10936caa9c608412b85203f891ae2c52741a5ed\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436835159065/2c8ce4e2-2595-4357-9732-a910b076b272-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Placards outside the Ol’ Curiosities &amp; Book Shoppe just off the town square where a party is going to be held at midnight tonight to mark the arrival of the new novel.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Placards outside the Ol’ Curiosities &amp; Book Shoppe just off the town square where a party is going to be held at midnight tonight to mark the arrival of the new novel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Pilkington/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a45bf8e4b07b3a9dbc757f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T00:47:55.457Z\">1.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Early reader opinions are starting to come in...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/garsdalespartak/statuses/620754597624315908\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison\">@samjordison</a> &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; draft 1.

Ouch. <br />There are a few sharp moments too. “We Finches do not marry the children of rednecked white trash, which is exactly what Henry’s parents were born and were all their lives,” says Jean Louise’s Aunt Alexandra. “The trash won’t wash out of him.” Brutal. <br />“Aunty,” says Jean Louise in reply, “why don’t you go pee in your hat?” Scout still lives, after all!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a43c94e4b0710add775079\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T22:37:48.880Z\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She was completely unaware that with one twist of the tongue she could plunge Jean Louise into a moral turmoil by making her niece doubt her own motives and best intentions, by tweaking the protestant, philistine strings of Jean Louise’s conscience until they vibrated like a spectral zither.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the one hand, I like that zither.

What to make of it especially given its provenance? It comes from that other bestselling book, The Old Testament. Specifically, Isiah 21:6 - although the whole passage about the ‘watchman’ there is worth perusal:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</p> <p>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</p> <p>And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</p> <p>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</p> <p>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</p> <p>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p> <p>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p> <p>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asses? Camels? Where does that leave us? It’s pleasing to note that Harper Lee has quoted the good old King James version. Although those of a proof reading persuasion among you will notice that in the relevant verse there is a comma after “Go”. There isn’t one in the book title. Apparently, an editor told Lee about this discrepancy. “That’s the Lord’s Book,” she is said to have replied. “This is my book. And there is no comma.”</p> <p>Did I mention that I like Harper Lee? A lot. I’m also unable to resist the temptation of pointing out how relevant this passage is on the verge of an almost-all-night reading marathon.

But the maudlin reflections on his mortality are leavened by jokes. “Atticus leaned forward a little, the better to disapprove of what he was reading.”</p> <p>After that it’s domestic details - and catching up on local gossip. We get the feeling that Scout - or Jean Louise as she is now - is no longer entirely comfortable in Maycomb. She can’t wear the right clothes to fit in any more... Not least because, as we start to realise towards the end, she’s now far removed from popular opinion in Maycomb. There’s a nice moment where she and Atticus discuss how outsiders and the media view the bus strikes and “that Mississippi business”... And it’s clear Maycomb’s out of step.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-14T03:36:49.214Z\">at 4.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55a4381ae4b0710add775070\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-13T22:19:14.644Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/statuses/620718307050713089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s the target: <a href=\"http://t.co/YEGmZmTz2H\">pic.twitter.com/YEGmZmTz2H</a></p>&mdash; Sam Jordison (@samjordison) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/status/620718307050713089\">July 13, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>How long does it take to read a 278 page book?

Oof. Of course, when she first wrote Go Set A Watchman, by all accounts prior to To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee can’t have known how this short sharp sentence about his passing would stab her readers right in the gullet. But even so. What a way to learn. And think about this: Jem was probably also dead the whole time that the narrator of To Kill A Mockingbird was telling us about him. Which adds a new layer of poignancy to the memory does it not? And a new fragility to the story. That robust, sensible boy was just wiped out suddenly one day, almost at random.

If I were in her place, I’d perhaps be worried about being remembered as the person who reviewed Go Set A Watchman first and whose opinion was shared by no one afterwards...</p> <p>Even so, the New York Times got their splash and their headline. Atticus Finch is not as sainted as some might have thought him from reading To Kill A Mockingbird. He may even be racist.

Indeed, she said: “Without Mockingbird there would be no Shami Chakrabarti,” she said, “and quite a few people would be happy about that...”</p> <p>After that Diane Abbott spent a few minutes talking about Boris’s water-cannons and making a pitch for doing his job, and I started to worry that the discussion would end up nowhere. Luckily, a member of the audience shot in with a brilliant question. “What would you have done to defend the case in To Kill A Mockingbird?” he asked Chakrabarti.</p> <p>She was briefly floored. The man in the audience told her a lawyer had asked him this was the question to ask, and she started joking about everyone hating lawyers until they need them and setting off on a new tangent about the uses of the profession... But her questioner wasn’t having any of it. He told her she was answering like a politician, “which is to say, not answering at all”. <br />It was pretty fascinating to see someone used to duelling with some of the meanest polticians in the land lost for words - although she salvaged the situation by resorting to frank honesty. “I’m not sure I could defend it any better,” she said in the end. “The problems of the books and the story is that he raised the most eloquent defence and still didn’t win.” She also pointed out that she is “a recovering lawyer”.<br /></p> <p>Abbott then made the smart point that the outcome in To Kill A Mockingbird wasn’t about the ability of the lawyer - it was the social context.
