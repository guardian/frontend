Pay off part of your mortgage? Buy a new kitchen? Give yourself that luxury bathroom you always promised yourself? Well, now is your chance. <p>Jobs &amp; Money, in association with The MarketPlace at Bradford &amp; Bingley, is offering readers the opportunity to win a tax-free £7,000 cash lump sum.

All you have to do is ring 0800 113 333 or enter online. Just go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money\" target=\"_new\"> theguardian.com/money</a> and enter the draw there.</p> <p> The results of our ICM poll this week reveal what most people would do if they won thousands of pounds in a competition. </p> <p> A new kitchen was the most popular choice, picked by 28% of the 1,000 people polled by ICM. Younger people in particular were keenest to splash the cash on a kitchen makeover. </p> <p> A conservatory was the next most popular choice, pushing a new extension into third place, followed by a new bathroom. And so much for Britain&apos;s obssession with gardening - a garden makeover was the least popular choice. </p> <p> Conservatories were most sought after by the 45-plus age group, while young families in the 35-44 age bracket were keenest on building an extension. Perhaps you will be the lucky winner of the £7,000 prize. But if you don&apos;t, and you are interested in advice on your mortgage, then an independent expert may be able to help.
