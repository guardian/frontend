They reported that a vessel was in trouble near the Mediterranean island that is a frequent destination for people wanting to reach Europe from the north African coast.</p><p>The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said it believed there were around 500 passengers, all Eritreans who had boarded in Libya.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon Italian rescue divers found some 20 bodies underwater near the boat, a coast guard official said, bringing the total of known dead to more than 100. \"The coast guard divers have begun inspections: they have found around 20 bodies around the boat at a depth of about 40 metres,\" Floriana Segreto told Reuters. She said divers were continuing the search.</p><p>The Italian president, Giorgio Napolitano, said the European Union needed to act to stem \"a succession of massacres of innocent people\".</p><p>Initial reports said the boat was believed to have caught fire before sinking. More than 151 people had been rescued, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Lampedusa's mayor, Giusi Nicolini, told news agencies that many more were unaccounted for and children were among the dead.</p><p>\"It's horrific, like a cemetery, they are still bringing them out,\" she told reporters.</p><p>In a statement, the Italian transport minister, Maurizio Lupi, said 250 people were still missing after what he said was a huge tragedy that was \"not humanly tolerable\".</p><p>\"We need to rescue those whose boats sink at sea, a task the men of the coastguard have been seeing to for months, but we also need to do everything possible to stop the traffickers of death who exploit the hope of the poor. It is a duty which we must take on, which the international community and in particular the European Union must take on.\"</p><p>Pope Francis, who visited the island in July on his first papal trip outside Rome, said he felt great pain for the many victims of the shipwreck.</p><p>\"The word that comes to mind is 'shame',\" Francis said in unscripted remarks after a speech in the Vatican. \"Let us unite our strengths so that such tragedies never happen again.\"</p><p>Italian media reported that Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister and interior minister, would travel to Lampedusa.</p><p>Earlier this week 13 men drowned in the waters off Sicily when their boat ran aground. At that time, both Alfano and Lupi, centre-right MPs, were at the centre of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/silvio-berlusconi-humiliating-climbdown-italian-parliament\" title=\"\">Italian government crisis sparked by Silvio Berlusconi</a>, which absorbed the nation for five days.</p><p>Last year, almost 500 people were reported to have died or gone missing while making the crossing from Tunisia to Italy, the UNHCR said. Numbers have been boosted by thousands of refugees from the civil war in Syria.</p><p>\"I commend the swift action taken by the Italian Coast Guard to save lives. At the same time, I am dismayed at the rising global phenomenon of migrants and people fleeing conflict or persecution and perishing at sea,\" the UN high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Guterres, said.</p><p>Migrants frequently land on Lampedusa, 113km (70 miles) from the coast of Tunisia, often picked up at sea in dangerously overcrowded boats by Italian coastguards.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418948522|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|3d33130b6e4a557a8e00c6d08fa1faa018ff9956 -->",

There are acute concerns that the fighting in Libya will spark a fresh exodus. Tens of thousands of people have fled to neighbouring Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Niger since the start of the unrest in February.</p><p>In Lampedusa, the authorities have moved to shuttle people into immigration processing centres elsewhere in Italy. But these have rapidly filled, and the backlog is now palpable on the island.</p><p>\"It is a never-ending flood,\" Edoardo Faiella, a spokesman for the local customs police, told Reuters. \"We're getting 12 to 13 boats arriving every day, on average, with 80-100 people on board each time, and there is growing tension with the inhabitants of Lampedusa.\"</p><p>Many of those arriving, mostly young men unable to find work at home and risking the often perilous crossing in search of jobs in Europe, have been moved to other parts of Italy.</p><p>Italy has been sending back the vast majority of the 14,918 Tunisians and Egyptians who have arrived at its borders in recent weeks after popular revolts in their home countries, saying they fail to qualify for asylum or refugee status as there are no wars or humanitarian crises in their countries.</p><p>The anti-immigrant Northern League, a key government partner that has been at the forefront of demands that the country's European partners take in some of the Lampedusa immigrants, submitted a proposal to parliament on Monday demanding the European Union take responsibility.</p><p>Last week the European commission president, José Manuel Barroso, met the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and said Italy could count on the commission's \"political and financial solidarity\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/372881768|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|15c20c6d770f14b4cd1a0faa5e4de881a3f9d8a4 -->",

        "headline":"Berlusconi claims he will empty Italian island of Lampedusa of migrants",
        "body":"<p>Facing fierce criticism over his handling of a wave of north Africans landing on the Italian island of Lampedusa, Silvio Berlusconi has put on a vintage display of showmanship, claiming he would empty the island of immigrants within 60 hours, nominate locals for a Nobel peace prize and buy a holiday home there.</p><p>So far this year 18,000 north African migrants have sailed to the island, which has only 5,000 native inhabitants.</p><p>During a lightning visit to Lampedusa, which is closer to Africa than the Italian mainland, Berlusconi told cheering locals that six chartered ferries were arriving to pick up the remaining 6,000 migrants, mainly young Tunisian men, who have made the sea crossing since the collapse of the Tunisian government in January and the suspension of coastal patrols.</p><p>The migrants will join other north Africans who have already been transferred to centres and camps on the mainland after paying out thousands of euros to make the often perilous crossing.</p><p>\"In 48 to 60 hours, Lampedusa will be inhabited only by Lampedusans,\" said Berlusconi.</p><p>Locals have protested against the nightly arrivals by using fishing boats to block the harbour entrance as the island's immigrant centre was overwhelmed, food supplies ran short and migrants bivouacked on a rubbish-strewn hill overlooking the port.</p><p>To frequent applause, Berlusconi told residents he would give them tax breaks and propose they receive the Nobel peace prize for their patience, later telling a press conference he would push for the construction of a casino and a golf course.</p><p>\"We are buying up the fishing boats so that they cannot be used for the crossings,\" he said. \"That way when I am out of politics I will use them to set up a fresh fish business.\"</p><p>The prime minister also said he would use his private TV channels to promote the relaunch of tourism in Lampedusa. While surfing the internet before his visit, he added, he had purchased a beach house on Lampedusa, which he visited before leaving the island.</p><p>A local couple living next door to the €2m house said they had been woken on Tuesday night by noises from the house. \"I thought it was the Tunisians,\" said Rosina Licciardi, \"but it was the gardener and his wife cleaning things up.\"</p><p>Berlusconi said he would also ask the mayor to plant a few more trees on the island and paint the houses brighter colours.</p><p>Opposition members alleged Berlusconi's appearance was a diversionary tactic as his supporters in parliament worked on a measure trimming the statute of limitations for first-time offenders, a measure they claimed is designed to cancel the prime minister's ongoing trial for bribing British lawyer David Mills.</p><p>\"Over there he bought a house, while here he bought himself safe conduct,\" said Pier Luigi Bersani, the head of the opposition Democratic Party.</p><p>Berlusconi is now seeking to convince Italy's regional governors to put up the migrants brought ashore. Over 3,000 who have already escaped from makeshift camps have travelled to Ventimiglia seeking to cross into France, where many have relatives.</p><p>Interior minister Roberto Maroni has told parliament that a deal was underway with the Tunisian government to take the migrants back.</p><p>\"If they are economic migrants, and most of them are, then Italy can repatriate,\" said Laura Boldrini, a UN spokeswoman, \"Many come from villages on the coast and worked in the tourism industry but now fear job cuts.\"</p><p>Italy will need to identify each migrant and serve an expulsion order, which can be appealed against, added Boldrini.</p><p>Maroni has warned that the Tunisians may be just a warm up for 50,000 migrants fleeing the war in Libya. Boldrini said 1,500 people had crossed to Italy so far from Libya, mainly Eritreans, Ethiopians and Somalis.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/373179000|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|fffa9e569d340a8dc5f0e16e2485848caac0354e -->",

        "headline":"From Libya via Lampedusa, migrants languish in an Italian ski resort",
        "body":"<p>In the dark, the hotel that loomed after the last hairpin bend looked rather like Overlook in Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining. But that's where the resemblance ends. Montecampione, altitude 1,800 meters, is a ski resort at the end of the road winding up the Camonica Valley in Lombardy. The most striking thing on arrival here is being greeted with the faces and voices from another continent.</p><p>Since the end of June, more than 100 Africans who fled the war in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/libya\" title=\"\">Libya</a> have been settled in this hotel by the Brescia police authority, in line with the Italian government's policy of spreading the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/30/berlusconi-empty-island-lampedusa-migrants\" title=\"\">Lampedusa migrants</a> around the country. In most places the local authorities have been required to house them, but here private enterprise has also been asked to contribute. The hotel in Montecampione houses and feeds the migrants for €40 a head per day.</p><p>The nearest village in the valley is more than 20km away, so the migrants are cut off from the outside world while they await a decision on their fates. The monotony of their days is broken only by meals and their turn to use the internet and telephones, which gives them a few minutes' respite from tedium and isolation. \"We live in a strange situation here,\" admitted a lively young Ghanaian called Michael. \"We've got absolutely nothing to do, but we're all impatient to find work and start our lives again.\"</p><p>For now, all the migrants have is the piece of paper they were given in Lampedusa stating their date of arrival. To obtain temporary resident's permits and, if they are lucky, refugee status, they have to go through a complicated procedure, and the authorities are massively overworked.</p><p>At very best, most migrants will have to wait several more months. But for a dozen of them, things started to move when volunteers from a co-operative assisting the migrants came to collect the information required for filing asylum requests.</p><p>The migrants were obliged to relive the painful events that took them from Libya – where some have worked for years – to Montecampione. \"They've been abandoned with no support from the government. We have to act as substitutes for handling their asylum applications, giving them psychological support, and finding solutions to improve their living conditions,\" said Carlo Cominelli, head of the K-Pax co-operative. When the co-operative applied to the Red Cross for help, it was told that it was impossible for logistical reasons, so the volunteers have to make do on their own with the means available to them.</p><p>The hotel director, Giuseppe  Crucitti, is also doing his bit. \"My staff and I are doing more than what was asked in the agreement with the police department. You only have to look at them to understand what these men have been through.\"</p><p>Crucitti also distributes the clothes donated by the inhabitants of the valley. Many migrants arrived in only T-shirts and flip-flops, and up in the mountains the heating is already on full blast at night and you need a spot of sun to thaw out in the daytime.</p><p>A doctor from a local medical centre comes by once or twice a week. The hotel director told us that many people ask him for something to help them sleep, because they are still traumatised by the events they have lived through. A young Nigerian called Kelly, who was arrested and manhandled by Gaddafi's troops before managing to escape, told us sadly, \"I have no more hope. When I arrived in Italy I tried to explain my situation, but no one seems to understand what I've been through.\"</p><p>The last five migrants to arrive in Montecampione are equally bewildered. They reached Lampedusa  early in August, and were taken across Italy. They have got plenty of time  to find out about where they have ended up.</p><p>This story originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/377913487|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|a9ac4223d843bc3a5bdb5646f172b89e1fb83a5c -->",

        "headline":"Pope attacks 'globalisation of indifference' in Lampedusa visit",
        "body":"<p>In his first visit outside Rome since becoming pope, Francis visited recently arrived migrants on the island of Lampedusa on Monday, lambasting the rich world for its lack of concern for their suffering and inveighing against a \"globalisation of indifference\".</p><p>\"We have become used to the suffering of others. It doesn't affect us. It doesn't interest us. It's not our business,\" he said.</p><p>Lampedusa, which covers an area of less than eight square miles, is the southernmost part of Italy. Over the past 10 years it has become the point of entry into the EU for tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers.</p><p>Wearing vestments of penitential purple, Francis said he had decided to come to the island after learning of a recent incident in which migrants had died while attempting the crossing from north Africa. The thought of their suffering had come back to him repeatedly like \"a thorn in the heart\", he said.</p><p>As his plane landed, more than 160 Eritreans were coming ashore in the port, the latest of almost 8,000 arrivals on Italy's southern coasts so far this year, according to UN figures. Another 40 are known to have died trying to reach Europe.</p><p>The pope celebrated mass within sight of the so-called graveyard of wrecks, where fishing boats carrying migrants and asylum seekers end up after they drift ashore, their engines often having broken down at sea.</p><p>He asked for \"pardon for those who are complacent and closed amid comforts which have deadened their hearts\" and \"forgiveness for those who by their decisions at the global level have created situations that lead to these tragedies\".</p><p>That was the only allusion to politics in an address that nevertheless – like much of what Francis has said and done since his election – posed a problem for the Italian right. Though loud in their protestations of respect for Catholic doctrine, the followers of Silvio Berlusconi and the Northern League backed a deal with the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi that involved repelling seaborne migrants before they had a chance to apply for asylum.</p><p>The pope singled out for praise the Italian coastguards and revenue guards who have plucked thousands to safety, and the Lampedusans themselves. \"You offered an example of solidarity,\" he told them.</p><p>Though their island – a treeless patch of Italy 70 miles off the African coast – has at times been turned into a refugee camp, most Lampedusans have reacted with generosity and tolerance towards the migrants. Most of their protests have been directed at the authorities' failure to provide them with sufficient resources.</p><p>A banner draped along the pope's route read: \"Welcome among the <em>ultimi</em> – a word in Italian that has connotations of both furthest and least.</p><p>\"It was not even thinkable that the pope would come to an Island like this one,\" resident Andrea Pavia, who came out with his tearful wife and daughter to watch the pope drive by, told the Associated Press. \"I am so happy, I am so emotional. I just can't believe it.\"</p><p>Local fishing boats accompanied the coastguard patrol boat that brought the pope from the airport to the port. Francis, an Argentinian whose own grandparents emigrated from Italy, cast a wreath of flowers in the papal colours of yellow and white on to the water in commemoration of those who have died.</p><p>He disembarked at the quayside at which so many battered vessels packed with migrants have been tied up. There he shook hands with some recent arrivals and heard the account of an Eritrean who escaped from a military training camp.</p><p>Francis was then driven to the site of his mass in an aged Fiat vehicle like a military Jeep, which he chose in preference to the glossy Mercedes Popemobile.</p><p>• This article was amended on 11 July 2013. The original version said incorrectly that Lampedusa is the southernmost point of the European Union.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412397848|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ad0123ff431cf1df4ad24f6ea96fe9e317ba09e0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thirty-one people are believed to have died while trying to reach the Italian island of Lampedusa, the latest tragedy to occur on the perilous sea crossing between north Africa and Europe.</p><p>Survivors of the journey from Libya reportedly told authorities that the vessel in which they were travelling capsized on Friday evening, and more than half of its 53 passengers drowned. They said nine of the dead were women, the Ansa news agency reported.</p><p>Pictures on Italian television showed the wreck of a motorised rubber dinghy. The 22 people rescued were from a variety of west African countries including Nigeria, Benin, Gambia and Senegal.</p><p>When Pope Francis <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/08/pope-globalisation-of-indifference-lampedusa\" title=\"\">visited Lampedusa</a> this month, the UN said the death toll for the crossing this year was 40.</p><p>The survivors of Friday night were a fraction of the more than 470 migrants who arrived on Italian shores in the space of 24 hours. The reception centre in Lampedusa is reported to be full to bursting following a surge in the number of arrivals.</p><p>A week ago Save the Children <a href=\"http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2011/03/24/save-the-children-conditions-for-250-unaccompanied-migrant-children-on-lampedusa-unacceptable/\" title=\"\">raised the alarm</a> about the plight of unaccompanied minors in the centre, where they said dozens of child migrants were sleeping on the bare earth outside due the recent influx.</p><p>The traffickers who charge money for the crossings tend to take advantage of calm seas, as in recent days, to make the voyage.</p><p>It was a tragedy along the lines of Friday night's drowning that Francis said had spurred him on to devote his first trip outside Rome to Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost point. During the visit on 8 July, he said news of a recent incident had repeatedly come back to him \"like a thorn in the heart\".</p><p>The Argentinian pontiff, whose grandparents emigrated from northern Italy to Latin America, asked for \"forgiveness for those who by their decisions at the global level have created situations that lead to these tragedies\", and cast a wreath of flowers on to the water in commemoration of those who had died.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413819295|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|221fd9fc665bd467214f9867d1dba86196cadd94 -->",

Here are recent reports from Italy's southern shores, a key entry point to the European Union for migrants travelling through north Africa.</p><p></p><h2>8 July </h2><p></p><p></p><p>Pope Francis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/pope-globalisation-of-indifference-lampedusa\" title=\"\">makes his first visit as pope outside of Rome to Lampedusa</a>. In the first six months of 2013 as many as 8,000 Eritreans had arrived on Italy's southern shores and 40 had died making the journey. As Francis's plane lands, 160 from the ravaged African state came into port. Francis says he decided to come to Lampedusa after learning of a recent incident in which migrants had died while attempting the crossing from north Africa. The thought of their suffering had come back to him repeatedly like \"a thorn in the heart\", he says. He celebrates mass within sight of the so-called graveyard of wrecks, where fishing boats carrying migrants and asylum seekers end up after they drift ashore.</p><p></p><h2>28 July</h2><p></p><p>Thirty-one people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/28/migrants-drown-lampedusa-crossing\" title=\"\">are believed to have died</a> crossing to Lampedusa. Survivors of the journey from Libya reportedly tell authorities that the vessel in which they were travelling capsized and more than half of its 53 passengers drowned. They say nine of the dead are women. Pictures on Italian television show the wreck of a motorised rubber dinghy. The 22 people rescued are from a variety of west African countries including Nigeria, Benin, the Gambia and Senegal.</p><p></p><h2>15 August</h2><p></p><p>Official figures show that the number of migrants landing on Italian shores in 2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/15/italy-summer-surge-migrant-boat-landings\" title=\"\">has more than doubled over a 40-day period</a> during July and August. The Italian interior minister, Angelino Alfano, says 8,932 migrants have arrived after perilous sea crossings between 1 July and 10 August, with the total number of migrant arrivals for 2013 now standing at 17,167. In the previous 12 months, Alfano says, more than 24,000 people were recorded as having made it to shore.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>11 August</h2><p></p><p>The prosecutor of Catania, Sicily's second city, opens an investigation after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/11/egyptian-migrants-drown-sicily-resort\" title=\"\">six young Egyptians drown</a> while trying to swim 20 metres from a wooden fishing boat to the shore. The boat, which had been carrying more than 100 migrants from Egypt and Syria, ran aground on a sandbar near the Lido Verde resort and the bodies of the six were laid out in bags beside sun umbrellas on a popular Sicilian beach. It is suspected that the six may not have known how to swim. The Ansa news agency reported that the youngest would have turned 18 this month.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418959584|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c931ef533a4d6f8321c2bee3d2b98e5791df39ae -->",

The latest boat of them wasn't able to complete the journey and as a result, at least 94 Eritreans are dead and hundreds more are missing. How many people risk their lives to make it to Europe and which routes are the most dangerous? </p><h2>Mediterranean the most deadly stretch of water</h2><p>Whether it's an overcrowded leaking boat, a suffocating container or climbing over razor wire fences, UNHCR recognises that individuals are willing to take any risk that increases their chances of starting a new life abroad. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419111193'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380807076568/Lampedusa.png' alt='lampedusa' width='150' height='162' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Image by Norman Einstein</figcaption></figure><p>That's particularly evident on the Italian island of Lampedusa. With a population of 6,000 and a surface area of 20.2 km<sup>2</sup>, Lampedusa would have always struggled to cope as an entry point for North Africans wanting to make their way to Europe. But the island has become so overwhelmed by the influx and the constant casualties that it has become the paradigm for policy makers and international lawyers attempting to stop human trafficking and regulate a problem that shows no signs of slowing.</p><p>Lampedusa has become so symbolic of the desperate attempts of some that when Pope Francis visited Italy in July this year, he met with a group of recently arrived migrants before boarding an Italian coastguard vessel to <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/news-and-views/news-list/news-detail/article/pope-francis-prays-for-migrants-refugees-during-landmark-visit-to-italys-lampedusa-island.html\">cast a floral wreath</a> into the sea in memory of those who had died during the attempted crossing.</p><p>And the island was at the centre of European leaders' concerns when they began to question the Schengen agreements and push for legal reforms. Do the numbers justify the focus on this one island?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/de-schengen-a-lampedusa_986524.html\">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> attempts to collect numbers on 'irregular arrivals' (don't be misled by the term, it actually means the same thing as <a href=\"http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/free/IML_1_EN.pdf\">illegal/undocumented migrants</a>) and although estimations, the numbers show that thousands are attempting to get to Europe each year via Italy as well as Spain and Malta.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>But they also have estimates on the number of migrants who die or are reported missing en route to their destinations. In Italy alone, almost 3,000 migrants died between 2006 and 2011 on their way to reach either the mainland or one of the islands. Events abroad have a deep impact on these figures - in 2011, \"based on telephone calls from boats in distress and reports from survivors and family members\" UNHCR estimates that 1,500 individuals travelling from Libya to Europe died on the way.  </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>It's unlikely things will change soon. In the first half of 2013 alone, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/51d6b8a56.html\">8,400</a> migrants and asylum-seekers arrived by sea on the coasts of Italy and Malta. Over the same period, the numbers were far higher in the Horn of Africa where UNHCR recorded the arrival of more than 46,000 refugees and migrants. Yemen struggles to cope with the vast majority of these, most of whom are Ethiopian (84% in 2012) or Somali (16%). In 2012, 43 migrants died crossing the Red Sea - so far this year <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/5200d1ea9.html\">5 have died</a>, but that number could rise as smugglers and traffickers use increasingly dangerous methods to sustain their revenues.</p><h2><strong>Get the numbers and get involved</strong></h2><p>• Download <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At6CC4x_yBnMdG5aMDM2d0lxR2V1Wm9zTkhreGcxOWc&amp;usp=sharing\">the full spreadsheet</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@theguardian.com</a><br />• Follow us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">on Twitter</a><br />• Like us <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">on Facebook</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a></p><p><em>Mona Chalabi is teaching a Masterclass, Mastering spreadsheets: how to work with data, at the Guardian's London offices on 26-27 October. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/mastering-speadsheets-how-to-work-with-data-mona-chalabi-digital-course?INTCMP=edi_231034\">Learn more and book</a></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418968432|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ca9d3735a51c2978d3b7a94503c19f4b0fcdd396 -->",

Neither phenomenon will abate of its own accord.</p><p>There will be more days like this, more tragedies in places such as Lampedusa. The last decade saw <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats\" title=\"\">welcome growth</a> in the developing world as poor countries, principally India and China surged, taking 620 million out of poverty compared with 1990 and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">UN's millennium development goals</a> helped galvanise international institutions. But the improvement has been patchy. Even in those countries where poverty has been impacted, many who have been pulled out of officially classified poverty remain vulnerable in terms of living and social conditions. They may not die of poverty, but it's no way to live.</p><p>And what are we doing about this constant and inevitable knocking at the door of Europe? How do we reflect the truth that an undeveloped population – blessed or perhaps cursed with modern communications – will strike out for a better life in the developed world. We confront the problem with an unedifying hotchpotch of neuroses and political spasms that ensure we never truly see it in the round, never discuss it rationally and never get to grips with it.</p><p>David Cameron is to be hailed for sticking to his guns and allocating 0.7% of the budget to aid but let us never forget the drumbeat of rage and derision that envelopes him all the while because of this, his most domestically unpopular policy position. \"We're the mugs of the world, we're spending money we haven't got,\" <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/408367/Anger-as-Britain-still-gives-MORE-foreign-aid-than-any-other-G8-country\" title=\"\">complained Tory MP Philip Davies in June</a>, reflecting a body of opinion that will no doubt be shocked today but won't begin to link what we do in the world with the wider goal of preventing more migrant tragedies.</p><p>Many who shout loudest in our ruling coalition make it pretty clear that they don't like sending our money abroad. Neither do they seem comfortable having more migrants here. If the Lampedusa boat had landed safely, the next wave of stories would have warned of the hordes now heading across Europe; destination Britain. Those who arrived might have found themselves being urged to leave again by Theresa May's immigration vans.</p><p>And through our shortsightedness, we aren't even making sure that developing countries can help themselves. The Lampedusa boats were filled with Somalians and Eritreans, and yet right now Somalians in Britain face the loss of the mechanism whereby they were able to help relatives in their home country by sending home millions of pounds in remittances. Barclays is withdrawing from the market for fear of being accused of funding terrorism. Ministers know the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/08/banking-decision-remittances-hurt-minorities-barclays\" title=\"\">decision will be ruinous</a> – in Somalia particularly – but neither they nor Barclays nor the regulatory authorities can summon the courage or the vision to do anything about it.</p><p>So that's the migrant quandary – we are damned by the right for sending aid, damned if migrants come here and there are limits on the extent to which they can help themselves. Let us grieve, but let us not puzzle as to why they take to the boats.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419041099|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|bcf8c9502b9ab4ef966c4100cf7dc95570736246 -->",

        "headline":"Mediterranean migrant deaths: a litany of largely avoidable loss",
        "body":"<p>These days, it takes a blockbuster tragedy for migrant boats to reach the front pages – the quiet, regular additions to the Mediterranean's death toll encountered on an almost-weekly basis by rescuers, human rights activists and migrant communities themselves are simply far too humdrum to make the mainstream news. \"The reaction of a lot of us this morning was just 'yet again, yet again' … except this time it's even worse,\" Judith Sunderland, a researcher with Human Rights Watch who specialises in migration, told the Guardian. \"What's chilling is to think that this could have been prevented.\"</p><p>In the past two decades, almost 20,000 people are recorded as having lost their lives in an effort to reach Europe's southern borders from Africa and the Middle East. In 2011, at the height of the Arab uprisings, more than 1,500 were killed in a single year. Thursday's  horrific scenes are only the latest in a long line of similar, albeit less dramatic, boat disasters – a litany of largely avoidable loss which inspired Pope Francis, on a visit to Lampedusa earlier this year, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/pope-globalisation-of-indifference-lampedusa\" title=\"\">inveigh against the rich world's \"globalisation of indifference\"</a>.</p><p>Activists and policymakers agree that a large portion of the blame for migrant deaths must lie with the unscrupulous criminal gangs who demand large payments for arranging people trafficking and often use dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels for the job. But on the question of how Europe should approach this problem, there is considerable discord, dividing those who believe far more needs to be done to prioritise the saving of lives, from those who fear any shift in emphasis away from border enforcement will only encourage people trafficking.</p><p>\"If traffickers think they can smuggle people in with impunity, that's an incentive for smuggling to increase,\" said Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP and rapporteur for the Council of Europe's committee on migration. But critics claim that the enforcement posture adopted by both European nations and the continent's supranational agencies such as the border control force Frontex only serve to deny migrants vital humanitarian assistance and increase the risk of boat deaths.</p><p>\"What we really don't see is a presumption of saving lives; what we get instead is every effort to shut down borders,\" said Sunderland, who pointed out that security crackdowns on land crossings such as the Greece-Turkey border only displaced migrant flows and often forced more boats into the sea. \"The only hope is that this latest tragedy fundamentally shocks the conscience of Europeans and European decision-makers into adopting a real life-saving approach to migrants in the Mediterranean.\"</p><p>But more often than not attempts to forge a co-ordinated, effective European response to irregular migration by boat have stumbled. Following the Guardian's exposé of the \"left-to-die\" boat in 2011, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/08/nato-ship-libyan-migrants\" title=\"\">61 migrants were left to perish slowly at sea</a> despite distress calls being sounded and their vessel's position being made known to European authorities and Nato ships, an in-depth inquiry by the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly found that a \"catalogue of failures\" had caused the deaths and recommended a fundamental overhaul of European policy on migration; at the same time the UN declared that all migrant vessels in the Mediterranean should be considered by default as in distress, and thus in need of rescue.</p><p>Yet although thousands of migrants have been rescued by the coastguards of southern European countries such as Italy and Malta, there still remains an absence of political will when it comes to ensuring that vulnerable migrants don't fall through the cracks of an intricate set of border and rescue policies and overlapping regions of legal jurisdiction. In August the Italian authorities ordered two commercial ships to rescue a migrant boat in the sea and then demanded the ship's captains transport the migrants back to Libya, a move that experts believe could discourage commercial captains from attempting rescues at all and may be in breach of international law.</p><p>At the end of this year, Eurosur – a new Mediterranean surveillance and data-sharing system developed by the EU which, among other things, would use satellite imagery and drones to monitor the high seas and the north African coast – is due to go live. European policymakers claim the technology will make a serious contribution to saving migrant lives on the sea, but sceptics say that the project is still primarily focused on preventing migrants reaching Europe at all, and legislation needs to be redrafted to put humanitarian concerns at the forefront of Eurosur's operations.</p><p>In the meantime, much more could be done to ensure that both national coastguards and commercial vessels have both the capability and incentives to be proactive when it comes to saving the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable people.</p><p>\"A terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe. And not for the first time,\" said Jean-Claude Mignon, head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, in response to Thursday's grim death toll. \"We must end this now. I hope that this will be the last time we see a tragedy of this kind, and I make a fervent appeal for specific, urgent action by member states to end this shame.\"</p><p>Without a drastic increase in political will across the European continent, his wish is unlikely to be realised.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419000189|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c6bbe9e48e48b657f582858591ed7bfe4d16adbd -->",

A total of 155 survivors were rescued.

Human rights campaigners said that the tragedy could easily have been prevented.</p><p>\"A terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe. And not for the first time,\" said Jean-Claude Mignon, head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly. \"We must end this now. I hope that this will be the last time we see a tragedy of this kind, and I make a fervent appeal for specific, urgent action by member states to end this shame.\"</p><p>As the Sicilian island's quayside was lined with corpses, hopes for more survivors dimmed. When coastguard divers began an inspection of the area around the wreck, they found 20 more bodies underwater. Asked on Italian radio what help was needed, Pietro Bartolo, chief of health services on Lampedusa, replied: \"Coffins. Coffins and hearses.\"</p><p>Giusi Nicolini, the island's mayor, said: \"It's horrific, like a cemetery. They are still bringing them out.\"</p><p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the tragedy should be a spur to action. In Italy, Napolitano and government ministers said the time had come for the world to shoulder its share of the burden in the growing problem of migrant boat arrivals.</p><p>Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister, said: \"We hope the EU realises that this is not an Italian but a European disaster.\" He headed to Lampedusa vowing to \"make Italy's voice heard loudly\" with José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission.</p><p>Napolitano said there was now an \"absolute necessity for decisions and actions by the international community and primarily the EU\". The integration minister, Cécile Kyenge, told journalists: \"It is not the moment to point the blame at anyone, but we will ask countries to each do their bit.\"</p><p>Their message was echoed by Pope Francis, who said: \"Let's unite our efforts so that tragedies like this don't happen again. Only a decisive collaboration of everyone can help and prevent them.\" In impromptu remarks, he added: \"The word disgrace comes to mind. It is a disgrace.\"</p><p>The alarm over the unfolding disaster was raised shortly after 6am on Thursday by fishing boats who noticed a vessel in trouble off the Lampedusa coast near Isola dei Conigli (Rabbits' Island). Lampedusa, where the interior ministry says more than 8,000 migrants landed in the first eight and a half months of this year – out of a national total of more than 17,000 – is just 70 miles from the Tunisian coast.</p><p>Alfano said the boat's motor was believed to have stopped working, causing water to come into the vessel and prompting the passengers to burn a sheet to try to attract rescuers. \"Once the fire started, there was a concern about the boat sinking and everyone moved to one side, causing the boat to go down,\" he said. The passengers were just half a mile from the shore.</p><p>A young Tunisian man was arrested by Italian police on suspicion of being one of the people smugglers responsible for organising the crossing. Unnamed survivors quoted in the Italian media, who said the boat had left the Libyan port of Misrata two days earlier, said that three fishing boats in the area had seen that their vessel was in trouble but had not come to their rescue. Alfano rejected this, saying that the boats nearby had not seen them. \"If they had, they would have intervened,\" he said. \"Italians have big hearts.\"</p><p>Codacons, an Italian consumer group, said it would ask prosecutors to look into the allegations, which it said, if true, would represent a very serious failure.</p><p>The controversy echoed a similar tragedy in March 2011, revealed in the Guardian, in which dozens of African migrants en route to Lampedusa died after being apparently ignored by European military units.</p><p>Human rights groups have long been calling on Italian and European authorities to rethink their approach to the crossings, which brought about 15,000 migrants to Italy and Malta last year, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees.</p><p>Judith Sunderland, senior western Europe researcher of Human Rights Watch, said \"the lack of solidarity from the rest of the EU\" had caused an \"almost utter failure of any proposals for greater burden-sharing\". Member states needed to do more to help Italy shoulder the burden, she said, calling also for a \"presumption of rescue\" policy to be implemented to ensure that any overcrowded migrant boat spotted by passing ships would have to be offered help.</p><p>Andrea Iacomini, spokesman for Unicef in Italy, urged Enrico Letta, the prime minister, to go to Europe and demand more co-ordination and help. He urged the interior ministers of all Mediterranean nations to hold an immediate conference focused on how to prevent tragedy from happening again.</p><p>\"We need to go to Europe and say that there is a humanitarian emergency in Italy. What are we doing about it? … We cannot have the victims on our consciences only afterwards,\" Iacomini said, claiming the Mediterranean had \"become a cemetery. And it will become even more so.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419036624|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|58590224ac70e252ac9524595ec178837fdcbd6a -->",

She fell back into the water as I called 'hold on, hold on',\" he told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. \"She was looking at me and didn't say anything; she was exhausted. She couldn't even float. I watched as she slid down, without a scream, with those eyes watching me.\"</p><p>Colapinto was among the dozens of rescuers who fought to save 155 African migrants, mainly Eritreans and Somalis, after their vessel caught fire, capsized and sank half a mile from Italian territory after sailing from Libya.</p><p>But with about 440 migrants on board, the death toll was presumed to be far higher than the 111 corpses recovered by Friday afternoon. As efforts to dive down to the sunken ship were called off because of bad weather, a ferry arrived on the holiday island carrying 100 coffins and four hearses to collect the dead from a hangar at the airport. There they lay in rows, identified by numbers, many dressed in their best clothes as if waiting for a wedding.</p><p>Accompanying Colapinto as dawn rose on Thursday was his nephew Francesco Colapinto, who said he saw more than 20 migrants in the water sink out of sight, \"their arms raised, like statues\".</p><p>Close by, Vito Fiorino was asleep on his anchored yacht with friends when he was awoken by a noise like seagulls, before he realised the sea was awash with survivors and the sounds were cries for help.</p><p>Fiorino's group pulled 47 survivors from the sea, some of them repeating the word \"child\", as if asking them to search for their children, Corriere della Sera reported. \"But I didn't manage to find one,\" said Alessandro Marino, who was with Fiorino.</p><p>As the light grew, five motor launches that had arrived to pick up floating corpses were seen returning to Lampedusa's port, their decks piled so high with bodies that some toppled back into the sea.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419121426'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380904415165/Holding-centre-in-Lampedu-008.jpg' alt='Holding centre in Lampedusa' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Migrants rest on mattresses at a holding centre in Lampedusa. Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Simone D'Ippolito was setting out to sea with a group of diving students when he was told how the 66ft vessel had burned and sunk rapidly after passengers set fire to a blanket to attract attention.  \"I went back, dropped the clients and headed out,\" he told La Repubblica. \"It was a shocking scene, hard to describe. The first feeling was pain to see so many bodies, a sea of bodies.\"<br /><br />As the rescue effort continued, one body lined up on the quayside started to vomit water and fuel. Kebrat, a 24-year-old Eritrean woman, was taken by helicopter to hospital in Palermo in Sicily.  She said she had been travelling alone on the doomed vessel. \"I am escaping from the devastation caused by the war,\" she told La Repubblica. \"I am seeking a better life in Italy. I am searching for work. I have lived for years in fear.\"</p><p>Other survivors bedded down outdoors and in the back of a refrigerator truck at the overflowing holding centre.</p><p>Berakhe, 32, an Eritrean, was phoning home to announce his safe arrival. \"I will take us all to Norway, I swear. All the others are at the bottom of the river,\" La Repubblica quoted him saying.</p><p>Father Mussie Zerai, a Rome-based priest who assists migrants, said he had received hundreds of calls from panicking relatives of passengers who had paid their life savings to be on board the boat.</p><p>\"Right now, there are probably another 10,000 waiting in Libya to board boats, with about 2,500 Eritreans locked up in detention centres until they pay corrupt officials to be freed,\" said Zerai.</p><p>Italian prime minister Enrico Letta's centre-left Democratic party called on the EU to set up \"humanitarian corridors\" to provide protection for migrant boats.</p><p>The anti-immigrant Northern League blamed the country's first black minister, Cécile Kyenge, for giving \"dangerous\" encouragement to migrants with her calls for softening the immigration rules.</p><p>\"On that boat, in place of those desperate people, it could have been me,\" said the Congolese-born Kyenge.</p><p>After reports that some fishing boats had ignored the sinking vessel, local fisherman said they were often hesitant to pick up migrants at sea since they risked their boats being seized under Italy's tough laws on illegal migrants.</p><p>\"This immigration law is killing people,\" said Enzo, a 44-year-old fisherman from Lampedusa.</p><p>Investigators were questioning a Tunisian man who was among the survivors and was believed to be one of the traffickers who charged each passenger at least €1,000 (£625) to sail, making the vessel's human cargo worth almost €500,000.</p><p>Zerai said the detention centres in Libya that awaited migrants after their long journey from sub-Saharan Africa had fixed rates for release.</p><p>\"They pay $700 to be released from the centre at Misrata and $1,000 to be released from the centre at Kufra, although that covers transport to Tripoli,\" he said. \"The traffickers that run the boats are more or less the same armed militia men who control the detention centres. Since the fall of Gaddafi there is no real difference between the police, soldiers and the traffickers.\"</p><p>The other difference in post-Gaddafi Libya was a steep increase in racism toward black Africans and Christians, he said. \"The UN is present in Libya, but they don't have a mandate from the EU to select or prepare those who need asylum, and they are often stopped from visiting the detention centres,\" Zerai said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419101567|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|9171dae4e81318b974a016093fb024ef8db9c6ea -->",
