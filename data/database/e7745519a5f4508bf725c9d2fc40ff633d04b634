        "headline":"The NBA is more fun with Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook",
        "body":"<p>The first week of the NBA season is always a bit tricky to write about, it's too early to say anything but too much has actually happened to just say nothing. So, as always, every bit of information imparted below should be read with the caveat \"it's early though\". If the Philadelphia 76ers are still fighting for the number one seed in the Eastern Conference come springtime, for instance, expect most sports prognosticators <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcWTIWYDMQ\">to pull a Werner Herzog and eat their own shoes</a>. With that in mind, here's some of the things we've learned in the first week of real NBA action in the 2013-14 season.</p><h2>Chris Paul will be in the MVP discussions this year</h2><p>These last few years have not been a great time to be a MVP candidate in the NBA. First of all, there's that whole LeBron James thing, when you're playing around the same time as someone who may end up being the best of all time, you pretty much have to wait around until he gets injured or voters are sick of handing him hardware to get your chance. Then, of course, there's the fact that there's that Kevin Durant guy, who is almost as talented as LeBron and a few years younger to boot. The field gets even more crowded when you factor in the return of Derrick Rose, the Chicago point guard who was the last guy not named LeBron to win it. Plus old-timers like Tim Duncan from the San Antonio Spurs and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers could always have a MVP-caliber season remaining to sway the often-times sentimental voters.</p><p>So, it's been a bit tricky time to be Chris Paul, despite the fact that he could very well be the best point guard in the league. After biding his time with the New Orleans Hornets, mostly ignored by the media, Paul forced a trade to Los Angeles, landing with the Clippers after NBA Commissioner David Stern nixed a trade that would have made him the next Lakers legend. While he single-handedly turned the Clippers into a force in the Western Conference <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyoL5BwqDOs\">- while teaming up with forward Blake Griffin for highlight-reel plays</a> - the Clippers weren't able to get past the first round of the playoffs and Paul has yet to find his name even on the the shortlist of MVP hopefuls.</p><p>In the NBA, just like in most sports, individual awards are often dependent on how well one's team does, which might be a big reason why Chris Paul encouraged the Clippers to make a change at head coach during the offseason. (Of course, the main reason that Paul used his influence to get rid of Vinny del Negro probably had something to do with the fact that del Negro kinda sucked.) With former Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers in the fold, and the Lakers struggling to find an identity with Kobe Bryant out with an Achilles injury, the Clippers finally have the big stage to themselves, and Paul has been making the most out of it.</p><p>The Clippers have started out their season 3-1, with the biggest reason for their success being Paul. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/11/5/5068250/chris-paul-la-clippers-pace-hook\">Paul has been averaging 26 points and 13 assists per game, while shooting 51 percent from the floor</a>. While past performance still has Durant as the most likely MVP candidate to come out of the Western Conference, Paul will be in the conversation.</p><h2>Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook have returned</h2><p>Talk about two different timetables, Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook both suffered season-ending injuries early on during their teams' playoff runs so, in that sense, it's not a surprise that they made their regular season returns within days of each other. Well, except for the fact that the Chicago Bulls lost point guard Derrick Rose early in the 2012 NBA Playoffs while the Oklahoma City Thunder lost Russell Westbrook to a meniscus tear in their first round playoffs run against the Houston Rockets in 2013.</p><p>When Derrick Rose injured his ACL in the closing moments of the Chicago Bulls' first playoff game of 2012, it threw the entire Eastern Conference into chaos. Rose was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2011 and was supposed to be the closest thing that the Miami Heat's LeBron James had to a rival in the East. Instead, the Miami Heat's 2012 run to the NBA Finals went through an aging Boston Celtics team rather than the young, tough Chicago Bulls. As Rose took his time recovering from his injury in 2012, a decision which he was heavily criticized for, the superstar-free Indiana Pacers emerged as the team most likely to stop the superstar-centric Miami Heat.</p><p>When Rose finally returned to the Chicago Bulls during this preseason, there was a lot of hype that the Bulls would finally emerge as the clear second-best team in the Eastern Conference. After all, the Bulls managed to remain dangerous without Rose, center Joakim Noah emerged as a team leader, Jimmy Butler had a breakout season in Rose's absence and head coach Tom Thibodeau's squad took on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">a very physical defensive identity that gave the Miami Heat fits at times</a>.</p><p><em></em><br />Unfortunately for Chicago, waiting around until Rose felt completely healthy hasn't paid off early on in the 2013-14 season as they've won just one game since Rose's return. <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/chi-derrick-rose-chicago-bulls-turnovers-20131103,0,5091853.story\">Rose still looks rusty</a>, and the only good thing about how the Bulls have been playing recently is that it has settled fan fears that Rose-at-75% could have given the Chicago a shot at beating the Heat last postseason. A completely recovered Derrick Rose could very well make the Chicago Bulls one of the most dangerous teams in the Eastern Conference, but it's not clear that we've seen a completely recovered Derrick Rose yet.</p><p>When the Oklahoma City Thunder lost Russell Westbrook to a meniscus injury halfway through their opening round playoff series against the Houston Rockets, they essentially lost any chance they had to make it to back-to-back NBA Finals. Without Westbrook, it was up to Kevin Durant to account for nearly all of his team's offensive output. While the immensely talented Durant was able to keep the Thunder in games, he was clearly gassed by the time the fourth quarter came around. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9280528/nba-playoffs-2013-memphis-grizzlies-finished-oklahoma-city-thunder-game-5\">The Memphis Grizzlies were able to dispatch the Thunder in the second round of the playoffs</a>, clearing the space that allowed the San Antonio Spurs to make their surprise return to the Finals.</p><p>Although it seemed like once again Kevin Durant would have to keep his team afloat at the start of the 2013-14 season, Westbrook's timetable for return kept getting pushed up. Instead of missing the first few weeks of the season, as everyone expected, Westbrook made his return <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2013-11-03/russell-westbrook-return-okc-thunder-suns-result-score-stats-knee-injury-torn-meniscus-kevin-durant-reggie-jackson-jeremy-lamb\">in Sunday's win over the Phoenix Suns</a>. The worry that Thunder fans have about Westbrook is the exact opposite that Bulls fans had about Rose: is Westbrook just trying to push his way back to full strength too soon? To those of us neutral observers, we can only hope that Rose and Westbrook's returns stick, because the NBA is a lot more fun with the two of them in uniform than it is with them in suits on the sidelines.</p><h2>Philadelphia 76ers can't even tank right</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/nba-2013-14-season-preview\">In the Guardian's NBA preview</a> we compared the Philadelphia 76ers season with the Mel Brooks film <em>The Producers</em>. If the goal of the Broadway producers in that movie was to lose money, the goal of this Philadelphia 76rs season was to lose games, as many as possible in order to set them up as this is the best chance to pick early in this year's NBA Draft. Call it \"Springtime for Wiggins\". It's - we can't emphasize this enough - very early in the season but instead the 76ers have started out with a 3-1 record, putting them in second place in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Just like in <em>The Producers</em>, the Philadelphia 76ers' plan seems to have hit a snag, an unexpected run-in with accidental success. In the 76ers case that snag is named Michael Carter-Williams. With the Draft day media attention focused more on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/28/nba-draft-number-one-anthony-bennett\">the 76ers trading away Jrue Holiday in order to pick up Nerlens Noel</a>, the first clear sign that the franchise was tanking, there wasn't a lot of attention paid when the team selected Syracuse star Carter-Williams with the 11th overall pick.</p><p>Instead, Michael Carter-Williams has taken advantage of playing his rookie season for a rebuilding team containing very few established players, averaging 21 points, nine assists, five rebounds and four steals a game. That was enough for <a href=\"http://www.syracuse.com/axeman/index.ssf/2013/11/michael_carter-williams_named.html\">Carter-Williams to be named Eastern Conference Player of the Week</a>, and gain an early lead NBA Rookie of the Year talk. Of course, if he keeps this up, expect Philadelphia management to sideline him with a mysterious injury before he completely ruins their season.</p><h2>The New York Knicks are struggling</h2><p>What's more embarrassing, to succeed when you're attempting to tank or to fail when you're expected to take advantage of a weaker conference? While the Philadelphia 76ers keep unexpectedly winning, the Knicks are struggling with a 1-3 record, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-131105/daily-dime\">including a home loss to the still-woeful Charlotte Bobcats</a>.</p><p>The news could be getting worse for New York depending on the latest information regarding center Tyson Chandler. Chandler is the key to New York's defense, heck during certain stretches of time he has been the entirety of New York's defense. If Chandler remains sidelined for too long with a right knee injury he suffered in Tuesday night's game, then it seems unlikely that things will get much better in the early-going for New York. <a href=\"http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2013/11/06/chandler-injury-a-big-scare-for-knicks/\">As head coach Mike Woodson put it succinctly</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Our defense … It stinks right now\".</p></blockquote><p>If Tyson Chandler is out for any extended time, this might be the best chance for their new-look rivals in the Brooklyn Nets to make New York their town. If Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov really wants to test the loyalty of the Knicks faithful, this writer strongly recommends that he starts floating rumors that Isiah Thomas will be returning as Knicks' GM. Knicks fans have long since proven they can handle losing, but that? <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-gm-mills-forget-isiah-article-1.1483383\">That might be too much</a>.</p><h2>Other things we've learned this week</h2><p>• If Philadelphia seems to be having problems figuring out this whole tanking business, they can look to the Boston Celtics for some inspiration. Not only has Boston started out 0-4 under new head coach Brad Stevens, that stretch includes <a href=\"http://www.csnne.com/boston-celtics/cs-blow-22-point-lead-lose-home-opener-bucks?p=ya5nbcs&amp;ocid=yahoo\">letting a 22 point lead over the Milwaukee Bucks slip away in their home opener</a>.</p><p>• Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers remain the last of the unbeaten teams. No wonder David Stern was determined to retire mid-way through this season, he's just one LeBron James injury away from trying to explain to advertisers why their premiere franchise is located in Indianapolis. That's way more crowd shots of Andrew Luck for a national broadcast to have to lean on.</p><p>• Meanwhile surprise number one 2013 NBA Draft pick Anthony Bennett of the Cleveland Cavaliers has yet to actually <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24191878/four-games-in-and-cavs-anthony-bennett-yet-to-make-first-basket\">do that thing where you throw a ball up during an actual game and it lands in a hoop for points</a>, as his scoring has been limited to two free throws and zero field goals. At this rate, the Cavs might as well have signed out-for-the-season Nerlens Noel.</p><p>• The New Orleans Hornets are now officially the New Orleans Pelicans and to celebrate they introduced a brand new, <del>family-friendly mascot</del> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-new-orleans-pelicans-reveal-mascot-and-its-very-scary-20131031,0,5023236.story#axzz2js3Z6fN9\">Oh my god what the fresh hell is this?</a></p><p>• It's hit the point where the only truly funny segments on \"Saturday Night Live\" are their sports-related parodies, <a href=\"http://www.sportsgrid.com/video/snl-jay-pharoahs-shaq-impersonation/\">so it's nice to see Jay Pharoah unleash a ridiculous but amusing impression of Shaquille O'Neal</a> at the start of the NBA season. Of course, Pharoah's Shaq is far more insightful and eloquent than the real one, but they still have time to fine-tune it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421790438|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|407a9bc492a502f937219473725c430dab4963db -->",

        "body":"<p>Alastair Cook has been on the receiving end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/shane-warnes-criticism-may-have-been-fair-admits-alastair-cook\" title=\"\">Shane Warne's criticisms</a> since England started beating Australia last summer. In response three options were open to the England captain: to counterattack vigorously; to smile quietly like a choirboy, ignore the barbs and occasionally point at the scorecards; or – and this is the clever one – to agree with him, a reaction that can disconcert antipodean antagonists at a stroke.</p><p>In Australia, Cook has shrewdly opted for a combination of the last two. He politely agrees with Warne that he has much to learn about captaincy – \"I could be more imaginative,\" he says. More specifically, after Warne advocated that his old Hampshire mate Michael Carberry should open the batting because Joe Root might be \"crucified\" at the top of the order, Cook has proceeded to follow that course.</p><p>The probability is that the England hierarchy was not swayed by Warne's headline-grabbing observations, delivered at a Sky TV promotion, but the elevation of Carberry has two possible happy consequences.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/06/michael-carberry-states-ashes-case-with-unbeaten-153\" title=\"\">England's creakiness at the top of the order might be resolved</a> and it might keep Warne quiet for a while. Now Warne, Darren Lehmann's mate and Michael Clarke's best friend, might be seen as the tourists' unwitting strategist rather than their constant tormentor. No doubt England's analyst is on red alert in case the best captain Australia never had delivers a few more gems.</p><p>The promotion of Carberry reminds us that England are not as intransigent as they are often made out to be. This is not the first time they have surprised us. Leaving aside the selection of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/21/australia-shane-watson-england-woakes-kerrigan\" title=\"\">Simon Kerrigan and Chris Woakes at The Oval</a> in their last Test match, think back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/14/england-joe-root-dream-india\" title=\"\">Nagpur in December 2012</a>, where they first selected Joe Root. This was not expected, yet it was a triumph for rational thinking.</p><p>England had won two Tests against India quite brilliantly yet Cook and his advisers decided to change a winning combination. They ditched Samit Patel – they decided they did not need his bowling – and opted for Root, who hit a timely, time-consuming 73 in the middle order. It seems an obvious move now; it didn't then.</p><p>Now the probability is that Root, after opening throughout the recent Ashes series, will resume as a middle-order batsman. Carberry has had a dream start to his tour and is surely favourite to partner Cook in Brisbane.</p><p>There are caveats about Carberry's success – the pitches have been very flat, the bowling modest and the atmosphere far removed from what is anticipated at a steamy Gabba in a fortnight's time – but they are not sufficient for England to change course.</p><p>It is easy to be tempted by the idea of Root, who has opened the batting for the bulk of his first-class career, being stationed at six. If everything goes to plan he can be around to deal with the second new ball after Carberry and co have dealt with the first one. Smiles all round, except for Root's Yorkshire colleague, Jonny Bairstow.</p><p>Bairstow is fast becoming the fall guy in the England camp. Upon boarding the plane at Heathrow he might have been forgiven for thinking that he was England's likeliest No6 while Root continued as an opening batsman.</p><p>Now it seems as if Bairstow is likely to resume his Test career only if Matt Prior damages a finger on the morning of the match. In Hobart, he has to trot off to the nets again with Bruce French (England's wicketkeeping coach) while another county colleague, Gary Ballance, has been given another chance after his first-ball duck in Perth.</p><p>This may be construed as a compassionate selection – though not necessarily by Bairstow. And maybe Warne, a godsend to the media during the phoney-war phase of the tour, will rail that the omission of Bairstow, a firebrand of a batsman, is another example of England's negativity. In which case it seems Cook might not agree with him this time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421807939|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|90c7df4af7e1e66b4d41eea62cd1c7cc604a6570 -->",

There are conflicting reports concerning El Macca in the opener at Chepstow. The jockey's mount is forecast to go off favourite and though connections reportedly believe he is not high-class material he may be good enough in an ordinary race.</p><p></p><p>He is not the sort of favourite I would be backing and <strong>Brave Buck (3.15)</strong>, market leader in the handicap hurdle later on the card, is much more to my liking. The selection looks to have excellent prospects having showed much-imporved form to win last week and with the form already boosted.</p><p></p><p>Much the same argument can be made for <strong>Forest Walker (1.20) </strong>at Warwick.

        "headline":"Whatever Shane Warne says, the Ashes sledgers need to raise their game",
        "body":"<p>Given how studiedly manscaped he is these days, it wouldn't be the most enormous stretch if trash-talking dandy Shane Warne simply swept into the Ashes commentary box on the first day of the series, adjusted his monocle, and declared that to be tired of sledging is to be tired of cricket.</p><p>But is it? The veneration of the practice continues unabated in some quarters, yet with each Ashes series I find the easily amused glee in this aspect of proceedings slightly more tedious than I did the last time around. A ball of the series has yet to be bowled, but already the keepers of the annals are celebrating new entries, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/ashes-alastair-cook-shane-warne-england\" title=\"\">Warne's digs at Alastair Cook</a> grabbing a wearingly predictable number of headlines, before being parried by no less Wildean a figure than Will Carling. \"Bloody hell even their sledging is now shite!!!\" he sledged.</p><p>Once the action proper starts, and snippets of the on-pitch repartee filter out, many will celebrate whatever the latest variants are concerning a player's BMI and the sexual appetite of his spouse. Lest we forget, this is an art form which, with very few exceptions, can be boiled down to the endless rehashing of part or all of the following: You're shit, you're fat, and I've shagged your wife. Who's a shit.</p><p>Naturally, there are rare occasions when only calling someone a fat expletive will do, and a cheap laugh can be a genuine hoot, if it is deployed rarely enough to be a surprise – the retaliatory equivalent of Indiana Jones being confronted by the master swordsman and simply pulling out his pistol and shooting him. Used anything other than very sparingly indeed, however, it's a bore. Or, as the nursery disciplinary code used to run: first time funny, second time silly, third time smack.</p><p>Strip away the befuddling nostalgia around the celebrated examples of sledging down the years, and they have mostly dated terribly. The moments of genuine wit are so few and far between as to almost conform to the infinite-monkeys-on-infinite-typewriters principle. The moments of insight are arguably even fewer, which is perhaps why other sports have failed to adopt what is so often fabled as a match-winning form of verbal combat. Tennis stars, for instance, have yet to serve up their aces with a chaser of what they imagine to be the equivalent of a cheeky Bruce Willis one-liner.</p><p>Yet apparently on the basis that WG Grace was a bit lippy – albeit in a considerably more mannerly fashion – sledging continues to be referred to as \"a noble tradition\". Traditions are always unthinkingly noble, aren't they? In fact, \"noble traditions\" are a bit like \"billionaire philanthropists\" – you can't seem to have one half of the epithet without the other. Except, of course, you can.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one tells the self-styled grand masters, which is possibly why some articles on the noble tradition still feel able to speak admiringly of an ancient exchange between Beefy Botham and Rod Marsh. \"How's your wife and my kids?\" inquired Marsh, as you may recall. \"The wife's fine,\" retorted Botham, \"the kids are retarded.\" (Hey – he does a lot for charity, innit.)</p><p>Perhaps the only other place where the bar of wit is set so low is Westminster. There, Dennis Skinner can deliver some dead-on-arrival non-zinger, only for at least half the House to threaten to do themselves a mischief, so hysterical is their mirth. A few months ago the prime minister could not suppress his self-admiring laughter as he honked the following at the Labour front benches: \"I know I've been the one on holiday in Ibiza – but they've been the ones taking policy-altering substances!\" What can you say? Anywhere normal, this clunkfest would have been met with either withering silence or a pitying groan. In Westminster, it was received so rapturously it practically broke the laughter track.</p><p>This tends to be the way in all hermetically sealed worlds, particularly those whose defining characteristic is impregnable self-regard. Outside of the Premier League, for instance, what is always glorified as \"mind games\" could be simply classified as bad manners or being babyish. But within the bubble, where all critical faculties are apparently suspended, it is routinely regarded as game theorising on a par with the stratagems deployed by either side in the most mutually paranoid days of the cold war. And so with cricket sledging, where – within the Center Parcs of on-pitch idiocy – someone offering a variant on someone's wife's post-coital generosity with the biscuits is regarded as having out-Twained Twain.</p><p>Study the collected works of sledging, and it becomes clear that the bread and butter of the 21st century form is largely artless, low-level abuse delivered by people who think swearing is always funny. Which isn't to say swearing can't be hilarious – if it is done well. Done badly, though, it is not a substitute for wit, but another lame gag whose reliance on a naughty word merely foregrounds its failure in all other aspects.</p><p>As for whether it could be done better, one can but dream. Given this is the era of technical innovations and scripted so-called reality shows, I implore the International Cricket Council to embrace modernity and consider hiring The Thick of It's brilliant&nbsp;swearing consultant, Ian Martin. In an ideal world, he'd write the sledging for an entire Ashes series – but under this sort of time pressure, I'd settle for him being flown out to Australia without delay, to deliver a&nbsp;crash course to both sides in raising their game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421788468|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|fc8044065a8b0ae5976dfaff855e1e0b6ff4521e -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry says Shane Warne influence is behind England century",
        "body":"<p>Shane Warne would have loved it. Sitting at a table in the gym that serves as the press conference area at the work-in-progress that is the Blundstone Arena, Michael Carberry sang his praises as \"basically the reason why I actually got a chance to play Test cricket\" – and at the back of the room, Joe Root, the man who had been dropped down the order by England to make way for Carberry at the top, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/sport/blog/2013/nov/06/shane-warne-sledging-ashes\" title=\"\">as Warne had helpfully suggested</a>, had completed a cycling session with Matt Prior, so had to listen to every word.</p><p>Carberry had spent six blissful hours at the crease with Alastair Cook, the man who seems highly likely to be both his opening partner and captain in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in a fortnight. They became the first England pair to bat through a completed day since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998, and the first England openers to put on 300 in any fixture since <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/22322.html\" title=\"\">Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook's 359</a> in South Africa in December 1948.</p><p>Hard to believe that only a week ago Carberry was widely expected to have a long and frustrating tour, having been brought to Australia purely as cover for the opening pair of Cook and Root; and that last winter he was working as an electrician in Southampton, with reason to believe that at the age of 32, the single Test cap he won in Bangladesh in 2010 would be his last.</p><p>Two years before that, he was denied a trip to Australia, as a member of the England Performance Programme who shadowed the 2010-11 Ashes squad, after blood clots were found on his lungs. \"It's obviously been well-documented that I have had some tough times personally off the field,\" he said with considerable understatement after potentially the most significant and timely innings of a long and character-building career.</p><p>\"By the grace of God, I'm here to enjoy what I'm doing now. When things like that happen, it gives you perspective on your cricket. It made me probably relax more, and try to enjoy the game for what it is – rather than, as young players do, put pressure on yourself to get where you want to get to.\"</p><p>So even now, he insisted, \"I'm trying not to look too far ahead. I'll worry about the Gabba when I get there.\"</p><p>But there was no sheepishness about his tribute to Warne, even with Root in his eyeline. \"I think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/06/england-joe-root-michael-carberry\" title=\"\">Shane Warne</a> is basically the reason why I actually got a chance to play Test cricket,\" added Carberry, who had underachieved in two seasons with Surrey and three with Kent before joining Warne at Hampshire.</p><p>\"I was a young guy, a little bit lost in county cricket. I came to Hampshire – and from day one, he made me feel very much at home and gave me the backing every young player needs. He allowed me to play a brand of cricket I wanted to play. I think he was very influential in terms of me doing what I've done, then getting the chance to play for England a few years on.\"</p><p>The influence has not ended there. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/06/michael-carberry-test-england-bangladesh\" title=\"\">Whenever I've caught up with Shane</a>, he's always had very kind things to say about my game. He's someone I still keep in contact with, even though he might be overseas. He's always been a great friend to me.\"</p><p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p><p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/28/england-new-zealand-second-test\" title=\"\">second Test against New Zealand in May</a>, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls – of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day – efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p><p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p><p>The selection of Australia's A team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers – Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p><p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half-century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p><p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p><p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p><p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p><p>Chris Tremlett was the other eye-catching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421788334|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|45c5327fd9a38a0ba6fb383173c631797d0347f5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tony McCoy's bid to complete the remarkable milestone of 4,000 career winners over jumps is unlikely to be achieved at Chepstow on Wednesday after one of his two mounts was declared a non-runner.</p><p>The multiple champion jockey needs two more victories to reach his target, but Mission Complete was taken out of the his intended race owing to the soft ground prevalent at the Welsh track.</p><p>McCoy had already rated his chances of completing his mission at Chepstow \"slim\" when he spoke to reporters after a luckless day at Exeter on Tuesday.</p><p>McCoy's only ride at Chepstow, El Macca, runs in the opening maiden hurdle at 1.10pm. Unless the rider gets another ride on the card, McCoy must wait until Thursday, where he is expected to ride at Towcester, before he can attempt to bring up the landmark.</p><p>Jonjo O'Neill, who supplies the bulk of McCoy's rides, does have another runner in Minella For Steak in the race in which Mission Complete was withdrawn and there is a possibility that the jockey may switch to ride the gelding, on whom he won at Ffos Las last week.</p><p>McCoy was, indeed, booked to ride Minella For Steak at the initial declaration stage on Tuesday. The sport's rules allow him to be switched onto the horse at any time until shortly before the race at 2.40pm, since his intended mount has been taken out of the race.</p><p>His two rides on Thursday at Towcester are both owned by J P McManus, his longstanding employer and friend. Church Field has already won four races this year, though he faces 15 rivals in a competitive handicap hurdle. McCoy's second ride on that card is Mountain Tunes, bought by McManus for £75,000 at auction in April after winning a point-to-point race in Ireland. He will line up in a novice hurdle.</p><p>McCoy had expected to have a rare day off on Friday, following the abandonment of the card scheduled at Fontwell, where the course is waterlogged. But a replacement card has been arranged for that day at Southwell and it is thought that he may have rides there. Initial entries will be published this afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421787073|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|f6631b5663d0a90fc2562af9928c6e33990caf45 -->",

That's a whole different scenario.\"</p> <p>Stewards formally issued the charges on Wednesday with the trainers to appear before the Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board on Friday afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421776876|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|8b75f61b31536b6a987b12a5a937e9f2e161f192 -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry states Ashes case with unbeaten 153",
        "body":"<p>Michael Carberry seized an unexpected opportunity to make an eloquent case to be Alastair Cook's opening partner in the first Ashes Test in a fortnight with his first century in an England shirt on a blissful day at the Blundstone Arena.</p> <p>Carberry, who made 78 in the first game of the tour in Perth when Cook was ruled out by a back injury, was surprisingly selected to open with the captain against a higher-calibre Australia A attack, forcing Joe Root to drop back to the middle order.</p> <p>England briefed that there were still no guarantees about their Brisbane selection - &ldquo;We are open to all possibilities,&rdquo; Cook had said before the match. But Carberry could hardly have done any more, combining skill and stamina to make an unbeaten 153 as he and Cook became the first England pair to bat through a whole day's play since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998.</p> <p>Suddenly a Test recall at the age of 33, almost four years since he won a single cap in Bangladesh in early 2010 &ndash; also as Cook's opening partner, when Andrew Strauss was taking a break &ndash; is looming not as the long shot it seemed only a week ago, but as a probability.</p> <p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p> <p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the second Test against New Zealand in May, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls &ndash; of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day &ndash; efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p> <p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p> <p>The selection of Australia's A-team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers &ndash; Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p> <p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p> <p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p> <p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p> <p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p> <p>Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen are due in next but attention now will focus on Root and Gary Ballance, who was again selected ahead of their Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow to give him another chance to impress after his dismissal for a golden duck in Perth.</p> <p>Chris Tremlett was the other eyecatching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421768555|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|becd3bf08e7b83a1d33401a1042cfeadc3782a68 -->",

        "headline":"André Villas-Boas blasts 'incompetent critics' in Hugo Lloris concussion row",
        "body":"<p>André Villas-Boas has angrily defended his decision to allow Hugo Lloris to continue playing against Everton on Sunday despite the goalkeeper appearing disoriented after being hit on the head by Romelu Lukaku's knee as the pair challenged for a ball.</p><p>Tottenham Hotspur have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/tottenham-villas-boas-goal-record-everton\" title=\"\">widely criticised for not substituting the player</a> but Villas-Boas insisted that the club did nothing wrong and accused \"incompetent people\" of turning on Tottenham solely to attract attention to themselves. Villas-Boas also said it was \"remarkable\" Lukaku's role in the incident has not been quesioned further and suggested the Everton striker could have avoided the clash.</p><p>Tottenham originally intended to replace Lloris with Brad Friedel after the incident but the Frenchman demanded to play on and, after examination on the pitch by the club doctor, Shabaaz Mughal, and club physiotherapist, Geoff Scott, Villas-Boas let him do so.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/05/tottenham-hugo-lloris-head-injury\" title=\"\"> That decision has since been condemned</a> by, among others, the Professonal Footballers' Association, the international players' union FifPro, Fifa's chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, and the head injury charity Headway, who described the club's actions as \"dangerous and irresponsible\". However, Villas-Boas remains unrepentant.</p><p>\"I stand absolutely by the decision that I took and the decision that the medical department has taken following the checks that they made on the player, all of which were according to the book,\" said Villas-Boas. \"I stand by the decisions that gave us the green light for the player to continue. I have nothing else to say regarding that matter. I registered the fact that a couple of people have taken this opportunity to find a chance to get themselves publicised, people who have had no experience on the pitch whatsoever in this type of situation.\"</p><p>As far as the club are concerned Lloris did not lose consciousness and was not concussed as a result of the blow to the head.</p><p>Villas-Boas suggested that it is wrong to question the responsibility of the same medical staff whose actions helped save the life of Fabrice Muamba when the former Bolton Wanderers player collapsed from cardiac arrest during an FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane two years ago.</p><p>\"Two persons and the medical department that two years ago saved the life of a player on the pitch has been completely forgotten, poorly treated and badly respected by lots of opinion-makers.</p><p>\"What is extremely disappointing is the fact that two persons – a great doctor and a great physio who saved the life of Fabrice Muamba – were put into question by lots of incompetent people and people who have no experience on the pitch, in the action, in the moment. That is extremely serious and disappointing.\"</p><p>Lloris underwent a precautionary brain scan on Sunday night, during which nothing irregular was detected. Nevertheless, the incident ignited a debate regarding the effectiveness with which footballer clubs tend to deal with head injuries, with critics suggesting that other sports handle them with more appropriate prudence. Villas-Boas said any comparison between the Lloris incident and others was spurious. \"My medical department has followed the Premier League guidelines for this type of situation, that's the only thing I can tell you,\" he said. \"The situation is obviously not comparable to NFL situations, rugby situations or Petr Cech's situation. It astonishes me that you try to put this in the same mould as situations that happened in the past. We have all the indications that the player is OK and we don't see incidents like this happening again.\"</p><p>Villas-Boas added that it was \"remarkable\" that Lukaku, whose injured his knee during the clash, has not come under more scrutiny for his role in the incident. The Portuguese, who was Chelsea manager when Lukaku joined that club from Anderlecht, claimed the striker could have moved his knee to prevent it hitting Lloris and said he was saddened that Belgian has not made contact with the goalkeeper since Sunday to check on his wellbeing.</p><p>\"I want to believe that Lukaku's leg was not left late to clash into Hugo's head. I find it remarkable that through all of this amount of publicity that this incident has got nobody has actually dedicated themselves to finding out if he could have avoided the goalkeeper and I am disappointed that Lukaku hasn't contacted Hugo.</p><p>\"Lukaku is a fantastic footballer and I don't question his integrity or his human side. We had a warm hug on the pitch before the game so I have maximum respect for him and I think he has for me. But amid all this negative excitement I find it surprising that no time was lost to actually study the incident. I don't want to question Lukaku. He's a young player and wonderfully gifted but I think he could have jumped over perfectly.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421793382|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|43e71ec5c7b52f54092a6d20575060006a6a7325 -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United's David Moyes refuses to criticise Ashley Young dive",
        "body":"<p>David Moyes refused to condemn Ashley Young as the Manchester United winger was involved in another diving controversy in the goalless Champions League draw at Real Sociedad.</p><p>The England international won a 69th-minute penalty for United – which was missed by his fellow substitute Robin van Persie – after reacting theatrically to a slight pull by the Sociedad midfielder Markel Bergara. Two former United players turned television pundits, Roy Keane and Ray Wilkins, accused Young of \"conning\" the Italian referee, Nicola Rizzoli, with Wilkins labelling the dive \"pathetic\".</p><p>But Moyes, who took Young to task for diving against Crystal Palace earlier in the season, would not be drawn on whether the midfielder had resorted to theatrics again. United had Marouane Fellaini sent off for a second bookable offence in the 90th minute and Moyes did say of the penalty: \"I thought there were some strange decisions all night and that was another one of them.\" But he refused to criticise Young's part in its award.</p><p>\"I have seen it again,\" the United manager said. \"The boy tugs him in the box. The referee is two yards away from it and decides to give it. He's got a penalty kick for a decision tonight. I don't know about his reputation but the referee is there and he gave it. The referee made decisions all night. He's the one who saw fit to award a penalty and send a player off. I thought the referee made the decision and that was the referee's choice.\"</p><p>The new Republic of Ireland assistant manager Keane was more forthright, however. \"He's obviously played for it,\" he told ITV. \"If you are a Man United player and you see a player getting tugged back, you want him to go down. Ashley Young's obviously gone down too much over the last few months. He's been heavily criticised in England but we are in a foreign country and it's more accepted. But he's almost conned the referee there. If he scores the penalty, as a United player you would be delighted, but he's conned the referee there.\"</p><p>Wilkins said on Sky Sports: \"This [dive] is pathetic. This is as bad for me as all these over-the-top tackles we're getting at the moment because that is a conning of the referee. I just wish Ashley would cut this out because he's a good player but he's getting a bad name.\"</p><p>Van Persie also hit the post from open play and Javier Hernández missed a glorious chance from six yards as United had the edge in the Basque country. Moyes said: \"I see it as a missed opportunity to take three points. We had some good chances, especially in the second half, and I felt we were worthy of getting all three.</p><p>\"We are still in a strong position. If we'd won it would have given us a really strong chance of winning the group. We are still top but I do feel like we've missed a chance tonight.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421754241|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|e2a61e578ed321f48ded7a046504eaad953057e4 -->",

        "headline":"Michael Carberry states Ashes case with unbeaten 153",
        "body":"<p>Michael Carberry seized an unexpected opportunity to make an eloquent case to be Alastair Cook's opening partner in the first Ashes Test in a fortnight with his first century in an England shirt on a blissful day at the Blundstone Arena.</p> <p>Carberry, who made 78 in the first game of the tour in Perth when Cook was ruled out by a back injury, was surprisingly selected to open with the captain against a higher-calibre Australia A attack, forcing Joe Root to drop back to the middle order.</p> <p>England briefed that there were still no guarantees about their Brisbane selection - &ldquo;We are open to all possibilities,&rdquo; Cook had said before the match. But Carberry could hardly have done any more, combining skill and stamina to make an unbeaten 153 as he and Cook became the first England pair to bat through a whole day's play since Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash in a tour game against South Australia in Adelaide in 1998.</p> <p>Suddenly a Test recall at the age of 33, almost four years since he won a single cap in Bangladesh in early 2010 &ndash; also as Cook's opening partner, when Andrew Strauss was taking a break &ndash; is looming not as the long shot it seemed only a week ago, but as a probability.</p> <p>Cook also capitalised on the chance to build some early-tour form, in his first competitive innings since the fifth Test at The Oval in August, ending the day with 154 in which his complete authority over the toiling home bowlers occasionally bordered on contempt.</p> <p>It was his first century in 20 innings in all forms of cricket since the second Test against New Zealand in May, after he had an unusually lean trot in the home Ashes series. This was the Cook of the 2010-11 Australia tour, as he left the ball judiciously, picked off legside singles steadily, and punished loose balls &ndash; of which there were many, especially in the second half of the day &ndash; efficiently, whether driving the seamers through the covers, or rocking back to cut the spinners behind square on the off-side.</p> <p>There will be no danger of England getting carried away, however. A conspiracy theorist might wonder whether conditions here had been designed to be as far away as possible from those expected in Brisbane, a Tasmanian shirtfront devoid of pace or bounce.</p> <p>The selection of Australia's A-team was also suspicious, with only two specialist seamers &ndash; Trent Copeland, who had a good stint with Northamptonshire last summer, and Queensland's Ben Cutting. To be fair, they both posed some awkward questions with the new ball, and if they had found an edge from either Cook or Carberry, the day would obviously have been different.</p> <p>But by lunch England's new opening pair were in total control at 91 without loss off 31 overs, Cook having reached a 93-ball half century with consecutive pulled boundaries off Glenn Maxwell, the Victoria off-spinner who continued to drop short far too regularly throughout the day.</p> <p>Maxwell did cause a couple of flutters after lunch, with Carberry appearing uncertain and Cook cutting and missing. In fact for that third hour, Carberry was not overly impressive, scratching out 12 runs before he reached a 140-ball 50 with a boundary off the last ball before drinks.</p> <p>But he came out of his shell after that, reaching three figures in only 59 more deliveries and launching both Maxwell and the left-arm spinner Jon Holland for a straight six.</p> <p>The main question after tea was whether Cook, Carberry or both might retire, as Ian Bell did after scoring a century in the previous tour match, to allow more batsmen to have some practice. But this is a four-day match and England clearly judged it more important for the openers to make every effort to replicate Test conditions, with the added bonus of testing Cook's dodgy back to the limit.</p> <p>Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen are due in next but attention now will focus on Root and Gary Ballance, who was again selected ahead of their Yorkshire team-mate Jonny Bairstow to give him another chance to impress after his dismissal for a golden duck in Perth.</p> <p>Chris Tremlett was the other eyecatching inclusion in the England team, preferred to Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin as third seamer behind Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421768555|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|becd3bf08e7b83a1d33401a1042cfeadc3782a68 -->",

        "trailText":"The forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, said England wanted to 'put the throttle down' against Argentina but warned of their scrummaging threat",
        "headline":"Mako Vunipola injury opens door to Alex Corbisiero's England return",
        "body":"<p>The Lions prop Alex Corbisiero is set to return to England's front row against Argentina after Mako Vunipola was ruled out on Tuesday night with a strained knee ligament. A second front-row amendment could yet be required as Tom Youngs's wife is expecting the couple's first child and Bath's Rob Webber has been asked to stay on with the squad as cover.</p><p>The availability of Corbisiero, who played a leading role in the Lions series-clinching win in Sydney, is timely as England seek to counter Argentina's scrummaging threat at Twickenham on Saturday. The visitors lost all their Four Nations Tests and were beaten twice at home by England in June but the England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, is still predicting an intense set-piece \"battle\".</p><p>This season's new scrum laws, with pressure now being exerted after the initial engagement, suits the Pumas and Rowntree, a tireless student of front-row combat, says he does not expect a one-sided romp on Saturday against injury-hit opponents whose coach, Santiago Phelan, stepped aside on the eve of the tour.</p><p>\"We want to put the throttle down and go for this team,\" said Rowntree, acknowledging England were \"rusty\" for the first 50 minutes of their victory over Australia and need to improve. \"Even though they have a new coach and have a few players missing, I think they will come to Twickenham, play a very simple game and take us on in the forwards. Historically that's what they've done at Twickenham and I've a lot of respect for them. We have to match their threat … if they want to do that to us, we have to be in the battle to the end, otherwise we'll be made to look stupid.\"</p><p>Rowntree's research also suggests Argentina's scrums last more than eight seconds on average, approximately 25% longer than anyone else's, as they seek to squeeze as much energy out of their opponents as possible. \"They're big, physical and like a set-piece confrontation and that will never change. They like a long scrum. They want to punish you there.\"</p><p>Picking a strong-scrummaging hooker such as Dylan Hartley must be a serious temptation regardless of Youngs's availability, with competition for places increasingly fierce in every position, according to Rowntree.</p><p>\"Guys are putting their hands up every week and that's what we want. It's not about keeping people happy. I don't want them happy. There are some angry guys when they're not picked. What's important is we are honest and positive with them about why they are not playing or what they have to do better.\" There was good news for Geoff Parling, absent against Australia following a training knock, who has been recalled ahead of Dave Attwood. Danny Care, Christian Wade and Luther Burrell are also among the 27 players retained by the head coach, Stuart Lancaster.</p><p>Dan Cole, though, appears to have seen off the challenge of David Wilson for his tight-head shirt and is looking forward to propping against Marcos Ayerza, normally his colleague at Leicester.</p><p>\"If you don't get it right, they are good,\" said Cole. \"The Argentinians want to take you on in the scrum. The technique falls into place because they have a desire to beat you. They want to wear you out.</p><p>\"Speak to Marcos and there is a certain pride and honour in the way they scrum. They don't like cheating. It is a pushing contest and the team that gives up goes backwards. That is the gentlemanly way of doing it. It wears you out… the human body is not designed to be pushed backwards for long periods of time.\"</p><p>The durable Cole, set to win his 42nd cap since his debut in February 2010, is also looking to make up for not starting a Lions Test in Australia.</p><p>\"I did come back frustrated but the Lions won the series so I can't complain. I was happy to be involved in the Tests but obviously you want to start. You use it as motivation. The Lions' starting tight-head is probably the best tight-head in the world, or certainly up there. You want to be that person.\"</p><p>His chances of achieving this will partly rest on his workload over the next four years, the 26-year-old having been actively involved in no fewer than 40 games last season. \"I want to play every game for Leicester and England but you also seek to be the best you can be. I don't think 40 games a year is going to be that good for you. That's when you trust in your coaches to look after you.\"</p><p>The fly-half Katy McLean, meanwhile, will captain England's women against France at Twickenham on Saturday in place of the injured Sarah Hunter. The flanker Maggie Alphonsi is back for the first time in 20 months after a knee injury. The uncapped Bristol prop, Sasha Acheson, is on the bench.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421732119|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|bb065fafeef15b1a4cd24ed0dbc5748b855138f3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tony McCoy's bid to complete the remarkable milestone of 4,000 career winners over jumps is unlikely to be achieved at Chepstow on Wednesday after one of his two mounts was declared a non-runner.</p><p>The multiple champion jockey needs two more victories to reach his target, but Mission Complete was taken out of the his intended race owing to the soft ground prevalent at the Welsh track.</p><p>McCoy had already rated his chances of completing his mission at Chepstow \"slim\" when he spoke to reporters after a luckless day at Exeter on Tuesday.</p><p>McCoy's only ride at Chepstow, El Macca, runs in the opening maiden hurdle at 1.10pm. Unless the rider gets another ride on the card, McCoy must wait until Thursday, where he is expected to ride at Towcester, before he can attempt to bring up the landmark.</p><p>Jonjo O'Neill, who supplies the bulk of McCoy's rides, does have another runner in Minella For Steak in the race in which Mission Complete was withdrawn and there is a possibility that the jockey may switch to ride the gelding, on whom he won at Ffos Las last week.</p><p>McCoy was, indeed, booked to ride Minella For Steak at the initial declaration stage on Tuesday. The sport's rules allow him to be switched onto the horse at any time until shortly before the race at 2.40pm, since his intended mount has been taken out of the race.</p><p>His two rides on Thursday at Towcester are both owned by J P McManus, his longstanding employer and friend. Church Field has already won four races this year, though he faces 15 rivals in a competitive handicap hurdle. McCoy's second ride on that card is Mountain Tunes, bought by McManus for £75,000 at auction in April after winning a point-to-point race in Ireland. He will line up in a novice hurdle.</p><p>McCoy had expected to have a rare day off on Friday, following the abandonment of the card scheduled at Fontwell, where the course is waterlogged. But a replacement card has been arranged for that day at Southwell and it is thought that he may have rides there. Initial entries will be published this afternoon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421787073|2013-11-06T15:46:00Z|f6631b5663d0a90fc2562af9928c6e33990caf45 -->",

He gave a sample the following day and the test was negative. However, the consequences have rumbled on and Djokovic was clearly angry when asked to comment on the case on Tuesday night.</p><p>\"Viktor is a very good friend of mine,\" Djokovic said of his fellow Serb, shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-atp-world-tour-finals\" title=\"\">beating Roger Federer in the opening round of the ATP World Tour Finals </a>at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. \"I know him since I was eight years old. I've been involved very much in this case of his. I've been talking to him. I've been talking to his agent.</p><p>\"When you are randomly selected to go and provide the test – blood test or urine test – the representatives of Wada, anti-doping agency who are there in the tournament, are supposed to give you the clear indications and explain you the rules and regulations and what the severe consequences or penalties that you might undertake or you might have if you fail to provide the test. The representative, she didn't do that in his case.</p><p>\"First of all he's not positive on any banned substance. I'm not saying that it's completely not his fault but the way it was is that he had a medical pass where he was fainting … if he feels bad when he provides the blood test. He asked if it's possible to avoid providing blood test that day and he would come the next day – not because he wanted to hide anything, he just felt bad.\"</p><p>Djokovic added: \"I heard Andy Murray also said that he wants to take some action, making sure that he has [an] independent laboratory also following his tests that he provides to Wada and the Independent Drugs Tribunal. That says enough. I don't have trust in them any more. I don't have trust [in] what's going on.
