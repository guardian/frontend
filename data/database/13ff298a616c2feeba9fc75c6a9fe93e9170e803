Labor kept telling the voters he was a dysfunctional egomaniac who they couldn&rsquo;t possibly work with again, and the people kept telling the pollsters that they liked him better than Julia Gillard.</p> <p>In a democracy the voters inevitably win, although in this case the antipathy of many in Labor towards their former leader meant they left it until the final possible moment to change their minds.</p> <p>The future of the party now hinges on whether voters still like Rudd when he is leader again, or whether their professed preference for him was really a hankering for the way they felt when they elected him as \"Kevin07\", and politics still felt hopeful and positive &ndash; in contrast to the down and dirty shouting match it has been for the past three years.</p> <p>Rudd, who resigned tearfully when he was deposed before the 2010 election, will see the result as sweet vindication. But his real vindication will only come if he can lead Labor to a narrow loss, or even defy all predictions and emerge victorious.</p> <p>Gillard will now leave politics at the next election, gifting Rudd a better chance of unity than she ever had. She negotiated a more hazardous set of circumstances and endured more personal vitriol than any recent leader, with a resilience that amazed even her enemies.</p> <p>The outcome of Labor&rsquo;s latest leadership reversal really rests on Rudd&rsquo;s explanation as to why Labor has changed leaders yet again and what he will do differently this time - what he says to match Julia Gillard&rsquo;s contention in 2010 that she had wrested the leadership from him because Labor had been &ldquo;a good government that lost its way.&rdquo;</p> <p>Labor turned to Rudd again because polls showed he could raise its primary vote from 29% to 40%, and take the two party preferred vote from 43% to something closer than 50:50. In other words, instead of losing 35 seats and possibly also control of the Senate, Labor could lose narrowly, or even have an outside chance of winning.</p> <p>The Labor Party has gambled everything on Rudd being able to maintain that advantage as voters look at him again, as a real leader, rather than the fond memory of one, as he leads them into this election campaign.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411595621|2013-07-02T13:01:24Z|8a0103022ef1febf927a0a7721147326206af169 -->",

        "headline":"Julia Gillard: Labor's love lost",
        "body":"<p>Much of what happened in Canberra on Wednesday was familiar. The sight of two gifted centre-left leaders in Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/26/labor-returns-kevin-rudd-election-wipeout\" title=\"\">locked in mortal combat</a>, after three years of skirmishing and foiled challenges, has echoes of the ego-fuelled rivalry that brought down New Labour in the UK – but it is far bloodier. The real winner of Labor's years of infighting and meltdown in the polls has been opposition leader Tony Abbott, a rightwinger whose policies have remained obscure while the media sustains the great soap&nbsp;opera. Australia's first woman prime minister made a gracious exit.</p><p>But the bravery and toughness, which made her reputation internationally, were never enough at home. The dispute between Rudd and Gillard was not a contest about who had the best policies. It was between two people who each believed that the other had no legitimate claim on the job. She never recovered from the act of political assassination that got her the job in the first place. Ever since he was unseated by her, Rudd was a constant threat to Gillard's leadership, but in the unusual situation of a hung parliament, she achieved worthwhile things on disability and education, as well as shepherding an economy that has now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/grogonomics/2013/jun/11/australia-beware-normality-beckons-treasury?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">avoided a recession for 22 years</a>.</p><p>Broken promises, budget forecasts that did not come in as promised, and a series of U-turns left the impression Gillard was always buying just one more week of peace. The pressure that built on her was cumulative and Rudd was circling in the wings, unable to accept defeat. Gillard can point to plenty of enemies, including those who refuse in principle to accept a woman as prime minister. It is a notable fact of her premiership that her best-known speech remains the one she made on misogyny. The new leader now faces a tough general election. Which Rudd will be put before the Australian people – the one who was unseated three years ago, or the fighter who clawed his way back to power? The carnage is still on the battlefield, but he must now turn his attention away from his colleague and towards Abbott.</p><p>• This article was amended on 27 June 2013. An earlier version referred to Tony Abbott's policies as remaining obtuse rather than obscure. This has been corrected.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411646590|2013-07-02T13:01:23Z|8185441ca127187c722404ae7bd855f111fb89fa -->",

        "body":"<p>Another day has passed in Australian politics, and, with it, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/26/julia-gillard-where-go-wrong\">the prime-ministerial career of Julia Gillard</a>. To the outside world, the griping, carping, leaking and factional bloodbaths in the corridors of power may appear to herald a new era of dark malice on a continent famed for its sunshine.</p> <p>Foreigners: please be aware that your sudden awareness of our political fistfights is but a Twitter phenomenon. Perhaps it's because the weather's good for fighting, because our nasal vernacular affords a brutal-sounding rhetoric, or because the white systems of government are built on a foundation of Aboriginal genocide and yet broil with angry guilt – but be assured Australian politicians have been committing acts of high bastardry against one another for years.&nbsp;Here is our top 10.</p> <h2>BILLY HUGHES V ALFRED DEAKIN (AND THE REST)</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77302481-843d-4d3e-81a5-ffda84e53be1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372298247503/7b2435a6-35fd-4e6f-877c-da7d2782b168-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"billy hughes\" width=\"420\" height=\"252\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Billy Hughes. Photograph: Public domain</figcaption> </figure> <p>&quot;Little Digger&quot; Billy Hughes, Australia's seventh prime minister,&nbsp;can perhaps be identified as the founding father of Australian political bastardry. Despised for splitting from the Labor party while prime minister over the contentious issue of conscription for the first world war (he was in favour), Hughes's political adventurism began with seven years in colonial government, and proceeded over 51 more years in a federal parliamentary career. Ever the political survivor, Hughes knew little loyalty beyond his own ambition, and changed party membership five times: from Labor (1901–16) to National Labor (1916–17) to Nationalist (1917–30) to Australian (1930–31) to United Australia (1931–44) to Liberal (1944–52). Three parties expelled him, and he represented four different electorates in two states. He once allegedly used the floor of parliament to tell Australia's second prime minister, Alfred Deakin, that &quot;at least Judas had the decency to hang himself!&quot; resulting in cries of &quot;dreadful! dreadful!&quot; from the speaker of the house who collapsed in shock, and died, never regaining consciouness.</p> <h2>EARLE PAGE V ROBERT MENZIES</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ac86d824-0059-4782-a0e1-a602269f5470\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372298512360/fa9e0ad8-9cc3-440a-994c-0813100ca2c3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Earle Page.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Earle Page. Photograph: naa.gov.au</figcaption> </figure> <p>The delightfully-monikered Page (one of his middle names is Christmas) is Australia's second-ever longest-serving parliamentarian (41 years) and entered parliament in 1919 in one of the smaller, agricultural-protectionist parties that eventually evolved into the Country party and thence the modern National party. Page became deputy prime minister in a coalition with the United Australia Party (UAP), which was led by Labor’s own Judas-du-jour, Joseph Lyons. When Lyons died suddenly in 1939, Page became caretaker prime minister for three weeks before the UAP promoted Robert Menzies to the leadership – a man Page loathed and refused to serve. His antipathy to Menzies reached its zenith in a <a href=\"http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/before-office.aspx\">vitriolic personal attack</a> on his own coalition partner on the floor of parliament, where Page accused him not only of ministerial incompetence but of physical cowardice for failing to enlist in the first world war. The speech echoed around parliament for years and was frequently cited by Menzies' Labor nemesis, Eddie Ward.</p> <h2>EDDIE WARD V GOUGH WHITLAM</h2> <p>A firebrand of the militant trade union movement who rose in the Labor ranks through the tough 1930s, Eddie Ward's visceral opposition to Liberal leader Robert Menzies made his reputation, but it was his adversarial confrontations within his own party that sealed his fate. Believing himself to be the heir apparent to the Labor leadership after the death of Ben Chifley in 1951, he lost out to Doc Evatt and was devastated to lose again, to Arthur Calwell, in 1960. Denied also the consolation of the deputyship by the election of a young Gough Whitlam, Ward's resentment exploded; <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6PR3CEn4168C&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=iRgejRm79d&amp;dq=EDDIE%20WARD%20GOUGH%20WHITLAM%20party%20room&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=EDDIE%20WARD%20GOUGH%20WHITLAM%20party%20room&amp;f=false\">he attacked Whitlam</a> in the party room. Calwell intervened, slipped and injured his knee, and Whitlam fled down the parliamentary corridor. Ward gave chase, but a pause to remove his glasses afforded Whitlam time to dash into his office, and Ward's fist connected only with the closed office door.</p> <h2>GOUGH WHITLAM V MALCOM FRASER (AND JOHN KERR)</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2fea9d33-b352-442b-b0d0-7940aabd5dde\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372300431902/7ba742a3-f35a-4816-bd07-2ff4f9890fc2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Gough Whitlam. Photograph: nla.gov.au\" width=\"412\" height=\"252\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Gough Whitlam. Photograph: nla.gov.au</figcaption> </figure> <p>Gough Whitlam might’ve thought that the Senate blocking his government’s supply in 1975 was a storm he could weather. After all, his short time as prime minister had been characterised not only by <a href=\"http://www.whitlam.org/gough_whitlam/history_and_legacy\">frenetic political activity and legislative change</a>&nbsp;but scandal in the form of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans_Affair\">Khemlani Affair</a>&nbsp;and the more literal affair of <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/20/1032054962700.html\">Jim Cairns and Junie Morosi</a>. But the governor general, John Kerr, had other ideas, and Fraser’s role in the Dismissal will never be forgiven by many who think Australian democracy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJNaqjUra4%20\">died on the steps of Old Parliament House</a> that day. He might be everyone’s favourite lefty uncle now, but in 1975 Malcolm Fraser cooperated with Kerr, helping to bring down an elected government, surely the biggest act of political bastardry in Australian history.</p> <h2>BILL HAYDEN V BOB HAWKE</h2> <p>Bill Hayden wasn’t a wildly charismatic or popular Labor leader but he had a strong factional base and was widely respected within the party. He’d also made a huge dent in Malcolm Fraser’s lead during the 1980 election and was poised to become the next prime minister of Australia. But the ALP was jonesing to elevate a man with more raw charm than you could shake a stick at, who held records for drinking beer and won over everyone he met (except bosses, who didn’t care for him), <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/bob-hawke-was-the-only-one-messiah-for-labor/story-fnbcok0h-1226578572246\">former ACTU leader, Bob Hawke</a>. After Hayden’s closest advisers convinced him to step aside for the good of the party, he famously noted the injustice by saying &quot;a drover’s dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is&quot;. He was right about the direction of the electoral wind but <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/bob_hawke%20\">Hawke proved rather more popular</a> than his canine comparison, going on to win elections with the kinds of polling and majorities politicians dream about and remaining a beloved national figure to this day.&nbsp;Hayden, of course, became a very effective governor general, disinclined to interfere in the affairs of parliament.</p> <h2>BOB HAWKE V PAUL KEATING</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d52f9917-a71d-402a-bdcb-fa76ae516066\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372300908373/e59f904f-e5bc-4074-ac5c-ab8a68ddfccc-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Bob Hawke. Photograph: nla.gov.au\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bob Hawke. Photograph: nla.gov.au</figcaption> </figure> <p>The (first) Kirribilli Pact gave its name to later such bargains in the Australian political sphere, and earlier versions of the same must’ve passed between many leaders before 1988. With Keating snapping at his heels, Bob Hawke agreed to hand over the leadership without a fight, as long as Keating would support him through the 1991 election. The time to hand over the reins came and went, Keating challenged and lost, before heading to the backbench to lick his wounds and shore up the factional numbers needed for a successful spill. He got there in 1992 and Hawke took a long time to forgive his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Unlike Rudd though, he bowed out of parliament somewhat gracefully and seemed to spend a lot of time after this hanging out by the pool with Blanche. Keating would eventually lose the leadership of the country to Howard in 1996, in a defeat that few predicted would change the direction of the nation.</p> <h2>PAUL KEATING V PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c585d14e-ef14-4e9d-84a1-063e704455e9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372299739126/95592608_45987c3b1d_o-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Keating's offical portrait.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Paul Keating's offical portrait. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/xiaming/95592608/\">Photograph: Ming Xia/flickr</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>A political animal since, well, birth it seemed, the boiler-maker's brilliant son Paul Keating rose through the Labor ranks via neither the unions nor student politics but through policy mastery, political deftness and a volcano of verbal bastardry that erupted from his mouth like perpetual lava. Neither allies nor opponents were spared the man's infamous capacity for snark: he accused erudite Labor comrade Jim McClelland of &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1301752/Top-Paul-Keating-quotes\">having swallowed a fucking dictionary</a>&quot;, rebuffed Gough Whitlam's suggestion that he should attend university because &quot;then I'd be just like you&quot; and referred to the man he would depose, Bob Hawke, as &quot;Old Silver&quot; and &quot;Old Jellyback&quot;, threatening to stick to him &quot;like shit to a blanket&quot; when Hawke proposed a too-generous tax concession to sport.</p> <p>The best and worst of Keating was, of course, saved for the opposition. Peter Costello was &quot;all tip and no iceberg&quot;, Andrew Peacock an &quot;intellectual rust-bucket&quot;, and Wilson “Iron Bar” Tuckey a &quot;stupid, foul-mouthed grub&quot;. He famously called his 1993 opponent John Hewson, &quot;a feral abacus&quot; with a performance &quot;like being flogged with warm lettuce&quot;, and in saying &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_CHXDBq9Ps\">I want to do you slowly</a>&quot;, delivered a taunt that still echoes in the dark corridors of the Australian political imagination. Keating may have lost the election to Howard in 1996 but one suspects that Keating's special brand of spoken bastardry will endure beyond any memory of Howard's words. What, after all, do a majority of votes matter, when your opponent has described you to history as a &quot;mangy maggot&quot;, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1863256.htm\">the old desiccated coconut</a>&quot;, &quot;araldited to the seat&quot; and a &quot;dead carcass, swinging in the breeze&quot;?</p> <h2>JOHN HOWARD V PETER COSTELLO</h2> <p>Poor old Peter Costello was a loyal subject, a treasurer who delivered everything he was asked, and a John Howard acolyte who formed part of the bedrock of Howard’s support within the party after the revolving-door leadership of the 1990s. Many hoped that a transition of leadership from Howard to Costello would arrest the breakneck speed towards the hard right on social (if not fiscal) policy and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s217991.htm%20to%20the%20Republic%20http://australianpolitics.com/1999/10/27/peter-costello-statement-on-republic.html%20\">deliver fairer outcomes</a>&nbsp;on everything from Reconciliation to the republic. But Howard and Hawke had something in common – an inability to prise their hands off the levers of power, and Costello was denied time (2001) after time (2004), despite a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/11/australia.mainsection\">Kirribilli-style arrangement for transition</a>. Howard reneged but instead of hitting the backchannels and building support for a challenge, Costello basically pouted, which Australians resented. His&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s398442.htm\">inability to connect</a>&nbsp;with voters&nbsp;was compounded when it became clear he believed the leadership should be gift-wrapped rather than fought for. Who knows what the 2007 election might’ve held if Costello had stood up to his old mentor?</p> <h2>MALCOLM TURNBULL V TONY ABBOTT</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SzS3Np73wM\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2SzS3Np73wM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>When the most conservative leader the Liberal party has ever seen knifed one of the most progressive, there was only one vote in it. And Tony Abbott must’ve been overjoyed to discover he could saddle Turnbull with the most difficult and absurd portfolio to sell – opposing the hugely popular and globally applauded National Broadband Network (NBN). Cut to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SzS3Np73wM%20\">Turnbull grimacing his way</a>&nbsp;through pressers ever since, as he&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/04/turnbull-our-broadband-plan-could-cost-the-same-as-the-nbn-but-with-a-catch/\">tries to convince</a>&nbsp;the Australian public that the Liberal plan&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/time-for-malcolm-turnbull-to-detail-his-nbn-plan/story-e6frg9io-1226642976746\">would cost marginally less</a>&nbsp;(or the same to householders)&nbsp;while dissembling around that old adage that you get what you pay for – or in this case, less than what we’ll pay for, with significantly less coverage, bandwidth&nbsp;and access for Australian internet users. The move has damaged Turnbull in the eyes of voters but as long as the Liberal party’s own faceless men support Abbott, it’s not the only thing neutralising Turnbull’s leadership ambitions.</p> <h2>JULIA GILLARD V KEVIN RUDD (PART ONE IN A SERIES)</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3f7a7a57-b985-4750-927a-362616406963\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372299450571/ce32cf3b-55f2-4d13-a552-580af688b01d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rudd and Gillard in gentler times.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Rudd and Gillard during gentler times. Photograph: Andrew Mears Pool/EPA</figcaption> </figure> <p>After the leadership carnage in the Labor party that followed the defeat of Keating by John Howard in 1996, many in the party and outside of it saw former diplomat Queenslander Kevin Rudd as Labor's shining, Mandarin-speaking, next big thing and delivered him a massive election victory that robbed the once-thought-invincible Howard of his own seat in 2007. But while Rudd's mastery of Mandarin was impressive, his interpersonal skills seemed to be vastly overrated. Despite his popularity in the electorate, Rudd infuriated any potential partners in the Senate, near everyone in his own caucus and even his personal staff with his narcissistic, arrogant style. After the failure of Rudd to pass an emissions trading scheme, caucus rolled him for his deputy, the cool-headed, professional negotiator, Julia Gillard.</p> <p>She herself had more than a bit of prior in bastardry; a former member of Labor's socialist left faction, she split to lead her own faction in order to deal herself into power with the support of the right. We scarcely need tell you how this one ended.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411649064|2013-07-02T13:01:23Z|0225567cfb73c34a292a8ae50de91d6518a462f7 -->",

        "headline":"Kevin Rudd: can he save Labor?",
        "body":"<p>In the words of the colleagues who know him best he is a selfish, dysfunctional, egomaniacal, saboteur. Now, desperate to avoid electoral annihilation, they have again made Kevin Rudd prime minister.</p> <p>They had to, because voters stubbornly continued to prefer Rudd to the woman who deposed him, Julia Gillard, despite every ugly thing Labor had revealed about him.</p> <p>So we get the election campaign we thought we were going to have in 2010 - Kevin Rudd versus Tony Abbott.</p> <p>And again, just months from an election, we suddenly hear a new Labor leader trying to explain how mistakes will be rectified and governing will change. Except this time Rudd is cast as the saviour, rather than the sinner. And Gillard, Australia&rsquo;s first female prime minister, a leader who has toughed out extraordinary political adversity and personal invective, is the one cast aside.</p> <p>But we have graphic quotes to prove that Labor only turned back to Rudd under the most extreme duress - constant and unwavering polling indicating almost certain political oblivion. Even with the polls pointing to electoral devastation, Labor&rsquo;s aversion to its former leader was so strong, it did not support him in two previous ballots - one in February 2012 that he lost 71 to 31 and one in March 2013 when he didn&rsquo;t even stand.</p> <p>But Rudd just continued to be Rudd, touring marginal electorates - for the good of the Labor cause of course - proving with every appearance, every folksy &ldquo;gotta zip&rdquo;, every street walk mobbing, that he retained his popular appeal.</p> <p>The question for voters - certain also to be posed by the coalition in advertisements ready and waiting - is should we believe what Labor said about him when they were trying kill any chance of his resurrection, or what they&rsquo;re saying now that he&rsquo;s back?</p> <p>Did he have &ldquo;chaotic work patterns&rdquo; that resulted in a government that was &ldquo;paralysed&rdquo; (Julia Gillard 23 February 2010)? Did he preside over &ldquo;dysfunctional decision making and ... a deeply demeaning attitude towards other people&rdquo; (Wayne Swan 22 February 2012)? Did he deliberately &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; the 2010 election campaign with leaks damaging to Julia Gillard and have &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; for the Australian people (Stephen Conroy 23 February 2012)?</p> <p>To answer we need to understand the real battle that has almost destroyed Labor and separate the real failings of the Rudd Government from the way they were presented to try to tear him down.</p> <p>Rudd v Gillard is unlike previous political leadership battles. It wasn&rsquo;t a dispute about who was the better leader, or whether it was time for generational change or whether the incumbent had reneged on a deal to hand over to the impatient aspirant.</p> <p>This was a moral conflict, a fight to the death, where each side believed utterly and totally that the other had no legitimate claim to the job, and presented an existential threat to the party.</p> <p>To the Rudd camp, Julia Gillard was aware of, and at times actively involved in, a covert campaign to undermine and eventually overthrow an elected prime minister in his first term at the behest of faceless factional warlords and unionists who did not like the fact that Rudd resisted switching policy according to the findings of the latest focus group and did not pay due deference to the demands of the unions. They insist Labor&rsquo;s poor polling since the leadership change is a result of Gillard&rsquo;s misjudgements and policy failures.</p> <p>To the Gillard camp, Kevin Rudd is a man putting his own thwarted ambition above the interests of the party, a person so devoid of ''Labor values'' he would destroy the party he claims to serve in an utterly selfish bid to get his old job back.</p> <p>The Gillard supporters like to tell journalists Rudd&rsquo;s overthrow was a &ldquo;mutiny in defence of good government&rdquo; - despite the fact that most senior ministers and most of the caucus knew nothing about it until the last possible moment - and claim Rudd has never given Gillard a chance to stabilise, or to improve the party's polling or her own grip on the job, and they are intensely bitter at the media for continuing to report the leadership tension.</p> <p>To extricate the facts of the Rudd Government&rsquo;s record from the subsequent intractable fighting and fury it helps to go back to what we knew before the shock overthrow of a sitting Prime Minister who was not given the chance to stand for re-election.</p> <p>We did know that decision-making in the Rudd Government was dysfunctional, centralised and log-jammed.</p> <p>The strategic priorities and budget committee - the so-called &ldquo;kitchen cabinet&rdquo; - comprising Rudd, Gillard, Swan and then finance minister Lindsay Tanner took almost all the important decisions. Ministers who might have forseen impending disasters were left astonishingly ignorant of major developments in their portfolios.</p> <p>The resources minister Martin Ferguson, for example, didn&rsquo;t discover the full details of the original resource super profits tax until a few days before they were made public. Cabinet was read only a short prepared statement by the junior treasury minister Chris Bowen assuring them the new tax would be &ldquo;in tune with Labor values&rdquo;. The mining industry&rsquo;s $27 million campaign against that tax was to prove the final straw for Rudd&rsquo;s leadership.</p> <p>The first term government, elected with such optimism, had been side-swiped by the global financial crisis, the parliamentary defeat of the emissions trading scheme and the failure of the global climate talks in Copenhagen. It was for a time paralysed. An election was looming. Rudd could not decide what to do with the defeated emissions trading scheme or when to launch his tax reform and was travelling the nation trying to convince the electorate of his new funding model for health and hospitals. Ministers and senior bureaucrats took to following the Prime Minister around the country to try to get a decision.</p> <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have these people, senior people, the ministers who had things on their agenda, their departmental secretaries, waiting around all day in whatever city the SPBC meeting was in, and then not even get into the room, they&rsquo;d fly home, or go out and buy some clean smalls and fly on to wherever the whole show was going the next day,&rdquo; one person involved in the process told me soon afterwards.</p> <p>But the problem had also been acknowledged during &ldquo;very frank discussions&rdquo; at the SPBC, changes had been made, reviews had been ordered to make sure things were different, and Rudd has since vowed he would change his management style - to employ more elder &ldquo;greybeards&rdquo; to advise him, for example, to consult more, to communicate better.</p> <p>Whether or not he makes good on those pledges is in some ways a secondary problem for Labor. Its first hurdle is executing a grand political mea culpa, convincing voters that - despite its own excoriating assessments - they were in fact right about Rudd and Labor itself was wrong. And then Labor has to make the case that despite three years of division and internal warfare, the party could possibly be trusted again.</p> <p>Alternatively, despite yet another last-minute manouevre - voters may decide Labor&rsquo;s battle to the death over the legitimacy of rival leadership contenders proves the illegitimacy of the party&rsquo;s claim that it remains able to govern the nation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411584168|2013-07-02T13:01:23Z|18cd1a2e07263f2afe6eabb4f688f24efbb24ccd -->",

        "headline":"Julia Gillard: where did it all go wrong?",
        "body":"<p>As the great Irish existentialist Samuel Beckett once wrote, the end is in the beginning, and yet you go on. That was Julia Gillard&rsquo;s story, and Labor&rsquo;s story since June 2010.</p> <p>Gillard unseated a prime minister who had not yet served out his first term in office. Voters didn&rsquo;t expect it, and they didn&rsquo;t care for it. Gillard became the face of a treacherous assassination culture imported from Sussex Street, Sydney, a symbol of Labor&rsquo;s absent moral core. Killing Kevin was an act from which she never fully recovered.</p> <p>Perhaps she could have recovered if she had not compounded shock with aftershock &ndash; if she didn&rsquo;t go on unsettling people. Gillard&rsquo;s consistent failure to reassure is the common thread behind the series of events that have led her to this day, to this inexorable end.</p> <p>The revelation that nice girls do carry knives was compounded by her pre-election evasion on the carbon price, which in the hands of Tony Abbott and his amplifiers became The Great Lie. There were broken promises, a budget surplus promised for years and never delivered, the emissions trading scheme that became a &ldquo;tax&rdquo; in an authority-sapping compromise. Smaller retreats and stuff ups that turned ugly, such as the incident on Australia Day in 2012, where a member of Gillard&rsquo;s staff unintentionally contributed to a violent protest which trapped the PM and Tony Abbott in a restaurant. (The staff member had to depart, and Gillard lost credibility.) The policy backflips: a mining tax that brought the government unremitting political hell but ironically raised only modest revenue. Then the problems without solutions: surging boat arrivals that left Gillard wedged uncomfortably between the moral purity of the Greens and the bareknuckle populism of the Coalition. Her brittle veneer of social conservatism on gay marriage, unconvincing and out of time. The recruitment of Peter Slipper in a naked attempt to boost parliamentary numbers and buy time. The overly long tolerance for Craig Thomson despite serious allegations against him.</p> <p>The stumbles and misjudgments stopped Gillard expanding into her office. They fed the public perception that Gillard&rsquo;s prime ministerial identity was a protean thing, never entirely convincing, never entirely stable. Was she the &ldquo;real Julia&rdquo; or something else &ndash; perhaps just the sum of her latest grand bargain; perhaps an undisclosed agent of the Greens, or the unions? It pushed people back to the certainty and conventionality they saw in Kevin, or more precisely, projected on to him.</p> <p>Gillard appeared to be a hostage because she was forced to bargain for everything. One more week. Five more minutes. An unsettling sort of contingency for Australians unused to their prime ministers living so obviously hand to mouth. There was no time to breathe and grow in a maelstrom. There was no certainty for Gillard to ease into, no time to work on her flaws and limitations, no practice runs. She tried to please, to connect, to speak slowly so as to be better understood, to utter the soundbites deemed right for the times to explain her convictions and her values, to knock off her sharper presentational edges in some evident quest to be prime ministerial, to remain calm against all provocation, to make the case why things must be so.</p> <p>But try as she might, she lacked convincing shorthand to deploy to voters. She was intensely private, contained, reserved &ndash; stubbornly enigmatic and withholding for a person so long in the public spotlight. She rationed appearances by her best self. There were glimpses of something that rang clear and true: the enduring values that drove the Labor agenda in this difficult term despite all the obstacles; the quest for a coherent legacy in the delivery as well as the dreaming; Gillard&rsquo;s ferocity over the dispatch box; the exocet precision of that misogyny speech. Her pre-prime ministerial self would expand and fill a room, but would then retreat, abashed, in silent apology.</p> <p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the voters who doubted. It was colleagues. Even those loyal to her and completely steadfast throughout the chapters of the self-indulgent and unhinged civil war between her and Rudd feared the consequences of her political tin ear. Gillard lacked the essential alchemy of prime ministers, the deep instinct, the second sight, the magical tricks that propel leaders inevitably to the top of the cabinet table. Her colleagues all knew it, the friends and the foes. This was not a judgment made in anger, it was the sum of long observation.</p> <p>Departing backbencher Sharon Grierson noted recently that no one apart from Gillard could have propelled Labor through this period of stubborn policy achievement &ndash; through a carbon price, through tax reform, through education reform, through the beginnings of a national disability insurance scheme. No one apart from Gillard had the work ethic, the courage, the resilience, the attention to detail, the ruthless self-belief to shrug off all the naysaying in the single-minded belief that there was a job to do, and every day you are in government is better than every day you are in opposition.</p> <p>It is absolutely true, as is the discomfiting reality that Gillard faced gratuitous attacks that were entirely gender-based. Over and over, we saw confirmation that there was a proportion of people in Australia who struggled with Gillard as a public manifestation of feminist progress. This pushback against the prime minister was, at times, extraordinary &ndash; and for a woman of my generation, depressing.</p> <p>Julia Gillard is incredibly brave, astoundingly resilient, one of the toughest people we have seen in The Lodge. Through all the difficulties of her prime ministership she was stoic, dignified, composed, resilient. She departed in that style on Wednesday night. Shoulders back. Head high. In the circumstances - the provocation, the consistent undermining by colleagues, the terrible erosion of her authority executed by her enemies within Labor, Kevin Rudd's slow terrible revenge - she exited with class.</p> <p>There was no self pity. She was confident it would be easier for the next woman, and the one after that. She had done her best. She had achieved difficult things in tough times. She had blazed a trail.</p> <p>But the deep personal flaws were there too. Gillard could command admiration, but not respect. She shape-shifted. She confounded rather than connected. She was, in turns, too loyal and then too ruthless. The tempo of project Julia was ragged. She could not nurture a fractured government back to functionality. She did not command the caucus, the cabinet, the voters. She became a solo act, shrinking before our eyes.</p> <p>Of course she would say her failure to reassure was an unnatural condition imposed on her by her enemies &ndash; the people who made it their business to keep her in tumult, to make sure her feet never touched solid ground. Abbott was utterly pitiless, forgiving his own severity and minimising it before highlighting hers. The hung parliament and its freewheeling characters were a backing track of instability. Rudd would not accept defeat, no matter how many times she outflanked him and won. He remained on the field, resolutely on the moral high ground, camped out in luxury, plotting and scripting revenge of the nerds while she dragged Labor behind her in a singular act of will that was as terrifying as it was admirable.</p> <p>She would point in her defence to the toxicity of the media cycle. Before she could unpack her bags in the official residence the news cycle fragmented, chasing its own increasingly desperate shadow. Media outlets seemed to lose their will and their capacity to cover complexity, seemed to lack the courage to stand still. Gillard watched as her prime ministership was transformed into a soap opera. Heads she lost. Tails she lost. Commentators she had declined to flatter and court and appoint keepers of her personal mythology elevated rivals and critics at her expense, recording their laments in minute detail, playing gleeful stenographers to the disaffected. Her disintegration became grist to the hourly mill, a habit that the media could not kick. &ldquo;Gillard&rsquo;s woes&rdquo; was a standing item on every news list in the country.</p> <p>And then she would point to those haters. The culture warriors who resisted the progressive threat on principle. The type of Australians who could not accept a lady in the Lodge &ndash; and certainly not an unconventional one, with a sub-optimal boyfriend, no husband, no children, no God, no instinct to defer. Her steady prevailing, without flourish, without self-indulgence, without self-pity only gave fresh succour to their hatred. Who knew there were so many of them, lurking and fulminating in their self-righteous loathing? Stuffing her in chaff bags. Peeping through her window. Dinosaurs in a last desperate act of fire-breathing, consuming her and themselves &ndash; a bizarre and terrible immolation.</p> <p>She&rsquo;d be right in these assessments, more or less.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s all been part of the Julia Gillard story, an incredible tale where Australia chewed up and spat out its first female prime minister.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411585473|2013-07-02T13:01:24Z|4e7ebf36e49c6b5f395183d928b97d5c9a3b1299 -->",

        "headline":"Kevin Rudd: a man for the party but not a party man",
        "body":"<p>The plotters who pulled Kevin Rudd down in 2010 didn&rsquo;t know their man. They knew he was making a mess of government and had lost support in the caucus. They could see his immense popularity fading. But they didn&rsquo;t realise that Rudd would never give up, the wounds would never heal and he would never go away.</p> <p>His self-belief is bottomless. There were dark nights for Rudd after his defenestration but it remained a constant comfort that he had never been rejected by the Australian people. His quarrel was with his party, a quarrel he was ready to resume whenever the opportunity allowed. </p> <p>Rudd had never had an army of supporters in caucus. Nor did those who worked closely with him in his early years have much to say in his favour. As a diplomat, public servant and shadow minister, Rudd had an unhappy knack of making colleagues loathe him.</p> <p>But the public saw another figure altogether, a new kind of Australian politician, a man of intellect and values. He sounded right. He looked fresh. He was not mired in old Labor conflicts. He seemed a conviction politician of rare courage, a thinker who could take the country into the future.</p> <p>Whatever the party&rsquo;s suspicions, their pollsters told them Rudd bridged the old divide in Labor&rsquo;s following. The fearful were comfortable with him. So were the intellectuals. He pulled votes from the radical left and the Christian right, from the Greens and the Tories. They made him leader in December 2006, but not out of admiration for the man. They did it for the party. </p> <p>He had always been underestimated. Back in the 1990s, his unhappy colleagues in the office of the Queensland premier Wayne Goss were surprised he was even considering a career in politics. But in those days Rudd hid from view the humiliating childhood that drove him into politics.</p> <p>He was 11 when his father died and the family were thrown off their farm. A few weeks after appearing as Rubens&rsquo; Blue Boy in a fancy dress pageant in the Eumundi school of arts, the boy was dumped in a bleak Catholic boarding school on the outskirts of Brisbane. He never forgot the grim years that followed. The Rudds had no home. One night they slept in a VW in the bush.</p> <p>Rudd remade himself through politics. Every step of the way was deliberate. He was a loner who learnt to be popular; a backroom operator who taught himself how to campaign; an ex-diplomat who had to master Australian speech in his 30s. He&rsquo;s never been fluent.</p> <p>His Labor colleagues, when he appeared in Canberra in 1998, thought his ambition to lead the party one day were ludicrous. He had no substantial faction to back him. He battled for attention until he discovered morning television. That was the unlikely forum in which Australians came to know a version of him.</p> <p>He won the leadership in 2006 and a mighty victory over John Howard in 2007. He was loved. What followed was the longest honeymoon in Australian political history. A fresh spirit swept over the country after the rancour of the Howard years. His government handled the global financial crisis superbly. The opposition collapsed.</p> <p>But at the height of his popularity the flaws began to show. He was a micro-manager who found it hard to make up his mind; a national leader with a passion for fine detail, and a big thinker with a short attention span. His office was chaotic. He was impatient with his ministers, thoughtlessly rude to senior bureaucrats and foul-tempered with his staff. He sent distinguished figures out on great missions and had no time for them when they returned.</p> <p>All this might not have mattered if the results were good. They weren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;For all the effort, he doesn&rsquo;t come up with particularly interesting solutions to problems,&rdquo; one of his staffers told me in those years. &ldquo;His policy positions aren&rsquo;t breakthroughs, not particularly new or exciting. After all the work they are dull.&rdquo;</p> <p>It turned out that Rudd couldn&rsquo;t bear to be disliked. He was oddly unwilling to draw on the bank of goodwill at his disposal. He saw himself as an agent of transformative change but in practice he was a trimmer. Reverses knocked him about badly. He wasn&rsquo;t resilient.</p> <p>Australia&rsquo;s love affair with Rudd began to sour after the Copenhagen climate summit in late 2009. A bipartisan pact to deal with global warming had collapsed when the opposition dumped the urbane Malcolm Turnbull for one of the great head-kickers of Australian politics, Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Abbott got under Rudd&rsquo;s skin. The great mistake of Rudd&rsquo;s career was to fail, in early 2010, to take the country to an election fought on climate change, an election he seemed certain to win. Instead he floundered about for six months making dramatic but poorly thought through policy decisions: to take charge of the hospitals of the nation and to tax the super-profits of the mining boom.</p> <p>He failed to pull off either policy coup. His government was logjammed. His popularity was slumping and an election was looming. At this point, his party made a catastrophic tactical error: instead of confronting him, pulling him into line, imposing discipline on this office, making all that was positive about the man work for the Labor government, they sacked him.</p> <p>He was only 52. His ambitions were untouched. And he has, since childhood, taken defeats very, very badly. The belief that he leaked against the new leader, Julia Gillard, in the election campaign that year earned him fresh enmity in caucus. The poll he would have won comfortably left Gillard running a minority government.</p> <p>And Rudd never went away. Though Gillard twice demonstrated he didn&rsquo;t have the numbers to topple her, Rudd didn&rsquo;t give up. His belief in himself was untouched. As her fortunes collapsed, the polls kept giving caucus the same old message: that whatever they thought of Rudd, the people had not given up on him. He might yet save the party from ruin &ndash; perhaps not win an election but save Labor from a historic wipeout.</p> <p>So, three years almost to the day since toppling him, despite everything that went wrong the last time, Rudd has been restored &ndash; for the sake of the party. The election is only weeks away. That will play to his strength. This time he doesn&rsquo;t have to govern. He only has to campaign.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411650900|2013-07-02T13:01:23Z|75b179743c49984983613191a9130325cff29fff -->",

But they didn’t realise that Rudd would never give up, the wounds would never heal and he would never go away. His self-belief is bottomless. There were dark nights for Rudd after his defenestration but it remained a constant comfort that he had never been rejected by the Australian people.

How hard was it for you to vote against Australia’s first female Prime Minister? Here you are, a senior woman in a Labor Cabinet.</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>And a feminist. And that’s been extremely hard. But, ultimately, as I said, you have to weigh your loyalties and your different principles. And I do not believe the feminist principles which I hold dear would be served by Tony Abbott becoming Prime Minister with the views that he has expressed on women and women’s capacity and because of the ways in which he has implicitly allowed the sexism in this country that we have seen on display. I do not believe a leopard changes his spots.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>In terms of the sexism which has been on display, as you say, the Prime Minister made some reference to that last night too – the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in her speech after the vote. She said: “The reaction to being the first woman Prime Minister does not explain everything about my Prime Ministership, nor does it explain nothing. It explains some things and it’s for the nation to think about those things in a sophisticated way”. Do you think the reaction to having a female Prime Minister ... how much of it does explain about Julia Gillard’s position in the polls with the electorate?</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>I think Julia put it very well – “it explains some things, but not everything”. And I think her suggestion that we collectively consider as a nation the response and, in particular, the way in which things were said, the sorts of views and personal attacks that became legitimised, we should think about whether that is what we want for our national politics. As Prime Minister Rudd said last night, that is not what we want for our national politics. We should have a very different approach to our political life and I hope that we do consider that.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>Julia Gillard also said last night that she thinks her doing this job will make it easier for the next woman. You could argue it could make it harder, given the reaction?</p> <p><strong>PENNY WONG: </strong>Well, it depends what we do with it. I think she’s right. The important thing about being the first is that there’s another, and then another.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51cb8b53e4b09948c1bd8728\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-27T01:46:11.666+01:00\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>There's fifty of his closest friends waiting outside the ABC studios in parliament house.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/statuses/350049594442383360\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Don't dream it's over.

Is that the case this morning?</p> <p><strong>TONY ABBOTT: </strong>Look, plainly one-third of the Cabinet has no confidence in Mr Rudd. They have resigned. It’s the biggest exodus from the Cabinet in memory. <strong>But we are not into parliamentary games. There have been far too many parliamentary games, there’s been far too much backroom dealing and double crossing. Let's let the people decide. That’s what we need.</strong></p> <p><strong>KARL STEFANOVIC: </strong>You’ve talked about that, though, in the past. You’ve obviously changed your mind on that. Why have you have changed your mind on the no confidence motion?</p> <p><strong>TONY ABBOTT: </strong>Well, I’ve always said it’s the people's responsibility to choose the Prime Minister and to choose the government. All we have had for the last three years are backroom deals and back-stabbing orchestrated by the faceless men who are not interested in the welfare of the Australian people, not interested in the all the battlers out there who are struggling with the cost of living pressures, who wonder why our borders are in chaos. They’re just interested in protecting their own power and prerogatives.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51cb68f2e4b0617475f3a375\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T23:19:31.178+01:00\">8.19am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>An air of exhaustion hangs over the place today - but that hasn't stopped the new guard hitting the airwaves this morning.</p> <p>Penny Wong and Mark Butler - two prominent ministers and two key players in Labor's transition back to Rudd - have confirmed this morning that they voted for Rudd in yesterday's ballot.</p> <p>Wong obviously faced a very difficult personal decision. She told Fran Kelly on Radio National breakfast it was a testing proposition for a feminist - walking away from the country's first female prime minister.</p> <p>But Wong said her feminist principles were best served ultimately by ensuring Labor had the best strategy to keep Tony Abbott from winning the election.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51cb632be4b01371b36ff25f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T23:07:24.000+01:00\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good morning and welcome to the day after the night before.</p> <p>Mike Bowers has been out early documenting the transition to a new prime minister. He's captured a handshake between two of Kevin Rudd's great supporters, lobbyist and strategist Bruce Hawker and Senator Doug Cameron.</p> <p>It's like a circus down on the front lawns of the parliament - all the TV networks have set up their breakfast shows to broadcast from Canberra. Our two protagonists met up after some punditry on morning TV.</p> <p>I won’t bombard you all with an exhaustive list of stories about the leadership in our news wrap this morning - I’m going to assume, given the readership yesterday, that you are across what happened, more or less.</p> <p>But I will point you in the direction of a few pieces by my favourite writers on a completely extraordinary day.</p> <p><strong>Michael Gordon: The Age</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/gillard-pays-ultimate-price-to-end-a-poisonous-chapter-20130626-2oxm9.html\">Julia Gillard has delivered the ultimate act of leadership and paid the ultimate price, ending the most poisonous, inglorious chapter in modern Labor Party history. But whether Kevin Rudd transforms Labor's prospects at the election depends on whether he can re-unite a fractured party that he helped divide, re-connect with a hostile electorate and challenge a rampant opposition. Gillard's magnanimity in the end has made the transition easier; her decisiveness ensured that this was the last stand. Yes, her flaws made her vulnerable, but she will be remembered as one of the nation's most tenacious leaders.</a></p> <p><strong>Paul Kelly: The Australian (paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/rudd-must-keep-labor-ship-afloat/story-e6frg74x-1226670497176\">Kevin Rudd is resurrected, Julia Gillard's career is destroyed and Rudd has launched a new crusade to halt the Tony Abbott bandwagon. This is the dramatic trifecta that pivots the 2013 election upon an unpredictable new axis. In grim desperation the Labor Party has voted for its self-survival in a bid to deny or cripple an Abbott government.</a></p> <p><strong>Lenore Taylor: Guardian Australia</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/26/labor-leadership-spill-kevin-rudd\">The future of the party now hinges on whether voters still like Rudd when he is leader again, or whether their professed preference for him was really a hankering for the way they felt when they elected him as &quot;Kevin07&quot;, and politics still felt hopeful and positive – in contrast to the down and dirty shouting match it has been for the past three years.</a></p> <p><strong>Laura Tingle: The Australian Financial Review (paywalled)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/huge_task_for_recycled_leader_6M7qhKMZTIW2tgpkTjUM3M\">Kevin Rudd finally returns to a prime ministership diminished by the Labor civil war that first removed him, helped create minority government and then replaced him. And in which he, of course, was a major protagonist. His will to power, and all the flaws it has exposed along the way, now turn on Tony Abbott. His goal will be an election victory – not saving the furniture – though the timing of that election must now be in doubt.</a></p> <p><strong>Michelle Grattan: The Conversation</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/rudd-wins-the-game-of-thrones-15573\">Rudd has been restored to the leadership three years to the week after he was pushed out. </a><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/rudd-wins-the-game-of-thrones-15573\">In his mind, his return journey has all been about righting a wrong, seizing back what was his – the power, the Prime Ministerial Office, the Lodge. This rang through his news conference tonight, when he said: “In 2007 the Australian people elected me to be their PM. That is the task that I resume today …” Rudd’s tortuous course back has been costly to the party and contributed to, although is not responsible for, Gillard’s failures.</a></p> <p>We'll be following all today's events live.

        "headline":"Kevin Rudd sworn in as prime minister",
        "body":"<p>Kevin Rudd has been sworn in as prime minister for a second time, three years after being deposed, and now faces the daunting task of reworking policy and replacing more than one-third of the cabinet just months before an election.</p> <p>Rudd has not said when he will call the poll or whether he will stick with Julia Gillard&rsquo;s nominated election date of 14 September, but appears to have the confidence of the hung parliament. The Coalition is indicating it will not move a no confidence motion.</p> <p>As the nation woke, yet again, to find the prime minister had been changed overnight and without reference to the voters, Labor struggled to work through the divisions that resulted in the overthrow of Australia&rsquo;s first female prime minister in a ballot won by Rudd, 57 votes to 45.</p> <p>Rudd backer Chris Bowen who resigned from the cabinet after the last leadership crisis in March, has been confirmed as treasurer. Gillard backer Gary Gray said he had agreed to stay on as resources minister, but was still blunt in his assessment that Gillard&rsquo;s leadership had been killed off by a constant campaign of destabilisation by Rudd supporters.</p> <p>Gray only last week said Rudd was able to &ldquo;get himself into the media &hellip; what he can&rsquo;t do is govern and what he can&rsquo;t do is lead the Labor party&rdquo;. He has told ABC radio he made the remarks &ldquo;in the heat of anger and frustration&rdquo;.</p> <p>Speaking after the ballot on Wednesday night, a composed Gillard said she was proud of her achievements in what &ldquo;has not been an easy environment to work in&rdquo; because of the minority parliament, the internal Labor divisions and the Coalition&rsquo;s fierce anti-carbon tax campaign.</p> <p>Referring to the accusations that she had &ldquo;played the gender card&rdquo; by calling out sexism, she said her position as the first female incumbent &ldquo;does not explain everything about my prime ministership and does not explain nothing about my prime ministership&rdquo;. She said: &ldquo;It explains some things and it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey.&rdquo;</p> <p>When he announced his candidacy, Rudd promised &ldquo;no retributions, no paybacks, none of that stuff&rdquo;, but Gillard, the treasurer, Wayne Swan, the climate change minister, Greg Combet, the education minister, Peter Garrett, and the trade minister, Craig Emerson, communications minister Stephen Conroy and agriculture minister Joe Ludwig all immediately announced they were standing down from the frontbench. Gillard, Garrett and Emerson said they would not contest the forthcoming election.</p> <p>The leader of the government in the House, Anthony Albanese, has been sworn in as Rudd&rsquo;s deputy. The finance minister, Senator Penny Wong, will be the leader of the government in the Senate.</p> <p>Addressing the media late on Wednesday night, Rudd said he had contested the prime ministership again because &ldquo;I simply do not have it in my nature to stand idly by and allow an Abbott government to come to power in this country by default&rdquo;.</p> <p>He made few references to policy.</p> <p>But he repeated a phrase he used when he was first prime minister &ndash; that he did not want to lead a country that did not make things any more &ndash; and said there would be &ldquo;a big future for Australian manufacturing under this government&rdquo;.</p> <p>He also reached out to the business community, which has been disenchanted with some recent Labor policies. He said: &ldquo;Let me say to Australian business, I want to work closely with you &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to see things that drive business and Labor apart.&rdquo;</p> <p>And he repeatedly said he wanted an end to the recent divisiveness of the political debate.</p> <p>&ldquo;In recent years politics has failed the Australian people. There has been an erosion of trust, there has been too much negativity all round. In fact it has been holding our country back, and all this must stop,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;I see my role as prime minister as forging consensus wherever I can &hellip; without resorting to personal vitriol, that diminishes and demeans us all. We can do better than that.&rdquo;</p> <p>He also acknowledged Gillard&rsquo;s achievements, saying she was &ldquo;a woman of extraordinary intelligence, great strength and great energy&rdquo; who had &ldquo;achieved much under the difficult circumstances of a minority government&rdquo;.</p> <p>The workplace relations minister, Bill Shorten, who publicly announced he had switched his support to Gillard just before the ballot, explained his decision.</p> <p>He said there were Labor policy legacies \"which could only have been created by Prime Minister Gillard and that can only be kept by Prime Minister Rudd &hellip; Prime Minister Rudd gives us a chance to save these things&rdquo;. He nominated policies such as the Gonski education reforms and superannuation changes.</p> <p>The environment minister, Tony Burke, a Gillard backer, said he had offered his resignation from the front bench to Rudd, but it had not been accepted.</p> <p>Gillard said her caucus colleagues had &ldquo;defied gravity&rdquo; by sticking with her for so long, and said she understood that in this last ballot the political pressure had become too great.</p> <p>Swan said she was &ldquo;one of the toughest warriors that has ever led the Labor party&rdquo;.</p> <p>The spill was the third time Gillard&rsquo;s leadership had been tested in this tumultuous term of government. In February 2012 she decisively beat Rudd and in March 2013 he did not stand in a ballot she called after another period of escalating leadership tension.</p> <p>After the March ballot, Rudd said there were &ldquo;no circumstances&rdquo; in which he would return to the leadership, but as Labor&rsquo;s primary vote languished at 29% and showed no signs of improving, his backers launched yet another desperate last-minute push. Rudd said he changed his mind because he feared the consequences of a Coalition landslide.</p> <p>Wednesday night&rsquo;s ballot was a dramatic resolution to the leadership tensions that have simmered ever since Gillard overthrew Rudd in June 2010 and took the nation to the polls just over three weeks later.</p> <p>Under Gillard&rsquo;s leadership Labor legislated a carbon price, a national disability insurance scheme, aged care reform and a new needs-based system of education funding, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/26/gonski-school-education-reforms-senate\">passed the Senate on the same day she was deposed</a>.</p> <p>Gillard took a resolute approach to the job, despite an often hostile media and a fierce attack from the Coalition, and gained worldwide recognition for her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/09/australia-pm-gillard-misogynist-video\">&ldquo;misogyny speech&rdquo;</a> in which she said she would not be lectured about sexism by the Coalition leader, Tony Abbott.</p> <p>But after the 2010 election resulted in a hung parliament she was forced to govern without a majority in either house, a state of uncertainty that proved unpopular with voters.</p> <p>Her popularity and that of her government suffered under an intensive campaign by Abbott against the carbon pricing deal she did with the Greens and independents. Because it started with a fixed price it was seen as the &ldquo;carbon tax&rdquo; she had promised never to introduce. Her position was further eroded by a series of scandals, including allegations against Labor backbencher Craig Thomson, who was forced onto the crossbench, and against former Coalition MP Peter Slipper, who Labor convinced to become Speaker.</p> <p>The ballot was called by Gillard after Rudd supporters began collecting signatures for a petition to call a special caucus meeting to consider the leadership. But it quickly became apparent the numbers in caucus were moving against her and shortly before the vote factional powerbroker Bill Shorten announced he was reluctantly shifting his support to Rudd.</p> <p>Rudd said he was standing in the ballot &ndash; contrary to his previous assurances &ndash; because Labor was &ldquo;on course for a catastrophic defeat unless there is change&rdquo; and Australians &ldquo;want a real choice&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;I owe it to people to offer them a viable alternative,&rdquo; he said, vowing there would be &ldquo;no retributions, no paybacks, none of that stuff&rdquo; if he won.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411649532|2013-07-02T13:01:23Z|25b3644b3ceb92b5d2ba859f8360bde4c86c1265 -->",
