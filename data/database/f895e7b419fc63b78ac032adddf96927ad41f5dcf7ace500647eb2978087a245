In addition to the murder, the 529 were accused of attempting to kill two other police officers and attacking a police station.</p><p></p><p>The death sentences are not final and  appeals are likely; similar sentences have often been commuted in Egypt. But families of the accused and rights lawyers described the process as a miscarriage of justice.</p><p></p><p>One man, whose father was among those sentenced to death, said: \"Nothing can describe this scandal. This is not a judicial sentence, this is thuggery.\"</p><p></p><p>He added: \"The session last[ed] for five minutes, [and] during those five minutes none of the lawyers or the defendants were listened to – not even the prosecution. The judge just came in to acquit [the 16] and sentence to death the others.\"</p><p></p><p>Mohamed Zaree, head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS), a prominent rights group, said: \"This verdict is a disaster. To rule in the second session of a trial – it means the judge didn't hear the defence or look at the evidence. Even someone from the second grade of the law faculty would never have issued this verdict – it goes against the basic principles of criminology.\"</p><p></p><p>The same court will try 683 more Brotherhood supporters on Tuesday – including the leader of the group, Mohamed Badie, and the head of its political wing, Saad al-Katatny.</p><p></p><p>The defendants are among at least 16,000 political dissidents arrested since the overthrow of Morsi last July, according to police figures. Some rights groups say the real figure may be as high as 23,000, and many of those imprisoned have been tortured by the authorities.</p><p></p><p>One of the most high-profile detainees – Alaa Abd El Fatah, a secular activist investigated by every regime since Hosni Mubarak – was released on bail on Sunday in a rare instance of judicial clemency.</p><p></p><p><em>Additional reporting by Manu Gallad</em></p>","headline":"Egypt sentences to death 529 supporters of Mohamed Morsi","trailText":"Complaints of miscarriage of justice as judge takes just two sessions to find defendants guilty of police officer's murder","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395658126325/Pro-Morsi-protesters-in-C-003.jpg","wordcount":"384","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432833447","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8836818","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2064143","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T10:52:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-sentence-529-morsi-supporters","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-sentence-529-morsi-supporters","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/mohamed-morsi","webTitle":"Mohamed Morsi","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/mohamed-morsi","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

finally confirms long-awaited candidacy – promising 'stability, safety and hope for Egypt' – and he is widely expected to win","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:30:45Z","body":"<p>Egypt's army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi resigned from the military on Wednesday night, paving the way for a long-awaited presidential campaign and a return to strongman leadership for Egypt.</p><p>\"I am here before you humbly stating my intention to run for the presidency of the Arab Republic of Egypt,\" Sisi said in a televised statement, still dressed in military fatigues. \"Only your support will grant me this great honour.\"</p><p>Sisi had been spoken of as a potential head of state after he removed ex-president Mohamed Morsi last July, following days of mass protests against Morsi's Islamist-slanted government. But while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">his candidacy has been an open secret</a> for months, Sisi himself had given few definitive signals of his intentions.</p><p>That finally changed on Wednesday night – three years and two months after the fall of Egypt's last ex-military strongman, Hosni Mubarak – as Egypt's military council, known as Scaf, convened to allow Sisi to resign. Minutes afterwards, shortly before 9:30pm local time, state television broadcast a 13-minute statement recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>\"If I am granted the honour of the leadership,\" Sisi said, \"I promise that we together – leadership and people – can achieve stability, safety and hope for Egypt.\"</p><p>In speech that contained few surprises, the outgoing field marshal warned Egyptians that the country faced a host of economic and political challenges, and asked them for their patience and help in rebuilding the state. He focused on strengthening state institutions and increasing stability – mentioning democracy just once, and with no mention of human rights.</p><p>Sisi is widely expected to win any presidential election by a landslide, as many see him as the only candidate with the authority to control a country wracked by three years of post-revolutionary turmoil. He has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large and often sycophantic following</a>, ranging from wealthy businessmen – who have paid for his face to be displayed on vast hoardings across Cairo – to working-class shopkeepers, who place his photograph in shop windows. To many, Sisi represents a bulwark against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, who are instinctively blamed for any outburst of violence.</p><p>But support for Sisi is by no means universal. Supporters of the Brotherhood detest him for leading a crackdown on dissent that has seen at least 16,000 people jailed since July, and over a thousand killed. A small group of secular liberals, who are now also victims of the state crackdown, also want the army out of politics. Thousands of students at Cairo university chanted against military rule on Wednesday afternoon, as news of Sisi's resignation began to trickle through.</p><p>In January's constitutional referendum, which was seen as a poll on Sisi himself, over 98% of those who voted said yes to the new constitution, and implicitly for the general too. But only 38.6% of the electorate took part, less than Sisi would have hoped for.</p><p>Sameh Seif Elyazal, a retired general expected to form part of Sisi's campaign, said: \"For the majority of Egyptians who were waiting anxiously for this moment, they will be very happy – but I think the Muslim Brotherhood will be very upset and angry.\"</p><p>The experience of the referendum has led rights activists to fear that the presidential elections may not be free or fair. Several campaigners against the constitution were arrested for putting up posters, leading many to fear a repeat scenario in the presidential poll.</p><p>Only one other serious candidate – a champion of workers' rights, Hamdeen Sabbahi – has declared his candidacy, and a senior army officer told the Guardian that the campaign would be without irregularities: \"[Sisi] is very happy for other people to run. It's not going to be a race without other candidates.\"</p><p>But three leading candidates from the 2012 elections have already withdrawn from this year's race, warning that the election will be a sham.</p><p>\"I won't take part in deceiving people into believing we have a democratic path when we don't,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/16/khaled-ali-announces-will-run-president-2/\" title=\"\">one of the withdrawn candidates, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh</a>, said in February.</p><p>Sisi risks his popularity plummeting once he becomes president, analysts argue, since <a href=\"http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=931530677&amp;Country=Egypt&amp;topic=Politics\" title=\"\">Egypt's economic and political challenges</a> are so intractable that they cannot be easily solved.</p><p>HA Hellyer , Egypt analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said: \"A Sisi presidency is going to face the key structural problems endemic in Egypt as [the country's head of state from 2011-2 Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein] Tantawi, Mubarak and Morsi did.

But while his candidacy has been an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">open secret for months</a>, Sisi himself gave few definitive signals of his intentions.</p><p>That appeared to change on Wednesday – three years and two months after the fall of Egypt's last ex-military strongman, Hosni Mubarak – when Egypt's main state-run news website said Sisi would resign from the army by the end of day, allowing him to run for elected office. Two senior military sources later confirmed the news to the Guardian.</p><p>\"Today we will have a meeting for SCAF [the army's governing council] – and after that he will resign,\" said one high-ranking officer. \"After that he will be a civilian, and after that he will be able to announce his campaign.\"</p><p>Sisi is widely expected to win any presidential election by a landslide, as many see him as the only candidate with the authority to control a country racked by three years of post-revolutionary turmoil. He has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large and often sycophantic following</a>, ranging from wealthy businessmen – who have paid for his face to be displayed on vast hoardings across Cairo – to working-class shopkeepers, who place his photograph in shop-windows. To many, Sisi represents a bulwark against Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, who are instinctively blamed for any outburst of violence.</p><p>But support for Sisi is by no means universal. Supporters of the Brotherhood detest him for leading a crackdown on dissent that has seen at least 16,000 people jailed since July, and more than a thousand killed. A small group of secular liberals, who are now also victims of the state crackdown, also want the army out of politics. Thousands of students at Cairo University chanted against military rule on Wednesday afternoon, as news of Sisi's resignation began to trickle through.</p><p>In a referendum in January, which was seen as a poll on Sisi himself, more than 98% said yes to the new constitution. But only 38.6% of the electorate took part, fewer than Sisi would have hoped.</p><p>The experience of the referendum has led rights activists to fear that the presidential elections may not be free or fair. Several campaigners against the constitution were arrested for putting up posters, leading many to fear a repeat scenario in the presidential poll.</p><p>Only one other serious candidate – the workers' favourite Hamdeen Sabbahi – has declared his candidacy, and a senior army officer told the Guardian that the campaign would be without irregularities: \"[Sisi] is very happy for other people to run. It's not going to be a race without other candidates.\"</p><p>But three leading candidates from the 2012 elections have already withdrawn from this year's race, warning that the election will be a sham.</p><p>\"I won't take part in deceiving people into believing we have a democratic path when we don't,\" one of the withdrawn candidates, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, <a href=\"http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/16/khaled-ali-announces-will-run-president-2/\" title=\"\">said in February</a>.</p><p>Sisi risks his popularity plummeting once he becomes president, analysts argue, <a href=\"http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=931530677&amp;Country=Egypt&amp;topic=Politics\" title=\"\">as Egypt's economic and political challenges</a> are so intractable that they cannot be easily solved.</p><p>HA Hellyer, Egypt analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said: \"A Sisi presidency is going to face the key structural problems endemic in Egypt as [the country's head of state from 2011 to 2012 Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein] Tantawi, Mubarak and Morsi did. He actually has a worse situation to deal with, considering the security threats, and the counterproductive efforts of the Egyptian state in facing all those problems. No one quite knows how he intends to address those problems – or even if he will try with any degree of success. Some of those answers may become more evident as his team members become clear in the short-lived presidential campaign – but no one should be optimistic in any real progress any time soon.\"</p><p>Analysts also say it remains to be seen how authoritarian a Sisi presidency will be, as it is currently unlikely that he is directly co-ordinating Egypt's crackdown on dissent. \"So the real test comes post-election,\" Michael Hanna, an analyst of Egyptian politics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> this week. \"Will a President Sisi – with the backing of the military, and with what he would consider a popular mandate – then decide he can make decisions?\"</p>","headline":"Egypt's army chief expected to resign, paving way for presidential campaign","trailText":"Abdel Fatah al-Sisi is said to be planning to step down from army on Wednesday, and is expected to win vote by landslide","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395844420717/Abdel-Fatah-al-Sisi-poste-006.jpg","wordcount":"752","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"433043878","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8847059","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2066047","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-29T14:36:22Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/egypt-army-chief-resign-presidential-campaign","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/26/egypt-army-chief-resign-presidential-campaign","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

Abbas says she believes only two may be responsible for the murder of her husband","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:21:00Z","body":"<p>The wife of the policeman whose murder led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence\" title=\"\">death sentences for 529 Egyptians</a> on Monday has suggested that only two of them may be responsible for his killing.</p><p>The sentences caused global outcry on Monday after it emerged that the 529 had been convicted of the murder of officer Mostafa al-Attar last August in a case that lasted just two court sessions.</p><p>Speaking to an Egyptian news presenter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CW1kMcQULc#t=77\" title=\"\">after the case ended</a>,  Al-Attar's wife, Magda Abbas, inadvertently cast further doubt on the strength of the prosecution by saying that her joy at the sentences was tempered by the fact that the two men who killed him were still in hiding.</p><p>Al-Attar was wounded by a mob at a police station and later brought to hospital, where Abbas said two doctors killed him. \"Those who killed Mostafa are not there [in prison],\" said Abbas. \"They are fugitives.\"</p><p>Local lawyers protested against the death sentences by boycotting a second mass trial of 683 people on Tuesday, which was presided over by the same judge who ruled in the first case.</p><p>Judge Saeed Youssef Elgazar went ahead regardless – a decision defence lawyers said was illegal.</p><p>\"I have never seen anything like this in all my life as a lawyer,\" said Adel Aly, one of the defence counsel who chose not to attend Tuesday's trial of defendants including the head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie.</p><p>Ahmed Shabeeb, another lawyer involved in the boycott,  said: \"His [Elgazar's] decision infringed all the procedures guaranteed by law and the constitution – as if he wanted to say that he's the uppermost god.\"</p><p>According to local media, Elgazar has a history of controversial judgments, most prominently in January last year when he acquitted policemen accused of murdering protesters during the 2011 revolution.</p><p>Further draconian sentences were avoided as Tuesday's trial was adjourned until 28 April. But violence broke out in Minya, the southern city where both trials took place, as students clashed with police. The head of the local student union said some protesters had been hit by police shotgun pellets. Clashes were also reported in the northern city of Alexandria.</p><p>The death sentences sparked a global outcry, culminating in the UN's human rights office judging that the case had breached international law.</p><p>\"A mass trial of 529 people conducted over just two days cannot possibly have met even the most basic requirements for a fair trial,\" said the UN's human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville.</p><p>But reaction in Egypt was more mixed. The identities of the 529 are not all known, but many Egyptians assume they are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group behind the ousted president Mohamed Morsi. Many in Egypt instinctively blame the Brotherhood for all new outbursts of violence, and believe the 529 deserved their punishment.</p><p>One lawyer from the area, Ali Delgawy, said: \"They're liars, so they deserve whatever happens to them.\"</p><p>Both state and private media have consistently backed the actions of the post-Morsi regime, and Monday's trial was no exception. \"Today, we got justice, the justice that we want. We are tired of your violence. We will build the country despite your war,\" <a href=\"http://madamasr.com/content/egyptian-television-celebrates-mass-death-sentence\" title=\"\">said Rania Badawy</a>, a presenter on the private Tahrir channel.</p><p>A presenter for the Sada al-Balad channel, Ahmed Moussa, said: \"I salute the fairness and justice of our judiciary in defiance of those killers and all those who attack it. Egypt's judiciary is clean and fair.\"</p><p>Analysts argued that while the judgment may have been made independently, Egypt's judiciary was not a neutral institution. \"Parts of the judicial apparatus are fully on board with the new repressive order, at least for now,\" said Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University. But he added: \"I think it is more a matter of a common mentality than direct co-ordination.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Manu Abdo </em></p>","headline":"Egyptian policeman's wife casts doubt on death sentences handed out to 529","trailText":"<p>Magda Abbas says she believes only two may be responsible for the murder of her husband</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395758044787/Minya-003.jpg","wordcount":"621","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"432951313","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8842496","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2065258","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T14:37:30Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/25/egypt-lawyers-boycott-mass-trial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/25/egypt-lawyers-boycott-mass-trial","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

But their scale and the brisk way they were enforced heightened concern for Egypt's rule of law <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution\" title=\"\">amid a crackdown on political opposition</a>. At least 16,000 mainly Islamist dissidents have been arrested since Morsi's overthrow in July.</p><p>Amnesty International described the news as \"injustice writ large\", and said it was the largest single batch of death sentences it had seen anywhere in the world in recent memory.</p><p>The sentences are likely to spark yet more unrest, with Egyptians from both secular and Islamist backgrounds expressing anger. Supporters of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood announced large-scale protests to begin immediately and continue  on Tuesday.</p><p>Sixteen defendants were acquitted after lawyers said they had not been allowed to present a proper defence during either the trial's first hearing, on Saturday, or the second and final session on Monday.</p><p>Ahmed Shabeeb, a lawyer for the men sentenced to death, said: \"This is a disturbing verdict that infringed all laws, regulations, as well as the 2014 constitution.\"</p><p>Shabeeb claimed that the judge, Saeed Elgazar, sentenced the men out of spite after being told during Saturday's 45-minute-long session that his behaviour was unconstitutional.</p><p>\"Don't talk about the constitution, I don't want to hear about that in my court,\" Elgazar had said, according to Shabeeb. The judge's outburst reportedly started a fierce argument that he tried to resolve by calling armed security officials to guard the judicial bench, Shabeeb added.</p><p>\"He swore he'd give a verdict at the next session on Monday, and that is what happened,\" Shabeeb said. \"It is a reckless verdict that was borne from anger.\"</p><p>The defendants were sentenced in Minya, a southern city that was hardest hit by a spasm of anti-state and sectarian violence that erupted across Egypt last August. Mobs thought to be sympathetic to Morsi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/egyptian-police-recapture-islamist-town-delga\" title=\"\">attacked dozens of churches</a> and police stations in revenge for the state's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/14/cairo-doctors-morsi-hospitals\" title=\"\">brutal clearance of a pro-Morsi protest camp</a> in Cairo.</p><p>A deputy police commander, Mostafa el-Attar, was killed in the Minya violence, and it was for his murder and the attempted murder of two others that the 529 were sentenced to hang.</p><p>Families of the accused and rights lawyers described the process as a miscarriage of justice. \"Nothing can describe this scandal. This is not a judicial sentence, this is thuggery,\" said Waleed, whose father was among those condemned, and who asked not to publish his surname.</p><p>He said Monday'ssession lasted five minutes. \"And during those five minutes none of the lawyers or the defendants were listened to, not even the prosecution. The judge just came in to acquit [the 16] and sentence to death the others,\" he said.</p><p>Mohamed Zaree, head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, said: \"This verdict is a disaster. To rule in the second session of a trial – it means the judge didn't hear the defence or look at the evidence. Even someone from the second grade of the law faculty would never have issued this verdict, it goes against the basic principles of criminology.\"</p><p>Many compared the sentences unfavourably to the 10-year jail term given last week to a police captain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/cairo-prison-abu-zabaal-deaths-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">who was found culpable for the gassing to death of 37 prisoners</a> last August.</p><p>The death sentences are the latest instalment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">campaign of repression</a> that has seen over a thousand in which more than 1,000 dissidents have been killed, thousands more have been arrested, and journalists have been jailed for advocating or reporting narratives that oppose the post-Morsi state.</p><p>But Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University and an expert on the Egyptian judiciary, said the verdict was highly unlikely to have been directly ordered by a central figure such as Egypt's army chief, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p><p>\"Parts of the judicial apparatus are fully on board with the new repressive order, at least for now,\" said Brown. \"Many felt that they were under attack by the Morsi presidency and they have rallied around what might be called the 'party of order' represented by the military, the security apparatus, and the top of the religious establishment.</p><p>\"I think it is more a matter of a common mentality than direct co-ordination. Indeed, the court here has gone so far that it is difficult to see that it serves the interest of the regime.\"</p><p>Egypt's foreign ministry was at pains to emphasise the conditional nature of the sentences, hinting at embarrassment at Monday's events. \"The law allows the verdict to be appealed,\" its statement read, in red type that was emboldened and underlined. It claimed the ruling \"would be overturned as soon as the defendants demand a retrial\".</p><p>More draconian verdicts are feared on Tuesday, with the same Minya court due to try 683 other Brotherhood supporters and officials including its leader, Mohamed Badie, and the head of its political wing, Saad al-Katatny.</p>","headline":"Anger in Egypt as 529 Morsi supporters sentenced to death","trailText":"<p>Muslim Brotherhood calls protests as judge accused of acting out of spite after two-day trial over policeman's death in Minya</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395686576854/Minya-004.jpg","wordcount":"834","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"432879952","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8839551","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley and Manu Abdo in Cairo","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2064736","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T18:46:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-morsi-supporters-death-sentence","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.

The security crackdown has severely undermined the Brotherhood's ability to mobilise and stage big street protests. Those who think this way are undoubtedly encouraged by the conduct of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the Ukraine crisis, and the apparent failure of the west to stand up to him. These hawks dismiss any international response to the action of the police or the judiciary as of little consequence.</p><p>There's already been a barrage of criticism both inside Egypt and abroad. The procedure itself lacked basic standards of fairness. Many are ridiculing a legal system that allows for a mockery of justice on this scale to take place. The trial lasted two days, and more than half the defendants are on the run.</p><p>This is not the first time the Egyptian judiciary has attracted widespread condemnation. Last November a court in Alexandria gave <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/12/07/Egypt-courts-hear-appeals-of-jailed-female-protesters.html\" title=\"\">21 Islamist women and teenagers jail sentences of up to 12 years</a> for taking part in a pro-Brotherhood protest that turned violent. The disproportionate punishment produced a howl of protest. The sentences were later commuted on appeal, and the women were released.</p><p>The Egyptian judiciary has a mixed record. It has, for example, given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/02/hosni-mubarak-sentenced-life-prison\" title=\"\">Hosni Mubarak a life sentence</a>, which he's appealed against. He is currently being retried. But none of the police or military accused of killing protesters since the uprising that toppled him in 2011 have been found guilty.</p><p>Given this record, most observers will conclude that the verdict is political, designed to send a message to the Brotherhood and its backers abroad – in Cairo this usually means Turkey and Qatar, which have made no secret of their unwavering support for the Brotherhood– that the Egyptian state is still in no mood to compromise with the Islamists: surrender or annihilation.</p><p>But coming down with a sledgehammer on anything that moves makes the government look more like a raging bull than a confident operator playing by the rules. It also adds to perceptions of the Brotherhood in the outside world as clear victims, despite the fact that government action against the Islamists still enjoys broad support in Egypt itself.</p><p>Within days the electoral commission is expected to issue a timetable for the presidential election. Given that it is the judiciary that will be supervising the election, anything that undermines its independence will cast a long shadow over the electoral process. The credibility of the transition will be called into question if the judiciary is seen to act at the behest of those who hold power.</p><p>Yesterday's verdict comes at a critical moment in Egypt's muddled transition from authoritarian rule to what many still hope, despite all the disturbing signs, will be an elected and representative government. Many others remain sceptical, though. Sentencing almost 530 suspects to death en masse will most probably strengthen the scepticism of those who believe Egypt is heading towards anything but democracy and rule of law.</p>","headline":"A death sentence not just for hundreds of Islamists, but Egypt's democratic future","trailText":"<strong>Magdi Abdelhadi: </strong>The judiciary's role in the sentencing of almost 530 Muslim Brotherhood supporters could destroy faith in the electoral process","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395751395428/Journalists-trial-in-Cair-006.jpg","wordcount":"574","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432941169","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8841049","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Magdi Abdelhadi","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2065137","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-28T13:20:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/25/death-sentence-islamists-egypt-democratic-future-muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/25/death-sentence-islamists-egypt-democratic-future-muslim-brotherhood","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/magdi-abdelhadi","webTitle":"Magdi Abdelhadi","r2ContributorId":"47049","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/3/1325604592385/magdi-abdelhadi2.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Magdi Abdelhadi is a freelance writer and broadcaster and former Arab affairs analyst for the BBC</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/magdi-abdelhadi","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/magdi-abdelhadi","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-432941980","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395751385414/Journalists-trial-in-Cair-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"EPA","photographer":"Tarek Wajeh/Almasry Alyoum","altText":"Journalists trial in Cairo","height":"54","credit":"Tarek Wajeh/Almasry Alyoum/EPA","caption":"Journalists on trial in Cairo on 24 March for allegedly supporting a terrorist group – the Muslim Brotherhood.

They were convicted after just two court sessions, most in absentia and without being allowed to present a defence. On Tuesday a further 683 members of the Brotherhood, including its leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/aug/20/brotherhood-mohammed-badie-arrested-video\" title=\"\">Mohammed Badie</a>, will face similar charges in the same city. Although many of these sentences are likely to be commuted when the defendants reach the last stage of Egyptian justice and are brought before the grand mufti, legal experts cannot recall a court coming to such draconian conclusions on such a scale. It will send a shudder through those who once cheered on the Egyptian revolution and imagined the country was on the path to democracy.</p><p>There are now so many political prisoners in Egypt that its jails are close to bursting. By the government's own estimate, 16,000 people have been locked up in the crackdown that followed the military coup in July last year in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, the Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, was ousted. Prisoners are packed up to 40 to a cell and are routinely beaten. The thousands rounded up in the past eight months consist largely of members of the Brotherhood, and almost all of its leaders, but include secular revolutionary activists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alaa-abd-el-fattah\" title=\"\">Alaa Abd El Fattah</a>, who was bailed on Tuesday, as well as reporters. Twenty journalists were arrested after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/29/egypt-to-charge-20-al-jazeera-journalists-damaging-countrys-reputation\" title=\"\">accused of spreading misinformation</a> and aiding terrorists.</p><p>To say that Monday's death sentences were ordered by the military leadership as part of the brutal counter-revolution would credit army chief and defence minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/egypt-army-chief-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-indicates-run-presidency\" title=\"\">Abdul Fatah al-Sisi</a> with a level of control he may not have. There is little evidence, in this case, of direct interference from the army in the rulings of the court. A more likely scenario is that parts of the judiciary are fully signed up to the army-led campaign of political repression. They felt threatened by Mr Morsi's government and have rallied round the old establishment, the \"deep state\" of shadowy bureaucrats created by the deposed dictator, Hosni Mubarak.</p><p>The response of Egypt's most important ally to the crackdown against the largest of Arab revolutions has been equivocal. In October, the Obama administration – which famously failed to describe the events that toppled Mr Morsi as a coup because US law forbids Washington from giving money to \"any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree\" – announced it would <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/world/middleeast/obama-military-aid-to-egypt.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">withhold some military and civilian aid</a> to the country, including tanks and fighter aircraft. Congress has since <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/us-circumvents-law-to-transfer-aid-to-egypt/a-17406390\" title=\"\">passed legislation</a> requiring that Egypt make progress on democracy and human rights before the aid, worth $1.5bn, can be released. However, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has declared his intention to unblock the aid as soon as he feels he can. \"We want this interim transitional government to succeed. We are committed to try to help make that happen,\" Mr Kerry told a congressional hearing earlier this month. \"I'm hopeful that in the days ahead I can make the appropriate decision. And when I say days ahead, I mean short term.\"</p><p>Mr Kerry's desire to restore the US subvention to Egypt stems in part from his reluctance to upset another gambit he has in the Middle East: the push to restart the Israel-Palestinian peace process. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.580617\" title=\"\">Israel has been lobbying hard</a> for the release of aid to Cairo's government in recent months because it sees security co-operation between the countries as a major line of defence against Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual ally in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The judge in Minya may have designed his ruling in order to help General Sisi quell the voices of the opposition. If so, he is deluded: his draconian decision will only help push the country deeper into crisis. Before Mr Kerry can even contemplate fully restoring aid, he must demand concrete steps towards democracy and human rights.</p>","headline":"Egypt: death and the deep state","trailText":"<strong>Editorial: </strong>The sentencing of 529 of the Muslim Brotherhood to death will send a shudder through those who cheered on the revolution","newspaperPageNumber":"34","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3nz9m","wordcount":"668","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432894075","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8837153","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Editorial","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2064793","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-27T23:04:52Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-deep-state-editorial","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/24/egypt-death-deep-state-editorial","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/muslim-brotherhood","references":[]},{"id":"world/hosni-mubarak","webTitle":"Hosni Mubarak","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hosni-mubarak","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/editorial","webTitle":"Editorial","r2ContributorId":"56303","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367609515569/guardianlogo_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Editorials from the Guardian.

How much power does the country's new strongman, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, intend to wield?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:11:07Z","body":"<p>The activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is one of at least 16,000 political dissidents languishing in an Egyptian jail and it was from his cell that he wrote <a href=\"http://madamasr.com/content/everyone-knows\" title=\"http://madamasr.com/content/everyone-knows\">the following</a> last week: \"Everyone knows that most of those in jail are young, and that oppression is targeting an entire generation to subjugate it to a regime that understands how separate it is from them and that does not want to, and cannot in any case, accommodate or include them.\"</p><p>It is a bleak assessment of contemporary Egypt, three years and two months after a revolution that was supposed to empower Abd El Fattah and many of those in jail with him. In his letter Abd El Fattah highlights the arbitrary nature of many of their detentions, the torture to which thousands have probably been subjected – and the apathy towards, and often enthusiasm for, such malpractice among the public.</p><p>Among Egypt's revolutionaries and rights lawyers, it is no longer remarkable to say the country has returned to the era of Hosni Mubarak – or worse. To Abd El Fattah's portrait of a revolution turned on its head, others might add, among many other criticisms: untrammelled police brutality; journalists jailed; a ban on the kind of protests that drove the 2011 uprising; the exile of Mohamed ElBaradei and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/wael-ghonim-egypt-regime-targets-secular-activists\" title=\"\">Wael Ghonim</a>, two of the politicians and activists most associated with Mubarak's downfall. Plus the likely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/eqypt-al-sisi-speculation-presidency\" title=\"\">election to the presidency</a> of the army chief whose presence has come hand in hand with the restoration of Mubarak-style oppression: Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p><p>In cabinet, writes one former minister under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/16/egypt-coup-catastrophe-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, whose year-long presidency was toppled last July, \"there is now no one left that has any link to the 25 January revolution\". The nuance of Yahia Hamed's point is debatable, not least because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/protests-egypt-presidential-decree\" title=\"\">Morsi's own government had autocratic leanings</a>, and the extent to which Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood was involved at the start of the 2011 uprising has long been contested. But Hamed's general premise stands: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/egypt-new-prime-minister-ibrahim-mahlab\" title=\"\">Egypt's recent cabinet reshuffle</a> saw the departure of the most moderate voices in government – the secular liberals who supported Morsi's overthrow last July, not because they craved greater authoritarianism but because they wanted less of it.</p><p>But to what extent all this marks a full-circle return to permanent dictatorship – and how similar such a dictatorship would be to Mubarak's – is open to question. It is sometimes assumed that Sisi's grip on power is total. Certainly he enjoys more influence than any other Egyptian and has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/egypt-general-sisi-mania\" title=\"\">large, sycophantic following</a>. But how much power he wields directly – and how much cohesion there is between his army, the secret police, the cabinet, and the judiciary – is unknown.</p><p>\"For me, the most outstanding feature of this moment is that nobody is in charge,\" says Michael Hanna, an analyst of Egyptian politics. \"The military is not really in charge and it's not making systemic decisions.\" Even if Sisi is in favour of it, the thinking goes, he might not be directly co-ordinating Egypt's oppression – which may instead be the result of different factions elsewhere in the state using a vacuum in leadership to assert themselves. \"So the real test comes post-election,\" says Hanna.</p><p>\"Will a President Sisi – with the backing of the military, and with what he would consider a popular mandate – then decide he can make decisions?\"</p><p>However he acts, it should also <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/ahmed-ezz-egypt-sisi-felool.html#\" title=\"\">not be assumed that Sisi represents quite the same elites</a> as Mubarak did. Sisi may have been head of army intelligence under the ousted dictator, and Egypt's latest prime minister may hail from Mubarak's National Democratic party (NDP). But in Mubarak's last years, senior army officials were at loggerheads with the NDP leadership, whose neo-liberal instincts threatened the military's vast economic empire. When Mubarak fell, leaving senior generals in charge, it was those NDP officials – including Mubarak's son Gamal – who were among the first to experience retribution.</p><p>\"The NDP neglected society,\" says one senior officer, who was keen to portray the army as Egypt's salvation. \"Their corruption is the reason people are still suffering. They will never come back and the Mubarak era will never come back. A new era is coming.\"</p><p>As Abd El Fattah's prison letter shows, many fear this new era will nevertheless bear many of the oppressive hallmarks of the old one. But others also maintain that the country's dire economic predicament will not allow any new government to use violence to crush dissent indefinitely. As an increasing range of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/egyptian-army-runs-cairo-buses-strikes-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">workers' strikes</a> show, officials have nothing to offer the public in exchange for the removal of their political rights. And even if the immediate outlook is dark, this argument continues, the residue of revolutionary gains will remain.</p><p>\"I don't think you can roll back the gains of liberal principles in the last few years,\" summarises Samir Radwan, Egypt's first finance minister of the post-Mubarak era, who believes the country's civil society is still in much better shape than it was four years ago.</p><p>Hala Shukrallah, who became Egypt's first female leader of a political party earlier this month, is a case in point. Her rise is one scarcely imaginable four years ago – a reflection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/egypt-christian-woman-leads-dostour-party\" title=\"\">she told the <em>Observer</em></a>, of \"real, deep changes in the psyche of the Egyptian people and the Egyptian youth\".</p><p>Likewise, several activists were arrested for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/egypt-referendum-day-arrives\" title=\"\">campaigning against Egypt's latest constitution</a>, which passed in January. But the text itself, though flawed, represented a small incremental gain: it is comparatively more liberal than any predecessors.</p><p>Detainees enter police custody expecting to be beaten and tortured – but it has not all been one-way traffic. To the surprise of many, the policemen who murdered Khaled Said in 2010 – the attack was one of the rallying points for the 2011 revolution – had their sentences extended last month. A police captain, culpable for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/cairo-prison-abu-zabaal-deaths-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">gassing to death of 37 prisoners</a> inside a prison van last August, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/egypt-police-captain-jail-gassing-37-prisoners\" title=\"\">jailed for 10 years</a> last week. These are extremely rare convictions, and farcically lenient in comparison to the sentences some Morsi supporters have been given simply for protesting. But at a time of seemingly unstoppable police influence, two judges have still been independent enough to convict serving officers.</p><p>It was intriguing, too, to see the face of Hisham Geneina peering from an Egyptian broadsheet last week. Geneina, Egypt's chief auditor, had given an interview criticising the police for obstructing his employees' post-audit of their accounts – and he later expanded on his allegations to the <em>Observer</em>. The accountants who did the police's pre-audit, Geneina said, were paid by the police – which, he argued, caused an obvious conflict of interest. Meanwhile, Geneina's team on the post-audit were sometimes not given the paper records they needed. It was not the most rebellious outburst but, given the political climate, it was also not the most compliant.</p><p>But for the thousands in prison, or the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117072/egypts-young-islamists-use-facebook-organize-violence\" title=\"\">young Islamists growing frustrated</a> with the futility of street protests, a few hints of optimism here and there mean little amid a wider environment of wholesale oppression. In his letter from prison, Alaa Abd El Fattah argues that Egyptians have allowed themselves to become deceived by a bogus promise of gradual progress and the \"show\" of democratic process.</p><p>\"The show helps to normalise the situation,\" Abd El Fattah writes, \"it [diverts people] on to useless routes: negotiations, advice, legal representations, efforts with the media – until the common understanding becomes that anyone who's accused is guilty, that it's up to the revolutionaries to avoid being imprisoned or killed.\"</p><p>He ends with a rousing call to action: \"Everyone knows there is no hope for us who have gone ahead into prison, except through you who will surely follow. So what are <em>you</em> going to do?\"</p><p>The success of Egypt's next president may depend on the response.</p>","headline":"Egypt's spring 2014: is the counter-revolution now complete?","trailText":"The January 2011 uprising was supposed to empower those who toppled the dictator's regime – yet thousands of them languish in jail and fear the country has come full circle, writes <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong>","newspaperPageNumber":"33","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2014/3/22/1395492423723/Alaa-Abd-El-Fatah-004.jpg","wordcount":"1293","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"432728348","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8832670","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Patrick Kingsley","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-03-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2063705","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-03-26T00:04:10Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/23/egypt-spring-2014-counter-revolution","tags":[{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/egypt","references":[]},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","references":[]},{"id":"world/hosni-mubarak","webTitle":"Hosni Mubarak","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/hosni-mubarak","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/focus","webTitle":"In focus","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/focus","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/focus","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/patrick-kingsley","webTitle":"Patrick Kingsley","r2ContributorId":"39083","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749337943/PatrickKingsley.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746110/PatrickKingsley.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian's Egypt correspondent.
