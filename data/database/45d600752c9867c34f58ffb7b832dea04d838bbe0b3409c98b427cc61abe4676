McGuinness held the monarch&apos;s hands for a few moments and spoke to her in Irish. He told her the words meant: &quot;Goodbye and God&apos;s speed.&quot;</p> <p>McGuinness was a senior member of the IRA when it killed the Queen&apos;s cousin Lord Mountbatten in a bomb blast in 1979.</p> <p>The Queen is the head of Britain&apos;s armed forces, seen in the past by Republicans as occupying troops in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The pair met in a room within Belfast&apos;s Lyric theatre during an event celebrating the arts in the Republic and Northern Ireland.<br /> <br />In a quiet space used by the Lyric for creative learning, the two were joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Northern Ireland first minister, Peter Robinson, the Irish president, Michael D Higgins, and his wife, Sabina.</p> <p>The McGrath Suite – named in honour of benefactor Harvey McGrath, former chairman of British insurer Prudential, and his wife, Allison – is usually filled with toddlers enjoying storytelling sessions or drama students taking part in workshops.</p> <p>But on Wednesday it was sparsely furnished with leather seating – four chairs and a sofa – set around a circular wooden table decorated with flowers, with tea, coffee and still and sparkling water on a side table.</p> <p>The floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on to landscaped gardens and the river Lagan were covered with curtains.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"1765580","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"1765580","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>The
