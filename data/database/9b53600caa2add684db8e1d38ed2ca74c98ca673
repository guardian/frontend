        "body":"<p>A senior Conservative is calling for the BBC to be made more accountable to the citizens and politicians of Wales, arguing that the corporation has a near monopoly when it comes to reporting Welsh affairs.</p><p>Andrew RT Davies, leader of the <a href=\"http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=143\" title=\"\">Welsh Conservatives</a> in the national assembly, is writing to the BBC and the government claiming that more needs to be done to make sure the broadcaster is properly scrutinised in Wales.</p><p>He claims the BBC is so powerful in Wales, where it runs operations in both English and Welsh, that more checks are needed to make sure that it is held to account.</p><p>During a speech on Thursday at <a href=\"http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/research/aber-research/research-centres-and- groups/iwp-en/\" title=\"\">the Institute of Welsh Politics</a>, in Aberystwyth, Davies will say that as devolution develops it will become ever more important to ensure robust mechanisms monitoring the BBC are in place.</p><p>Davies is to say that the BBC is by far the most powerful media organisation in Wales. \"Because of its sheer scale in Wales its importance cannot be underplayed. Therefore it is more important than ever that as Wales and its politics develops so too does its most important broadcaster. The BBC in Wales needs to be a beacon of transparency and editorial neutrality. This can only come from accountability.\"</p><p>He is writing to Maria Miller, the culture secretary, to Lord Patten, the BBC trust chairman, and to the director general of the BBC, Tony Hall, to call for more accountability.</p><p>He believes that the new BBC charter in 2017 will be the ideal time to make changes.</p><p>At present the BBC produces an annual report that it submits to the culture secretary in Westminster, but Davies says there needs to be a mechanism by which assembly members in Cardiff can properly scrutinise the broadcaster's Welsh operations.</p><p>\"The editorial decisions that are taken in Wales, not just on politics but on how Wales is reported, must be scrutinised by the most important body in Wales,\" he will say. \"Any organisation that operates for the public should be fully accountable.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182497|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|55187bd47227c82f71a95aa79f6e2573893f6cc1 -->",
