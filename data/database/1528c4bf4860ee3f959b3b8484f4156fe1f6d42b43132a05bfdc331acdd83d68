As far as I am concerned, they are two sides of the same coin. Yet with increasing concerns about the prospects for the economy, not least with the chill winds blowing from the Eurozone, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/29/autumn-statement-george-osborne-green-policies\" title=\"\">some are now beginning to argue that the environment is a luxury we can't afford</a>. They couldn't be more wrong.</p><p></p><p>The way to grow jobs is not by propping up the past, but by investing in the future. At the Department for Transport, we have made it clear that we need to do all we can to decarbonise road transport. Our firm commitment to low-carbon vehicles is beginning to pay off, not simply in lower carbon emissions but in terms of investment in jobs for the future. We will shortly see manufacture of the new electric Nissan Leaf begin in Sunderland, safeguarding 360 jobs and creating 200 more with the production of the new lithium ion battery.</p><p></p><p>Our ambitious investment in rail, particularly in electrification, is creating jobs today and cutting carbon tomorrow. Our Green Bus Fund, now in its third round, is not just cleaning up our buses, but proving a real boon for British bus manufacturers, both in terms of domestic supply and export potential. And our record spend on local sustainable transport is cleaning up our cities and boosting their economies.</p><p></p><p>So embracing green is good for jobs. The environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, hit the nail on the head at a Rio+20 Earth summit event recently, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/09/rio-20-earth-summit-caroline-spelman-speech?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">she said</a>: \"Being green is integral to sustainable economic growth.\"</p><p></p><p>The simple fact is that while much of the economy is struggling, there is a growing demand for green products. Private companies invested £2.5bn in renewable energy projects in the seven months from last April, with 11,619 new jobs being created, often in areas of higher unemployment such as the north-east, an area which has also enthusiastically embraced the move to electric vehicles.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Britain has the world's sixth largest low-carbon and environmental goods sector, employing over 900,000 people and growing by 4% a year. As a government we are determined to build on this using the British genius for invention and innovation to capitalise on the low-carbon future the world is embracing.</p><p></p><p>One reason why investment levels have been buoyant in green areas is because industry understands that we have to do things differently in the future. To take just one example, the growth of the emerging economies, particularly China, has led to a real terms increase in commodity prices of 147% over the past decade. If we want to prosper tomorrow, we cannot simply pull away at yesterday's levers. We need new answers, and ideally ones which are free from price fluctuation or the whims of unstable regimes. And that means reducing our dependency on oil for transport and energy. The result: more energy security, more UK-based jobs, less carbon.</p><p></p><p>But we also need to ensure that the decisions that individual departments like Transport take are properly joined up across government. We have set ourselves a tough challenge: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to be the greenest government ever</a>. It is a challenge that we in government are determined to meet, working across government departments rather than pigeon-holing the environment in only one or two departments of government. Safeguarding our environment has to be a cross-government purpose as important to the Business Department, the Treasury or Communities and local government as it is to Defra or Decc.</p><p></p><p>Governments can of course only do so much, but one key way to make a difference is to set a clear direction of travel and stick to it. So another reason why green investment has been buoyant is because of the clear buy-in by all three major political parties that tackling climate change is an essential, not just for environmental reasons, but economic ones too. If anyone doubted that, the game-changing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">Stern report</a>, emanating from the heart of the City, made it very clear that the price of doing nothing was greater than the price of taking action.</p><p></p><p>That is why creating growth and cutting carbon are twin objectives that we are determined to remain focussed on in government so that we can deliver both a stronger economy and a safer world.</p>","headline":"We must capitalise on a low-carbon future","trailText":"<strong>Norman Baker: </strong>Some are beginning to argue that the environment is a luxury we can't afford.

The body is due to publish a report this week in Brussels on the impact of global warming.</p><p>What Mr Dimas knew - but did not tell the scientists, apparently - is that the EU's programme for cutting carbon, its two-year-old emissions trading scheme (ETS), remains in disarray.</p><p>The Democrats, who are now the majority party in the US Congress, and California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, are drafting plans for an American version of the carbon \"cap-and-trade\" scheme.</p><p>However, preliminary data on the scheme's performance last year - its second year of operation - showed that 93%, or about 9,000 of the 10,000 heavy industrial plants covered by the EU's trading scheme, emitted less carbon than their quota of free permits. The resulting 1%-1.5% rise in emissions was not as great as in 2005 but the spot price of a tonne of carbon fell by about a quarter to &euro;1 (68p), at one point collapsing to just 92 cents.</p><p>Only a handful of countries shored up the market by issuing fewer emissions quotas than industry wanted. These included: Britain - where Drax, Europe's biggest coal-fired power plant, emitted 5m tonnes more than its 15.5m tonnes permit - Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Spain. The trading mechanism is designed to create scarcity, forcing up the price of carbon and prompting industries such as steel and power generation to invest in cleaner, greener technologies, such as renewable, carbon-free energy and, eventually, carbon capture and storage. So far, it is manifestly not working as planned.</p><p><strong>Debacle</strong></p><p>Mr Dimas and his officials deliberately released the raw data early - without analysis or interpretation - to avoid last year's debacle, when premature release of national statistics brought a disorderly collapse of the market. This year the full, sifted figures will be released on May 15.</p><p>The 2005 data showed that industry emitted 66m tonnes less carbon than allowed, prompting allegations that, in Germany alone, the four big power producers had enjoyed windfall profits of up to &euro;8bn by cashing in their excess free carbon permits. In Britain, despite the tighter cap, generators are estimated to have made &pound;1bn.</p><p>In 2006, industry emitted about 30m tonnes less than permitted. German emissions rose 0.6% while overall EU emissions went up by 1%-1.5% because of resumed growth in the eurozone.</p><p>Mr Dimas's officials readily admit that the first phase of the scheme has been a botched experiment because of the generous over-allocation of permits. But they now insist that the second phase will be much more successful because of tighter controls on quotas. Many EU governments have significantly reduced the number of carbon permits they will grant to polluters. Poland has cut its permit total by 26% and Latvia and Lithuania by half.</p><p>Brussels believes that the second phase of the trading scheme is crucial because it coincides with the key stage of the Kyoto protocol from 2008 to 2012. Brussels is pressing the US, other developed countries and emerging economies to agree on a global emissions trading scheme to be introduced after 2012, at UN talks starting in Bali in December. The EU has endorsed a unilateral 20% cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 and wants the developed world to sign up to a 30% cut, with countries such as China and India joining in.</p><p>\"The whole idea of the second phase is to squeeze allocations, push up the carbon price by creating scarcity and encourage companies to invest in future, green technologies,\" one of Mr Dimas's aides said, pointing to a forward price for carbon in 2008 at close to &euro;17 a tonne. They are delighted that the squeeze on national carbon caps for this second phase has prompted squealing from several big companies.</p><p>Cemex, the Mexican cement producer which owns the UK's RMC, is suing the European commission over the British permit plan while US Steel is similarly taking legal action over the Slovakian allocation plan. Three German companies have also launched legal action in the European court of justice.</p><p>Mahi Sideridou, EU climate policy director at Greenpeace, said yesterday's data strengthened Mr Dimas's hand in ruling on the second phase of the trading scheme. \"In the first phase the commission didn't have any data and governments could freely submit; now it can compare reality to how many permits are given out,\" she said, suggesting that the commissioner would be emboldened to revise the scheme in time for the second phase.</p><p>Mr Dimas wants to include civil aviation in the ETS by 2011 despite the threat of legal action from the US and others. He insisted that the original EU-15 countries were still on course to meet their Kyoto target of an 8% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, despite mounting signs that Europe is still falling woefully short of this goal on its policies. California, which said last week it planned to link its own ETS to the EU's with four other western US states, and Washington will undoubtedly need more persuasive evidence.</p><p><strong>Explainer Trading scheme</strong></p><p>The European emissions trading scheme was designed to provide a <strong>market-based approach</strong>, rather than a direct tax, to the problem of curbing big industrial users' <strong>carbon dioxide emissions</strong>. It covers sectors such as power generation, steel, glass, cement, ceramics and paper.</p><p>Countries are given allocations of the amount of carbon dioxide they can emit which is then divided up between firms covered by the scheme. Firms which emit less than their allocation can <strong>sell the unused portion</strong> to over-polluters.</p><p>The aim is to create a market in carbon where the price is high enough to encourage firms to curb their emissions to keep down costs. Critics argue that the scheme so far has been <strong>too generous</strong> in terms of allocations, keeping down the price of permits, and that it should be extended <strong>to include aviation</strong></p><p>There have also been suggestions that the market principle should be taken further and <strong>all permits should be auctioned</strong>, rather than simply handed out by governments.</p><p>Industry is also concerned that at present the scheme only extends to 2012, causing uncertainty over whether there will be a \"price for carbon\" beyond that date.</p><p><strong>The worst 15</strong></p><p>Verified carbon emissions, tonnes:</p><p><strong>1</strong> <strong>Drax</strong> power station 20,771,624</p><p><strong>2</strong> <strong>Ratcliffe-on-Soar </strong>power station 8,638,887</p><p><strong>3</strong> <strong>Fiddlers Ferry </strong>power station 8,492,925</p><p><strong>4</strong> <strong>West Burton</strong> power station 8,419,658</p><p><strong>5</strong> <strong>Longannet</strong> power station 8,417,779</p><p><strong>6</strong> <strong>Ferrybridge C</strong> power station 8,413,055</p><p><strong>7 Cottam</strong> power station 8,068,565</p><p><strong>8 Kingsnorth</strong> power station 7,766,631</p><p><strong>9 Eggborough</strong> power station 7,215,160</p><p><strong>10 Teesside</strong> steelworks 6,370,456</p><p><strong>11 Didcot A</strong> power Station 6,342,700</p><p><strong>12 Port Talbot</strong> steelworks 6,132,851</p><p><strong>13 Scunthorpe</strong> steelworks 6,000,096</p><p><strong>14 Aberthaw</strong> power station 5,264,973</p><p><strong>15 Teesside</strong> power station 5,177,349</p>","headline":"Smoke alarm: EU shows carbon trading is not cutting emissions","trailText":"<p>Some US states want their own 'cap and trade' scheme but the evidence is proving that permits are so generous they fail to curb industry.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"25","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/b4nd","wordcount":"1125","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"329766627","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Gow in Brussels","internalPageCode":"220063","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/03/carbonemissions.environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/apr/03/carbonemissions.environment","tags":[{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"environment/carbon-emissions","webTitle":"Greenhouse gas emissions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/carbon-emissions","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-change","references":[]},{"id":"profile/davidgow","webTitle":"David Gow","rcsId":"GNL004626","r2ContributorId":"15549","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/18/1313670142658/david-gow.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Gow is the former European business editor of the Guardian.

People are often surprised that figure is so high and that's because a lot of focus is given to how energy is generated, rather than how it is used.  So as the <a href=\"http://www.ukgbc.org\" title=\"\">UK Green Building Council</a>, we were particularly interested to see how the Conservatives and Lib Dems are proposing to tackle our carbon-hungry built environment.</p><p>Unfortunately, the statement is a bit short of ambition and is worrying in part. A concerning phrase in the text looks pretty innocuous at first glance: \"We will require continuous improvements to the energy efficiency of new housing.\" Surely that sounds like a good thing? Unfortunately it's not that simple. Without urgent clarification, this one line risks a wave of uncertainty sweeping throughout the construction and property sector.</p><p>In 2006, the previous government introduced the most progressive environmental policy of the New Labour years. It said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/04/zero-carbon-homes\" title=\"\">from 2016 every single new home built must be responsible for zero carbon emissions</a> from the energy used in its operation. There has been confusion over the precise definition, but the principle is clear – build super-energy efficient homes, then provide all the remaining energy from renewable sources.</p><p>I hope we receive reassurance as soon as possible that the coalition fully supports the 2016 target. The target has genuinely galvanised housebuilders, architects and product manufacturers and helped transform a sector not traditionally associated with radical change. To pull the rug out from under the feet of all those companies who have been investing and innovating and preparing for 2016 would be disastrous. Missing this opportunity to commit to the target is pretty sloppy.</p><p>Let's not be churlish, there is much to welcome. A smart grid and smart meters, feed-in tariffs that provide an incentive to install renewables and a green investment bank – it's all good stuff, even if most of it was under way before the election.</p><p>There is also a commitment to \"encourage home energy efficiency improvements paid for by savings from energy bills\". This rather dry commitment refers to a rather radical idea, which has the potential to revolutionise our ageing, leaky housing stock which is responsible for 26% of our CO2 emissions. The biggest barrier to making home energy efficiency a mainstream activity, particularly for Victorian solid-walled properties, is the high upfront cost. Under a so-called Pay As You Save scheme (the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/oct/06/conservatives-green-deal\" title=\"\">Conservatives called it the Green Deal</a>) the measures don't cost anything up front, but are paid for by spreading the cost over a long period, paid back through savings in energy bills.</p><p>Labour would say it was already committed to it, but we need legislation to get this sort of scheme up and running so if the coalition fast-tracks the necessary bill, that should be warmly welcomed. However, critics will argue that without reference to additional incentives or disincentives to encourage the take-up of such a scheme (such as different levels of stamp duty), today's statement doesn't go far enough.</p><p>There is another hole in the statement, and it comes in the shape of an office building – or a hotel, hospital or warehouse for that matter.  Non-domestic (ie, non-residential) buildings are responsible for 17% UK CO2 emissions, yet they barely got a mention in any of the main party manifestos – even the supporting \"green\" documents.</p><p>And there is no mention of the previous government target for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon by 2019. The same principles apply with a zero-carbon office as with a zero-carbon home. And the same criticisms apply by not re-committing to this target. Policy was not as far advanced in this area compared with the domestic sector, but it's still an omission. We also have no mention of the role for district heat or other sustainable community infrastructure, which will be an important part of the solution.</p><p>As for refurbishing our non-domestic buildings, there is a commitment to refurbishment in the non-domestic stock (\"We will also take measures to improve energy efficiency in businesses and public sector buildings\") but it's hardly inspirational stuff. Here, business would accept much more stringent demands being made of it, such as phasing out the worst performing properties over time. That means if a property is not up to scratch by a particular date, it can't be sold or rented until it's been refurbished. The basis for this would be much-needed improvements to the system of A to G ratings for buildings – and making sure every building in the country was reliably labelled.</p><p>What is completely lacking is any sense of a comprehensive strategy – a well thought through plan for decarbonising our built environment. Of course you wouldn't expect the Lib Dems and Conservatives to have precise details right now, but I'd like to see an indication that government has a vision for what this looks like. The Lib Dem manifesto talked of a \"zero carbon Britain by 2050\" – where has that ambition gone?</p><p>The ironic thing is that none of this need be a burden on either business or the householder. Buildings offer twice as much cost-effective carbon reduction potential as any other sector.  Lower carbon buildings – whether new or refurbished – are better quality buildings, nicer to live and work in, with more natural daylight, cheaper to run, and more valuable in the long-term. Low and zero carbon buildings and the industry that delivers them, are worth potentially billions of pounds a year to the UK economy and could create over 100,000 new jobs.  Let's not miss this open goal.</p><p>• John Alker is director of policy &amp; communications, <a href=\"http://www.ukgbc.org\" title=\"\">UK Green Building Council</a></p>","headline":"Coalition must

While delegates made modest progress on some key issues, the real stuff happened outside the negotiations, as the leaders of some of the highest-emitting and fastest-growing economies pledged to reduce their countries' greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Brazil announced it would reduce its deforestation rate over 50 percent from recent levels by 2017, avoiding an estimated 4.8 billion tons of CO2 emissions. Mexico pledged to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, employing a \"cap-and-trade\" policy like the one recently considered by the U.S. Congress. South Africa presented a detailed plan to peak their country's emissions by 2020. And while China—now the world's largest source of annual greenhouse gas emissions—made no new announcements in Poznan, it is on track to reduce its energy intensity 20 percent by 2010. In 2007 alone, China closed over 1,000 inefficient factories.</p><p>These developments are significant for two reasons. First, these four countries collectively account for nearly a quarter of global emissions. More importantly, China, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico are all developing countries—\"non-Annex I countries\" in the parlance of the Kyoto Protocol. Critics perennially complain that international efforts to address global warming won't work unless developing countries—which account for just over half of all global greenhouse gases—take action to reduce their emissions. For their part, developing countries have resisted emissions targets, arguing, legitimately I think, that developed countries have contributed the lion's share of emissions so far, and should lead in making reductions. In any case, the argument that developing countries are taking no action is wrong. This month's pronouncements signal a growing urgency on the part of emerging economies to shift their own development to a more sustainable path.</p><p>While the new targets are politically significant, their impact on emissions and domestic policy remains to be seen. Brazil's plan, for example, has come under fire by local environmental groups, who charge that it lacks ambition (the first phase of its target was largely achieved before the plan was even announced) and means little without an implementation plan. There is no doubt that China's plans are being implemented, but as long as China's economic growth outpaces its intensity targets, they will not result in absolute emissions reductions. Per-capita Chinese energy consumption is still well below that in the United States, so reducing emissions intensity is a reasonable near-term goal. Ultimately though, we will need absolute reductions in China as basic energy demand is satisfied and new technology options materialize.</p><p>Developing countries have come a long way since the US Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because it did not require them to act. President-elect Obama has stated that his administration will seek deep emissions cuts in the U.S., but Congress will no doubt have an eye on China as it considers what policies to enact. A clear understanding of developing country climate and energy policies will be key to fostering confidence that emissions reductions at home will not be negated by unconstrained growth abroad.</p><p>For their part, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa have made at least some of their efforts contingent on outside support, and the Chinese used their program to call on developed countries for greater action. Mexican environment minister Juan Rafael Elvira said that his country's target was meant to spur other countries to reduce their own emissions—and to help Mexico attract investment to make its reductions. South Africa has divided its plan into low- and no-cost efforts it can tackle alone and additional efforts it could undertake with international assistance.</p><p>As the Obama administration takes up the negotiating reins, it will be navigating a very different terrain than the one in which the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in 1997. Developing countries have presented a range of initiatives that they are prepared to take forward either unilaterally or with international support. The U.S. must now act quickly to pass strong legislation to spur an economic recovery while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Internationally, the U.S. must seek a fair and effective agreement that supports the initiatives already underway in developing countries. A significant part of the global community is ready to do its part. So must the United States.</p><p>• This article was shared by <a href\"http://www.wri.org/\">World Resources Institute</a>, part of the <a href\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>","headline":"A different world than Kyoto","trailText":"<p>The argument that developing countries are taking no action to address climate change is wrong, write Jonathan Lash and Taryn Fransen.

I take my own cutlery to my work canteen rather than using disposable chopsticks, which uses lots of wood. I recycle plastic bags by using them for rubbish and try to take my own bag when shopping. I'm glad the government brought in its new policy. [China has pledged to ban flimsy plastic bags from June.] When I go shopping,  I don't really think about the environment.  I am more concerned with food safety.</p><p>For me, though, the two biggest environmental worries are water and air pollution. When I was a child we lived in the hutong alleyways and heated our home with coal. I had no idea that it was dirty. But now, we have different standards and more knowledge about the health impact. When I was a child we drank water straight from the tap. Now my children have bottled water only. Exercise is different too. We used to run outside when I was young because people said it was good for our health. But now they say the air is bad so we should exercise indoors.</p><p> Personally, I don't think there is much we can do as individuals. We can't stop producing waste water and rubbish every day. We can  reduce it, but we can't avoid it completely.  I think the government must take the lead.</p><p>I recently bought my first car. It's a Mitsubishi Lancer, which has good fuel efficiency. I use it to take my daughter to school and so that we can all get out of the city at the weekend and go somewhere where the  environment is a bit better. There is a Chinese expression: if you want to correct others, you should first correct yourself. That applies to the west's criticism of our country's environmental record. Global warming is not  a problem for one person, or one country. It is a problem for humanity as a whole. All countries must make a contribution.</p><p>It's hard to know what I can do as an individual. If our government takes the initiative and sets new regulations, I will follow them.  I guess most people are like that.</p><h2>Xu Zebin, 42,  manager at a foreign oil company </h2><p>I think I am doing very well living an environmentally friendly lifestyle because I always use buses for commuting. I think that is the best thing I can do to reduce emissions. It is part of my job because  I am working on a project for sustainable   urban mobility.</p><p>I have never had a car because public  transport in Beijing is quite good. It is sometimes a little crowded, as in any country, but that is not a big issue. Personal convenience does not justify emissions.</p><p>At least once a week, I get out of the city and walk around Fragrant Hills in the west. The air there is pretty good. But when you look back at the city from afar, you notice how bad the pollution is.</p><p>I do some recycling, mostly of plastic bags from the supermarket which I use for rubbish. To be honest, I haven't done anything to make my life carbon neutral. Even though I work in the environmental field, the concept is hard for me to understand. And if we can't understand, how can we take action?</p><p>Global warming worries me, but I think the best way for China to contribute to a solution is to promote energy efficiency. It is a practical, visible step. People can feel the result in their day-to-day lives. It is a fact that China is going to be the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. But no one country can solve the problem. The responsibility is global.</p><p>I wish schools would do more to educate people about the environment. I have a 17-year-old son, but I have never heard him talk about these issues at home. But overall, awareness is improving among the public and officials.</p><h2>Sun Jie, 29, magazine editor</h2><p>I do what I can to be green. In my office,  I encourage staff to bring their own cups rather than using the paper ones by the  office cooler. We also have a cotton \"office bag\" that we use when buying snacks so that we don't need plastic bags. If I go shopping with my friends, I tell them not to use them  as well. But I don't carry my own chopsticks around yet.</p><p>To be honest, I don't think about the  environment when I am shopping. I try to buy locally made goods to help the local market.  I also avoid goods in fancy packages - it's  better to buy fruit loose.  But I don't separate my rubbish. The main reason is that the  garbage bins don't show you how to do it.</p><p>To China's critics in the west, I would say, don't just complain, share your technology with us. China is the factory of the world. We make all the Christmas trees and the gifts that go under them for the developed countries. They want more so we make more. In the US, they don't want pollution so they close their factories and move them here. They are happy to buy the cheap goods we make. But then they come back and blame us for pollution  because there are so many factories here.</p><h2>Huang Weizhen, 28, Greenpeace campaigner</h2><p>My biggest worry is the air pollution in Beijing. The weather is usually bad, we don't get much sunshine and the air we breathe is not good, so I try to avoid spending too much time on the street. I either stay indoors or go quickly to the nearest public transport.</p><p>The problem has been caused by the  emergence in China of a middle class. More and more people are buying cars, but the  government has relaxed controls on car usage, so the air quality is getting worse. I have a bicycle but usually I travel by subway. I think people should avoid using private cars unless they are visiting friends who live far away. In daily life, they should use bikes or public transport. </p><p>I avoid using plastic bags because they don't decompose easily. I take my own chopsticks everywhere so I can avoid using disposable ones. At home, I use energy-saving light bulbs and I try to buy environmentally friendly clothing, such as cotton that is white, grey or black. It is better not to have things with bright colours because they are made with toxic  synthetic dyes. There is a line of environmentally friendly T-shirts on sale here, but at the moment they are a little too expensive for me.</p><p>I buy organic food bought locally as well as environmentally friendly DIY materials. There is not much I can do about energy efficiency in my home because the central heating is  controlled by the government, not me.</p><h2>Yuan Fengli, 25, photographer</h2><p>I have just bought a car and, yes, it contributes to the pollution. It is a bad thing for the environment, but living in the modern world you have to live with that.  I really wanted a car and now I have one. Since I got it, I haven't taken a single bus. I sometimes use taxis. But my car's engine isn't too big - just 1.6 litres. I try to save fuel with the way I drive, by not using the brake too often. </p><p>I also try to help the environment by  not throwing away batteries. I tried to use rechargeable ones for my work, but they don't work well with the camera's flash so I just buy regular AAs. I keep hold of them, even though I haven't worked out what to do with them yet. My girlfriend calls me an idiot for doing this, but I don't want them to cause pollution. I also try to make full use of plastic bags by using them for garbage or for picking up after my dog.</p><p>Of course, I don't do enough. If I earned enough money I would be happy to donate money to organisations that work to help the environment. But mostly I don't think about the environment that much.</p><p>When you develop as a country like we have, you have a phase when you build a lot a factories and that creates a lot of pollution. Only later do you realise this problem and  do something about it. I think China is  50-100 years behind the west. I think the  government realises this and is doing something to help, but I also understand if they don't do much because they have to drive  the economy forward.</p><h2>Fu Leiyun, 26  shop assistant</h2><p>I don't do much for the environment, but I make an effort. When I go shopping, I always take my own cotton bag. I have been doing that for three and a half years since I saw a television programme about how hard it is for plastic to biodegrade. </p><p>I have a car that my parents bought for me. I try not to use it for short distances. Instead,  I take a bus or walk. I sort my rubbish into  recycleable and non-recycleable bags. I don't drop litter, but if I see my friends doing that I help them pick it up.</p><p>We have too much traffic and not enough trees. In other countries, I think cities are much greener than ours. </p><p>But I am a common person. I have no power to decide anything and no special knowledge. All I can do is save energy in my daily life and encourage my friends to do the same.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Post questions and answers to <strong>Ask Leo</strong> The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1 3ER <strong>Fax: 020-7713 4366</strong>.

your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/13/coal-stations-activism\" title=\"interview with Sustainable Development Commission Chair Will Day\">interview with Sustainable Development Commission chairman Will Day</a> (Report, 14 August), I feel I must point out the importance and urgency of developing carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). With world demand for coal set to increase by over 60% over the period 2006-30, according to the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/\" title=\"International Energy Agency\">International Energy Agency</a>, as countries like China and India build the new power stations they need, it is clear that there is no credible solution to climate change without CCS.</p><p>Day asks to be shown where CCS is working, and that is the right question to ask. CCS needs to be demonstrated on a large scale in a power station, and the UK is taking a global lead in driving the technology to this next stage. We have already launched one competition for a 300MW demonstration and plan to support up to a further three in the UK. We  also want any new coal-fired power station constructed in the UK to demonstrate CCS on a substantial proportion of its capacity – reducing emissions from day one of operation and making a real contribution to the development of CCS.</p><p>With regard to the planned expansion of Heathrow, we have always said that the expansion cannot proceed unless stringent environmental limits on noise and air quality are met. In addition, aviation emissions will be capped under the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/index_en.htm\" title=\"EU emissions trading system\">EU emissions trading system</a> and the government has sent a strong signal to the air transport industry by announcing a new target to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from UK aviation to below 2005 levels by 2050.</p><p><strong>David Kidney</strong></p><p><em>Undersecretary of state for the</em><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\" Department of Energy and Climate Change\"><em> Department of Energy and Climate Change</em></a></p><p></p><p>• The chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission is right that statistics like \"one [coal power station] a week opening in China\" can't be waved as some trump card to justify doing nothing on climate change. But they are a reality check.</p><p>On air travel, also discussed, the Chinese are restricting themselves to a mere new airport a month. This brings UK aviation and its 0.1% share of all global emissions into rather stark relief. Avoiding Heathrow's acute capacity problems and third runway won't dent the problem; and discouraging certain types of flying rapidly becomes a moral maze. The answer is Day's remedy: pricing-in carbon. This is the way to change behaviour and accelerate innovation.</p><p><strong>Robert Siddall</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aoa.org.uk/home/index.asp\" title=\"Airport Operators Association\"><em>Airport Operators Association</em></a><em> </em>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>• Will Day is right to call for the price of air travel to rise and for the planned third runway at Heathrow not to go ahead. As well as emitting carbon dioxide, planes also contribute to global warming by emitting nitrogen oxide and water vapour at high altitudes. Estimates vary, but total global warming caused by air travel is probably at least twice as bad as burning the same amount of oil in other ways.</p><p>However, the argument about building coal-fired power stations in the UK is less straightforward. Regardless of what Britain does, China, India and many other countries will be massively expanding this form of power generation, and if their power stations are not fitted with very effective carbon capture and storage  technology, they will have a devastating impact upon the climate. Therefore, it may make sense for the UK to build some coal-fired power stations, but only if they are used to develop CCS. CCS needs to be greater than 90% efficient, and it needs to be cheap enough to be used worldwide, probably with subsidy from the EU and the US.</p><p><strong>Richard Mountford</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.twopercentfortheplanet.org/\" title=\"www.twopercentfortheplanet.org \"><em>www.twopercentfortheplanet.org </em></a></p><p></p><p>• You are right to highlight the need for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/aug/16/carbon-capture-gas-power-generation\" title=\"carbon capture and storage technology to be fitted to all kinds of fossil fuel power stations in the future\">carbon capture and storage technology to be fitted to all kinds of fossil fuel power stations in the future</a>. Many believe that CCS should just be fitted to ongoing and proposed coal-fired power plants but this would dangerously distort the market against cheaper coal and in favour of more import-dependent gas-fired power stations, on which the UK is becoming dangerously overreliant. Electricity from coal is cheaper than that generated by gas. The gas price is tied to a fluctuating oil price. It is accepted that CCS on coal plants will increase costs, but there is no policy consistency in only making one fossil fuel pay the price.</p><p>Importantly, 90% of all ongoing and approved power station construction in the UK today is gas-fired; but this point was not highlighted in the latest energy white paper, nor was the huge \"dash for gas\" which has taken place since 1997.</p><p>The government should now be looking to support new technologies which allow us to clean up, modernise and maintain our ongoing coal-fired stations before we can install CCS. New pre- and post-combustion coal stations must also be approved alongside better energy storage technologies for intermittent renewables. In order to help maintain some balance, the EU large combustion plant directive, which rules we must close many of our coal- and oil-fired power stations within six years, must also be re-examined.</p><p><strong>Tony Lodge</strong></p><p><em>Centre for Policy Studies</em></p><p></p><p><em>• </em>Further to your report (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/12/vestas-factory-closes-despite-campaign\" title=\"Vestas factory closes despite campaign\">Vestas factory closes despite campaign</a>, 12 August), the campaign to save the only major wind turbine blade manufacturer in the UK remains an urgent cause.

the foot\" by subsidising its coal, oil and gas industries by $4.2bn (£2.6bn) a year even as government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/01/labour-ed-davey-green-levies-energy-review\" title=\"\">reviews the \"green levies\" on energy bills which support energy efficiency and renewable power</a>, according to a report published on Thursday.</p><p>The figures from the <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Overseas Development Institute</a> suggest that Britain is now the world's fifth largest subsidiser of fossil fuels after the US, Russia, Australia and Germany despite commitments to cut carbon emissions and reduce \"perverse\" fossil fuel subsidies. In 2011, the latest year for which data is available, Britain gave tax breaks of £280m to oil and gas producers and reduced VAT on fossil fuels by several billion pounds, says the thinktank's report.</p><p>Rich countries have committed to phase out \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies but the ODI figures, drawn from the International energy agency, OECD and other sources, suggest global subsidies to fossil fuel producers totalled $523bn a year in 2011 – dwarfing subsidies to renewable energies. For every $1 spent to support renewable energy, another $6 were spent on fossil fuel subsidies, says the report.</p><p>\"They are subsidising the very activities that are pushing the world towards dangerous climate change, and creating barriers to investment in low-carbon development and subsidy incentives that encourage investment in carbon-intensive energy,\" says the report's author Shelagh Whitley.</p><p>\"In effect, each of the 11.6bn tonnes of carbon emitted from the top 11 developed countries comes with an average subsidy of $7 a tonne – around $112 for every adult,\" she said.</p><p>The figures have been released as ministers prepare to go to <a href=\"http://www.cop19.gov.pl/\" title=\"\">Poland for the deadlocked UN climate talks </a>and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/energy-industry-competition-test-cameron\" title=\"\"> as uncertainty surrounds the future of  government-mandated levies on energy bills that support fuel poverty schemes and renewable energy</a>.</p><p>G20 governments accepted in 2009 that fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce energy security, and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change. But the report suggests that special interest groups have hindered their elimination and little has changed.</p><p>\"The rules of the game are currently biased in favour of fossil fuels. The status quo encourages energy companies to continue burning high-carbon fossil fuels and offers no incentive to change. We're throwing money at policies that are only going to make the problem worse in the long run by locking us into dangerous climate change,\" said Whitley.</p><p>The report said: \"Investors are being sent the wrong signals on two fronts as carbon prices decline and fossil fuel subsidies increase.\"</p><p>The report argues that fossil fuel subsidies also fail in one of their core stated objectives, which is to to benefit the poorest. \"Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies would create a win-win scenario. It would eliminate the perverse incentives that drive up carbon emissions, create price signals for investment in a low-carbon transition and reduce pressure on public

But these costs will save money in the longer term because they will reduce reliance on expensive imported gas – on current gas prices, about £100bn will be saved by 2050.</p><p></p><p>The Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body set up to advise the government on meeting long-term carbon goals, said firmly on Wednesday that there was no reason to revise the UK's carbon budgets, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/17/uk-halve-carbon-emissions\" title=\"\">which require a halving of carbon emissions in the 2020s, compared with 1990 levels</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"This is clearly the most cost-effective way to proceed,\" said Lord Deben, chairman of the committee and former Conservative environment minister.

He suggested <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/28/climate-change-energy-bills-george-osborne\" title=\"\">that the UK was in danger of losing competitive advantage by going further and faster on carbon cuts than rival countries</a>.</p><p></p><p>But the committee told journalists the UK was \"not out in front\" compared with other EU member states and major trading nations such as China, which are also putting in place measures to curb greenhouse gases. Its study found that there was no impact on the UK's energy-intensive industries from the fourth carbon budget, which will run from 2023 to 2027, because they are already protected from carbon prices and rising energy costs.</p><p></p><p>Under the terms of the Climate Change Act, the government can only challenge the committee's findings if it can produce evidence contradicting the report. Any attempt to circumvent the advice would be subject to judicial review.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no deadline for the government's response to the study. That means that, in theory, the coalition could put off a decision until after the next general election in 2015. Lord Deben warned that postponing a response would hurt investment. \"There is a huge market out there [for green goods and services] – I want those jobs and investment to come to Britain,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Some sections of industry urged the chancellor to conduct his own \"hard-edged\" review of the carbon budgets. Steve Radley, director of policy at the manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: \"Industry will be deeply concerned that the committee on climate change is advising that the UK remains on a unilateral trajectory towards a 50% reduction in emissions. With other EU members showing little appetite to match our ambitions, this will continue to push electricity prices above our competitors and risks pushing investment abroad. Government must now demonstrates it understands the competitiveness issues at stake by undertaking a hard-edged review of the committee's evidence.\"</p><p></p><p>The EU is set to discuss its 2030 emissions target in the next few months, and several member states are arguing for a 50% reduction compared with 1990 levels, if this level of ambition is matched by other countries. The EEF was unable, when asked, to provide examples of investment going abroad as a result of the UK's carbon policies, or research on how the UK's carbon targets would affect productivity.</p><p></p><p>Green groups said the committee's findings should be confirmed as government policy as soon as possible. Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"There's no justification for watering down the fourth carbon budget – doing so would drive up emissions, drive away jobs and send Britain's international credibility on this crucial issue into reverse. Our over-reliance on increasingly costly fossil fuels has sent bills soaring. Leading businesses are crying out to invest in our huge renewable energy potential but they need the confidence to do so, which is why they are backing ambitious cuts in UK carbon.\"</p><p></p><p>More than 100 companies, including Unilever, Kingfisher and Sainsbury's, and a host of renewable energy and construction companies, called on the government to accept the committee's advice.</p><p></p><p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"The UK takes its obligations under the Climate Change Act, to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, extremely seriously. The committee's advice has an important role in the fourth carbon budget review and we agree with them that it is important to make a final decision as quickly as possible. We will consider the advice carefully as part of our work on the review, which will be published in the new year.\"</p>","headline":"Ministers must stick to carbon dioxide emissions reductions, says CCC","trailText":"Committee on Climate Change tells ministers to hold firm on commitment to cut carbon emissions drastically","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/12/10/1386696972612/George-Osborne-Delivers-A-001.jpg","wordcount":"817","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"424645530","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8432791","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Fiona Harvey, environment correspondent","internalPageCode":"2011243","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-12-14T06:00:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/11/uk-carbon-budget-emissions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/11/uk-carbon-budget-emissions","tags":[{"id":"environment/committee-on-climate-change","webTitle":"Committee on Climate Change","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/committee-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/committee-on-climate-change","references":[]},{"id":"environment/carbon-emissions","webTitle":"Greenhouse gas emissions","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/carbon-emissions","references":[]},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-change","references":[]},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/environment","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"environment/carbon-tax","webTitle":"Carbon tax","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-tax","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/carbon-tax","references":[]},{"id":"environment/pollution","webTitle":"Pollution","type":"keyword","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/environment/pollution","references":[]},{"id":"profile/fiona-harvey","webTitle":"Fiona Harvey","r2ContributorId":"42410","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/2/1/1296557630486/Fiona-Harvey.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Fiona Harvey is an award-winning environment journalist for the Guardian.

The IPCC makes clear that taking decisive action now will save lives and money. In fact, reducing carbon pollution rapidly and immediately can cut the overall economic damages of climate change in half. We will hear more on this topic when part three of the report – on mitigation options – is released in Berlin next week.</p><p>Given that the IPCC first sounded the alarm nearly 25 years ago, it's fair to ask why governments are more likely to take heed this time around.</p><p>First, governments have already <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/meeting/6295.php\" title=\"\">promised</a> to do what's necessary to hold temperature rise below 2C. Second, combating climate change makes good economic sense. Investing in energy efficiency creates jobs, and in the US alone would save <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/202074-make-energy-efficiency-part-of-us-policy\" title=\"\">hundreds of billions of dollars</a> on energy bills.</p><p>Governments could generate additional benefits by phasing out the wasteful subsidiing of fossil fuels. Producer subsidies and tax credits which create corporate incentives for new exploration and development should be the first to go. For the same money, we should increase  the development of clean, renewable energy.</p><p>Don't believe anyone who tells you that a 100% renewable energy-powered future is unrealistic. There are no technical barriers to addressing the climate crisis. The only thing missing is political will and leadership. The race to put a man on the moon is evidence enough of what can be accomplished when there is the political will to do so.</p><p>So how do we generate that necessary political will?</p><p>Business and financial leaders, pension fund managers, religious and labour leaders, and people from all walks of life are joining the fight to prevent catastrophic climate change. It is becoming increasingly obvious that climate change is not only about protecting polar bears or the environment, but is fundamentally about people – about jobs, food, water, children, and quality of life. Global change will only happen when people perceive it as relevant to their daily struggles and priorities – and at this critical moment in history, people are <a href=\"http://www.climatedots.org/\" title=\"\">connecting the dots</a>. As leaders of the two largest international climate networks, we are optimistic that a political tipping point is approaching.</p><p>Heads of state and government will gather at the United Nations this September for a summit which will focus exclusively on climate change. This represents a historic opportunity for our leaders to address the crisis head on, and for civil society to demand it of them.  They must announce bold actions at the national and local levels which go far beyond the status quo.</p><p>To remain within relatively safe limits of temperature rise, we can't bow to the will of the likes of ExxonMobil. The <a href=\"http://www.ecofys.com/en/publication/feasibility-of-ghg-emissions-phase-out-by-mid-century/\" title=\"\">science</a> tells us that we need to phase out greenhouse gas emissions by around the middle of the century. Admittedly, this is a challenging goal but unless we want to consign our children and grandchildren to a world reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic B-movie, it's a challenge worth accepting.</p><p>So is it too late, or is it not too late? That is not a question, but a choice.</p><p><em>Kelly Rigg is the executive director of the </em><a href=\"http://tcktcktck.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Call to Climate Action</em></a><em>, a network of more than 400 non-profit organisations.

Horizon plans new reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, north Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire.</p><p>The Japanese company's move means EDF, which last week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/future-nuclear-power-uk-edf?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">threatened to hold the government to ransom</a> for higher subsidies for its nuclear plans, will face competition in constructing new reactors. David Cameron said: \"This is a decades-long, multibillion-pound vote of confidence that will contribute vital new infrastructure to power our economy. It will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational, as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the UK's nuclear supply chain.\"</p><p>At the same time, a pot of £1bn in government funding will be made available to up to three projects that promise to be the first major demonstration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in the UK.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/carbon-capture-competition-shortlist\" title=\"\">four shortlisted projects</a> – chosen from eight submissions – are made up of two in Scotland (one at Grangemouth and another at Peterhead), along with one in Teesside and a project connected to the UK's biggest coal-fired power station, Drax in Yorkshire.</p><p>Edward Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"[This] is an important step towards an exciting new industry, one that could help us reduce our carbon emissions and create thousands of jobs.\"</p><p>But critics complained that the government had merely put off its decision on CCS, as the precise details of the funding will not be announced until next year.</p><p>Tom Greatrex the shadow energy minister, said: \"Yet again Ed Davey has kicked a decision about support for CCS into the long grass, creating more uncertainty for the industry. We are now at risk of losing our competitive advantage in developing low-carbon technologies, engineering expertise and valuable skills that we could export around the globe.\" owing to the difficulty of putting together a business plan that would satisfy investors.</p><p>The scale of the energy challenge facing the UK is daunting. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Council, said it was the equivalent of having to run an operation the size of the Olympics every two years for the next two and a half decades. He said every CCS plant would cost about £1bn for the carbon capture technology alone, in addition to the money needed to build the power plant, and about $70 per tonne for dealing with the resulting carbon dioxide on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Stuart Haszeldine, an expert on CCS at University of Edinburgh, said the announcement had injected momentum into the important task of developing technology that will be needed to meet the UK's carbon targets. \"It is unexpectedly good news. We now have four plausible designs.

As far as I am concerned, they are two sides of the same coin. Yet with increasing concerns about the prospects for the economy, not least with the chill winds blowing from the Eurozone, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/29/autumn-statement-george-osborne-green-policies\" title=\"\">some are now beginning to argue that the environment is a luxury we can't afford</a>. They couldn't be more wrong.</p><p></p><p>The way to grow jobs is not by propping up the past, but by investing in the future. At the Department for Transport, we have made it clear that we need to do all we can to decarbonise road transport. Our firm commitment to low-carbon vehicles is beginning to pay off, not simply in lower carbon emissions but in terms of investment in jobs for the future. We will shortly see manufacture of the new electric Nissan Leaf begin in Sunderland, safeguarding 360 jobs and creating 200 more with the production of the new lithium ion battery.</p><p></p><p>Our ambitious investment in rail, particularly in electrification, is creating jobs today and cutting carbon tomorrow. Our Green Bus Fund, now in its third round, is not just cleaning up our buses, but proving a real boon for British bus manufacturers, both in terms of domestic supply and export potential. And our record spend on local sustainable transport is cleaning up our cities and boosting their economies.</p><p></p><p>So embracing green is good for jobs. The environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, hit the nail on the head at a Rio+20 Earth summit event recently, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/09/rio-20-earth-summit-caroline-spelman-speech?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">she said</a>: \"Being green is integral to sustainable economic growth.\"</p><p></p><p>The simple fact is that while much of the economy is struggling, there is a growing demand for green products. Private companies invested £2.5bn in renewable energy projects in the seven months from last April, with 11,619 new jobs being created, often in areas of higher unemployment such as the north-east, an area which has also enthusiastically embraced the move to electric vehicles.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Britain has the world's sixth largest low-carbon and environmental goods sector, employing over 900,000 people and growing by 4% a year. As a government we are determined to build on this using the British genius for invention and innovation to capitalise on the low-carbon future the world is embracing.</p><p></p><p>One reason why investment levels have been buoyant in green areas is because industry understands that we have to do things differently in the future. To take just one example, the growth of the emerging economies, particularly China, has led to a real terms increase in commodity prices of 147% over the past decade. If we want to prosper tomorrow, we cannot simply pull away at yesterday's levers. We need new answers, and ideally ones which are free from price fluctuation or the whims of unstable regimes. And that means reducing our dependency on oil for transport and energy. The result: more energy security, more UK-based jobs, less carbon.</p><p></p><p>But we also need to ensure that the decisions that individual departments like Transport take are properly joined up across government. We have set ourselves a tough challenge: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to be the greenest government ever</a>. It is a challenge that we in government are determined to meet, working across government departments rather than pigeon-holing the environment in only one or two departments of government. Safeguarding our environment has to be a cross-government purpose as important to the Business Department, the Treasury or Communities and local government as it is to Defra or Decc.</p><p></p><p>Governments can of course only do so much, but one key way to make a difference is to set a clear direction of travel and stick to it. So another reason why green investment has been buoyant is because of the clear buy-in by all three major political parties that tackling climate change is an essential, not just for environmental reasons, but economic ones too. If anyone doubted that, the game-changing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">Stern report</a>, emanating from the heart of the City, made it very clear that the price of doing nothing was greater than the price of taking action.</p><p></p><p>That is why creating growth and cutting carbon are twin objectives that we are determined to remain focussed on in government so that we can deliver both a stronger economy and a safer world.</p>","headline":"We must capitalise on a low-carbon future","trailText":"<strong>Norman Baker: </strong>Some are beginning to argue that the environment is a luxury we can't afford.

The warning came as Campbell said the Lib Dem grassroots would tolerate no rowing back from the green agenda that is central to their purpose in government following the resignation of Chris Huhne.</p><p>Huhne, one of the Lib Dems' toughest operators, resigned as energy secretary to mount a \"robust defence\" of claims that he persuaded his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, to take his penalty points for a speeding offence in 2003. The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, and his ex-wife, who faces a related charge, will appear before Westminster magistrates on 16 February. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>Campbell told the <em>Observer</em> that the Lib Dems' credibility rested on the new energy secretary taking as tough a line on green issues as Huhne and not giving in to the demands of the Tory right.</p><p>\"Liberal Democrat voters, and in particular Lib Dem activists, will not be content if there is any rowing back on the green agenda,\" he said. \"Commitment to the environment has an iconic place in the Lib Dem approach and if we were seen to water that down, publicly and privately, things could get very tough.\"</p><p>Environmentalists expressed dismay at the loss of Huhne from the heart of government. Greenpeace said he had been \"a vocal advocate for the green agenda in a government whose green credentials are looking more than a little tarnished\".</p><p>Huhne was furious when the chancellor, George Osborne, suggested in his autumn statement last November that the government could not put green policies before the need to create jobs.</p><p>\"We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminium smelters and paper manufacturers,\" the chancellor said. \"All we will be doing is exporting valuable jobs out of Britain.\"</p><p>Davey, 46, the former consumer affairs minister, , who has had a relatively low-profile career in the party until now, will join Nick Clegg  at an event which officials insist will demonstrate the party's determination to keep green policies at the top of the government's agenda.</p><p>Clegg is due to give a major speech on the environment within weeks, before Osborne's budget next month. Lib Dem sources said Davey, Clegg and others would be working on ideas on how to raise money to pay for more tax cuts for low earners through pollution taxes, most probably on aviation.</p><p>On his promotion to the Cabinet, Davey said he was \"particularly conscious of the impact on consumers' households across the country of high energy bills\". He made clear he would continue with Huhne's plans to increase the number of windfarms and \"a green economy where there's lots of green jobs to help growth in our economy\".</p><p>He added: \"I am
