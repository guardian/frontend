        "body":"<p>There is no guaranteed safe way for a woman to respond to an unwanted \"compliment\" from a stranger on the street,Â but one artist in the US got closer to finding an answer on Thursday. </p><p>Artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh has pasted posters in the northeast US bearing messages along the lines of: \"Women are not outside for your entertainment,\" and \"My outfit is not an invitation,\" as part of her Stop Telling Women Smile street art project. </p><p>Nearly 850 people backed her online fundraising campaign to extend the project's geographic reach. The fundraiser closed Thursday morning after raising more than $34,500 in 30 days. </p><p>These funds will enable Fazlalizadeh to take her project across the US through the winter. In the spring, she plans to use the funds to make the project international, though she is still figuring out which cities to go to. </p><p>\"I could take it everywhere, because street harassment does happen everywhere,\" Fazlalizadeh told the Guardian.</p><p>Fazlalizadeh was looking for a way to talk about street harassment when she came up with the idea for the project. \"That's what I use my art for, to speak out about social and political things I have an opinion on,\" she said. </p><p>To create the posters, Fazlalizadeh interviews women about street harassment, draws their portraits, then uses an anecdote from the story to design a poster. The posters then get pasted around cities.</p><p>The fundraiser met its $15,000 fundraising goal in the first week of its launch. In the final hours of the campaign, more than $2,500 was raised.</p><p>Fazlalizadeh is using the funds to pay for travel and to hire a filmmaker to document the experience. She will also be partnering with anti-street harassment groups including <a href=\"http://www.ihollaback.org/\">Hollaback</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/\">StopStreetHarassment.org</a> as she participates in community events in the cities she visits. </p><p>\"It was really surprising to me, and great for me to know I related to other women, but it was also disheartening to see how many women go through this and just how severe it can be,\" Fazlalizadeh said.  </p><p>Fazlalizadeh started to plan the project in February 2012 and put her first poster up in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood that September. She then put posters up in Philadelphia and Washington DC as the project was picking up traction in the media. </p><p>Her inbox is filled with emails from women moved by her project, many of whom share stories about incidents of street harassment that became serious after the woman did not respond to it in a way the aggressor preferred.</p><p>\"A lot of women have talked to me about how things can jump from a seemingly nice comment to instantly becoming an insult and becoming an assault if the woman doesn't respond the way the man wants her to, and that's kind of the common theme of the stories I've been getting,\" Fazlalizadeh said. </p><p>The argument that these comments are well-intentioned has led some to criticize her for including the Stop Telling Women To Smile poster in her project. </p><p>\"A lot of people tell me the smile thing shouldn't be considered harassment when you think about how it's seemingly genuine and not harmful, but then it can instantly turn harmful when you don't respond the way that a man wants you to. That makes it street harassment.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418975618|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|45dd848520d6aa8460a8f7e8a1890036daa9ff76 -->",
