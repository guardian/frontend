He became the president of the Bahrain Football Association in 2002 and the president of the Asian Football Confederation in 2013. He has been accused of being complicit in the torture of several Bahraini footballers following the uprising in that country in 2011 (accusations he strenuously denies) and of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/23/sheikh-salman-fifa-football-development-money\">using football development money to further a previous campaign</a>. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>Gianni Infantino</strong></strong> - a Swiss-Italian lawyer who has been general secretary of Uefa since 2009, and who many of you will know as the star of various draw ceremonies. His closeness to Michel Platini probably doesn’t exactly help his candidacy, and one of the reforms he will push for should he be elected is an increase of teams at the World Cup from 32 to 40. </li> \n <li> <strong><strong>Prince Ali al-Hussein</strong></strong> - the third son of the King of Jordan, Prince Ali challenged Sepp Blatter for the presidency in 2015. He is a former Fifa vice-president, president of the Jordan football association and of the West Asian Football Federation, which he helped to found. He’s probably the most likely to introduce significant reforms and has public support, and attempted to bring in transparent voting booths for the election, an attempt that was not successful. </li> \n <li><strong> Toyko Sexwale</strong> – real name Mosima Gabriel Sexwale, he’s a South African former businessman and politician who was imprisoned on Robben Island at the same time as Nelson Mandela. At one point he considered running for the presidency of South Africa, but eventually withdrew. He was involved in the organising committee for the 2010 World Cup, and also fronted the South African version of the Apprentice. He got his nickname from his involvement in karate as a younger man. </li> \n <li><strong> Jerome Champagne</strong> – a former French diplomat who also held various positions within Fifa between 1999-2010, where he was an adviser to Blatter, the deputy secretary general and director of international relations.

He became the president of the Bahrain Football Association in 2002 and the president of the Asian Football Confederation in 2013. He has been accused of being complicit in the torture of several Bahraini footballers following the uprising in that country in 2011 (accusations he strenuously denies) and of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/23/sheikh-salman-fifa-football-development-money\">using football development money to further a previous campaign</a>. </li> <li> <strong><strong>Gianni Infantino</strong></strong> - a Swiss-Italian lawyer who has been general secretary of Uefa since 2009, and who many of you will know as the star of various draw ceremonies. His closeness to Michel Platini probably doesn’t exactly help his candidacy, and one of the reforms he will push for should he be elected is an increase of teams at the World Cup from 32 to 40. </li> <li> <strong><strong>Prince Ali al-Hussein</strong></strong> - the third son of the King of Jordan, Prince Ali challenged Sepp Blatter for the presidency in 2015. He is a former Fifa vice-president, president of the Jordan football association and of the West Asian Football Federation, which he helped to found. He’s probably the most likely to introduce significant reforms and has public support, and attempted to bring in transparent voting booths for the election, an attempt that was not successful. </li> <li><strong> Toyko Sexwale</strong> – real name Mosima Gabriel Sexwale, he’s a South African former businessman and politician who was imprisoned on Robben Island at the same time as Nelson Mandela. At one point he considered running for the presidency of South Africa, but eventually withdrew. He was involved in the organising committee for the 2010 World Cup, and also fronted the South African version of the Apprentice. He got his nickname from his involvement in karate as a younger man. </li> <li><strong> Jerome Champagne</strong> – a former French diplomat who also held various positions within Fifa between 1999-2010, where he was an adviser to Blatter, the deputy secretary general and director of international relations. He attempted to challenge Blatter in 2015 but didn’t get enough support to make the ballot, but said during that campaign that he would consider removing the 2022 World Cup from Qatar.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d03314e4b074a9f6b35bb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T11:27:51.420Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some more details on the reform bill that was passed earlier are here, should you fancy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/26/fifa-members-vote-reform-package-election\">Fifa members vote in favour of reform package at extraordinary congress</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d03169e4b074a9f6b35baa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T11:09:17.005Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The congress also voted to remove a chap called Canover Watson from the Audit and Compliance Committee, a man who was recently jailed for seven years over five counts of corruption.

Fifa.</strong> This is either the start of the reform, the beginning of a new way of governing the world game in which unfairness and corruption will be cast out and we can all live in peaceful harmony. Or just a case of welcome the new bloke, same as the last bloke, the equivalent of Fifa changing its shirt and charging back out into the world to carry on more or less as it was before. </p> <p>The Fifa Extraordinary Congress is upon us, a name which does make it seem like rather more of an exciting even than the glorified admin that it actually is, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun, right guys?</p> <p>A brief summary of how the day is going to go will read a little something like this.</p> <ul> <li>At the time of writing, everyone is having lunch, which might seem a little premature (they dispersed to the canteen at 11.30am local time) but it’s probably a good idea to break early given the interminable process that is to come.<br /></li> <li>Earlier, after taking a roll call to ensure everyone was present, the Fifa congress voted on the new package of reforms, and you’ll be delighted to learn it passed – 179 votes in favour, 22 against. Those reforms included a term limit for the new president, greater transparency in terms of salaries and various human rights provisions.<br /></li> <li>At 12.00 GMT the fun will begin, with the five presidential candidates – Gianni Infantino, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Tokyo Sexwale, Prince Al bin al-Hussein and Jerome Champagne – offering their platforms in an allocated 15 minute time period. We’ll introduce you to the candidates more formally in a bit.<br /></li> <li>After that, the process of voting begins, which could take a while. At that point we’ll probably just have to talk among ourselves.<br /></li> <li>The result is tentatively expected at around 5.30pm GMT, but don’t necessarily hold us to that. There may not be a definitive result from the first round of ballots (a two-thirds majority is required), so another round will be required when a simple 50% majority will suffice. If there still isn’t a winner, a third round will take place when the candidate with the lowest votes is eliminated, and we continue until there is a new president.<br /></li> </ul> <p>After that...handshakes, fizz, celebration and recriminations. Stick with us. It could genuinely be quite an interesting day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T11:12:14.308Z\">at 11.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56d029e7e4b0d38537b1f5f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:35:03.829Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/25/fa-greg-dyke-fifa-sepp-blatter\">FA’s Greg Dyke: Sepp Blatter would win Fifa poll again if he was standing</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:45:02.217Z\">at 10.45am GMT</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"5199","creationDate":"2016-02-26T10:16:35Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-26T10:42:59Z","internalComposerCode":"56d02603e4b0d38537b1f5ec","internalPageCode":"2463770","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-04-04T11:02:42Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/99129ca4d48480887d011f84a014a5c0d0819c3d/0_193_2000_1199/500.jpg","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4h4hk","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/99129ca4d48480887d011f84a014a5c0d0819c3d/0_193_2000_1199/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"2636","internalShortId":"/p/4h4hk"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2016/feb/26/fifa-election-who-will-succeed-sepp-blatter-president-live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/26/fifa-election-who-will-succeed-sepp-blatter-president-live","webTitle":"Fifa election: Gianni Infantino wins presidential election – as it happened","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-26T17:48:18Z","sectionName":"Football","sectionId":"football","type":"liveblog","id":"football/live/2016/feb/26/fifa-election-who-will-succeed-sepp-blatter-president-live","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"football","webTitle":"Football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football","editions":[{"id":"football","webTitle":"Football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
