        "headline":"Russell Brand might be better off actually trying to help the dispossessed",
        "body":"<p>The comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/30/robert-webb-russell-brand-vote\" title=\"\">Robert Webb is so incensed by&nbsp;the anti-politician rhetoric of the comedian Russell Brand</a> that's he has rejoined the Labour Party. Perhaps Webb should have talked this through with his sometime collaborator, the comedian David Mitchell. Mitchell insists, in response to the campaigning for more robust press regulation by the comedian Steve Coogan, that involving politicians in press regulation could be \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/27/leveson-press-regulation-steve-coogan-david-mitchell\" title=\"\">catastrophic</a>\". Which rather suggests that Mitchell also sees politicians more as problem than solution.</p><p>Good on all of them. It's nice to see clever, funny people exhibiting passionate engagement with current affairs. But I can't help wishing that these comics were all just a tiny bit less attractive. As the unattributed wit once said: \"Politics is showbusiness for ugly people.\" Good gag. Yet, as Brand declares his empathy for the dispossessed and the problems they face, you do wonder if he'd be more usefully employed actually taking political surgeries and engaging with trying to help people directly.</p><p>However, few people in showbusiness could even begin to handle the level of contempt that politicians routinely face. And even if they could, they might find it harder to bear the public scrutiny of their private lives that politicians have to accept. That, after all, is where Coogan came in. And Britain may be ready to read and listen to the social critique that Brand so eloquently offers. But it's probably less ready to vote for a recovering heroin addict and non-recovering womaniser, even if Brand were not exhorting people never, ever to vote.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">his notorious political essay for the New Statesman</a> last month (commissioned by himself, as guest editor for a week), Brand quoted the comedian Billy Connolly, who warned that: \"The desire to be a politician should bar you for life from ever being one.\" Now, leaving aside the fact that it's pretty wonderful that such a thing as a \"notorious political essay\" is doing the rounds in the UK, the fact remains that all people who have a desire for a public profile and an audience believe in their ability and right to have power over others. The main difference is that people in showbusiness are accountable to the market, while politicians are accountable to the democratic will of the people. (Obviously, both sets of people rely on the perfidious media to set out their stall, which causes no end of resentment.)</p><p>By projecting himself as a passionate, radical thinker and anti-establishment poster-boy, Brand is building Brand Brand. In his essay, Brand acknowledges the hypocrisy of having \"without a flicker of self-awareness palmed off my shopping bags jammed with consumer treats and headed for the throng\" of a Reclaim the Streets march that developed into a riot. But he&nbsp;doesn't much like it when another protester questions his right to be there because \"you work for MTV\".</p><p>Now, I like Brand. I see his appeal. I love his writing. But&nbsp;I also find him absurd, because he doesn't see that he is criticising the politics of individualism from a platform entirely reliant on the personality cult he himself has zealously constructed. This was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">what Jeremy Paxman was getting at when he took Brand to task</a> the other week for believing he had the right to call for revolution. I found it touching when Paxman asked Brand if he didn't think that perhaps politicians feel rather paradoxically powerless themselves. Maybe, he said, \"they're simply overwhelmed by the scale of the&nbsp;problem\". It's not that I agree with Paxman. Connolly's point, surely, was that what marks politicians apart from others is that they don't feel overwhelmed at all, that they have the arrogance to believe that they are part of the solution. But Brand has that arrogance, too. In his essay, he calls for \"six billion individuals\" to seize the moment and join \"the revolution of consciousness\". He calls it optimism. But it's also arrogance, the idea that the world could heal itself by thinking, in unison, like Brand.</p><p>In part, Brand is just working the programme, bringing the philosophy of <a href=\"http://www.na.org/\" title=\"\">Narcotics Anonymous</a> meetings to the pages of a political magazine. Brand exhorts people to find their connection to God or their higher power in order to understand that they are not the centre of the universe and that their self-destructive impulses cannot be beaten through their own willpower; that, on the contrary, it's self-willfulness that leads people into addiction. The addiction anonymous model asks people to accept that they can't have one drink, because they don't have the willpower to resist a second. You gain self-control by accepting that you don't&nbsp;have any. It's the opposite of politics, and this explains Brand's seemingly nihilistic view quite fully (if you leave aside the fact that arrogance is supposed to be the enemy of recovery from addiction).</p><p>I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/09/russell-brand-birmingham-symphony-hall-review\" title=\"\">Brand's Messiah Complex show</a> in London the other week, in which he – in jest, of course – compares himself to Che Guevara, Gandhi, Malcolm X and Christ. The picaresques by which he drew self-deprecating parallels between himself and these figures were beautifully constructed. Yet I wouldn't be surprised if there was a corner of Brand's mind, perhaps unacknowledged even by himself, where he wonders whether there's some higher spiritual purpose in his own fame and success – and the platform to proselytise that it has delivered to him.</p><p>Brand talks about being famous in his show as well, and the access to endless vaginas it has brought him. Jemima Khan, presumably the attractive woman Brand says he accepted the guest editorship of the New Statesman to please, was in the audience. I can't speak for Khan, but if a man I had been romantically involved with spoke in public about women in such reductive terms, I&nbsp;would not be comfortable. Yet part of him, quite clearly, is deeply romantic. There's something as self-destructive as drug addiction in embracing a persona that glorifies the physicality of sex over the intimacy of emotion. The way in which Brand talks about women generally is not empathetic towards the&nbsp;women in his life as individuals.</p><p>Yet the promotion of empathy is surely key to the spiritual renewal that Brand appears seriously to be preaching. And funnily enough, empathy is central to the thesis of comedian David Baddiel, in his show, <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/david-baddiel-78334\" title=\"\">Fame: Not the Musical</a>. (As are anecdotes about his great friend Russell Brand.) Baddiel believes that there is a lack of empathy for the famous. It's why, he thinks, trolls send them insulting tweets or post nasty comments below their articles. It's why, he thinks, critics feel free to say awful things about their work.</p><p>The point I think Baddiel is missing is that his own awareness of himself as \"famous\" leads him to believe the lack of empathy he experiences is bound up with his difference, his fame. It is, in the particular. But, more generally, the urge to \"other\" people is endemic. Sure, putting people in a box marked \"famous and therefore not like us\" is a way of absolving oneself of empathy for that person. But so is putting people in a box marked \"feckless\" or \"immigrant\" or \"weirdo\" or \"old\" or \"lefty\" or \"Tory\" or \"woman\". A good way of dispatching the need for empathy is to find any label that can in some way read: \"Not like me.\"</p><p>Politicians are routinely accused of lacking empathy, with some justification. Yet, you could argue that they are merely giving (or failing to give) as good as they get (or fail to get). Politicians live in a box marked, in giant, angry letters: \"Not like me.\" It's a box Brand believes they should be sealed up in, without even the occasional vote to acknowledge their existence. Maybe Brand is utterly wrong. Maybe the \"revolution of consciousness\"  he calls for needs to start with some rumination on the idea that it is precisely by insisting on our right to have no empathy for politicians that we get the empathy-lacking politicians that, if the non-comedian Alexis de Tocqueville was correct, we perhaps deserve.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421451765|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|749a252dc5a877282be67b94339655630ce756bb -->",

        "body":"<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine got married. To do this, she moved to London from Germany, leaving behind her friends, her family – and her job. She wasn't too worried about this: she'd built up more than a decade of experience and achievements. She could speak perfect English. She'd miss her family but financially, she'd be fine.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, London had other ideas. She went to interview after interview. They all ended in rejection.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she went to an interview where she was asked some odd questions. She was asked which part of London she lived in. She was asked what her husband did. And finally the interviewer just came out with it: \"Look, your husband is obviously doing quite well for himself, you've just got married, why do you even want a job?\"</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, that question contained the sexist (not to mention economically antiquated) idea that women just work for pin money. But it also hinted at another issue: the issue of babies. The issue of maternity leave. The issue of \"why should I hire you when you'll probably just end up costing me thousands of pounds in wasted pay a few months down the line?\"</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2013/11/04/government-launches-pregnancy-discrimination-investigation/\" title=\"\">European court of human rights has just been given £1m</a> by Maria Miller, the minister for women and equalities, to investigate just how bad this situation is. This follows on from a damning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/mar/09/women-on-maternity-leave-illegal-discrimation\" title=\"\">Slater &amp; Gordon poll</a> showing that many women were returning from maternity leave to worse jobs – or sometimes no job at all.</p><p></p><p>Research into this area is of course welcome. But I can't help but feel that we are ignoring the most obvious reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/04/review-pregnancy-discrimination-work\" title=\"\">women are discriminated against in this way</a>. The issue is at heart incredibly simple: it's about money.</p><p></p><p>Women from the age of 30 to 45 are viewed with suspicion and seen as a liability. They are a fecund cost waiting to happen. So why, these companies think, should we take the risk on this well-qualified woman, when we can place a safe bet on this man. He might not be as effective at the job, but at least he'll be around in six months' time. And so the cycle continues, with brilliant women floundering in their careers, overtaken by men not as a result of merit, but as a result of a shrewd cost decision. And perhaps the most irritating thing about this cycle is how easy it is to fix.</p><p></p><p>It is currently enshrined in law that women are the primary care-givers. Women get 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional maternity leave. Men get one or two weeks of ordinary paternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional paternity leave. There is no reason for this disparity, beyond a traditional notion that women are somehow more innately qualified than men to bring up children.</p><p></p><p>It's great that the government is finally sitting up and taking notice of this problem. It's great that it is seeing that legislating against discrimination doesn't mean that it stops. But what we need to see now is some action to change that. And splitting leave equally between the two parents of a child is the obvious and equitable way to do that.</p><p>Until men are seen as equally likely to take time off because of the child that they have brought into the world, this kind of covert, wink-wink discrimination will continue – and it will continue to affect women who don't intend to or can't have children, as much as those who do. If a company can't know either way, it is going to take the safer bet. And that bet is going to result in more women like my friend, who is still looking for a job, and still not finding one. I'm starting to wonder if she ever will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683067|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|3b167b213761b6738a27b3612118ecad8d4b27ba -->",

        "headline":"Obamacare and Romneycare: same framework doesn't mean same results",
        "body":"<p>President Obama parachuted into Boston this week to wax nostalgic about Massachusetts healthcare reform.</p><p>Flanked by his good friend Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and cheered by a friendly crowd (minus a few anti-Keystone XL pipeline hecklers), it was clear why the president felt \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jn4jJTLzgM'\">good to be back in Boston</a>\". Under siege after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/obamacare-website-glitches-cgi-private-contractors\">disastrous website launch</a> of his own national healthcare exchange, Obama hoped to boost the fortunes of his own signature achievement – for a few minutes in the news cycle at least – by showcasing some of its similarities to the country's first successful universal health care reform effort.</p><p>Let me give you the Massachusetts perspective.</p><p>Seven years ago then-Governor Mitt Romney, flanked by Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy and a phalanx of state lawmakers and other officials, signed the legislation that became the template for Obamacare. \"Romneycare\", like Obamacare, was built on \"ideas about markets and competition that had long been championed by conservatives\", said Obama who used the same downtown Boston venue, the historic Faneuil Hall, to make his pitch.</p><p>In a 2006 address, Romney called the state's healthcare law, which created a new marketplace where people could research and buy healthcare plans vetted by state officials, a \"once in a generation opportunity\". He said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Let's open the way for every Massachusetts citizen to have high quality, private health insurance.</p></blockquote><p> At that time, more than 500,000 people in Massachusetts were uninsured.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://bluecrossmafoundation.org/sites/default/files/060700MHRLawSummary.pdf\">Massachusetts healthcare law</a> requires every resident to have health plan coverage; anyone who decides to forgo coverage must pay a penalty based on 50% of the minimum insurance premium available that an individual would qualify for. An independent public board, the <a href=\"https://www.mahealthconnector.org/\">Massachusetts Health Connector</a>, oversees the healthcare exchange, which offers a range of insurance options from providers that have met the state's coverage standards.</p><p>The Bay State also expanded Medicaid subsidies for low-income residents and increased the numbers of children who are eligible. Young adults are allowed to stay on parents' plans until they turn 26, or they can seek out reduced rates for coverage through the state exchange. Massachusetts did not levy new taxes to pay for the program; higher Medicaid reimbursements from the federal government cover the programs costs.</p><p>Obamacare operates on a similar framework. The federal government expanded Medicaid eligibility. Young people can stay on their parents' plans until age 26, but it does the Bay State one better by allowing them to stay on that plan even if they have a job that offers insurance coverage.</p><p>Most Massachusetts residents accepted the individual mandate with few complaints. Businesses, however, balked at what turned out to be the most controversial aspect of Romneycare, a $295 per employee penalty for firms with 11 or more full time workers that choose not to offer insurance.</p><p>Obamacare is more forgiving of small businesses. Firms with less than 50 people do not have to pay a penalty. The federal plan comes with a sweetener that Romneycare did not offer: companies that meet certain criteria can receive <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Affordable-Care-Act-Tax-Provisions\">tax credits</a>.</p><p>A 2012 <a href=\"http://www.masstaxpayers.org/publications/health_care/20120413/massachusetts_health_reform_spending_20062011_update_\"budget_buste\">study</a> by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a statewide business group, found that only a tiny percentage of the state's budget went to Romneycare. However, the federal health care plan includes new taxes such as levies on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/opinion/the-myth-of-the-medical-device-tax.html?_r=0\">medical devices</a> and tanning salons.</p><p>Although Obama celebrated the state's bipartisan healthcare accomplishments, the Bay State's political realities were more complex than the optics at the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.bostonglobe.com/rw//Boston/2011-2020/WebGraphics/National/BostonGlobe.com/2012/06/21healthcare/images/2006Romney.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/08/von-hoffman-award-mitt-romney/&amp;h=1207&amp;w=1568&amp;sz=704&amp;tbnid=JXzVEbPIzR6PuM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=117&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__mYhf1QjzOhWiRcT2A6PiN45FoBM=&amp;docid=jnxKgF5Vgl0Z9M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wEtzUpWvDqK0sATujIHADg&amp;ved=0CDMQ9QEwAQ\">Faneuil Hall signing</a> suggested. Romney was well acquainted with the facts of the game in Massachusetts.</p><p>He weighed in at important junctures in the healthcare debate. But with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature steering the bill from start to finish, the governor was essentially relegated to a secondary role. Romney vetoed the employer penalty, a symbolic rebuke many believed was predicated more on his presidential run than Massachusetts realities. The legislature had little trouble overriding his veto. </p><p>Romney knew that Massachusetts was onto something revolutionary, but fearful of conservative opposition on the road to the White House, he ditched those aspirations. When he became the Republicans standard-bearer in 2012, he abandoned the most important piece of legislation during his tenure in office.</p><p>Even as Obama trumpets the Massachusetts reform, it's far from a one-size-fits-all model. The Bay State is an outlier in the US, a comparatively wealthy state where many people were already covered by employer-sponsored health insurance programs. The number of uninsured people was small and a large number of residents were already eligible for Medicaid.</p><p>Today, 98% of state residents have health insurance coverage. An August Massachusetts Medical Society <a href=\"http://www.massmed.org/News-and-Publications/MMS-News-Releases/MMS-2013-Public-Opinion-Survey-Shows--High-Satisfaction-with-Health-Care,-Easy-Access-to-Care,--But-Cost,-Affordability-Remain-Most-Important-Issues/#.UnM_ERbvyrc\">poll</a> found that 84% of respondents were satisfied with their healthcare choices and experienced few problems finding care. As the president rightly pointed out, no \"parade of horribles\" descended on the state.</p><p>However, Romney weighed in the Bay State plan on that very subject on<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10151730960446121\"> his Facebook page</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> A plan crafted to fit the unique circumstances of a single state should not be grafted onto the entire country.</p></blockquote><p>Universal health coverage in Massachusetts is settled business. State lawmakers, healthcare professionals, and economists are focused on trickier issues like controlling healthcare costs. It remains to be seen if the rest of America can embrace Obamacare's similar reforms without fear or begin to devise viable alternatives to cover the uninsured that are tailored to each individual state's circumstances.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421463015|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|958a676f4f25a660cbe476eeab21493957d6b085 -->",

        "body":"<p>The co-operative movement, started by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/27/co-operative-group-retail\" title=\"\">Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers</a> in the 19th century is fascinating in terms of social history. The Rochdale pioneers were a collective of weavers who developed a set of ethical principles which formed the basis for their first co-operative and for the modern movement. These included democratic member-control of the co-operative, which was to be community oriented, in other words, a social enterprise. Membership was open to all, without fear of discrimination in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation or disability.</p><p></p><p>Today, it is easy to dismiss the movement as having little relevance. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">takeover of the Co-operative Group's banking arm</a>, with 70% of ownership now in the hands of City investors, appears to have fatally undermined the movement's principles. Is the Co-op Bank even worth saving?</p><p></p><p>Put aside first the dismissive argument that the Co-op Bank was mismanaged and therefore does not deserve to be supported. It is easy to say this <em>in vacuo</em>, but saying it to the 12,000 retail bondholders, the 1,000 people who could lose their jobs, the even larger number who have accounts with the bank, who believe in the co-operative movement and feel disappointed and let down by events, becomes more difficult. The fact is that there is a difference between cherishing a set of values and principles and practical action. We can argue vehemently for both adhering to the founding principles and for a management that can be held to account while implementing them.</p><p></p><p>We need also to look back to the 1980s to understand how mutualisation was undermined and fell out of favour through the privatisation of the building societies. The windfall that members enjoyed at the time seemed so worthwhile; a few hundred pounds each to put towards a new lounge carpet or whatever.</p><p></p><p>Now, the readiness with which we junked the mutual societies seems to be coming back to bite us. The private banking system has let us down badly; the absence of any ethical principles to underpin that system has resulted in mayhem; and a bailout of our main high street banks of an order that borders on incomprehensible. With so few mutualised societies left, people have fewer places to turn to place their hard-earned cash. So what we need is a return to mutualisation. And for this reason alone the Co-operative Bank is worth saving.</p><p></p><p>Circumstances have not changed that markedly since the founding of the Co-operative retail stores and bank. Indeed, we have been reminded recently of the abject poverty that many have fallen into, needing to use food banks or choose between \"eating and heating\" and the need for charitable institutions to step forward and help the needy. Other aspects of the social fabric are of concern. People feel they are having to choose between supporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-green-levy-energy\" title=\"\">green energy policies </a>and paying the fuel bills.</p><p>In a civilised, developed society everyone should be able to eat well, heat their homes and support policies that protect the environment to ensure our long-term wellbeing and future happiness. One way to do that would be to support a financial sector that includes mutualised institutions underpinned by ethical principles similar to those cherished by the Rochdale pioneers. They may not be exciting but banking with community-based, socially oriented institutions would surely enable people to sleep more soundly at night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647722|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|d57ae8f7c3a079a15ed5ea3d43cd7a54c64dc944 -->",

        "headline":"How I feel when scientists examine the wagging of dogs' tails",
        "body":"<p>Scientists at the University of Trento, Italy, have discovered that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/31/dogs-communicate-feelings-tail-wagging\" title=\"\">the way a dog's tail moves is linked to its mood, and by observing each other's tails, dogs can adjust their behaviour accordingly</a>. Good to know that researchers are at last investigating the way dogs read each other's body language, because up to now, according to Dr John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary sciences, research on how dogs relate to each other has rather lagged behind research on how dogs relate to humans.</p><p></p><p>Prof Georgio Vallortigara, the neuroscientist conducting <a href=\"http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-aef68816-cd9f-3061-ad4b-1939ff6c7068/c/main.pdf\" title=\"\">this research</a>, suggests that dogs wag their tails with a bias to the dog's right if they're happy, but with a &quot;left-dominated swish&quot; if they're nervous, which indicates that the left and right sides of the brain &quot;are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions&quot;. Just like humans.</p><p></p><p>It often seems to come as a bit of a surprise to scientists that dogs, and God forbid, other animals' brains, might be as complex as ours, with different hemispheres playing different roles in emotions. Or even that the animals have emotions. But anyone reasonably sensitive who owns a dog knows that a dog can be fearful, anxious, happy, fed up, excited and much more. Dog owners will also know that dogs read each other's whole body language, not just their tails. Sometimes they don't read it very well, just like us. Most dogs give a series of increasingly serious warning signs before they lose their tempers: lick their lips, blink, turn their heads away, curl their lip, lower their ears, wrinkle their foreheads, and if the dog that's annoying them doesn't get the message, they may growl or bare their teeth, and if that's still not enough it will be head and chest forward, muscles flexed, and bang, you've had it. The tail wagging is just a one of a huge array of signals.</p><p></p><p>Vallortigara still does not think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these tail movements. Why ever not? Why would a dog give a complex series of signals to another dog, if it does not intend that the other dog should respond in a certain way? Instead, the professor believes that dogs learn their response from experience. He's just looking at the responding dog, not the dog which is demanding a certain response.</p><p></p><p>Why mess about making dogs watch dogs on film, robot dogs and dog silhouettes with their tails wagging this way and that to find out whether and how dogs communicate and relate? Why not just go and spend time with a group of dogs and watch their behaviour? I promise you it's much more fascinating, rewarding and informative. But it sometimes seems that scientists will turn themselves inside out rather than admit that we are not the only creatures with emotions, language, relationships and intentionality. Perhaps that's because once we accept that we are not more complex and superior in every way to every other living thing on the planet, we might have to treat animals with more respect and whatever is the animal equivalent of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile I've just carried out a little experiment here, the results of which don't fit with Vallortigara's findings. I am at present looking after my daughter's tortoise, which my dog does not like, because the tortoise bites its paws. I notice that when the dog is confronted by the tortoise, it wags its tail rather feebly to the right. I promise you that in this situation the dog is not happy. I wonder if Vallortigara has a dog, or two?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421462964|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|a22991c6b13c4744d17aecd45672fe23948a83aa -->",

        "headline":"Wardrobing: why returning worn clothes is the latest fashion",
        "body":"<p>I remember the last time I did it. My biggest worry was that my heartbeat would give me away. I took a deep breath, told myself to maintain eye contact, drew myself up to my full height and lied my face off. No one ever found out.</p><p>Until now. According to a survey, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">one in six women</a> admit to purchasing an item of clothing or an accessory, wearing it and then returning it to the shop for a full refund. And I am one of them. What I've always thought of as a way to look presentable at weddings without having to move into the poor house immediately afterwards has a much more serious name in the US. Return fraud.</p><p>Some readers might be shaking their heads, but others will be familiar with the prickle of tucked-in tags, the red wine avoidance body swerve, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze\" title=\"\">Febreezing of shame</a> the next day. It could be a sign of our obsession with instant gratification, the need to possess and reject, the bad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/26/sex-and-the-city-2-review\" title=\"\">Sex And The City</a> hangover which has left us broke, miserable and in possession of a metric tonne of peculiar orange-beaded mules. Bloomingdale's department store <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">takes a dim view of the practice</a>, and has marked its merchandise with big black tags that you have to leave on in order to get a refund, meaning you can attend the gala dinner in a Cavalli cocktail dress that you intend to take back the next day, as long as you don't mind looking like you arrived Santa-style, by climbing down a sooty chimney.</p><p>Big stores lose out when we return clothes, but everyone else wins. It depends on the returner, and the garment – you'd hope that no one would be so vulgar as to attend a hot yoga class in their new Spandex unitard and then demand a refund on their purchase. But as long as the wearer has remembered their deodorant and been careful with their cigarettes, I don't mind the idea of buying a dress that's already had a few gratis nights out. After all, we love vintage clothes because they have a history and a story. Returned clothes could have great stories too, it's just they're more likely to end with a trip to Chicken Cottage.</p><p>It's possible to rent occasion wear from some outfitters, but if stores feel \"wardrobing\" is a serious problem, they need to get in on the act. Chain stories could consider introducing a clothes library, where a garment can be rented for a reduced fee, which covers storage and cleaning costs. If nothing else, it would make a sizeable dent in the scary pile of man-made fabrics that end up in landfill every year.</p><p>For women, fashion consumerism is a game they can't win. In one light, we're flibbertigibbets, unable to focus our minds on serious issues like sport, because our heads are full of sparkles and chiffon. If we find joy in fashion, we're thought to be frivolous and simple, even though this is an industry that generates thousands of jobs and billions of pounds, attracting artistic visionaries and smart entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, we can't escape fashion. Everywhere we turn, we're being told to look different, to look better, to have the right outfit for every mood and occasion. If you ever have to go out, be seen in public and talk to people, I am certain there will have been at least one occasion in your life when it became a tearful and traumatic experience because you felt you looked wrong. We're judged by our peers and our families, and now on Facebook and Instagram. People you haven't seen since school can berate you for recycling a bridesmaid's dress and wearing it to a christening. Of course we fantasise about finding the outfits that fill us with joy, that make us feel like our very best selves, as if we could tap dance down the Left Bank and solve mysteries and build bridges and make brioche, while being simultaneously sexy, clever, cool and insouciant. But most women, shopping is not a source of joy. Forget the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQK0VTTXvA\" title=\"\">\"Big mistake! Huge!\"</a> scene in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81528/pretty-woman\" title=\"\">Pretty Woman</a>. In reality it's more like a mash up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\" title=\"\">Battle Royale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36325/scum\" title=\"\">Scum</a> and the bit in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/70550/men-in-black\" title=\"\">Men In Black</a> where the man is slowly revealed to be a big greasy alien.</p><p>If wardrobing was legitimised and formalised, shopping would not lead to alarming amounts of waste and even more alarming levels of debt. We would have the time to work out whether we were comfortable in a garment and whether it made us happy. Shopping wouldn't be such a stressful, expensive risk. It might even become as much fun as the movies suggest. If we could try more and buy less, we'd end up with so many items we truly loved that it would curb our desire for a pointless purchase just because it's new. No matter how big the store is, returning worn items and lying to get a refund is definitely not OK. But it would be great if shops could recognise why this practice is so widely adopted, and meet us in the middle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632571|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|f75efa82c9657befacef0a8d71bc19054b428b10 -->",

        "headline":"xoJane isn't doing women any favors with its 'birth like chimpanzees' story",
        "body":"<p>There's no debate that women are underrepresented in the media. Men's bylines <a href=\"http://www.vidaweb.org/the-count-2012\">vastly outnumber women's</a>, in some publications by as much as 9 to 1. Men <a href=\"http://cjr.org/behind_the_news/vida_count_female_bylines.php\">pitch more often</a>, and they tend to be more persistent than women. So I'm a fan of women's media outlets that publish large numbers of female contributors and center on women's voices and experiences. But in the push to promote women's voices, some sites push the boundaries of journalistic ethics, recreating a retro women's magazine model where fear-mongering too often replaces informative, valuable content.</p><p>The latest, but hardly the only, offender is <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/\">xoJane</a>, which recently published a piece titled \"<a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/healthy/how-to-lotus-birth\">I Did Not Cut My Baby's Umbilical Cord For Six Days So We Could Have A Natural Lotus Birth Just Like Chimpanzees</a>\". Written by the \"full-time mom of Ulysses\" and \"Mama Naturally\" blogger Adele Allen, the post details Allen's at-home birth assisted only by her husband, followed by their decision to not sever the umbilical cord and leave the placenta attached to newborn Ulysses until it fell off naturally. Allen insists that leaving the placenta attached is a good thing because chimps do it, and because it allows the newborn to keep mainlining nutrients from the organ. She asserts that contrary to the claims of medical professionals, there's no real risk of sepsis from keeping a dead organ attached to a brand-new infant with an under-developed immune system. And she wanted a home birth unassisted by any medical professional because that's more natural. </p><p>Unfortunately, Allen's assertions don't match up with reality. Chimpanzees aside – although I will briefly note that chimps are more prone to eating their placenta, since dragging a piece of rotting meat through the jungle right next to your vulnerable young is actually a really great way to attract predators – keeping a placenta attached to either your baby or yourself poses real threats. </p><p>Allen argues that there's no sepsis risk because there aren't any reports of babies dying from sepsis after keeping their placenta attached until it falls off. But perhaps that's because the number of parents who are bizarre and irresponsible enough to keep their child's placenta attached are, thankfully, statistically insignificant. And women do die from placental abruption. While Allen's home birth went just fine and there are, of course, legitimate concerns about the medicalization of childbirth, it's worth noting that before birth-related medical advances, women and babies died in extraordinary numbers. Child-birth is a killer for a whole lot of women, and trained attendants save innumerable lives. </p><p>That may not remain the case, though, if large media outlets like xoJane continue to give science-denying wackadoodles a platform. Allen and any other person is entitled to hold her dangerous beliefs, start her own website to discuss them, publish her own newsletter about them or stand on a street corner and tell people her opinions. But no one is entitled to publish their views on a prominent website. And most responsible publications won't print material that is factually inaccurate and promoting dangerous practices without at least offering some sort of expert counterweight in the same story.</p><p>In many middle-brow \"women's interest\" publications, which are largely glossy magazines and the websites that emulate them, the interest of promoting women's voices (not to mention getting page views or selling magazine copies) too often means editors are disturbingly willing to publish women who make totally outrageous, factually incorrect and often dangerous claims. </p><p>I reached out to xoJane, for example, to ask about their editorial standards –whether they fact-check the pieces they publish, what standards a piece needs to meet in order to merit publication, what the standards are regarding statements presented as fact in first-person narratives, and whether they have any editorial standards related to pieces dealing with crimes, self-harm or illegal activity. The response from xoJane was: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>xoJane accepts submissions for – and at times seeks out – highly-personal narratives told from a first person point of view. We are a platform for women to share their experiences without prescribing or giving advice. We encourage discussion, debate, and even disagreement among our community and our readers.</p></blockquote><p>I don't want to be too hard on xoJane here, because most online publications I've written for don't have a fact-checking staff, so they're also not alone in that. And their publication is just one of many that relies on the female first-person narrative model, and often does so successfully. They published alleged Maryville rape victim <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/daisy-coleman-maryville-rape\">Daisy Coleman's first-person account</a> of what happened to her, for example – that's a triumph of women's media, of news-pegged first-person narrative, and of a feminist ideal that lets women speak for themselves and tell their own stories. The site publishes a series of interesting and often insightful writers, and I have enormous respect for many of their contributors and editors. I highlight xoJane only as an obvious example of the good and bad of \"women's media\" model. </p><p>First-person narrative in women's media routinely take the reader through a litany of traumas the author has undergone. The scare-story has been been a staple of women's magazines for decades, and the very name of xoJane's first-person series – \"It Happened To Me\" – invokes fear, and the sense that something terrible happened to the writer. </p><p>There's an argument that the female existence is imbued with trauma, and writing about our lives honestly sheds light on that fact. In the United States, one in four women will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime. <a href=\"http://dvrc-or.org/domestic/violence/resources/C61/\">One in four</a> will experience intimate partner violence, and that number goes up when you look at the world's women. Of course, female-centric media both reports on that violence and publishes first-person accounts of physical, emotional and psychological trauma. Story-telling is crucial to combating shame and opening up dialogue about the darkest corners of women's lives. But it can also stoke unnecessary fears, and keep women in a state of terror, operating in the world as if we're just one misstep away from becoming a victim or featuring truly dangerous advice under the guise of just highlighting women's voices or just giving women more information. </p><p>See, for example, Mothering magazine, which in 2001 featured the personal story of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=6558202\">Christine Maggiore</a>, an HIV-positive woman who claimed, contrary to the weight of the scientific evidence, that HIV did not cause AIDS. She encouraged HIV-positive people to reject treatment and was reportedly instrumental in convincing the then-president of South Africa of her position, leading him to cut funding to thousands of HIV-positive pregnant South African women. Maggiore appeared on the cover of Mothering, her pregnant belly painted with the words \"NO AZT\". The daughter she birthed died at age 3 from AIDS-related complications. Maggiore <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-christine-maggiore30-2008dec30,0,7407966.story#axzz2jPGzb8jU\">died from what most believe were AIDS-related complications</a> in 2009. </p><p>Then there's Cosmopolitan magazine, which in 2007 reported on what it termed \"<a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/tips-moves/new-kind-of-date-rape\">gray rape</a>\", a \"new kind of date rape\". Reading the descriptions of the \"gray rapes\" in question make it clear that they were more like rape-rape: the woman said no, the man forced himself on her anyway. But in the name of telling stories – or, I suspect more honestly, selling magazines to women curious about what new kind of rape might befall them – Cosmo misrepresented both the reality of sexual assault and the law, doing <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/170767/ending-rape-illiteracy\">lasting damage</a>. </p><p>And there's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/17/jenny-mccarthy-the-view-blonde-stereotype\"> Jenny McCarthy</a>, she who claims vaccines cause autism based on her personal experience with her son, sitting down for her regular spot with the women of day-time talk show The View. </p><p>There have been endless debates about whether these first-person stories reflect a particular type of female narcissism or whether accusations of narcissism are sexist. After all, when a man writes a navel-gazing first-person narrative, he's rarely deemed a narcissist, he's written the great American novel, or at least a click-baity piece at Vice. Yet there are few dedicated men's publications so totally dependent on the first-person narrations of either one's trauma, one's personal life, or one's peculiar choices (which will certainly get commenters raging). Indeed, there are few \"men's publications\" in the vein of female glossies and their online equivalents – perhaps because men who write and pontificate feel entitled to cover any topic at all, whereas women feel we're only able to speak on those things we are experts on, ourselves being an obvious one.</p><p>Women's voices matter, and media outlets that center on women's voices and use stories to crack the walls of shame do a great service. In featuring women's stories, we owe it to each other to publish with a modicum of responsibility, and to at the very least not disseminate the kind of false information that poses serious health risks. Women's voices are marginalized in media, but that doesn't mean it's responsible, let alone laudable, to publish the most foolish, wrong or dangerous among us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421466486|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|4d1e591c0a9b8e85711022be70d31fc0b1510a05 -->",

        "headline":"Judges can sidestep religion, but they can't avoid morality",
        "body":"<p>Sir James Munby <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Speeches/law-morality-religion-munby-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> last week saying that judges no longer concerned themselves with the promotion of virtue and the discouragement of immorality – and nor should they: Britain is now a secular society, he said, and religion has no special privilege beyond what it is granted by human rights legislation. This was widely reported as claiming that the law no longer has any business enforcing morality. I have now read his speech carefully and I am not at all certain that this is what he said – and if it's what he meant he is clearly wrong and his own speech proves it. Judges, he thinks, are very much in the business of enforcing morality, and so they ought to be. The confusion, and it's a very important one, arises from supposing that morality now means what it meant in respectable circles 100 years ago – a form of 19th-century Protestantism.</p><p>Much of his argument is wonderfully clear and, more importantly, right. Within living memory many influential judges did assume that morality was largely concerned with sexuality and the application of biblical standards of patriarchy in so far as this was possible. All this has gone. \"Judges are no longer <a href=\"http://thelawdictionary.org/custos-morum/\" title=\"\"><em>custos morum</em></a> of the people, and if they are they have to take the people's customs as they find them, not as they or others might wish them to be,\" said Munby.</p><p>\"And if they are\" – that's where the argument shifts, because, as will become apparent, he does believe judges are the custodians of morality to some extent. I suspect that any other view is incoherent, or at least wicked. The burden of his talk is an attack on religious privilege. It seems odd to suppose that this must also be an attack on morality.</p><p>For Munby's claims about what has replaced morality are themselves profoundly moral ones. They have to be. Look at his praise of tolerance.</p><p>He wants to live in \"a tolerant society, increasingly alive to the need to guard against the tyranny which majority opinion may impose on those who, for whatever reason, comprise a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority\".</p><p>This seems to me an entirely and unavoidably moral desire. What justification is there for not imposing our views on a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority? You can't answer the question without using moral concepts. What amoral reason could there be not to impose our views on the minority? Only that we might fail in the attempt and that's not often a serious danger.</p><p>Similarly, his argument against privileging religion is not based on the idea that we can sidestep morality, but on the belief that our idea of morality is better and truer than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/06/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Lord Denning</a>'s was in 1957. Munby said that \"Reliance upon religious belief, however conscientious the belief and however ancient and respectable the religion, can never of itself immunise the believer from the reach of the secular law.\" I don't think many people would disagree with this – I certainly wouldn't. But the question then becomes how to draw the line, and the answer most certainly involves moral judgment and reasoning, as he goes on to recognise.</p><p>\"Where precisely the limits are to be drawn is often a matter of controversy. There is no 'bright-line' test that the law can set. The infinite variety of the human condition precludes arbitrary definition.\"</p><p>Even when Munby has recourse to European human rights law, he remains enmeshed in the problem: he points out that the <a href=\"http://human-rights-convention.org/the-texts/simplified-convention/\" title=\"\">European Convention on Human Rights</a> \"forbids the state to determine the validity of religious beliefs\" but that prohibition depends on a very narrow definition of validity and religious beliefs. What he means, clearly, is that the state has no business with the truth claims of religious mythologies: the state should have no opinion on whether Jesus rose from the dead, or if Muhammad really heard the angel Gabriel. But in other respects the convention positively demands that we determine the validity of religious beliefs. Are they, for instance, \"worthy of respect in a democratic society\"? Are they \"compatible with human dignity\"? These, again, are moral judgments, which society cannot avoid and should not try to.</p><p>Munby's easy acceptance that morality means what Lord Denning thought it did abandons a very necessary battlefield and hands victory there either to religious conservatives who claim that morality must have a supernatural sanction, or to the kind of market fundamentalists who claim that morality is unnecessary or unproblematic. Humanists need to do better than that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421619645|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|adb63e2c026bef8116f6b975f95539a12446ae60 -->",

        "body":"<p>I am a model. I model men's clothes. The biological roulette made me female. I was the first woman to be signed to the men's board at Ford Models.</p><p>I was invited earlier this week to speak at a conference for business executives at a \"trend school\" – the topic: gender. I declined – not for lack of desire to share my experience, strength and hope in some helpful way. But I was rather offended by the notion of being so removed from reality as to require a school for trends, and repulsed at the blatant attempt to co-opt and commodify culture for business profit over participation and engagement with it. I also knew that there would be no room for me to break the news: this is not about gender.</p><p>So, corporate America, this article is for you.</p><p>The contemporary cultural landscape supports a larger interpretation than the one we currently have, of female-masculinity and masculine-femininity. To believe otherwise is to be deceived by a myopic view which is influenced by capitalist gain and profit.</p><p>The first thing I want to get out of the way is to ask you to look at this list: Gertrude Stein, Greta Garbo, Jenny Shimizu, Tilda Swinton, Jack Halberstam, Stella Tennant, Judith Butler, Erika Linder … it goes on. If you do not know who everyone on the list is, go look them up, your life will be larger for it. You should, after that, realise that this is not a question of \"trend\". There is a historical tradition you should know about and it is certainly not about gender. It is about being fierce.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454207'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383310295781/Casey-Legler-005.jpg' alt='Casey Legler' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Casey Legler backstage at the Michael Bastian fashion show, February 2013. Photograph: Ilya Savenok/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The cultural context further supports this wider angled discourse on the acceptance of difference (or lack thereof) beyond the specifics of female-masculinity and masculine-feminity and posits the isolated focus on gender as incorrect. Russia, Edith Windsor and Bethann Hardison are three examples – the first being a terrifying contemporary example of institutionalised homophobia and homogeneity; the second, our own attempt here in the US to de-institutionalise homophobia via gay marriage; and the last being a fashion legend calling into question the enduring racism within fashion. The fashion industry is on its way to being the better for it.</p><p>We are only too familiar with the mainstream's difficulty in celebrating difference (when it's not being entirely destructive to it). Corporations and the traditional media have not yet learned how to resolve this: in the public discourse the celebration is often sanitised and white-washed (sometimes literally) for profit – and by this I do mean corporate profit.</p><p>And why should you care about this? Because we have in our societies children and teenagers and we are responsible for their wellbeing. This is on us. And why do I specifically care about this? Why am I bothering to write this? Because I'm gay. I'm butch. I'm a woman. I'm queer. I'm 36. I'm 6ft 2in. And caring for \"otherness\" matters to me. Gay youth is still terrorised for being different in some parts of the world – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/russia-rise-homophobic-violence\" title=\"\">Russia is a horrifying example of this</a>. But look, too, at what still happens here in the US. Children are made to feel shame, they are made to feel ugly, they are ostracised and bullied, or worse – and here in New York I see them on the streets – 40% of homeless youth are <a href=\"http://www.uakron.edu/groups/lgbtu/Transgenderhome.php\" title=\"\">LGBTQI</a> identified.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454205'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383310687680/Casey-Legler-001.jpg' alt='Casey Legler' width='220' height='330' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Casey Legler in an Observer Magazine menswear shoot. Photograph: Julian Broad for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>If images of me out there in the world make it that much easier for another kid, and the kids around them or their parents, to get on with the more important business of figuring out who they are and how they can uniquely contribute to the stream of life, then my job is done. The clincher: while unique in my contribution, I am not alone in expanding the landscape – Brittney Griner, JD Samson, Venus X, A$AP Rocky, OFWGKTA – are all examples of non-conformity and also of excellence.</p><p>This is about making space, making room and making things better. To limit this conversation to the (albeit salacious) red herring of gender is dangerous, careless and nothing short of ignorant – it takes for granted the intelligence and wellbeing of our communities (offering only an uneducated, uninteresting and sensationalist conversation to boot). It shames those who are gender-conformative and perpetuates a construct of homogeneity and belonging that is nothing short of destructive for our youth. It offers a false sense of privilege and ignorance to those who \"fit\" the norm (or trend) while potentially destroying those who don't and ignoring those who are able to survive outside of it.</p><p>I will not let this become just the other side to the same coin of oppression, a false emancipation at the cost of others.</p><p>This is too important and deserves closer examination and care. Lives depend on it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421452292|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|0c4275fb1c507527201cf16c159c26c7eef6ccb1 -->",

        "headline":"In Michael Gove's world Jane Austen, Orwell and Dickens will die out",
        "body":"<p>Michael Gove is <a href=\"http://dickens.stanford.edu/hard/issue1_gloss2.html\" title=\"\">Mr M'Choakumchild</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/charles-dickens/9048771/Gradgrind-My-favourite-Charles-Dickens-character.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Gradgrind</a> personified: \"<a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/cdickens/bl-cdick-hard-1.htm\" title=\"\">What I want is, Facts</a>. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.\" In Gove's schools, whatever might seize the imagination, give pleasure and stay in the heart and mind for a lifetime longer than rote-learned facts is being rooted out.</p><p>When he has done with cleansing the curriculum, it may be the case that fewer people know who Gradgrind and M'Choakumchild are. Dickens and much of literature will be a closed book to those not lucky enough to encounter them outside their exam-crammed education. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/15/michael-gove-gcse-changes-english-literature\" title=\"\">English literature is to be stripped out of the core English GCSE exam</a>, leaving nothing but grammatical correctness and straitjacket language reduced to right and wrong answers. Literature is to become an optional extra, and probably not a highly regarded one, for fear it might let the imagination roam dangerously free. English language, maths, three sciences, a foreign language and history or geography are the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19626663\" title=\"\">core English baccalaureate subjects</a>. <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/why-did-shakespeare-make-rest-silence-hamlets-400760\" title=\"\">The rest is silence</a>, more or less. (But soon few may recognise that reference.) In a world of harsh exams, with the screw tightened down to factual rigour, league table tyranny will increasingly sideline optional extras.</p><p>An array of writers, artists and academics fired off a <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Education/article1335699.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_11_02\" title=\"\">letter of protest to the Sunday Times, including Michael Morpurgo</a>, Robert Harris, Sheila Hancock, Miriam Margolyes and professors John Carey and John Sutherland. The new English literature exam will become more rigorous, concentrating on pre-20th century texts, which may deter all but enthusiasts: when everyone had to do some literature, it was more accessible to all. Prof Sutherland talks of how \"the humanities humanise us\".</p><p>No doubt Gove thinks that soft-headed, but he might ponder the conservative values of preserving the best. If few read literature together, the idea of a canon vanishes. The Bible has all but gone in a generation, a deep cultural loss: apart from the nativity, there is no common reference point, no chill to the marrow at <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&amp;pentid=P568\" title=\"\">God telling Abraham to cut his son's throat</a>, no common understanding of a reference to Lazarus. Another term of Gove-ism, and Jane Austen, Dickens, Orwell, Wilfred Owen, JD Salinger and all the rest will go the same way: it doesn't take long. Pupils may groan at literary texts, but books stay in the mind for further exploring. Whatever is unexamined with marks and tables is unvalued under the Gove whip.</p><p>The consultation in progress is unlikely to change the plan. Gove pretends it's for schools to choose – but drama, dance, art and now literature will slip away. Confident top schools may keep these subjects, but average schools, under intense pressure to perform in core EBacc exams, will let the rest slide. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/22/cultural-learning-building-knowledge-tate\" title=\"\">Cultural Learning Alliance</a> argues passionately for the cause of arts in schools. The Arts Council is negotiating valiantly behind the scenes with <a href=\"http://ofqual.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofqual</a> about how to ensure arts exams are as rigorous, and so of equal status, as the rest.</p><p>In Gove's groves of academe, high achievers will be more clearly set apart, laurels for the winners in his regime of fact and rote, 1950s grammar schools reprised, rewarding those who already thrive under any system. The UK always scored well with top students: it is the long tail of those falling behind who drag down our ranking in PISA tables. He is giving this unequal society, made more so by this government, schools better honed to reflect that social difference. The hurdles are set higher, the fallers will fall further and harder, with fewer paths into education for those not fired up by a strict diet of maths, grammar, physics and French.</p><p>Rudely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\" title=\"\">Gove dismisses the education world as \"the blob\"</a> – but if he asked further education colleges, those havens of second and third chances, what best rescues students failed by schools first time round, it is often those other doors into the many gardens of learning.</p><p>Schools need friendly secret niches with different kinds of teachers: for some children it might be sport, for others design, art, music, dance or drama where other talents and enthusiasms are welcomed to draw a child in, not propel them out. New GCSE codes downgrade all these, urging schools to discourage them. Under Gove's tutelage 14% fewer pupils are taking arts GCSEs. The Commons education select committee reports that the EBacc effect narrows options away from the arts, affecting disadvantaged children most. An Ipsos Mori report finds that schools with a high proportion of children taking free school meals are more than twice as likely to abandon arts subjects as are privileged schools. <a href=\"http://t.co/t17EsAb1pZ\" title=\"\">Gove boasts</a>: \"We've rewarded schools that teach traditional subjects, which help all students get into university.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/XeJOVZmORY\" title=\"\">Liz Truss, his minister, parrots</a>: \"We are rebalancing the curriculum towards high-value subjects – in maths, sciences, DT, computing, English and languages.\"</p><p>What is \"low value\" about drama? Small children learn through acting out imaginary roles. There is no discipline tougher than putting on a play, relying on one another, learning a part, hitting a cue, in mortal peril of failure and hope of triumph before an audience. Anyone who ever acted in a school play remembers it for ever. Ability to speak out, perform and pretend is essential for most jobs, from estate agent upwards. Employers complain that young people mumble, slouch and don't look them in the eye, prizing the \"soft skills\" that elite schools teach through drama and debating. Emotionally, drama teaches children lacking in empathy to put themselves into others' shoes, to express fears.</p><p>But ever fewer schools employ specialist drama teachers: English teachers may or may not have an aptitude. Shakespeare is on the curriculum, no longer to be examined, but dead on the page without performance to breathe life and sense into it. The RSC sends out a toolkit to help-teachers teach Shakespeare. The <a href=\"http://www.ssf.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare Schools Festival</a> is in progress, a thousand primary and secondaries performing in real theatres everywhere, a brilliant project – but drama should be the right of every child. No school should be judged good or outstanding unless it's good at arts: the Arts Council awards an \"<a href=\"http://www.artsmark.org.uk/about-artsmark\" title=\"\">Artsmark</a>\" to schools that do well, but only a quarter earn it. My guess is Gove wouldn't send a child of his to any school that regards arts as a waste of time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421652147|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|91e4580b286456bfa27174440260744cc55a0f1b -->",

        "body":"<p>Neither our security nor our freedoms should be the subject of partisan politics. I think we all agree that the burden of responsibility on our intelligence agencies to keep us safe is heavy, and we pay tribute to them.</p><p>I had the privilege of working with the agencies, including GCHQ, during my six years at the Foreign Office, and I know first hand that their work is vital. In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">recent speech</a>, the MI5 director general, Andrew Parker, set out the current security challenges that Britain faces, and I pay tribute to the officers who, out of the limelight, work unstintingly to protect us from those dangers.</p><p>I also pay tribute to Parker for an under-reported aspect of his speech. While discussing trying to reduce the terrorist threat, he observed: \"In a free society 'zero' is of course impossible to achieve ... A strong record of success risks creating an expectation of guaranteed prevention. There can be no such guarantee.\"</p><p>As an MP and a citizen, I recognise that bitter truth. We in the House of Commons have a duty to ensure that the public grasp it, too.</p><p>Similarly, any democratic government must be accountable to their citizens, particularly if they impinge on their citizens' freedoms in the necessary pursuit of security. In recent years, UK surveillance of its citizens has increased exponentially, and the legal basis has sometimes, and now regularly, appeared strained at best. Oversight is frayed and legitimate debate is at risk of being drowned out by frankly untested assertions of national security.</p><p>In June, the Guardian published revelations by US National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">GCHQ was clandestinely tapping</a> transatlantic fibre-optic cables, giving almost unfettered access to people's phone call records, emails, Facebook entries and the like. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/legal-loopholes-gchq-spy-world\" title=\"\">legal basis</a> for Operation Tempora looks thin at best, and parliament certainly had no idea of the scale of the use of those powers.</p><p>We also learned that Britain receives data from the US Prism surveillance programme, which appears to allow GCHQ to dilute – not circumvent entirely, but dilute – the safeguards that would apply if the same agencies were to gather the information themselves.</p><p>In this month's speech, the MI5 director-general also lambasted the Guardian for handing terrorists a \"gift\" – he used a potent word. More recently, ministers have claimed that the disclosures have put lives at risk. I want to take that seriously, because Parker claimed that making public \"the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques\" breaches national security. To be clear about what was being discussed, the newspaper was not disclosing interception techniques – the technical aspect – or revelations of sources or operatives, which would clearly be a major source of concern, but simply revealing our intelligence reach. I Parker's assertion that was made difficult to take at face value. The contention may be true, but it cannot be taken on mere assertion.</p><p>Any serious terrorist groups assume that their phones, emails and internet use will be monitored. That is no secret, and learning that western spies drain the swamp of their own citizens' data in the process does not aid terrorists in any tangible way. If national security had been materially breached, why has no one at the Guardian been charged or even arrested since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london\" title=\"\">destruction of computers </a>watched by GCHQ technicians at its offices back in July? Why was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/david-miranda-documents-schedule-7\" title=\"\">David Miranda</a> not arrested and bailed, following his detention for several hours at Heathrow, in August? Either UK law enforcement is surprisingly slow – given the assertions – or national security is being used as a fig leaf to muzzle disclosures that are just plain embarrassing.</p><p>I accept, by the way, the disclosure that 850,000 NSA employees and private contractors can access data from Project Tempora represents a security concern, but of course that vulnerability is entirely of the government's own making.</p><p>I am prepared to be proven wrong about all that, but ministers and intelligence chiefs need to understand that the bald assertion of national security cannot be used to guillotine all debate. We are here to correct that understanding. Without revealing details that would prejudice the work of the security services, we need a coherent explanation of the damage to national security, not only vague and opaque assertions.</p><p>From reports in the Guardian, we also know that the government are concerned about the legality of the powers that they are using – fears that public debate might lead to litigation, fears about legal challenge under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act</a>. Those are legitimate concerns. I recall similar ones from my own experience of working with the agencies as a Foreign Office lawyer. Those, however, are altogether more nuanced concerns than the shrill and unsubstantiated suggestion that we have somehow lost track of terrorist plotters as a result of the revelations.</p><p>The issues need to be debated in parliament, not stifled by the blanket assertion of national security. Scrutiny is vital. In the US, the Democrat chair of the senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-surveillance-dianne-feinstein-opposed-allies\" title=\"\">has called</a> for a total review of NSA surveillance: \"Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing.\"</p><p>This week, on a bipartisan basis, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/29/usa-freedom-act-jim-sensenbrenner-nsa-reform-full-text\" title=\"\">USA Freedom Act</a> was proposed in Congress, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-surveillance-review-intelligence-chiefs-testify\" title=\"\">support from more</a> than 80 Congressmen – including, no less, the architect of the US Patriot Act, Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. The act would block collection of bulk data on American citizens, insert judicial oversight – something missing in this country – and increase transparency and reporting on the part of companies and government. If that is good enough for the Americans, why here in Britain would we settle for anything less? Congress and the public in America have woken up to the scale of unfettered surveillance, and it is time that we in the House of Commons did the same.</p><p>What do we need to do next? First, we need a proper account to parliament of the exercise of existing surveillance powers. Why and where are they deemed inadequate? Will the minister, when he has the opportunity to speak, confirm that no MPs have been subjected to such surveillance, given that the House of Commons has not been informed of any change to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/04/politicalnews.uk\" title=\"\">Wilson doctrine</a>? Will ministers clarify the extent to which GCHQ was involved in what has recently been reported about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\" title=\"\">NSA tapping Google and Yahoo!</a> communications, without consent or any observation of the authorisation procedures agreed with those companies?</p><p>Secondly, if there are shortcomings – we need to be alive to those, on both sides of the debate– we need a clearer explanation of their impact on national security. Successive governments have been remiss in proposing such broad data communications legislation, beyond the imperatives of national security or of access by police and the intelligence agencies, as most people and most members of the House of Commons accept. That has undermined parliamentary and public support for the more forensic task of plugging any holes in our intelligence capabilities.</p><p>Thirdly, we need to consider any exposure of our agencies to \"fishing expedition\" legal challenges – I understand that concern. GCHQ has cited the Human Rights Act, a concern that I suspect stems from the expansion in the right to privacy under article 8 of the convention. If there is broader concern about the act, that must feed into the debate about its future.</p><p>Finally, I am not convinced that the intelligence and security committee (ISC) is able to provide the oversight that we need. I say that without casting any aspersion on current or former members, least of all its formidable chair, Malcom Rifkind. I do not believe, however, that the ISC has the tools or the independence to do the job properly. It is billed as a creature of parliament, but through its appointment and accountability, and under the statutory regime, it is ultimately and really beholden to the executive. It needs to develop into more of a committee of the House of Commons, tailored in a bespoke way, but acquiring more of the powers and independence of normal select committees, if it is to deliver the kind of oversight capable of commanding public confidence.</p><p>Above all, we must take this debate forward, away from the polarised and untested assertions on either side, and place the work of those who would protect us on a firmer footing. Karl Popper said: \"We must plan for freedom, and not only for security, if for no other reason than only freedom can make security more secure.\"</p><p>We need to pursue our security in a way that respects our freedoms, limits incursions to genuine cases of national security and does so under a regime that commands the rule of law. Failing to do that would be the real gift to the terrorists – a victory for everything that they believe in and a blow against everything we stand for.</p><p></p><p>• This is the text of a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000332\" title=\"\">speech delivered by Dominic Raab at a parliamentary debate on surveillance at Westminster Hall on Thursday</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421454917|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|481759b74ae35e0b4cccf68205832da05f14025c -->",

        "headline":"Indonesia-Australia spying row: welcome to full-contact diplomacy",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of full-contact diplomacy. Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natelagawa’s warnings that Indonesia will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/spying-row-indonesia-threatens-to-stop-co-operating-on-people-smuggling\">review its intelligence co-operation </a>with Australia and the United States unless they provide assurances they won’t spy on Indonesia shouldn’t be over-interpreted; they’re part of the rough-and-tumble world of diplomacy. And before we diagnose a crisis in Indonesia-Australia relations, we need to take a closer look at what’s going on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">revelations</a> about the collection of signals intelligence at Australian missions in regional capitals are the work of an American whistleblower and Australian journalists, not neighbouring governments. If foreign governments are genuinely surprised and shocked that the US and Australia spy on them, they are naive in the extreme. Stealing secrets has been a part of statecraft since time immemorial, and arguably makes the world a safer place by minimising the chances that governments will surprise each other. Amidst all the outrage in Germany that the NSA has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">tapping Angela Merkel’s private mobile phone</a>, someone should be asking some hard questions about why her phone hasn’t been encrypted from the start. If the Americans weren’t tapping the German chancellor’s unsecured phone conversations, the Russians, Chinese and French would be.</p> <p>In reality, Jakarta is well aware that Australia is part of the most potent eavesdropping partnership in the world. Indonesia has been a beneficiary of Australia’s intelligence capabilities in its fight against terrorism, just as Australia has benefited from intelligence cooperation with Jakarta. Against this background, Natelagawa’s threatened “review” takes on a Yes Minister slant – something that’s done in order to look decisive, while leaving things pretty much as they are.</p> <p>The Indonesian foreign minister is responding vociferously because he and his president don’t want to seen to be supine in response to allegations of Australian eavesdropping. Indonesia is in the countdown to a presidential election next year, and one way to discredit opponents is to accuse them of selling out to western interests. President Yudhoyono is already criticised by nationalists for being too nice to Canberra; and even though he can’t run again, he can’t discount his party being punished if he isn’t seen to be outraged by this apparent assault on Indonesia’s integrity.</p> <p>There’s another element to Natelagawa’s response that can’t be discounted either. Diplomacy is not all about smooth talk and cocktail parties; it’s often a brutal competition for the slightest advantage, even between ostensible friends and allies. The ability to exploit the slightest weakness can be worth its weight in gold as governments manoeuvre against each other.</p> <p>Natelagawa, who studied in Australia, has probably watched the odd State of Origin game. He knows the first 10 minutes of the match are known as the “softening up period” – a stanza of ferocious physicality in which each side tries to cow the opposition into a disadvantageous state of mind. Right now, there's a new government in Canberra, and neighbouring governments are likely to be keen to test its mettle. The odd diplomatic jab can give a better sense of what can be expected from a new government than years of polite cocktail discussions. New Australian governments over the past two decades have had some rocky foreign policy starts – think of the Howard and Rudd governments’ run-ins with Beijing early on – which makes one think that a bit of softening up may have become part of the regional diplomatic scene.</p> <p>Remember, this is not the first time Natelagawa has muscled up to the Abbott government. More than a few eyebrows were raised in Canberra back in September when he disclosed the contents of private discussions with Julie Bishop to the media – on the foreign minister’s first overseas trip no less. For this reason, the government’s neither-confirm-nor-deny, steady-as-she-goes response is spot-on. The last thing they want to do is to look unsettled.</p> <p>Does all of this add up to a new attitude of antagonism in Jakarta? No. Indonesia has demonstrated over several years that it well understands the value of building a robust and pragmatic relationship with Australia. Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made in Jakarta that it needed to do more to meet Australia half-way on the asylum seeker issue – and it has done so, under a distracting cover of grim warnings about Australian policy positions. So too should the current protestations be taken as a bit of Indonesian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang\">wayang</a> theatre, while the real business of collaboration carries on behind the curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669687|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|811b6538c8d4d99fea24c38d23da22b004872d33 -->",

        "body":"<p>I am not privy to the thought processes of supermodels (thank God), and I cannot for the life of me think what was running through Heidi Klum's head when she came up with the idea that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2482400/Heidi-Klum-turns-wrinkled-old-lady-Oscar-winning-make-artist-Halloween.html\" title=\"\">dressing as an old woman</a> was an amusing concept for Halloween. Heidi is well-known for going the full nine yards on All Hallows' Eve. She's been <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1cu1jjR\" title=\"\">Clive Barker's Hellraiser</a> (or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IITEG\" title=\"\">Gunther von Hagens' flayed body</a>, depending on your cultural references), the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/17x0AMK\" title=\"\">Hindu goddess Kali</a> (managing to offend an entire religion) and now she's given us what currently terrifies the western world beyond all reason – age.</p><p>Yes, there are cultural differences at play here – dressing up for Halloween in the US does not necessarily mean witches, vampires and Frankenstein – but it's hard to see this stunt as anything other than ill-judged and offensive. There is a fine line here and Klum has crossed it.</p><p>Once the initial \"red mist\" had dissipated and I started to analyse my reaction, I've concluded it's the fact that she played it straight and gone to a great deal of trouble to do so. This is not the slightly more acceptable \"comedy crone\" that we're used to seeing and can tolerate – if we can't laugh at stress incontinence and sagging bosoms we're screwed. No, the problem for me is that it feels frankly insulting to quick fix a look that most of us are working hard to achieve over several decades. I'm not joking – take pride in the battle scars life leaves. Lines, wrinkles, veins, scars are all badges of survival – signs of a life lived. How dare Heidi Klum make light of that. As several people pointed out when I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/TheVintageYear\" title=\"\">started on a rant</a> this morning – there are those who have gone too soon who would have been very happy to embrace a wrinkled and stooped old age.</p><p>I then began to wonder whether she was trying to subvert the whole supermodel eternal youth myth. Perhaps she was saying something profound about all of us heading the same way. Something like \"age is compulsory\" or perhaps \"life is terminal\". But after reading her  comments on Twitter, such as \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/heidiklum/status/396086313776349184\" title=\"\">Little old me</a>\" – I decided I was crediting her with too much existential angst.</p><p>No, it is quite simply that making herself into an old woman for an evening is meant to be funny – not ironic, not an indication of the inner terror of a young and beautiful woman, not witty or making a point, it is purely to ridicule the old and have a good laugh at their expense. There is a serious discussion beginning on the subject of positive ageing and positive representations of age. I've been to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/16RuRW9\" title=\"\">two</a> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HeZppB\" title=\"\">conferences</a> in the last two weeks on the subject. Both were fascinating, stimulating and reassuring. What baffles me is that neither were rammed to the rafters – there seems to be some sort of apathy among older people about tackling their own future and status. Perhaps they think if they ignore it, it will stop, like ignoring a child having a tantrum. Or perhaps it's a generational thing and they feel it's impolite to make a fuss.</p><p>Unless a fuss is made there is a real danger that they (we) will find themselves negated still further to the point of oblivion. Older people, and I include myself at 58, must stand up and be counted, and protest against ageist nonsense such as this. Younger generations must be allowed to see positive representations of age and older people, not stereotypes and caricatures. To allow the current situation to continue is to stoke the fires of ageism and isolation of older generations. What are older women used for in the advertising world? Anti-ageing beauty products (usually heavily airbrushed or shown on 30-year-old models), medical products and walk-in baths: I'll happily bore the tits off anyone who wants to talk to me about the lack of positive imagery in the media. Which might be rude of me to say so, but I'm still not nearly as rude as Heidi Klum.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421458460|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|15442eac8a4e7157c96ce6a1acc03c2c5d200212 -->",

        "headline":"Why Australia should celebrate Guy Fawkes night",
        "body":"<p>\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November,\" lectures the old nursery rhyme. It&rsquo;s not really about remembering the date, but what it stands for: the importance of our political processes, and preventing people from hijacking them through public apathy.</p> <p>For the past few weeks, we have been up to our novelty eyeballs in discussions about whether Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/halloween-in-australia-what-a-terrible-and-spooky-sight\">should celebrate Halloween</a>. But given recent developments in Australia&rsquo;s political landscape, perhaps we should have been discussing whether Australia should celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night\">Guy Fawkes night</a>.</p> <p>In 1605, British authorities arrested a Catholic terrorist who was about to ignite enough explosives to blow the UK&rsquo;s House of Lords. His plot was to kill the king, the Privy Council, and a handful of aristocrats. His goal was to facilitate a Catholic queen&rsquo;s ascension to the throne. His name was Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>History would be kind to Fawkes. Although the fifth&nbsp;of November was instituted as a holiday to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot and an opportunity to stir up anti-Catholic prejudices, Fawkes would eventually be recast as an anti-authoritarian hero. At the start of the 20th Century, he was the protagonist of children&rsquo;s stories; by the end, he was the face of Alan Moore&rsquo;s protagonist in V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist who worked with Moore on V for Vendetta, said that the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735\">Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny</a>\". Although the historical Fawkes differs significantly from the contemporary imagination, his face has entered the popular consciousness as a prompt for questions about civil liberties and the relationship between the population and the state.</p> <p>As a young conservative who is generally in favour of greater state powers, I sit on the other side of the political spectrum from what Fawkes now represents. But despite my position on the right side of the political spectrum, I still find it profoundly disturbing that state and federal governments have been able to pass laws increasing the scope of their power with very little debate in the broader public.</p> <p>Governments have discovered that they don&rsquo;t need to discuss, negotiate, or persuade because the broader public has become almost completely apathetic to the idea of scrutiny and oversight. Activists and academics may write huffy pieces in hyperbolic prose, but the broader public simply does not care. Where there should be genuine outrage and concern, there is an eerie silence from a public that is disaffected, disinterested, and has forgotten the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November.</p> <p>Queensland&rsquo;s \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/queenslands-new-anti-bikie-laws-a-recipe-for-tyranny-david-simon-says\">anti-bikie\" legislative package</a>, for example, seemed to come out of nowhere, was discussed for no more than 30 minutes, and then promptly passed into law. Although there were good reasons to introduce the legislation, the attorney-general of Queensland canvassed none of them. Instead of trying to persuade people with reasoned argument, he opted instead to troll the leader of the opposition over Twitter: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarrodBleijieMP/statuses/389991967125299201\">you must tell us who's side you are on, Criminal Motorcycle Gangs or Qld'ers?</a>\". Licensed by the public&rsquo;s lack of interest, other states are <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/vic-qld-on-board-with-our-bikie-lawsnsw/story-e6frfku9-1226749540734\">introducing similar legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the federal level, a weekly press conference satiates the public&rsquo;s interest in the scrutiny of border protection policies. The media and Coalition were once sent into apoplexy every time a boat arrived; now the discussion has gone deathly quiet, as if millions of voices cried out for six years and were suddenly silenced.</p> <p>The situation is so dire that news organisations are resorting to stunts &ndash; like the New Stateman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\">commissioning of Russell Brand as a guest editor</a>, and Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\">subsequent interview with him on Newsnight</a> &ndash; in a desperate attempt to stir any public interest in politics. But it&rsquo;s a flash in the pan, a brief candle illuminating nothing.</p> <p>It seems weird to complain about this malaise when it so clearly benefits my side of politics, but it feels like an ungallant, ignoble victory. Had St George slayed the dragon while it slept, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written stories about him. Similarly, achieving good political outcomes is more than just getting your legislation into force; it&rsquo;s about having contentious but meaningful policies survive the ordeal of fire, generated by vigorous public discussion and debate.</p> <p>By forgetting the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November &ndash; whether as a lesson about the importance of protecting political institutions, or as a symbol of anti-authoritarian rebellion &ndash; we have extinguished fiery political conflict with wet blankets of apathy. Our political culture is desperate for symbols behind which the public can rally and express its political concerns. Fawkes gives us that symbol, reinvented time and time again to speak to new political concerns.</p> <p>Who better to symbolise the resistance to more powerful security legislation than a terrorist from the 1600s cast as both the villain and hero of the holiday? How better to reignite the political passions of the public than with a bonfire? What better attracts the public&rsquo;s interest in community than fireworks? Come for the bonfire and the fireworks; stay for the political symbols.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not the whole answer, but popularising political engagement is a good first step. Celebrating Guy Fawkes night hands the flame of political change back to the popular consciousness. Today, it&rsquo;s time to remember the fifth of November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664451|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|d718ba9e1bb807f77b444837ba1536dc64c2d683 -->",

To put it another way, when a woman takes on a project no one else will, or does something helpful or thoughtful, it's seen as something she does for fun. When a man does it, it seen as real work. </p><p>The revelation of this structural ingratitude explains a lot. It's a pivotal point in understanding a key issue in workplaces: why can't women form lasting alliances, even though they spend more time contributing to their organizations <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303382004579129273775055280\">by mentoring</a>? </p><p>Alliances are often based on favors; if a favor is not counted, a potential ally is lost.</p><p>Why is it that women are often thought to lack \"<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/10/29/do-you-have-executive-presence/\">executive presence</a>\", which is the aura of accomplishment and authority that hovers around powerful people? Why are men 46% more likely to have \"<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303382004579129273775055280\">sponsors</a>\" boost their rise through an organization? It all comes down to the fact that women are essentially locked out of the favor system that helps men get ahead; many powerful men keep a running tally in their heads of who owes them a favor and who doesn't; women, because their favors don't count, never even make it on to that list. Favors are a currency, and women are suffering from a currency crisis.</p><p>That ends up leaving many powerful women on shaky ground, easily scapegoated when something goes wrong. It's a fear that most women learn to live with, and be wary of, as they rise through the ranks. The higher the woman's rise, the greater her wariness, which is probably why, as a reporter and editor, I find many female entrepreneurs and executives shunning the spotlight of news when they're succeeding, while male executives tend to court news coverage.</p><p>A few years ago, I interviewed a prominent woman and financial executive about how she had made it so far in a male-dominated profession. With her public relations advisor on the line, she sang the praises of her \"supportive\" coworkers and bosses and took barely any credit for her own talent and resilience. I was baffled, but after years of covering Wall Street, I was used to women avoiding the spotlight and shuffling off responsibility for success to others. This time, I understood why. After we hung up, she called me back, alone, to check that she had not misspoken about something. She told me: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I have to be very careful. This place is a shark tank, and there are a lot of people who'd love to use something against me.</p></blockquote><p>It's a realization that many women in male-dominated professions – particularly Wall Street – have long understood: one wrong step, and they suffer far harsher consequences than men in similar positions. It's part of the reason women don't rise very far, and why, when push comes to shove, it's women who get laid off (layoffs also <a href=\"http://ux1.eiu.edu/~lsghent/elvira.pdf\">disproportionately hurt minorities</a>); as Anita Raghavan <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0316/072_terminated_women.html\">noted in Forbes</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>72% of the people laid off on Wall Street after the financial crisis were women, even though they made up 64% of the workforce before the crisis.</p></blockquote><p>This trend is also particularly apparent in another important aspect of women's careers: mentoring and networking. The standard advice for women who feel stuck is to seek a mentor, or to build an external network so that they can find information, support and advice outside their workplace.</p><p>Yet, this backfires too. When favors don't really count, women find themselves marginalized in professional networks as much as they do at work. Studies have shown that women in academia, for instance, find their own rise through the ranks slowed because they spend too much time helping or tutoring students. Professional women also spend a lot of time \"mentoring down\", which cuts down on the time they can spend talking to powerful people within their organizations.</p><p>Every woman has an anecdote of having her contacts, good will, or time being taken for granted. A friend who is a professor pronounced herself \"mesmerized\" by how the men in her department were rarely imposed upon by students, whereas she and other women were always being asked for extra help.</p><p>There was an example in my own life recently, most recently when a hiring manager at another publication asked me to scour my network to recommend a candidate for a prestigious job; later, neither the candidate nor the editor who asked for my help said \"thank you\". </p><p>I don't regret the time and effort it took to make the introduction, but that lack of acknowledgement concerned me, as it would concern others. The lack of acknowledgement is not just a matter of rudeness, ingratitude or bad manners; it's a rejection of a potential alliance. It means that, should a woman ever ask for a favor from the people she has done favors for, she might find that help is a one-way street. She would likely not receive any help, since her own work on their behalf was not acknowledged. She might behave as an ally, but she will find, according to the implications of this study, that others won't behave as hers.</p><p>It's the same predicament a lot of women find themselves in: women want to help, but their help doesn't seem to count. Feeling victimized will certainly not be productive, but the study, and commenters on it, offer precious little usable advice. Some suggest not doing as many favors, which, while it might reduce the problem of unappreciative recipients, won't actually solve it. Some suggest being a little more insistent on credit when doing a favor, which might work though it sounds exhausting; a favor is not a rug in a Moroccan souk where haggling is appropriate. Some suggest just getting used to being taken for granted, but women have had thousands of years to acclimate to that state of affairs, and it hasn't been terribly successful.</p><p>Ultimately, the solution is probably something a lot bigger. There are multiple ways that society places too little value on the contribution of women, then tells them they're not contributing enough. This is true when women who are mothers are called \"housewives\", as if their labor at home has no value. It's true when women at work are paid less. It's true when women are marginalized in any realm, from politics to medicine. It's worth everyone's time to think about how to change that. That seems to be a change that society considers a mere favor. It's actually going to be real work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421457346|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|87e8e084adcaccf5088351a8e62f0a125d183785 -->",

There is arguably more to such articles, though, than just the usual prurient (and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/08/women_know_more_than_just_love_and_sex/\">quasi-anthropological</a>) interest in young women behaving badly.</p> <p>Australia has long been shaped by a narrative of egalitarianism. Our national self-image centres on a uniquely <a href=\"http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10571\">classless society</a>, unencumbered by the stratification and snobbery of the Old World. Acknowledging that divisions exist and that we do not in fact inhabit a <a href=\"http://tarahunt.com/2013/10/28/meritocracy-is-almost-as-real-as-this-unicorn/\">unicorn-filled meritocracy</a> is impossible within this framework. For those who wish to maintain the comforting fiction of a nation where Jack is as good as his master, the resulting sense of denial creates strange outcomes. As Guy Rundle <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/01/rundle-rupert-clive-and-campbell-in-the-arkansas-of-the-world/?wpmp_switcher=mobile\">noted</a> recently, Australia is a topsy-turvy place where &ldquo;billionaires lecture us about elitism&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have a class-shaped gap in much of our national conversation, and this void is filled by coded, euphemistic language, including <a href=\"http://thingsboganslike.com/\">mockery</a> of &ldquo;bogans&rdquo; and, relevantly, the lamentation that young women attending a horse race fail to conform to dress codes. Thus we have &ldquo;leading stylist and Westfield ambassador Donny Gallela&rdquo; advising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When dressing for the races, women should dress like a lady and adhere to basic racing style rules such as not flashing too much flesh and always wearing headwear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, we are repeatedly <a href=\"http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/article/-/19485760/melbourne-cup-carnival-2013-race-day-fashion-explained/\">told</a>, is the point of the Cup for women: it gives us a chance to &ldquo;dress like a real lady&rdquo;.&nbsp;We are attuned to sexism, but classism also lurks in this sort of advice. The term &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is used to denote a division between different types of women (recall also that class is inextricably linked to race), and it circulates in modern times despite the equivalent descriptor &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (to separate male plebs from their betters) having largely fallen into disuse.</p> <p>Consider the UK-produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladette_to_Lady\">Ladette to Lady</a> television show that appeared during the 2000s, teaching boisterous young women to enunciate their vowels, dress demurely, and sublimate their personalities. For added colonial cringe, there were <a href=\"http://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/aussie-ladette-to-lady/\">versions</a> of the show featuring all Australian contestants. A century after George Bernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion, the urge to remould young Eliza Doolittles has not yet evaporated.</p> <p>In 2013, it is no longer acceptable publicly to fulminate about the failings of the <br />&ldquo;lower orders&rdquo;, but this sentiment has not disappeared: could it lie beneath the horror expressed each November at the spectre of fake-tanned, miniskirted young women?</p> <p>Parallels may be drawn with the phenomena English writer Owen Jones interrogated in his 2011 polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Classes</a>; the author argued that hostility towards an &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; represented in caricatures such as Little Britain&rsquo;s Vicky Pollard masked contempt for the working classes (a term rarely used in Australia&rsquo;s mainstream media, except when politicians <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Costello-taxes-the-point-were-all-working-class/2005/05/16/1116095909038.html\">claim membership</a>). For Jones, demonization was &ldquo;the ideological backbone of an unequal society&rdquo;.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the Cup and the scandalised commentary surrounding its dress codes, which raises some questions. What does a lady look like? Who determines what behaviour is deemed ladylike? Is a lady simply a woman who conforms to antiquated assumptions rooted in a moribund yet strangely durable English class system?</p> <p>To ask these kinds of questions in the context of the Melbourne Cup is not to romanticise binge-drinking, which poses a danger to both men and women (although enthusiastic boozing attracts less concern when embraced by the male of the species). Neither is fashionably scanty clothing, at the races or otherwise, necessarily a symbol of empowerment; it&rsquo;s as well to be sceptical of versions of feminism that coincide with the dictates of consumer capitalism. It is simply to suggest that lamentations about the failure of young women to act &ldquo;like ladies&rdquo; need to be read with a critical eye.</p> <p>One thing is more or less certain: the day after the Cup, the papers will be replete with gleefully prurient pictures of bedraggled young women carrying their shoes. Our leaves don't fall in dramatic fashion, we don't have many snow storms, but here in this wide brown land the seasonal cycle continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421659057|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|188a3cd16dc159170c57fe482de2882014b1b4d2 -->",

        "body":"<p>If the breezy weekend tempted you out into Epping Forest, or to a National Trust coastal path, or to the tamer world of Tooting Common or Hampstead Heath, then remember <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_%28National_Trust%29\" title=\"\">Sir Robert Hunter</a> who died 100 years ago on Tuesday, for without him, these and many other <a href=\"http://www.oss.org.uk/\" title=\"\">open spaces</a> might have been lost. Hunter argued that there was a continuity between the original 12th-century protection of commoner's rights over a piece of land, and a similar right in the 19th century. The new suburbanites might have no sheep, pigs or cows, but access to open space and fresh air was as important to them as grazing had been to their ancestors. Enshrined in law in the mid 1870s, the principle preserved thousands of acres – although it is now being undermined by new planning legislation. Later, Hunter had the idea of preserving the wilder landscape of the Lake District by creating a land-holding company. It should, he proposed, be called the national trust.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662536|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|60a9774db20af4557a04a66d19894dc71f31ccf6 -->",

They understand, especially in the wake of the Washington Post's report about western spy services hacking into the<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html\"> intra-corporate networks of internet giants Google and Yahoo</a>, that no amount of cooperation will ever satisfy the people who wage a relentless campaign to spy on anything and everything that moves. (The NSA, of course, has issued a denial of sorts, but it's more of a<a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/10/30/nsa-non-denial-denial-241352052/\"> non-denial denial</a> of the Washington Post report). </p><p>For the users of cloud services and computing/communications technologies, the evidence mounts that we have to be skeptical (I would go as far as to say highly skeptical) of what the tech companies are telling us. We can appreciate their avowed good intentions, but they have created an architecture that obliges us to believe they may be selling us out at just about every opportunity, even if they are not.</p><p>For the companies themselves, a fairly stark choice is emerging: protect us, or risk losing us. If they chose the former, they will need to change the way they do business. Or they can lead a political movement to radically change societal norms and laws in ways that restrict collection of data and punish its misuse. Ideally, they should do both.</p><p>Changing the way they do business will be wrenching for some of them. The internet companies – cloud providers in particular – rely on a business model that obliges them to do to users what governments want to do to everyone: watch and store everything we do and say.</p><p>In a practical sense, here's what that means for Google. The company utterly relies on its ability to store vast amounts of data about how we all use the internet, including email, in plain text on its own servers. More than any large company in history, Google is about data-mining: extracting meaning and value from what we collectively do when we use its immense networks.</p><p>Google does offer more security than some other cloud-based services. Gmail is encrypted by default, so what you do when you're logged in is (probably) protected between your computer and Google's servers. The company is moving to encrypt everything moving from one server to another – to prevent the NSA, GCHQ and others from continuing to hack that data. But once the information arrives on Google's servers, it is decrypted so that Google can mine it for value.</p><p>To truly protect their users, Google and other tech companies would have to create a system that keep the information secret even from themselves. There would be a downside for the users, at least at first: We might lose some of the value that is created by the company's ability to learn from what we all do. Perhaps the tech industry could deploy a serious number of its high-paid engineers and designers to work on solutions that meet all of our needs.</p><p>If Google et al decided to make our security paramount, in an ecosystem where we users were no longer the product being sold, they'd have to ask us to pay for the services they provide. I would do so, gladly, if I could get an assurance of security. The reality, however, is that I can't imagine Google doing this, because the data collection and manipulation is so deep in the company's DNA.</p><p>I fear, in any case, that we've become so accustomed, even addicted, to the easy-to-use convenience of Google and its peers that not enough of us will opt for genuine safety. I hope the marketplace will come up with <a href=\"https://spideroak.com/\">more products</a> and <a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\">services</a> that are easy to use, robust in function and designed for security from the ground up; maybe the just-announced <a href=\"http://darkmail.info/\">DarkMail </a>will be part of the solution. I hope some nation (<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/how-did-iceland-become-such-a-whistleblower-paradise/276731/\">Iceland?</a>) decides to offer genuine protections to companies that want to genuinely protect their customers.</p><p>This is not just a technical issue. It's about the DNA of our societies, too. And that's why I hope Google, the tech company I still trust the most, will launch one of its famous \"moon shots\" – mega-risky projects aimed at mega-change – in the cultural and political realms.</p><p>President Obama has said he wants a serious national conversation about surveillance and data, but his administration has done everything in its power to prevent that from happening. Some moves in Congress to tweak the current system are welcome but insufficient.</p><p>Google should take the lead in organizing a who's who of the technology industry to put some of its vast wealth to work in Washington and other national capitals, media, academic institutions and everywhere else that makes sense – to push for fundamental changes in the way we collect and use data, in order to protect us from ourselves and each other in a world where surveillance potential is increasingly embedded into everything we touch. </p><p>The tech companies could start by loudly and publicly – and financially – supporting Lavabit, a company that shut down rather than agree to obey a government order to screw its customers, in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/edward-snowdens-lavabit-appeals-government-intrusion\">legal appeals</a>.</p><p>The tech industry seems to think it can win back our trust by quietly objecting to what it decides to call \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\">overreach</a>\" and by lobbying behind the scenes. No, it can't, because there's no reason why we should believe a word of it, even if we want (as I do) to believe it.</p><p>We need talk, yes, that deep and essential conversation about our future. We we also<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/31/apple-facebook-google-nsa-surveillance-reform\"> need action</a>. When the tech billionaires and the companies they control create the anti-surveillance, pro-security equivalent of the National Rifle Association – supporting pro-liberty candidates and targeting anti-liberty politicians for defeat – I'll start to believe they're serious about this.</p><p>Your move, Larry Page. Please, please make the right one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421428969|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|3b85fe24628c31279df9832afcda6743744017fd -->",

        "body":"<p>At the turn of the century, one of the banners student protestors lofted in the City read: \"Replace capitalism with something nice.\" Before the bust, bankers and brokers could look down from their skyscrapers and dismiss this as proof of marijuana-fugged thinking, reaffirming their belief that There Is No Alternative. For a brief period after the catastrophe of 2008, however, a deep but vague conviction that there must be a different way to run financial affairs became entirely mainstream; so mainstream, in fact, that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-coalition-documentation\" title=\"\">coalition partners</a> made a hazy commitment to promote banking mutuals, a year after the outgoing Brown administration had issued special statutory instruments to allow the Co-operative Bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/21/britannia-cooperative-banks-building-societies\" title=\"\">to merge with the Britannia building society</a>.</p><p>This deal, it was fondly imagined, could create a player to drag a friendly society ethos of finance into the 21st century, and on a scale to put a branch on every high street, really challenging the Big Four's way of doing business. Four years on, the necessity of that challenge has been underlined by scandals involving everything from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/libor-scandal/\" title=\"\">rate-rigging</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21840052\" title=\"\">money laundering</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\" title=\"\">systematic mis-selling of insurance</a>. Far from thriving, however, the great Co-operative challenger is fighting for life, and this week announced that it was being kept alive – but only with, in the final cruel irony, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">help of American hedge funds</a>.</p><p>The details of the deal are depressing first and most acutely for the workers who will lose their job in a run of branch closers. But they are depressing, too, for anyone who wants to see new models of finance, or indeed of business more widely. For the wider Co-op group is going to have to find £462m, which is half a billion pounds that will not be available to invest its mutually owned supermarkets and funeral homes. Assuming enough individual bond holders can be persuaded to acquiesce in the deal, the Co-op group's stake will shrink from 100% to 30%, while it writes ethical values into its articles of association.</p><p>In theory, the Co-op group will be able to blow the whistle on its own bank for any transgressions, but how likely is that? At best, like a declaration of confidence in a club manager, this is an avowal the company would rather it did not have to make. In the very worst case, the pledges could turn out as hollow as <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49344\" title=\"\">the guarantees of editorial freedom</a> that secured Rupert Murdoch's take-over of the Times.</p><p>That, however, is probably melodramatic. For 30% should be enough for control; more fundamentally – as those hedge fund investments make plain – there is a serious market for ethical banking. Co-op Bank's difficulties came from expanding too fast, a hubristic habit learnt from the mainstream. The real difficulty, then, wasn't that Co-op was too different – but that it was not different enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662147|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|3c168b0a65cc643c7fc6b937bc5305bf994408f2 -->",

        "body":"<p>What most political parties' election teams wouldn't give to know precisely what makes a person consider voting Ukip. Facile explanations about the surge of Ukip support being exclusively about Europe have been comprehensively dismissed in <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2012/12/the-ukip-threat-is-not-about-europe/\" title=\"\">extensive research</a> commissioned by Lord Ashcroft. It showed that Britain's relationship with Europe was the top issue for only, roughly, a quarter of the people considering Ukip. And yet the surge in support is a phenomenon that remains, to paraphrase Churchill, a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside the enigma that is Nigel Farage. The results of a new YouGov poll conducted on behalf of the thinktank Class <a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/news/latest/new-class-yougov-poll-released-today-shows-that-most-people-are-not-benefit\" title=\"\">provide some surprising clues</a>.</p><p>In a series of questions relating to a variety of areas, from energy prices and rent control to public ownership of railways and banking reform, the poll found that voters who intend to back Ukip supported state intervention, consistently and by a significant margin. These results are in marked contrast to the lower percentages seen among Conservative supporters and are closer to Labour voters. For instance, 73% of Ukip supporters chose the proposition &quot;the railway companies should be run in the public sector&quot; as expressing their views, compared with 79% of Labour and only 52% of Conservative.</p><p>This pattern is broadly replicated. &quot;The government should have the power to control energy prices&quot;: 83% Ukip, 86% Lab, 60% Con; &quot;The government should have the power to control private sector rents&quot;: 50% Ukip, 56% Lab, 32% Con; &quot;The energy companies should be run in the public sector&quot;: 73% Ukip, 79% Labour, 52% Con. YouGov warns that people &quot;should be careful about reading too much into a sub-sample&quot;, but notwithstanding that caveat they can be &quot;confident in saying that Ukip voters do seem to be more supportive of price controls and nationalisation than their rightwing image might suggest&quot;.</p><p>How does this help our understanding of the current political landscape? The concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass\" title=\"\">&quot;political compass&quot;</a> is useful here. The idea behind it is simply this: a horizontal, linear left-to-right nexus of economic ideology is no longer sufficient to express the complex relationship between parties and the voters they court. It is necessary to consider a vertical axis of libertarian to authoritarian (or statist). This, in effect, creates four quadrants, as the figure below shows.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-421455680\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383305693607/Political-chart-001.jpg\" alt=\"Political chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"502\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Political chart</figcaption></figure><p>Broadly speaking, the way in which each of the three main parties presents itself places it in one of three quadrants (albeit converged towards the centre) as an offering; Conservative in the libertarian right, Liberal Democrat in the libertarian left, Labour in the authoritarian left. I say this fully accepting that during this era, in which opinion polls seem to determine leadership rather than the other way around, all parties cherry-pick policies which are distinctly outside their quadrant. I also accept that the way in which a party portrays itself before an election and the way in which it acts in power, are often incongruous – the Liberal Democrats representing for many the most obvious example at present.</p><p>It would seem a possibility worth considering that Ukip has planted itself within the authoritarian right quadrant, which was previously largely unrepresented in British politics. This may explain why research into byelections found that a notable slice of Ukip support hadn't voted at all recently. Certainly, there seems to be an element of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2286303/A-plague-houses-Voters-turn-main-parties-UKIP-breakthrough.html\" title=\"\">general disillusionment with traditional politics</a>. However, it would be fascinating to explore further this notion that Ukip may have chanced upon this fourth quadrant.</p><p>I say &quot;chanced upon&quot; because I don't think there is any element of political strategic genius at work in this formulation. Rather, as I've explained before, Ukip flagrantly pilfers the most unpopular policies from both Labour and the Conservatives and frames them in a negative manner, making its manifesto a &quot;bucket list&quot; for the annoyed and offering easy, uncosted solutions. Scared of immigrants? Vote Ukip. Insecure about the financial crisis? Vote Ukip. Hate the smoking ban, energy companies, HS2, Brussels, travellers, burqas, tax, Boris, debt, wind farms, bankers, quangos, foreign aid, crime, Abu Qatada, tuition fees, lazy people, Muslims, foreigners, the hunting ban? Vote Ukip.</p><p>The result of that scattered approach, however, may be that Ukip has somehow stumbled upon virgin territory that perfectly fits their nationalist identity; the vote of people naturally leaning towards the authoritarian right.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421450083|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|1c52b258ba135fbe9027132209ec980128f487b6 -->",

        "body":"<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine got married. To do this, she moved to London from Germany, leaving behind her friends, her family – and her job. She wasn't too worried about this: she'd built up more than a decade of experience and achievements. She could speak perfect English. She'd miss her family but financially, she'd be fine.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, London had other ideas. She went to interview after interview. They all ended in rejection.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she went to an interview where she was asked some odd questions. She was asked which part of London she lived in. She was asked what her husband did. And finally the interviewer just came out with it: \"Look, your husband is obviously doing quite well for himself, you've just got married, why do you even want a job?\"</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, that question contained the sexist (not to mention economically antiquated) idea that women just work for pin money. But it also hinted at another issue: the issue of babies. The issue of maternity leave. The issue of \"why should I hire you when you'll probably just end up costing me thousands of pounds in wasted pay a few months down the line?\"</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2013/11/04/government-launches-pregnancy-discrimination-investigation/\" title=\"\">European court of human rights has just been given £1m</a> by Maria Miller, the minister for women and equalities, to investigate just how bad this situation is. This follows on from a damning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/mar/09/women-on-maternity-leave-illegal-discrimation\" title=\"\">Slater &amp; Gordon poll</a> showing that many women were returning from maternity leave to worse jobs – or sometimes no job at all.</p><p></p><p>Research into this area is of course welcome. But I can't help but feel that we are ignoring the most obvious reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/04/review-pregnancy-discrimination-work\" title=\"\">women are discriminated against in this way</a>. The issue is at heart incredibly simple: it's about money.</p><p></p><p>Women from the age of 30 to 45 are viewed with suspicion and seen as a liability. They are a fecund cost waiting to happen. So why, these companies think, should we take the risk on this well-qualified woman, when we can place a safe bet on this man. He might not be as effective at the job, but at least he'll be around in six months' time. And so the cycle continues, with brilliant women floundering in their careers, overtaken by men not as a result of merit, but as a result of a shrewd cost decision. And perhaps the most irritating thing about this cycle is how easy it is to fix.</p><p></p><p>It is currently enshrined in law that women are the primary care-givers. Women get 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional maternity leave. Men get one or two weeks of ordinary paternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional paternity leave. There is no reason for this disparity, beyond a traditional notion that women are somehow more innately qualified than men to bring up children.</p><p></p><p>It's great that the government is finally sitting up and taking notice of this problem. It's great that it is seeing that legislating against discrimination doesn't mean that it stops. But what we need to see now is some action to change that. And splitting leave equally between the two parents of a child is the obvious and equitable way to do that.</p><p>Until men are seen as equally likely to take time off because of the child that they have brought into the world, this kind of covert, wink-wink discrimination will continue – and it will continue to affect women who don't intend to or can't have children, as much as those who do. If a company can't know either way, it is going to take the safer bet. And that bet is going to result in more women like my friend, who is still looking for a job, and still not finding one. I'm starting to wonder if she ever will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683067|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|3b167b213761b6738a27b3612118ecad8d4b27ba -->",

But that's your style isn't it? Never let the truth get in the way of a good smear campaign, or something like that.</p><p></p><p>So just in case you wanted to attempt to polish that turd of an article with something that resembles the truth, here's some of them addressed:</p><p></p><p>1. I'm not single – I'm getting married in the spring.</p><p></p><p>2. When I returned to work after maternity leave, my relationship broke down, and I found it impossible to cover the irregular night shifts 30 miles from home with any form of childcare. Childminders just don't work all night. Her son's father <em>did</em> and <em>does</em> look after him, but at the time it was impossible to match our work shifts up with friends, family and childcare to cover my working hours. Because he works too. But don't let that ruin your image of a very good man as a feckless waster. I applied for flexible hours under the fire service flexible working policy, I applied for a job share post, I applied for day work roles, other jobs in the fire service closer to home, and was turned down on all counts.</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421450096'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383304449791/Kale-008.jpg' alt='Kale' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'My food column is for anyone … I also eat baked beans, but kale was such an easy target.' Photograph: Kevin Summers/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So, 3. I didn't sail out of the door for a life on benefits, I left to find a job closer to home, with better hours more suited to bringing up a young child alone. It took 18 months for me to find that job, and hundreds of applications, but I did it. And that's what sticks in your craw, isn't it? Because in order to satisfy the stereotype that you peddle day in day out in the rag currently lining my ferret cage, I should have stayed feckless and unemployed, and not tried to feed myself and my son decent nutritious meals, nor had the audacity to write about it.</p><p></p><p>4. I'm sure married men can raise families on £27k. There's a few thousand in the fire service. I wouldn't have had to give up my job if I'd had a wife to look after my child on night shifts either, so your point is null and void. What was I meant to do, take my son to work? (I actually asked …)</p><p></p><p>5. I'm a \"hard-pressed British taxpayer\" too. You know that £27k salary I just mentioned? Well I paid tax into the big welfare pot from that salary. The difference between us is that I am glad I live in a country that seeks to look after its citizens with a safety net, imperfect as it is, it's surely better than no support at all.</p><p></p><p>6. Claiming benefits wasn't a lifestyle choice. See above.</p><p></p><p>7. It wasn't a laptop, I blogged from my mobile phone. And before everyone starts bitching and bickering about the fact I had a mobile phone, it wasn't a fancy smartphone – I'd sold that to pay the rent – it was a Nokia that could send emails, and I emailed the posts in. Now I have a full-time job, I have a little notebook computer and a nice phone again, and I make no apology for that.</p><p></p><p>8. My food column is for anyone, funnily enough you don't need to fill out a gov.uk benefits assessment before being allowed to read it. My readership is varied and consists of young working families, people struggling to make ends meet, and also Paul Heaton, Nigel Slater and Tom Parker Bowles. I also eat baked beans, but kale was such an easy target for you, as you seem to have ideas about what people can eat based on their employment status.</p><p></p><p>9. I don't have a 52-inch plasma TV. I had a 17-inch one that my parents bought me a few Christmases ago but I sold it to pay the rent in August 2012.</p><p></p><p>10. \"No one makes any money out of blogging\". Yes they do. Adverts on high-traffic blogs, guest posts, sponsored posts, product endorsement – there are many ways to make money out of blogging. I don't go in for product endorsement posts, or guest or sponsored posts, but I do have adverts on my blog, which don't pay much but they do \"make money\". Even £1 is money, don't you know? But that's beside the point, you and I both know that I didn't set that blog up to make a career out of it. There are 40 million live blogs on the internet – the chances of mine leading to this when I started it, considering it was initially about Southend council meetings, are slimmer than the odds of winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>11. I don't \"rely on some sort of income support from the state\". I still receive child benefit, like all parents that earn less than £50,000 a year, single, married or otherwise, but I stopped claiming all other benefits when I started working full time. I'm grateful that the welfare safety net is there, but I no longer need it because I have a full-time job and earn just enough to look after myself and my son.</p><p></p><p>12. \"They think they are entitled to benefits on their own terms.\" Don't tell me what I think … If \"on my own terms\" means \"on time and not suspended without warning leaving me in rent arrears\" then absolutely, yes.</p><p></p><p>13. Ah, the tattoos. An easy distraction from the real issues. Read this slowly and absorb: I got my first tattoo when I was 18 (no baby, in work) and continued spending my wages on my tattoos until I didn't have wages to spend on them any more. I did not spend my \"benefit money\" on tattoos. End of. I do still have them, because tattoos are permanent, so even when you're freezing and starving you can't sell them for a bit of cash.</p><p></p><p>14. \"Her arms look like your average professional footballer\". But thinner, non?</p><p></p><p>15. 'Jack's bill for body art' (paid for when she was <em>working</em>) is cheaper than you'd think, being done mostly by friends and apprentices. Not that it's any of your business, what I spend my wages on.</p><p></p><p>16. \"Want the gravy without having to work for it.\" Ah, this old chestnut. See above. Left job to find new job. Now have a new job.</p><p></p><p>I think that's everything.</p><p></p><p>Thank you in advance for the amusement I will get reading the comments section of the Daily Mail today, and for the extra followers on Twitter and the messages of support. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2480664/The-phoney-ordinary-folk-Labours-TV-broadcast-Millionaire-restaurateur-Guardian-journalist-interviewees-saying-afford-fuel-bills.html\" title=\"\">Yesterday's smear campaign was a mild irritation</a>, but my blog got lots of hits as people Googled that feckless waster that dared to talk about a political issue, which in turn means that the income I receive from the little advert on the side bar will be significantly higher than usual. Cheers for that.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and if you really wanted your readers to foam at the mouth about me, I can't understand why you omitted the detail that I'm a <em>lesbian</em>. <a href=\"http://agirlcalledjack.com/2013/10/12/the-pink-list-2013/\" title=\"\">Number 19 on this years Pink List lesbian</a>, to be precise.</p><p></p><p>With my very best wishes,</p><p></p><p>Jack Monroe</p><p></p><p>• This first appeared on Jack Monroe's blog <a href=\"http://agirlcalledjack.com/\" title=\"\">A Girl Called Jack</a> and is republished here with permission</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421445414|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|e34f33655409e6dfd9f725d504f07f6296ad63df -->",

        "headline":"Rail privatisation: legalised larceny",
        "body":"<p><em>\"It needs access to private capital, access to private management, it needs more money into the business, and all this will become possible.\" David&nbsp;Cameron on Royal Mail, October 2013</em></p><p>As they flog our public assets, government ministers always promise one thing: that they will be better cared for by the new private owners. Sure, they may look like hedge funds out for a fast buck, but we must consider them investors, who will plough in their own millions to burnish the family silver.</p><p>Thatcher said it in the 80s; and now, during this second coming of popular capitalism, her grandchildren are saying it too.</p><p>While giving away Royal Mail at a bargain-basement price, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-mail/10370018/Royal-Mail-Cameron-signals-some-investors-will-lose-out.html\" title=\"\">David Cameron promised the result would be a flood of private cash</a>. When a <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1117327/romney-firm-to-buy-nhs-supplier-in-200m-deal\" title=\"\">unit supplying the NHS with blood was handed over to private equity</a>, Jeremy Hunt's officials pleaded the need for investment. And you'll hear that justification over and over again, as the coalition privatises a further £15bn worth of companies, departments and assets currently held by the public.</p><p>Never mind ownership, ministers will soothe us: lie back and think of the investment. So let's do that. Let's go back to the last great privatisation and see how much investment it yielded.</p><p>Tuesday marks the 20th anniversary of rail privatisation, the day when the government finally pushed through the legislation to break up and sell off our train services. Throughout the flotation process, successive transport ministers pointed at the goodies to come. Take this reliably bouffant <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo950115/debtext/60115-02.htm\" title=\"\">pledge from Steve Norris</a>: \"There is not the slightest shadow of doubt that, freed from the constraints of public sector financing, train operators … will generate substantially greater investment in the railways because of the privatisation of British Rail.\"</p><p>Was he right? I asked academics at the <a href=\"http://www.cresc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc)</a> to calculate how much companies such as Virgin and First Group are investing in their services. They looked at their return on capital employed, which is to say the amount train operators made on the money tied up in their business. A&nbsp;low ratio would indicate an industry doing as Norris and his colleagues foretold: ploughing cash into delivering a better service. A really high ratio would indicate the opposite: barely any cash going in.</p><p>The figures are astonishing. In the financial year ending in March 2012, the train companies gained an average return of 147% on every pound they put into their business. Forget about high: that is stratospheric. It suggests that – despite all the promises made by the freshly rehabilitated John Major – the train operators are investing barely anything, but making bumper returns.</p><p>If you're a pensioner, imagine a savings account that promised to give you next year a 147% return on your cash, rather than the 1% you'll typically get now. If you're a first-time buyer, imagine selling up next year at a 147% markup – impossible even in primest, most central London.</p><p>Other businesses would kill for the kind of low-investment, high-returns that Arriva, Stagecoach and the rest are making from their train sets. Big supermarkets get about £1.08 back for every quid they put in: all that stock ties up a lot of cash. Even the supposed profiteers over at Barclays would punch the air at a 10% return. For every pound the railway barons put in, they get £2.47 back.</p><p>And that most recent figure isn't a fluke. The Cresc team went back all the way to the start of the electronic database in 2004, and found that year after year the pre-tax return on capital employed was never less than 100%. Just as remarkable are the train operators' dividends: pretty much all the profit after tax was paid to shareholders.</p><p>No wonder Richard Branson is a billionaire with his own private island. No wonder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/26/firstgroup-chief-tim-otoole-offer-quit-debt\" title=\"\">Tim O'Toole, boss of FirstGroup</a>, and Brian Souter, head of Stagecoach, are on more than a million quid a year each. They are rewarded handsomely for handing over every spare penny to their shareholders.</p><p>But by the same token, no wonder passengers in cattle class can't get free Wi-Fi, or even a seat on the evening train out of Euston: there's no cash left to make the services worth the often excessive fares. The really big improvements, such as the west coast mainline upgrade now enjoyed by Branson's business, are funded by taxpayers. Heads they win, tails we lose.</p><p>A train lobbyist reading this (hi there!) will tell you that measuring investment by the operators is barking up the wrong tree. Arriva and the rest are essentially commissioned by the government to run a line. But that ignores three things. First, the industry never stops banging on about its role as an \"investor\". Second, free cash without having to pony up much actual investment is very welcome to the Branson empire, among others.</p><p>And finally, if the operators are merely there as middlemen, to sell us tickets and clip them, then why do we need them? Specifically, why is Cameron so desperate to give the publicly-run east coast mainline to the private sector?</p><p>Capitalism is meant to be about private firms taking risks and reaping the rewards. The rail network on the other hand is about the public taking the risk and racking up huge debts, even while the private firms reap excessive rewards.</p><p>Look at those investment return figures again: that isn't the triumph of liberalisation; that's legalised larceny. It hardly bodes well for the next wave of sell-offs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648967|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|301c53fb7cf1679e90eb402ff312fd1b0db9af9d -->",

        "headline":"When a woman says she's not feminist, we can do better than shout her down",
        "body":"<p>\"Absolutely not: I definitely wouldn't call myself a feminist,\" began Angela Epstein on Newsnight on Tuesday. Answering a question from presenter Emily Maitlis about whether she'd describe herself as a feminist, the journalist and broadcaster offered up a wistful eulogy to the ghosts of feminism past and bemoaned the deterioration of the movement. Apparently one woman under the king's horse was more than enough to secure feminist victory for all time. Women, she reminded us, now have the vote! Some women have even got the vote, a career and shiny hair. This is great news, but someone really ought to pass it on to the \"grumpy women in bad clothes\" who, according to Epstein, have bastardised feminism and committed the even graver offence of being poorly coiffed in the process.</p><p>There's no need to defend feminism from tired arguments such as this. Epstein was invited on Newsnight alongside Mary Beard and Natasha McElhone to provide the obligatory counterpoint to the feminist strand of the debate. And she is patently wrong. The imbalanced distribution of wealth and power between men and women is proof enough of feminism's legitimacy. And for those who still need convincing, personal testimony – via movements such as <a href=\"http://everydaysexism.com/\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism</a> – paints an even more vivid picture of the prejudices that today's feminists have to combat.</p><p>From within a feminist bubble it's tempting to imagine that Epstein is just hollering into the void from her little soapbox and that her pointless polemics about being \"disqualified from the sisterhood\" for having a career, are falling on deaf ears. But if we think this way we'll be sabotaging our own cause. Epstein's views reflect a wider neurosis about the meaning of feminism. Rather than just shouting her down, we need to ask why such distrust still persists and what we can do to dispel it.</p><p>In an article she wrote for the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2480538/I-ambushed-Twitterati-feminists-actual-fact-HATE-women.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail</a> after her Newsnight appearance, Epstein paints a picture of a feminism set on taking from her the things she holds dearest: her husband, her pride in being a mother and her daughter's right to play with dolls. As early as the first sentence she notes that her blow-dried hair should be evidence enough that she's no feminist. It's the kind of remark that make women up and down the country collectively facepalm. We mustn't laugh, though: these sorts of imagined dichotomies are more common than we might like to believe.</p><p>I have heard young women say that they wouldn't be a feminist because they love their boyfriends, or because they like to look sexy, or because they want to be a mother. Feminism apparently has been kept at arm's length by those for whom it's a pejorative term and shoehorned into the twin cones of Madonna's pointy bra. It is seen as limiting by as many women as find it empowering.</p><p>Rather than ruing the fact that so many seem to have missed the memo which explained how feminism is necessary and liberating, we need to take responsibility for hand-delivering its message. We need to understand women's reasons for recoiling from the word feminism, listen to their concerns, and see what we can do to be make the movement more inclusive. I'm not suggesting that we dumb down the message, abandon our demands or compromise on our principles, but we do need to take time to listen and to explain.</p><p>In the meantime, Angela Epstein has unwittingly exposed herself as just kind of person she abhors: the woman who thinks that career and family shouldn't be mutually exclusive, the woman who wants to achieve on her own terms and who expects the freedom to dress as she wants without being reduced to a stereotype. Sorry to break it to you, Angela, but I think you might be a feminist, too.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421449269|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|b68274b6073f7a92f0482799a74da507deb6dfdf -->",

        "body":"<p>I am not privy to the thought processes of supermodels (thank God), and I cannot for the life of me think what was running through Heidi Klum's head when she came up with the idea that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2482400/Heidi-Klum-turns-wrinkled-old-lady-Oscar-winning-make-artist-Halloween.html\" title=\"\">dressing as an old woman</a> was an amusing concept for Halloween. Heidi is well-known for going the full nine yards on All Hallows' Eve. She's been <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1cu1jjR\" title=\"\">Clive Barker's Hellraiser</a> (or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IITEG\" title=\"\">Gunther von Hagens' flayed body</a>, depending on your cultural references), the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/17x0AMK\" title=\"\">Hindu goddess Kali</a> (managing to offend an entire religion) and now she's given us what currently terrifies the western world beyond all reason – age.</p><p>Yes, there are cultural differences at play here – dressing up for Halloween in the US does not necessarily mean witches, vampires and Frankenstein – but it's hard to see this stunt as anything other than ill-judged and offensive. There is a fine line here and Klum has crossed it.</p><p>Once the initial \"red mist\" had dissipated and I started to analyse my reaction, I've concluded it's the fact that she played it straight and gone to a great deal of trouble to do so. This is not the slightly more acceptable \"comedy crone\" that we're used to seeing and can tolerate – if we can't laugh at stress incontinence and sagging bosoms we're screwed. No, the problem for me is that it feels frankly insulting to quick fix a look that most of us are working hard to achieve over several decades. I'm not joking – take pride in the battle scars life leaves. Lines, wrinkles, veins, scars are all badges of survival – signs of a life lived. How dare Heidi Klum make light of that. As several people pointed out when I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/TheVintageYear\" title=\"\">started on a rant</a> this morning – there are those who have gone too soon who would have been very happy to embrace a wrinkled and stooped old age.</p><p>I then began to wonder whether she was trying to subvert the whole supermodel eternal youth myth. Perhaps she was saying something profound about all of us heading the same way. Something like \"age is compulsory\" or perhaps \"life is terminal\". But after reading her  comments on Twitter, such as \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/heidiklum/status/396086313776349184\" title=\"\">Little old me</a>\" – I decided I was crediting her with too much existential angst.</p><p>No, it is quite simply that making herself into an old woman for an evening is meant to be funny – not ironic, not an indication of the inner terror of a young and beautiful woman, not witty or making a point, it is purely to ridicule the old and have a good laugh at their expense. There is a serious discussion beginning on the subject of positive ageing and positive representations of age. I've been to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/16RuRW9\" title=\"\">two</a> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HeZppB\" title=\"\">conferences</a> in the last two weeks on the subject. Both were fascinating, stimulating and reassuring. What baffles me is that neither were rammed to the rafters – there seems to be some sort of apathy among older people about tackling their own future and status. Perhaps they think if they ignore it, it will stop, like ignoring a child having a tantrum. Or perhaps it's a generational thing and they feel it's impolite to make a fuss.</p><p>Unless a fuss is made there is a real danger that they (we) will find themselves negated still further to the point of oblivion. Older people, and I include myself at 58, must stand up and be counted, and protest against ageist nonsense such as this. Younger generations must be allowed to see positive representations of age and older people, not stereotypes and caricatures. To allow the current situation to continue is to stoke the fires of ageism and isolation of older generations. What are older women used for in the advertising world? Anti-ageing beauty products (usually heavily airbrushed or shown on 30-year-old models), medical products and walk-in baths: I'll happily bore the tits off anyone who wants to talk to me about the lack of positive imagery in the media. Which might be rude of me to say so, but I'm still not nearly as rude as Heidi Klum.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421458460|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|15442eac8a4e7157c96ce6a1acc03c2c5d200212 -->",

According to a survey, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">one in six women</a> admit to purchasing an item of clothing or an accessory, wearing it and then returning it to the shop for a full refund.

It could be a sign of our obsession with instant gratification, the need to possess and reject, the bad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/26/sex-and-the-city-2-review\" title=\"\">Sex And The City</a> hangover which has left us broke, miserable and in possession of a metric tonne of peculiar orange-beaded mules. Bloomingdale's department store <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">takes a dim view of the practice</a>, and has marked its merchandise with big black tags that you have to leave on in order to get a refund, meaning you can attend the gala dinner in a Cavalli cocktail dress that you intend to take back the next day, as long as you don't mind looking like you arrived Santa-style, by climbing down a sooty chimney.</p><p>Big stores lose out when we return clothes, but everyone else wins. It depends on the returner, and the garment – you'd hope that no one would be so vulgar as to attend a hot yoga class in their new Spandex unitard and then demand a refund on their purchase. But as long as the wearer has remembered their deodorant and been careful with their cigarettes, I don't mind the idea of buying a dress that's already had a few gratis nights out. After all, we love vintage clothes because they have a history and a story. Returned clothes could have great stories too, it's just they're more likely to end with a trip to Chicken Cottage.</p><p>It's possible to rent occasion wear from some outfitters, but if stores feel \"wardrobing\" is a serious problem, they need to get in on the act. Chain stories could consider introducing a clothes library, where a garment can be rented for a reduced fee, which covers storage and cleaning costs. If nothing else, it would make a sizeable dent in the scary pile of man-made fabrics that end up in landfill every year.</p><p>For women, fashion consumerism is a game they can't win. In one light, we're flibbertigibbets, unable to focus our minds on serious issues like sport, because our heads are full of sparkles and chiffon. If we find joy in fashion, we're thought to be frivolous and simple, even though this is an industry that generates thousands of jobs and billions of pounds, attracting artistic visionaries and smart entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, we can't escape fashion. Everywhere we turn, we're being told to look different, to look better, to have the right outfit for every mood and occasion. If you ever have to go out, be seen in public and talk to people, I am certain there will have been at least one occasion in your life when it became a tearful and traumatic experience because you felt you looked wrong. We're judged by our peers and our families, and now on Facebook and Instagram. People you haven't seen since school can berate you for recycling a bridesmaid's dress and wearing it to a christening. Of course we fantasise about finding the outfits that fill us with joy, that make us feel like our very best selves, as if we could tap dance down the Left Bank and solve mysteries and build bridges and make brioche, while being simultaneously sexy, clever, cool and insouciant. But most women, shopping is not a source of joy. Forget the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQK0VTTXvA\" title=\"\">\"Big mistake! Huge!\"</a> scene in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81528/pretty-woman\" title=\"\">Pretty Woman</a>. In reality it's more like a mash up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\" title=\"\">Battle Royale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36325/scum\" title=\"\">Scum</a> and the bit in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/70550/men-in-black\" title=\"\">Men In Black</a> where the man is slowly revealed to be a big greasy alien.</p><p>If wardrobing was legitimised and formalised, shopping would not lead to alarming amounts of waste and even more alarming levels of debt. We would have the time to work out whether we were comfortable in a garment and whether it made us happy. Shopping wouldn't be such a stressful, expensive risk. It might even become as much fun as the movies suggest. If we could try more and buy less, we'd end up with so many items we truly loved that it would curb our desire for a pointless purchase just because it's new. No matter how big the store is, returning worn items and lying to get a refund is definitely not OK. But it would be great if shops could recognise why this practice is so widely adopted, and meet us in the middle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632571|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|f75efa82c9657befacef0a8d71bc19054b428b10 -->",

        "headline":"The Red Cross needs to reclaim its hijacked neutrality",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/syria-ceasefire-polio-vaccination\" title=\"\">Polio has broken out in Syria</a>. What are we going to do about it? There are refugees starving in the Sahara and drowning off Italy. Shias are being massacred in Iraq, Congolese are being raped, Egyptians tortured, Roma trafficked, Pashtun villagers drone-bombed. You can't stand idly by. Do something.</p><p>This week is the 150th anniversary of the forming of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in 1863. Four years earlier a Swiss businessman, Henry Dunant, was passing through the Italian village of Castiglione and found it swamped by soldiers from the battle of Solferino. The armies had departed, leaving 40,000 dead and wounded on the battlefield. Dunant desperately rallied the villagers to bring water and dress wounds on both sides. For him the task was straightforward. He had arrived after the event and needed simply to clear up the mess. His principle of impartiality held. Even during two world wars, the red cross symbolised neutrality, humanity's simple protest against the orgy of suffering.</p><p>Today that is not so easy. There are hundreds of similar charities round the world, each with overlapping ambitions. I remember a colleague returning from Ethiopia during the 1983-85 famine dismayed at the chaos of the refugee camps, with charity and NGO tents pitched like rival armies across the field of misery. Each craved publicity for fundraising back home. There was no co-ordination.</p><p>These things are better organised today by the UN and disaster relief committees. The ICRC has itself sprouted national societies and Red Crescent affiliates. But after the catastrophes in Ethiopia and Yugoslavia a spell was broken. The suffering was seen as politically engendered and complex. These were acts not of God but of men. Why pour aid into Ethiopia when it was either stolen or assisted mass relocation? The charitable prerogative was complicated by politics and diplomacy. Soon it was corrupted by a military embrace. Linda Polman wrote a book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/08/war-games-linda-polman-review\" title=\"\">War Games</a>, arguing that aid was furthering war rather than countering it.</p><p>Tony Blair's famous (or infamous) Chicago speech of April 1999, instigating the Kosovan war, was trumpeted by him as signalling \"the first of a new generation of liberal humanitarian wars\". From&nbsp;then on, liberal interventionism was identified not with Red Cross neutrality but with bombs falling and guns blazing \"to save little children\".</p><p>Noam Chomsky pointed to the irony of the emergent concept of \"a new military humanism\" and to the obscenity of using the least humanitarian weapon, the air-dropped bomb, in its cause. Even Henry Kissinger called Blair's approach \"irresponsible\", and Bill Clinton's White House complained of Blair having \"too much adrenaline on his cornflakes\".</p><p>A severe toll was inflicted on the Red Cross. Though its work extends to relieving natural disasters and supplementing healthcare, its classic purpose remains impartial relief in time of war, notably where civilians are caught in crossfire. It struggles to sustain an image of neutrality. In Afghanistan this has worked. The Red Crescent has access to prisoners held by the Taliban and trains Taliban first-aid workers, whereas other aid organisations are seen as in collusion with the Nato occupation.</p><p>But even the ICRC cannot avoid the taint of association with western interventionism. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/27/iraq\" title=\"\">attack on its Baghdad headquarters in 2003</a> suggested its impartiality was no longer universally acknowledged. Red Cross staff have been in killed in Chechnya, Sri Lanka, Congo and Syria and the tempo of such&nbsp;attacks, as on aid workers of all persuasions, has increased.</p><p>In 2005 the ICRC commissioned a report on its neutrality which concluded emphatically that \"military force … <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icrc.org%2Feng%2Fassets%2Ffiles%2Freview%2F2011%2Firrc-884-williamson.pdf&amp;ei=X4NyUpH5H4iQ7AaMrYHQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVPmbTIXJrFOBDQnAYVnfCNbgVUw&amp;bvm=bv.55819444,d.ZGU&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">as an instrument for gaining peace is for the Red Cross not applicable</a>\". That seems ever more like spitting in the wind. Humanitarian agencies spring up by the week, often in the lucrative baggage train of the military-industrial complex. As a result, foreign intervention in today's \"wars among the peoples\" risks not just being seen as aiding one side but as actually doing so. This is particularly the case when, as often, western military invasion and occupation have been justified as humanitarian. Like \"peacekeeping\" of old, the parlance of modern war can be contradictory.</p><p>As a result, \"doing something\" has come to imply something political, if not military. On Thursday the former British foreign secretary and champion of Blair's wars, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24754555\" title=\"\">David Miliband, visited the BBC</a> to promote his International Rescue Committee's efforts to get polio vaccine to Syria. He could not resist confusing humanitarian relief with more partisan intervention. He demanded \"a humanitarian ceasefire\" in Syria and a \"rallying of a sense of outrage and also a determination to do something\".</p><p>The Red Cross may protest its humanitarian purity, but its mission has been hijacked and compromised by political and military adventurism. How can a British NGO be safely neutral in Syria when Britain's prime minister has called for war against the Damascus government? It is dreadful but perhaps not surprising that doctors are targeted at checkpoints for delivering aid \"to the wrong side\".</p><p>The urge to relieve human suffering is profound, even if it means interfering in another country's affairs. It may seem sanitised by being called intervention, but interference it remains. To be lawful, it must be utterly divorced from politics and diplomacy and, above all, it cannot seem to give moral purchase to war. War has its own logic, its own morality. Charity's business is not to end war but to relieve war's consequences.</p><p>Of all Blair's legacies, the most outrageous is the jeering accusation that non-violent humanitarianism is \"standing idly by\", is doing nothing. Blair's wars undermined Dunant's concept of impartial neutrality. Somehow, the ICRC desperately needs to reassert it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421398817|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|4c73580f29210e44b5adcfa1f70c3eb7f96d8b18 -->",

        "body":"<p>Remember that referendum about whether we should create a single market with the United States? You know, the one that asked whether corporations should have the power to strike down our laws? No, I don't either. Mind you, I spent 10 minutes looking for my watch the other day before I realised I was wearing it. Forgetting about the referendum is another sign of ageing. Because there must have been one, mustn't there? After all that agonising over whether or not we should stay in the European Union, the government wouldn't cede our sovereignty to some shadowy, undemocratic body without consulting us. Would it?</p><p>The purpose of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and European nations. I mentioned it <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2013/10/14/elite-insurgency/\" title=\"\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. But I left out the most important issue: the remarkable ability it would grant big business to sue the living daylights out of governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing.</p><p>The mechanism through which this is achieved is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement\" title=\"\">investor-state dispute settlement</a>. It's already being used in many parts of the world to kill regulations protecting people and the living planet.</p><p>The Australian government, after massive debates in and out of parliament, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20559585\" title=\"\">decided that cigarettes should be sold in plain packets</a>, marked only with shocking health warnings. The decision was validated by the Australian supreme court. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets\" title=\"\">using a trade agreement Australia struck with Hong Kong</a>, the tobacco company Philip Morris has asked an offshore tribunal to award it a vast sum in compensation for the loss of what it calls its intellectual property.</p><p>During its financial crisis, and in response to public anger over rocketing charges, Argentina imposed a freeze on people's energy and water bills (does this sound familiar?). It was sued by the international utility companies whose vast bills had prompted the government to act. For this and other such crimes, it has been forced to pay out over a billion dollars in compensation. In El Salvador, local communities managed at great cost (<a href=\"http://www.canadians.org/fr/node/5297\" title=\"\">three campaigners were murdered</a>) to persuade the government to refuse permission for a vast gold mine which threatened to contaminate their water supplies. A victory for democracy? Not for long, perhaps. The Canadian company which sought to dig the mine is now suing El Salvador for $315m – for the loss of its anticipated future profits.</p><p>In Canada, the courts revoked two&nbsp;patents owned by the American drugs firm Eli Lilly, on the grounds that&nbsp;the company had not produced enough evidence that they had the beneficial effects it claimed. Eli Lilly is now <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854\" title=\"\">suing the Canadian government for&nbsp;$500m</a>, and demanding that Canada's patent laws are changed.</p><p>These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing. The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear. Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing. There is no right&nbsp;of appeal on the merits of the&nbsp;case.&nbsp;Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.</p><p>You don't believe it? Here's what one of the judges on these tribunals says about his work. \"When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign&nbsp;states have agreed to investment arbitration at all ... Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.\"</p><p>There are no corresponding rights for&nbsp;citizens. We can't use these tribunals to demand better protections from corporate greed. As the <a href=\"http://democracyctr.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Under_The_Radar_English_Final.pdf\">Democracy Centre</a> says, this is \"a privatised justice system for global corporations\".</p><p>Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: \"I've seen the letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day.\" Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible under these circumstances.</p><p>This is the system to which we will&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject if the transatlantic treaty&nbsp;goes ahead. The US and the European commission, both of which have been captured by the corporations they are supposed to regulate, are pressing for investor-state dispute resolution to be included in the agreement.</p><p>The commission justifies this policy by claiming that domestic courts don't offer corporations sufficient protection because they \"might be biased or lack independence\". Which courts is it talking about? Those of the US? Its own member states? It doesn't say. In fact it fails to produce a single concrete example demonstrating the need for a new, extrajudicial system. It is precisely because our courts are generally not biased or lacking independence that the corporations want to bypass them. The EC seeks to replace open, accountable, sovereign courts with a closed, corrupt system riddled with conflicts of interest and arbitrary powers.</p><p>Investor-state rules could be used to smash any attempt to save the NHS from corporate control, to re-regulate the banks, to curb the greed of the energy companies, to renationalise the railways, to leave fossil fuels in the ground. These rules shut down democratic alternatives. They outlaw leftwing politics.</p><p>This is why there has been no attempt by the UK government to inform us about this monstrous assault on democracy, let alone consult us. This is why the Conservatives who huff and puff about sovereignty are silent. Wake up, people we're being shafted.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a>.

        "headline":"Michael Gove's new GCSE exams leave pupils without a second chance",
        "body":"<p>It is a talent of the prime minister to appear as a reasonable guy and one saying we have heard on occasion from him seems to encapsulate that. \"I believe in second chances,\" he says.</p><p>But that all rings a bit hollow as schools digest the latest machination from the exams regulator Ofqual, doing the bidding of his endlessly energetic, deeply ideological education secretary Michael Gove.</p><p>With the announcement of yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/01/gcse-exam-shakeup-includes-international-benchmarking\" title=\"\">another new regime for GCSEs</a> – a new grading system for English and Maths, the move away from modular testing, coursework, tiering and the future reliance on an O-level style eggs-in-one basket summer examination – the education secretary sets himself against second chances for 16-year-olds. He seems more interested in the tougher GCSE as a nervewracking penalty shoot out. One false move and that's that.</p><p>Teachers I know view the changes with exasperation. It is hard to argue with the new, especially when the boss casts you as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\" title=\"\">\"the Blob\"</a> and critics collectively as \"enemies of progress\". But the move from modular testing is a particular bugbear.  \"Politicians are expecting a level of infallibility from pupils that they hardly display themselves,\" noted a senior teacher I spoke to. \"It's not as if politicians never mess things up on a specific day or at the dispatch box. They seem much more forgiving of themselves.\"</p><p>And it's not just the detail of today's announcement that sinks the spirit. It is the fact of another announcement – this one billed as the<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24759476\" title=\"\"> \"biggest change in a generation\"</a> by the chief executive of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey; another set of changes to sit aside all of the other Gove-ite initiatives. Last year, Gove announced the death of GCSEs and their replacement with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/17/gcse-exams-replaced-ebacc-michael-gove\" title=\"\">English Baccalaureate</a> certificates, with each subject to be set by a single exam board. That wheeze fell apart before the ink was dry. There was also the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/16/michael-gove-gcses-o-levels-reform\" title=\"\">return of O-levels</a>; another false start.</p><p>How to plan? How to locate equilibrium when government initiatives arrive out of a clear blue sky, unwanted and brimming with menace? How to be confident amid the turmoil already visited on many good schools by the Gove hit squad that is <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofsted</a>. Gove sees the discombobulation as proof that he has the Blob on the back foot. And of course he has the whip hand. But to bully is not to lead.</p><p>It's a recurring ailment of this coalition. It talks endlessly of clearing a path so that experts can serve the public with their expertise – without hindrance from bureaucrats; so ordinary people can take the reins and communities can decide their destinies. And then, by deed, it shows itself to be every bit as keen on centralisation and meddling and diktat as New Labour ever was. Gove is perhaps the worst. The fact that the Lib Dems are largely signed up to his war on the Blob allows him more room for baleful intervention than that enjoyed by similarly ideological driven colleagues.</p><p>And yet the same malady seriously afflicts the health secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/29/lewisham-hospital-jeremy-hunt-unlawful\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, at once imploring NHS trusts to grow up and run their own lives and then telling them how they should be run, who they should employ and how much they should pay them. And then there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/16/eric-pickles-regulate-landlords-letting-agents\" title=\"\">Eric Pickles</a>, the communities secretary, who seems to overdose on Michael Heseltine's notion that a secretary of state should be prepared to intervene \"before breakfast, before lunch and before dinner\". Pickles, the great champion of local democracy, hectors local councils about how much they pay their employees, which tenants they should house first, how they communicate with the local populace and how often they empty the bins.</p><p>Against that backdrop schools prepare for a brave new world of GCSEs, knowing that before long the world will change once again. And again. There are plenty of second chances for Gove and co.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421442418|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|52abea763b4b434bfe0eb538b73b0ccb687a97c4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Something awful happened to me last week while I was playing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/grand-theft-auto-5-review\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> (GTA). As usual, I was hijacking a car; either because I wanted to escape the police or because my other car was parked about 50ft away and I couldn't be bothered to walk over to it. It doesn't matter which.</p><p>However, this time the driver happened to be an old lady. A sweet old lady who pleaded with me not to hurt her as I pulled her frail body from her seat. That car was probably the only thing that still allowed her some degree of independence, I realised. The insurance company would probably dick her around, too. It might take her months to get the car replaced. And that's if she even had the confidence to return to the wheel at all, which she probably wouldn't.</p><p>Robbing the old lady, even though I knew she was just a lump of pixels, made me feel terrible. What sort of monster had I become? Appalled at myself, I gave her the car back and let her drive away in it.</p><p>I am rubbish at GTA 5. I think I'm just a bit too Guardian for it.</p><p>There have been other instances of this. I've only ever robbed one shop, and that was only when the game made me. I won't do it willingly due to a misguided belief that you should support the local businessman. I routinely get shot dead on missions because I don't like the idea of topping up my health meter with sugary snacks made from processed foods. I'm barely even skimming what the game has to offer, and it's all because I'm a woolly, liberal, cartoon joke.</p><p>This sounds like comic exaggeration, but I promise it isn't. If the game controller's R3 button allowed you to leave an apologetic note on the windscreen of the car you've just accidentally bumped into, then that's how I'd spend 95% of my time.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. When the first top-down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/18/dan-houser-grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">GTA game was released in 1997</a>, I was as recklessly immoral as they come. Back then I'd quite happily flamethrower a line of dancing Hare Krishnas for a giggle. But now that I've grown up into a hand-wringing, left-leaning ninny I've found myself trying to play the game as responsibly as I can. Like someone's mum would.</p><p>Playing GTA Online only makes this worse. The story mode makes you do a number of terrible things but that's fine because you're controlling a fictional character. But online, when I'm controlling a character who looks like me – albeit a skinnier, more attractive version of me – everything changes. For want of a better word, playing GTA Online turns me into a yellowbellied nancypants.</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm alone in being crippled by this sense of social responsibility, too. When you play GTA Online, you can hear everyone else, and in my experience all the other players are either rapping six-year-old French arsonists or middle-aged men who only stop trying to murder me as gratuitously as possible in order to shout swearwords at their newborn babies.</p><p>And yet, despite all this, I'll keep playing. Because the beauty of GTA is that it's set in such a perfectly realised world that nobody ever has to compromise their ideals if they don't want to. There are plenty of other things to do within the game. So let's hear it for GTA 5: the most expensive biking around a mountaintop while listening to Eddie Murphy simulator that there has ever been.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629670|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|b17dc2e5b97cac437e006a26d02ae61f380448e5 -->",

        "headline":"Ukip has chanced upon the neglected part of British politics",
        "body":"<p>What most political parties' election teams wouldn't give to know precisely what makes a person consider voting Ukip. Facile explanations about the surge of Ukip support being exclusively about Europe have been comprehensively dismissed in <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2012/12/the-ukip-threat-is-not-about-europe/\" title=\"\">extensive research</a> commissioned by Lord Ashcroft. It showed that Britain's relationship with Europe was the top issue for only, roughly, a quarter of the people considering Ukip. And yet the surge in support is a phenomenon that remains, to paraphrase Churchill, a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside the enigma that is Nigel Farage. The results of a new YouGov poll conducted on behalf of the thinktank Class <a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/news/latest/new-class-yougov-poll-released-today-shows-that-most-people-are-not-benefit\" title=\"\">provide some surprising clues</a>.</p><p>In a series of questions relating to a variety of areas, from energy prices and rent control to public ownership of railways and banking reform, the poll found that voters who intend to back Ukip supported state intervention, consistently and by a significant margin. These results are in marked contrast to the lower percentages seen among Conservative supporters and are closer to Labour voters. For instance, 73% of Ukip supporters chose the proposition &quot;the railway companies should be run in the public sector&quot; as expressing their views, compared with 79% of Labour and only 52% of Conservative.</p><p>This pattern is broadly replicated. &quot;The government should have the power to control energy prices&quot;: 83% Ukip, 86% Lab, 60% Con; &quot;The government should have the power to control private sector rents&quot;: 50% Ukip, 56% Lab, 32% Con; &quot;The energy companies should be run in the public sector&quot;: 73% Ukip, 79% Labour, 52% Con. YouGov warns that people &quot;should be careful about reading too much into a sub-sample&quot;, but notwithstanding that caveat they can be &quot;confident in saying that Ukip voters do seem to be more supportive of price controls and nationalisation than their rightwing image might suggest&quot;.</p><p>How does this help our understanding of the current political landscape? The concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass\" title=\"\">&quot;political compass&quot;</a> is useful here. The idea behind it is simply this: a horizontal, linear left-to-right nexus of economic ideology is no longer sufficient to express the complex relationship between parties and the voters they court. It is necessary to consider a vertical axis of libertarian to authoritarian (or statist). This, in effect, creates four quadrants, as the figure below shows.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-421455680\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383305693607/Political-chart-001.jpg\" alt=\"Political chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"502\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Political chart</figcaption></figure><p>Broadly speaking, the way in which each of the three main parties presents itself places it in one of three quadrants (albeit converged towards the centre) as an offering; Conservative in the libertarian right, Liberal Democrat in the libertarian left, Labour in the authoritarian left. I say this fully accepting that during this era, in which opinion polls seem to determine leadership rather than the other way around, all parties cherry-pick policies which are distinctly outside their quadrant. I also accept that the way in which a party portrays itself before an election and the way in which it acts in power, are often incongruous – the Liberal Democrats representing for many the most obvious example at present.</p><p>It would seem a possibility worth considering that Ukip has planted itself within the authoritarian right quadrant, which was previously largely unrepresented in British politics. This may explain why research into byelections found that a notable slice of Ukip support hadn't voted at all recently. Certainly, there seems to be an element of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2286303/A-plague-houses-Voters-turn-main-parties-UKIP-breakthrough.html\" title=\"\">general disillusionment with traditional politics</a>. However, it would be fascinating to explore further this notion that Ukip may have chanced upon this fourth quadrant.</p><p>I say &quot;chanced upon&quot; because I don't think there is any element of political strategic genius at work in this formulation. Rather, as I've explained before, Ukip flagrantly pilfers the most unpopular policies from both Labour and the Conservatives and frames them in a negative manner, making its manifesto a &quot;bucket list&quot; for the annoyed and offering easy, uncosted solutions. Scared of immigrants? Vote Ukip. Insecure about the financial crisis? Vote Ukip. Hate the smoking ban, energy companies, HS2, Brussels, travellers, burqas, tax, Boris, debt, wind farms, bankers, quangos, foreign aid, crime, Abu Qatada, tuition fees, lazy people, Muslims, foreigners, the hunting ban? Vote Ukip.</p><p>The result of that scattered approach, however, may be that Ukip has somehow stumbled upon virgin territory that perfectly fits their nationalist identity; the vote of people naturally leaning towards the authoritarian right.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421450083|2013-11-01T16:45:19Z|1c52b258ba135fbe9027132209ec980128f487b6 -->",

Mubarak's biggest crime was presiding over a police state for 30 years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/14/hosni-mubarak-trial-resumes-egypt\" title=\"\">But he wasn't tried for that</a>. Morsi's was a betrayal of the democratic values that brought him to power, but the charges against him say nothing of the sort. In Egypt's penal code no such acts are prohibited.</p><p>And just as Mubarak's laws got him off the hook, the same, unreformed laws may very well be used to nail Morsi. Only a new legal framework could have laid the foundation for a fair and transparent judicial process. But for selfish reasons neither the military who took over from Mubarak in 2011 nor Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood when it was in power, pursued this course of action. Instead, Egypt's leaders – of whatever ideological hue – continue to refuse to learn from other countries, or from their own mistakes.</p><p>Egypt is in a quagmire. The blame rests squarely on the shoulders of its old political class (the Islamists as well as the secularists) who have followed their narrow interests at the expense of everyone else. Either all or nothing.</p><p>Morsi's brief and defiant appearance in court (he reportedly told the judge \"I am the legitimate president\", and refused to wear the white prison uniform) confirmed what many feared. The Muslim Brotherhood is determined to fight on. Clashes between its supporters and police in Cairo and Alexandria may very well escalate and turn bloody.  Against the good advice of some of their best friends, the Brotherhood's leaders refuse to see that every demonstration, jammed road or disrupted trip on the Cairo underground serves only to swell the ranks of their enemies and detractors.</p><p>For a people who have endured all kinds of despots for centuries, the trials of two ousted presidents are truly seismic events, leading inevitably to instability and uncertainty. Is there anything the outside world can do to help?</p><p>On the political front, any mediation by the EU or others would only make matters worse. It would raise the Brotherhood's hopes that its daily disruption of public life is bearing fruit, and that someone will come to its rescue – which is patently not the case. The widespread perception in Egypt that the EU has been pressuring the interim government on the Brotherhood's behalf has infuriated public opinion, hardening the nationalist belief that it is a treasonous organisation soliciting foreign intervention in Egypt's internal affairs.</p><p>However, trade and revitalised tourism could inject hope where politics appears to spread despair. The outside world can offer assistance on how to reform Egypt's dysfunctional state machinery. Otherwise the Egyptians are better left to work out their political differences on their own.</p><p>Healing Egypt's political wounds will not be easy, because the divisions are multilayered and no longer limited to the simple binary of Islamists versus seculars. There is a third group that wants to work outside this polarisation, and a fourth that clings on to the military as the saviours. Add to all this the stalwarts of the old Mubarak regime: powerful people determined to preserve the state that served them so well.</p><p>It's perhaps no longer realistic to expect any major overhaul of the legal system or the police – longstanding demands of the revolution. Putting Morsi and Mubarak behind bars will not end Egypt's political turmoil. The interim government has in fact responded to such demands by creating a <a href=\"http://www.mei.edu/content/transitional-justice-egypts-way-forward\" title=\"\">minister for transitional justice</a> – but the new official, whose name is hardly known to anyone in Egypt, has so far done virtually nothing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421643614|2013-11-05T11:22:59Z|d2b32ddeca47d308dd422cb358ac7c2cbb344ba4 -->",
