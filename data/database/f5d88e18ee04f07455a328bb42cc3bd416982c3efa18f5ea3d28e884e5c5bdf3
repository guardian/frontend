But a first-time novelist who has just completed an online course in creative writing and likes to work from a VW campervan called Skye perched on the cliffs of the north Cornish coast is in the running for the prestigious award.</p> <p>“I had no expectations that it would be published or that anyone would review it let alone that it would make the Man Booker longlist,” said Wyl Menmuir, whose book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/many.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Many</a> is a strange, troubling mix of mystery, horror, sci-fi and suspense set in an isolated fishing village on a contaminated sea. </p> <p> Menmuir, a 36-year-old father-of-two, did not bother taking the initial call telling him he had made the list because he was having coffee with his 90-year-old grandmother, and when the news finally reached him, he expressed shock and disbelief that he was even in the same competition as one of his heroes, JM Coetzee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManBookerPrize/status/758276334959390720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congrats <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wylmenmuir\">@Wylmenmuir</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saltpublishing\">@saltpublishing</a> on making <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ManBooker2016?src=hash\">#ManBooker2016</a> longlist with The Many <a href=\"https://t.co/cDm3bcYhU1\">pic.twitter.com/cDm3bcYhU1</a></p>&mdash; Man Booker Prize (@ManBookerPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManBookerPrize/status/758276334959390720\">July 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> But when he sat down for an interview with the Guardian he seemed to be getting used to the idea. “The book is everything I wanted it to be. I have belief in it. I’m thrilled to be on the list,” he said. </p> <p> Menmuir, a literacy consultant and freelance editor, should be an inspiration for anyone who has dreams of writing a book but feels they don’t have time. </p> <p>He decided he wanted to be a writer when he was six or seven and met the author Robert Westall, best known for his second world war novel The Machine Gunners. “I realised there was a person who had actually written that book. He was an ordinary guy like me and maybe I could do that.” </p> <p>But Menmuir was in his early 30s when he tentatively began what became The Many at <a href=\"http://www.arvon.org/retreats/\">the Arvon centre in Devon</a>, a manor house retreat, where he took a course called Starting To Write Fiction. </p> <p>He carried on with it as part of his long-distance masters degree at Manchester Metropolitan University and finished with the support and wise counsel of fellow members of the global authors’ community <a href=\"https://www.write-track.co.uk/about/\">Write Track</a>, who kept him on course. He also used an app that allows a writer to monitor their progress to get him across the finishing line. </p> <p>“I need someone to tell me: ‘Come on, you’ve got to finish it’. There’s too many reasons not to finish, other work, family, kids – things that are easier than writing a novel.” </p> <p> It helped hugely when his wife, Emma, got a job at Truro high school for girls and the family moved from London to Cornwall three years ago. “It’s brilliant for writing. You get a lot more headspace. It meant I could spend a lot of time travelling to fishing communities like Newlyn, Mousehole and Cadgwith. I did a lot of talking to fishermen about the minutiae of what they do – the nets they use, the fish they are pulling out, what would be the case if this or that happened in the sea.”</p> <p> He has imbued his book with the oddness of some of these communities. “They are picturesque places but there’s an edge there as well. Cadgwith, for example, is full of second homes and it’s quite a strange place to be out of season.”</p> <p> A sense of being on the fringe is also important to the book – hence his penchant for writing in Skye, the campervan at the water’s edge. </p> <p>“Sometimes I’ll take the van down to the beach or up on to the cliffs, away from people, away from the internet and sit on the floor and write. Being close to the sea is important to me and was important to the novel. I wanted to get that sense of being right on the edge of something.” </p> <p>He was surprised when he finished The Many and amazed when it was taken up and released this summer by the small independent Salt Publishing, which is also based on a coast, the Norfolk one. </p> <p>Menmuir has started his next book. “It’s very different but it’s starting to take shape. I’m exploring ideas and I’ve got a couple of short stories on the go.” </p> <p>And if he were to beat Coetzee and the 11 others on the longlist and win the Booker? “It would be unreal. There are those things you don’t dare to dream. Winning the Booker is one of those things I wouldn’t have dared dream of. If it did happen there would be a degree of excitement involved … That’s an understatement.”</p> <p>

He was charismatic and handsome, with many mistresses, and put on a great show. But something is missing","byline":"Philip Hensher","body":"<p>Liszt is wonderful and unique, but you would not know it from the hapless subtitle to this study by Oliver Hilmes. A biography of a major cultural figure should not start by sounding like a performing arts undergraduate describing themself on Twitter. And without meaning any disrespect, this must be regarded as an unnecessary book. The weight of biographical commentary on Liszt is simply colossal. People have been writing full-length accounts of him since he was in his early 20s, and touring 1830s Europe. The first biographies written with the declared aim of stripping away accumulated myths appeared within Liszt’s lifetime, and have gone on being published ever since. Besides, in very recent times, he has been the subject of a truly great biography, Alan Walker’s astonishing and gloriously entertaining three-volume study, still in print. Oliver Hilmes wrote a very good life of Liszt’s appalling daughter, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/cosima-wagner.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Cosima Wagner</a>; I must say that I think his abilities would have been better directed elsewhere.</p> <p>Liszt was not the first touring virtuoso, but he was certainly someone who attracted vast interest due to his good looks, showy abilities and constant powers of reinvention. There is really no modern-day equivalent, though we pretend otherwise, and suggest that someone working in 4/4 in E minor is doing something never attempted before. If you could imagine a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lang-lang\">Lang Lang</a>’s virtuosity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/justin-timberlake\">Justin Timberlake</a>’s mass appeal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jul/30/per-norgard-contemporary-music-guide\">Per Nørgård</a>’s sheer confrontational newness, then something of Liszt could be envisaged. But it is impossible: circumstances have changed too much.</p> <p>The outlines of the story are impressive enough. His father touted him round Europe as a child, when he made considerable impact as a virtuoso and a composer. At 11, he contributed a variation to a project of the publisher Diabelli, the one that casually spawned a masterpiece by Beethoven. His father died early, and Liszt, at 15, took himself in hand. By the time he was 20, he was making a name for himself in Paris. He moved comfortably between the established aristocratic salons and more public performances. The scale and unprecedented force of his playing demanded stronger technology from piano makers – his recitals often required two pianos, as the first was likely to be destroyed in performance. We can only guess at the effects of his playing, but the piano music he was writing in the 1830s and 1840s gives a sense of his boldness. The sonorities are extraordinary, and the demands on the player still terrifying today (even Liszt had to retreat somewhat from some of the challenges he mounted in the 1840s). There is, too, the fascination of his effect on his society: he was charismatic and beautiful, and the list of his mistresses is long.</p> <p>There is a compelling mixture of the visionary genius and the utter charlatan in Liszt. Some of his most interesting pieces are also the most vulgar, such as the brilliant fantasies on operatic themes from <em>Norma</em>, <em>Rigoletto</em> and (for some, unforgivably) <em>Don Giovanni</em>. But there is a strange paradox here: the transcendental climaxes he so specialised in as a composer remain gloriously stagey, an apt accompaniment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/08/john-martin-painting-the-apocalypse\">John Martin</a>’s apocalyptic paintings. Nothing in Liszt matches the mystical inwardness of Chopin’s <em>Polonaise-Fantaisie</em>; his masterpieces are weirdly sincere and transparent in their calculations.</p> <p>Those masterpieces came thick and fast in the strangest period of Liszt’s career, his acceptance of the archaic post of <em>kapellmeister</em> at the tiny court of Weimar. He no doubt took the post because of the historical associations with culture at its most idealistic. What he found was a tiny court with few resources, a town of crippling conventionality and an immediate hostility to himself and his type. The apparent justification for Hilmes’s biography is the examination of some Weimar state papers, which, in fact, merely confirm what previous biographers had surmised about official attitudes to the composer and his menage. The pay was derisory (Liszt referred to it, without the slightest exaggeration, as paying for his cigars); the requirement to dress up in archaic dress was humiliating. But somehow Weimar represents Liszt at his greatest.</p> <p>There are two aspects of his personality that make him immensely sympathetic. He had very little jealousy towards other major creative figures, though Chopin, Schumann, Brahms and even Wagner did not always respond to him so generously. He supported the development not only of these major figures, but of fascinating minor ones such as Joachim Raff and Peter Cornelius, and any number of great pianists. Second, he very much liked intelligent women – an entranced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot\">George Eliot</a> gives a vivid account of him – and in the Weimar era, set up with one of the most interesting minds of the period, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/carolyne-zu-sayn-wittgenstein-mn0001725802\">Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein</a>. Most biographers like Sayn-Wittgenstein much less than Liszt did, and many, until recently, rushed to mock the fact that she wrote an enormous historical account of the Roman Catholic church. Hilmes acknowledges her cleverness and her bad luck, but, alas, rushes to express his incredulity that a man such as Liszt should settle for a first-rate mind when it isn’t attached to feminine pulchritude.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a39646708ef2a0c44a6d29a7e2bd138453d52758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a39646708ef2a0c44a6d29a7e2bd138453d52758/0_0_6000_7393/812.jpg\" alt=\"George Eliot\" width=\"812\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Eliot was quite taken by Liszt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the Weimar period, Liszt transformed music. The 12 remarkable symphonic poems showed how malleable musical form could be, dissolving rather than firmly concluding; modernity was born in Liszt’s most daring harmonic developments and in his ongoing experiments with sonority and performing technique. Much of his creative work, after the virtuoso period, is fascinating rather than fully achieved, but the great work of others, from <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> to Brahms’s <em>Paganini Variations</em> is hardly conceivable without him. In old age, his creative work thinned out further into cryptic miniatures, some easy enough for a child to play; in bagatelles such as <em>Nuages Gris</em>, the <em>Bagatelle Without Tonality</em> and <em>La Lugubre Gondola</em> the revolutions Schoenberg would work out, 30 years in the future, have already taken place.</p> <p>This is very much a biography directed towards people interested in Liszt’s life, and not what matters, his music. There are no music examples, and quite why the <em>B Minor Sonata</em>, for instance, is an “important piece”, “masterly” and yet, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Clara Schumann</a>, without any “wholesome thought” must be guessed at by the reader. Some of the translator’s work seems off the mark – I don’t think Sayn‑Wittgenstein, on her first appearance, can be described as “this portentous princess” – but other curious misapprehensions must be Hilmes’s own. He says that Liszt’s unusually large hands “enabled him to perform wide leaps”; the size of someone’s hands might enable the player to render a widespread chord, but could hardly have any effect on the capacity to perform leaps. There are plenty of things in Liszt that sound impressive but aren’t actually very difficult (I don’t think the <em>Sonata</em> becomes truly terrifying until the octave passages very near the end). What is required of the biographer is the understanding of exactly what Liszt was conquering, and an ability to separate legerdemain, flirtatious charlatanry and even noisy footling from the awesome substance. For this, I recommend Walker’s book, a triumph of understanding and complex sympathy.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>Franz Liszt</em><strong> </strong>for £20.50 (£25) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/franz-liszt-409967.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

It creates a<br />marvellously tense atmosphere and keeps you guessing throughout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f0a0057b168ba450a9411302ecb6615f3aab0af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0a0057b168ba450a9411302ecb6615f3aab0af/0_0_622_1000/622.jpg\" alt=\"Hot Milk by Deborah Levy\" width=\"622\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Other books I recommend for the summer (although not on the Man Booker list) include the much-hyped The Girls by Emma Cline – a book that even comes with the approval of Lena Dunham. I loved the descriptive language and the way it perfectly captures the insecurity of youth. It reminded me of that desperate teenage yearning to have a place in the world. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"689a5a691902fcb075482d2b58327c0defb7b33d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/689a5a691902fcb075482d2b58327c0defb7b33d/0_0_1680_2560/656.jpg\" alt=\"emma cline - the girls book cover\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The other book I would recommend is All Involved by Ryan Gattis – a very different story indeed about the LA riots in the 1990s. It explores the lives of several different characters who are all somehow caught up in the gang wars of that time. The best way to describe its effect is that it’s like watching a TV documentary in the form of a book. Think The Wire.</p> <p>Finally, right now I’m in the middle of Modern Lovers by Emma Straub, a new novel out this summer that explores contemporary life through the relationship of three college friends who find that their own teenage children are now growing up and having their own sexual relationships. So far I’m only a couple of chapters in, but it’s really entertaining. The characters are complex and likeable, and I am interested in finding out more about their past that has brought them to where they are now. It’s one of those stories that makes you realise that life really does run away from you.<br /></p> <p>We would love to hear what others are reading this summer.

It didn’t take long for British media to catch up. If you haven’t seen the story, the bare bones are that Byron Burgers set up a training meeting that staff were asked to go to, but when they got there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/it-was-a-fake-meeting-byron-hamburgers-staff-on-immigration-raid\">it turned out to be a raid by immigration officers</a>.</p> <p>Our reporters spoke to several members of staff, who wanted to remain anonymous. One said <em>“I feel really sad about this. Everyone is hysterical about immigration. It feels like it must have been in the 1930s or something.”</em></p> <p>Social media was quick to judge the company, and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boycottbyron&amp;src=tyah\">#BoycottByron</a> hashtag sprang up. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DissidentFam/status/756749270842302465\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tdlr: Byron burgers gets dozens of its own employees deported. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottByron?src=hash\">#BoycottByron</a> <br><br>On the 4th of July, workers... <a href=\"https://t.co/cUE4I2sbrg\">https://t.co/cUE4I2sbrg</a></p>&mdash; DissidentFam (@DissidentFam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DissidentFam/status/756749270842302465\">July 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The argument is that it was unethical for the company to collude with immigration authorities in this way, and effectively ship its own staff off to an uncertain future. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/318098661863389/\">A demonstration is planned for Monday</a> outside one of Byron’s London restaurants.</p> <p>The counter argument ran that actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RupertMyers/status/758588828408025088\">it was Byron who had been exploited</a> – by migrants using fake documentation that put the company at risk of legal action, and deprived people who did have the right to work in the UK of jobs. <a href=\"https://thesecretbarrister.com/2016/07/28/what-else-was-byron-burger-supposed-to-do/\">What else was Byron supposed to do?</a></p> <p>The row on Twitter, obviously, became rather embittered, and not safe for lunchtime social viewing.</p> <p>Like many things on social media, it is easy to dismiss the hashtag as “slacktivism” and reducing complex arguments to a few characters.

Or perhaps <a href=\"http://(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaQuest_DSV)\">SeaQuest DSV</a>. There’s something about the very simple notion of man speaking to animal that never fails to captivate. So the news that scientists had proved that wild honeyguide birds were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/21/sweet-talk-wild-birds-and-human-honey-hunters-converse-study-shows\">communicating with local hunters in Mozambique was too good a story to ignore</a>. Jules Howard delved deeper into this phenomenon to look at what made this story so special. It’s pretty much the sole example of animal and human working together for entirely mutual benefit – with neither exploiting the other. “The deal itself is simple. Humans want the honey. The birds want the bee grubs. The bird leads the humans to the honey and both species come out of the deal happier than when they went in. In biological terms, this is mutualism. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/wild-honeyguide-bird-humans-mutualism\">Though humans get something out of it, we are undoubtedly being exploited in the process. And that’s OK.</a>”</p> <p>Of course the dream is that we might go further than this. Anyone who has heard whale song or dolphin chatter cannot fail to be certain that there’s some serious gossiping going on under the sea. Surely it’s not beyond the wit of man to learn how to converse with our cetacean friends? Jules offered little hope of that – although the tale of friendly dolphins in Laguna talking with “head slaps” to the fishermen offered some consolation. Perhaps Darwin – the talking dolphin from SeaQuest – might not be so far-fetched after all.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b48e4e4b00eff095cd8c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T12:16:58.660Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Someone else in the office has a Pokemon on their desk</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c795611c231744cba3e802478da910263c527b04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c795611c231744cba3e802478da910263c527b04/0_0_399_710/281.jpg\" alt=\"pokemon desk\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b47e5e4b075867609e5db\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T12:12:49.163Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What's the most interesting item on your desk?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Loving this submission ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dacb8a88ae430504575f65ed7396aac29412335d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dacb8a88ae430504575f65ed7396aac29412335d/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Desk\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">deskessentials</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/579a0f2ce4b00eff095cd68f\">Add yours to the mix here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579afcb2e4b00eff095cd80f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mark-rice-oxley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T12:03:21.639Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'It was great to see readers piling into our series on Africa’s digital revolution'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Journalist behind our tech in Africa series Mark Rice-Oxley, the Guardian’s head of special projects, shares his views on how it’s so far been received. </em></p> <p>Any Africa correspondent – and not just on this newspaper – will tell you that it can be hard graft. Not just reporting pieces, but getting western audiences to read them.</p> <p>So it has been particularly gratifying to see readers piling into our series on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-tech-continent-africas-digital-renaissance\">Africa’s digital revolution</a>. Project journalism like this sometimes occupies an awkward space in the newsroom. Is it news? Well, not in the technical sense of someone doing something nasty to someone else in a single given moment. But does it tell people things they don’t know? Yes. And in some senses, a snapshot in time like this that pulls together dozens of slow-burn developments and assesses what they mean may contain more “news” than an account of a single event.</p> <p>Readers have been generous, with more than 10,000 shares on the series so far and many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/can-the-internet-reboot-africa\">hundreds of comments</a> and retweets.</p> <p>Some readers are deeply sceptical that technological innovation can bring anything but misery, addiction and Pokémon Go to a continent that hardly needs it:<br />Johann Brandstatter remarked:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What difference is playing games via the Internet on your mobile phone going to make ?</p> </blockquote> <p>Others questioned whether a continent with big problems of infrastructure, corruption and governance can harness the full benefits of the internet and smartphone technology.<br />But some like paddyd2009 took a more optimistic approach:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Africa is the BIG opportunity and smart money is being invested there! </p> <p>Sure fixed electricity is a problem, but sunlight is so abundant that a few solar cells on the roof and battery storage will go a long way. Both are rapidly coming down in price, and the power consumption of mobile phones and tablets is a few watts rather than 100’s of watts for a desktop computer.</p> <p>Dictators may threaten to periodically turn it off, but as smartphones become increasingly common, they can in emergency cases form their own networks, passing information around regardless of government attempts.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The series continues next week.

Despite being in the full throes of summer, or silly season in journalism, the world has been feeling pretty dark of late.</p> <p>Like many journalists I’ve been watching the Republican and Democratic national conventions with interest over the past few weeks. I’ve been thinking a lot about the stories we miss in newsrooms, particularly given how wrong we’ve been when it comes to recent political events in the UK. Brexit has made me think anything is possible, with one of those things being a president Trump.</p> <p>So this week when Michael Moore listed his reasons why he thinks <a href=\"http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/\">Trump will win</a>, I was all ears. But as a data reporter my interests lie in looking at polling data. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html\">presidential prediction model</a> came out last week and is being constantly updated with new polls and ratings of other news outlets. It’s a very similar approach we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/may/07/live-uk-election-results-in-full\">took at the Guardian</a> to predicting the outcome of the 2015 general elections. Though knowing how wrong we got it in the UK with the 2015 and once again with the EU Referendum, my sense is that public opinion has fragmented to the point where perhaps polls aren’t a reliable way of capturing political sentiment.</p> <p>Listening to fellow data reporters, like <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/590/choosing-wrong?act=2#play\">Harry Enten from FiveThirtyEight</a>, talk about how they dismissed the likelihood of Trump getting the Republican nomination only further confirms my concerns when it comes to how out of touch we might be. The gap between the polls and what is <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/trump-us-politics-poor-whites/\">happening on the ground</a> is what worries me more than anything.</p> <p>We can dismiss people with views other than our own too easily. In the UK we were wrong about Brexit, we were verging on complacent during the previous general elections. My sense is we might be off again when it comes to predicting who will win the US election. But, hey, maybe I’ll be wrong about this one too. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T11:55:39.219Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b11c2e4b09895e25091f0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T11:39:30.035Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What's the most interesting item on your desk?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Every week we will challenge you to take a photo of something different and share it with us.

It gets people out on the street, walking, chatting, socialising and exploring, but it’s important to remember: Pokémon Go is just a game and playing it doesn’t mean leaving your common sense at home.</p> <p> • Remember the virtual world is based on the real world. If a Pokémon shows up in a dark alley, think twice before blindly walking down there. Players with their phones out and heads down are being mugged.</p> <p> • Watch where you walk. Roads, cars, people and bikes exist in the real world, even if your Pokémap is a vacant landscape filled only with monsters ripe for capture. Put your head up and don’t cross the road while staring at your phone.</p> <p> • Move in groups. Pokémon pop up just as frequently for your friends as you and there is safety in numbers.

Just to be clear, One Dance first entered the charts in April. Back when the EU referendum campaign had just begun and all we had to worry about was what to get the Queen for her 90th. Simpler, innocent times. </p> <p>This evening we find out if the Canadian rapper’s success continues. If it’s at No 1 in the UK top 40 again, One Dance could beat Bryan Adams’s Everything I Do (I Do It For You), which topped the charts for 16 weeks in 1991. </p> <p>Even though we’re living in a time of huge cultural, societal and political upheaval, the One Dance phenomenon has still managed to ruffle feathers – particularly on one specific message board I stumbled across. One commenter regarded its popularity as an “absolute travesty”. Another proclaimed: “This cannot and must not be allowed to equal Bryan’s record.” </p> <p>They are perhaps upset because of the shift in modern music consumption. One Dance may not feel as ubiquitous as Adams’ single – a song projected from cinema and TV screens, blasted out from car stereos, at weddings, school discos, birthing pools and quite possibly crematoriums. It was so omnipresent that any irritation that first existed simply dissolved into acceptance, then approval, then wild adoration – you found yourself stumbling out of Woolworths one arm carrying a plastic bag filled with copies of CD single and the other cradling a sack of pick N mix. One Dance on the other hand, is being streamed in the millions; but it’s happening at house parties, through headphones. It is a private form of listening, but it is listening, none the less. Of those streaming One Dance on Spotify, 66% are apparently under 25.

Woman got on with two small children and sat in the seats directly across the aisle. Two kids, two electronic devices, both at top volume. After trying to change seats, even checking next carriage, eventually plucked up the courage to ask her, politely, if she could lower the volume. The look I was met with could've turned milk sour, and her attitude was aggressive to say the least. She gave me a mouthful about how I was lucky she wasn't sat right next to me (bit bizarre), I was left feeling embarrassed, volume stayed the same. Small kid then proceeded to have a massive meltdown and screamed his head off. This didn't bother me, kids do this sort of stuff all the time, but her attitude was awful. Just be aware of people around you and have a bit more respect for your fellow commuters.

Nobody wants the baby to cry, least of all the parent, and you can bet the parent will be having a harder time than anyone else on the flight. Giving out apology bags is fine, but it does suggest a society in which parents are immediately blamed and vilified for their children's behavior, even when they are too young to possibly behave in any other way. I think that's sad and that it would be nice if we could expect our fellow members of the public to react with more compassion rather than judgement (which has actually been the case any time I have had to fly with my kids). Giving out apology notes is good karma though, however twee it may be, so nothing wrong with doing it i suppose.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80018371\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1685314\" title=\"View WitNit’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1685314\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for WitNit\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1685314\" title=\"View WitNit’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">WitNit</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80018371\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">27 July 2016 8:08pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The growing intolerance towards children in public spaces in the developed world is a sign of how narcissistic we are becoming as a society (and I am expressly excluding children who are seriously badly behaved or parents who don't care).</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Add your thoughts on this article in the comments on the piece or below the line here. <br /></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T11:25:34.029Z\">at 12.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b1276e4b00eff095cd826\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T11:11:26.092Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Images of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are four images that struck a chord this week, as selected by our picture desk.

Amid the tumult, how many of us have time to look to literature for political insight? Fiction has a hard fight to show it is more useful in terms of dealing with what ails us than Twitter.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, what it means to be human is subject to change, but political novels of dystopia – from Huxley and Orwell to <a href=\"http://\"><em>Riddley Walker</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/handmaid-s-tale.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a> – have always made brave wagers on where we might be headed. And to those who imagine that current affairs have become somehow “stranger than fiction” – there is nothing so very new under the sun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/robert-harris-imperium-why-i-write-political-fiction\">Robert Harris: why I write political fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not to pretend that politics is rendered in fiction as widely or as well as it should be, given its centrality to how we live. Perhaps the problem begins with how novelists – like the rest of us – are both attracted and repulsed by the political world.</p> <p>The attractions are clear: the currents of popular feeling in a democracy, the fraught exercise of power by the few make for fathomless wells of dramatic conflict and thematic richness. Any contest to lead a national political party assumes dimensions we could call Shakespearean, whatever one’s view of the human calibre of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Theresa May or a Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p> <p>All fiction begins in empathy, and a politician is a complex human creature, just like you and me. As Senator Silas Radcliffe, anti-hero of Henry Adams’s 1880 novel <em>Democracy</em>, puts it: “No representative government can long be much better or much worse than the society it represents.” That congruence, too, ought to provide rich pickings for writers; and yet something routinely inhibits them from approaching politicians as subjects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0245b5c23ee0050e641df8fba679ee99d81a25d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0245b5c23ee0050e641df8fba679ee99d81a25d/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shakespearean dimensions … Theresa May’s path to the top</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Quite a few writers – and also their readers – feel somehow duty-bound to be in opposition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some writers just resist the extension of too much empathy towards the powerful – for fear they will have to acknowledge more than the lowest possible motives. The literature of politics abounds with great novels of social protest on behalf of the oppressed and aggrieved, from Charles Dickens and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilezola\">Emile Zola</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Upton Sinclair</a>. It is no coincidence that Marx and Engels rated Balzac as a major materialist. Similarly, we know the dreadfulness of totalitarian regimes – the everyday depravity of the torturer, the snitch and the censor – so much the better for the artistry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mikhail-bulgakov\">Mikhail Bulgakov</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/05/memoirs-revolutionary-victor-serge-review\">Victor Serge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/02/encyclopedia-of-the-dead-danilo-kis-review-fitting-tribute\">Danilo Kiš</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera\">Milan Kundera</a>. But it may be that such exemplars overly condition our idea of where the artist ought to stand in relation to state power.</p> <p>My sense is that quite a few writers – and also their readers – feel somehow duty-bound to be in opposition; and what results is a certain lacuna in our collective imagination. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hanifkureishi\">Hanif Kureishi</a> has lamented that, unlike in Dickens’s time, there is not one contemporary writer with “a sense of the whole society, from prisoner to home secretary”.</p> <p>But there is often a difficulty for writers who adopt an overtly political stance. A novelist may set out purposefully to make a book that furthers a cause, but it is not likely to be any good, since good books don’t carry messages like sacks carry coal. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonytrollope\">Anthony Trollope</a>’s great fictional prime minister Plantagenet Palliser put it: “The idea that political virtue is all on one side is both mischievous and absurd.” Even writers who see this clearly may feel overburdened by the binary narrowness of tribal political feeling, how it can thwart the regard for human ambiguities that a novel ought to possess.</p> <p>There are, of course, two main and vying definitions of “politics” alive in our popular speech. Many people refer readily to “my politics”, meaning a set of values they claim to live by. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/10/saulbellow\">Saul Bellow</a> once proposed a dyspeptic paraphrase of this mindset: “We’re for all the good things, and against all the bad.”) But there is also politics as the Bismarckian “art of the possible” that we must call on since we don’t agree but are required to compromise. Such artistry, though, appears not to inspire a great many artists.</p> <p>Interestingly, some of the major literary exceptions to this rule – Trollope, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/10/culture.obituaries\">Norman Mailer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/01/gore-vidal-dies\">Gore Vidal</a> – have put themselves to the test of standing for elected office, albeit unsuccessfully. Political journalism, in its proximity to high office, has also bred insightful fiction. After the journalist Billy Lee Brammer did time on the staff of Texas senator L<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/robert-schenkkan-lyndon-b-johnson-all-the-way-bryan-cranston\">yndon Johnson</a>, he crafted a remarkable <em>roman à clef</em> from it, <a href=\"http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/bragap\"><em>The Gay Place</em></a> (1961). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-harris\">Robert Harris</a>’s trilogy about the statesman-orator Cicero – showing how a shrewd man armed with a lawyer’s gift for a stirring speech might attain power in ancient Rome – testifies to the acumen Harris acquired at the BBC and the Observer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96dca9f9d0b22365652bcf161aa9e6208293ba38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dca9f9d0b22365652bcf161aa9e6208293ba38/0_0_3925_2583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Mailer during his campaign to become New York City mayor, June 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Mailer during his campaign for New York City mayor, June 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Boenzi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But to my mind the greatest of all political novels is <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/robert-penn-warren\">Robert Penn Warren</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/29/100-best-novels-all-the-kings-men-robert-penn-warren\"><em>All The King’s Men</em></a> (1946), patterned after the real-life rise and fall of demagogic Louisiana governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\">Huey “Kingfish” Long</a>. Its protagonist Willie Stark, like all thoughtful conservatives, knows himself to be a fallen creature (“Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption,” he drawls). Yet in power, Stark consecrates himself to a populist improvement of the lives of the poor, albeit by routinely disreputable means – he gives away only a shade more than he steals. When Stark’s hypocrisies are called out by an honest adversary, he doesn’t miss a beat in his defence: “You got to make good out of bad. That’s all there is to make it with.” Yet Stark has no answer as to how he arrives at his philosophy. He is hazarding shots in the dark – as, more often than not, we all must.</p> <p>Penn Warren’s magisterial work gives us a lesson in facing up to the tragic element inevitably bound up in so much political decision-making. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">Friedrich Dürrenmatt</a>, Swiss author of brooding philosophical crime stories, articulates this adroitly in <em>The Quarry</em> (1951) when a villain declares that our human fate is not to know “what actions will result from our obedience or our revolt, what crime adheres to the fruit we eat”.</p> <p>The moral-political drama of consequences unforeseen – perhaps what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-rumsfeld\">Donald Rumsfeld</a> meant by “unknown unknowns” – is nowhere better framed in fiction than in Tolstoy’s late novella <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/243/243-h/243-h.htm\"><em>The Forged Coupon</em></a>, published posthumously in 1911. A feckless youth amends by hand a voucher on a government bond and fobs it off for change in a shop; that false note is passed on to a peasant firewood seller, who soon finds himself in an awful predicament. The ripples of the original sin widen, and evil begets evil; but Tolstoy, in his eminence, also shows us people in the teeth of adversity realising what their souls are for. At the end of the chain, a woman writes to the tsar of Russia begging clemency for her husband’s murderers. But the executions have happened already. Although the tsar’s conscience is troubled, he will not change, for his office doesn’t permit him to. “… he could not give himself up to the demands of the human being,” writes Tolstoy, “because of all the demands that are made on a tsar from every side; as for admitting that the demands of the human being might be more binding than the demands made on him as a tsar – he did not have the strength to do that.”</p> <p>The obligations on Tolstoy’s tsar bind our elected politicians no less. Whenever I reread <em>The Forged Coupon</em>, I am reminded of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a>’s comment that the dilemma of Pontius Pilate constitutes “a timeless parable of political life”, in its contest over whether to “do what appears principled or what is politically expedient”. Tolstoy understood that dilemma just as he understood a million other things. He saw it as deeply human, and not wholly resolvable – not in this life. Tolstoy speaks to our time as he spoke to his. No part of our present crises would be strange to him.</p> <p>• Richard T Kelly’s novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/knives-435047.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>The Knives</em></a> is published by Faber on 4 August.</p>","wordcount":"1342","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-05T12:05:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4p8ke","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb0e8fea1368db5a0550cc1d098884d4b86b22f/0_87_3000_1800/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/politics","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/point-of-view","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Point of view","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/point-of-view","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/point-of-view","references":[],"description":"A personal opinion from the world of books and ideas"},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/review","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"tone","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/richard-t-kelly","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Richard T Kelly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-t-kelly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/richard-t-kelly","references":[],"bio":"<p>Richard T Kelly is a writer and author of the novels Crusaders (2008) and The Possessions of Doctor Forrest (2011), and the authorised biography Sean Penn: His Life and Times (2004).

forgotten, out-of-print history book from 1929 has sold out across the internet after it was praised by Elon Musk.</p> <p>The Tesla chief executive and billionaire <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-28/musk-s-reading-list-reflects-his-own-battle-against-the-gods\">told Bloomberg on Thursday</a> that he was currently reading a book called Twelve Against the Gods by William Bolitho. “It’s really quite good,” Musk added, sending the price of the now obscure text up from $6.35 (£4.82) on Amazon.com for a secondhand paperback edition, to $99.99, before it sold out at the online retailer. Shortly after, used books marketplace Abebooks reported that it had also sold out, with the 13 copies available quickly snapped up and Bolitho’s book the most sought for on the site all day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eac2ea3148df539997e87b8d7be897a9e152d7ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac2ea3148df539997e87b8d7be897a9e152d7ac/0_6_600_904/332.jpg\" alt=\"Twelve Against the Gods by William Bolitho\" width=\"332\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musk-read … Twelve Against the Gods by William Bolitho.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abebooks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twelve Against the Gods, by former Manchester Guardian correspondent Bolitho, is a series of sketches of the lives of 12 figures from history, including Casanova, Napoleon, Woodrow Wilson and Alexander the Great. It is, runs its description, “intended to elucidate history somewhat, more to illustrate it, to honour without hypocrisy the deeds of men and women whose destiny was larger, if not deeper than our own”.</p> <p>“We had only 13 copies available at the start of Wednesday and all of them have sold, including a copy for $99. Twelve Against the Gods was easily the top search term on AbeBooks.com yesterday [Thursday]. I am positive we would have sold many more copies if they had been available,” said spokesperson Richard Davies. “When we have less than 15 copies of a particular book then it’s safe to say that it’s pretty obscure. We had not sold a single copy this year until Musk revealed he was reading it.”</p> <p>Bolitho was born in 1890 and <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807E5DD1238E03ABC4C53DFB066838B629EDE&amp;legacy=true#\">died aged 39, in 1930</a>. He fought during the first world war, where he survived being blown up by a mine and buried alive. After the war, he became the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, where he encountered <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iyCMAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+hemingway+collection&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqsvCfqpjOAhVIJsAKHbj-CsMQ6wEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20hemingway%20collection&amp;f=false\">Ernest Hemingway</a>, at that time a fellow journalist. Hemingway later wrote that he “had a white, lantern-jawed face of the sort that is supposed to haunt you if seen suddenly in a London fog, but on a bright windy day in Paris meeting him on the boulevard wearing a long fur-collared great coat he had the never-far-from-tragic look of a ham Shakespearean actor”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/may/25/elon-musk-entrepreneur-observer-profile\">Elon Musk: the new It Boy of Silicon Valley | The Observer profile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“None of us thought of him as a genius then and I do not think he thought of himself as one either, being too busy, too intelligent, and, then, too sardonic to go in for being a genius in a city where they were a nickel a dozen and it was much more distinguished to be hard-working,” added Hemingway.</p> <p>Noël Coward, with whom Bolitho was also friends, wrote of him that “of all the minds I had ever encountered, his, I think, was the richest and most loving”. Coward dedicated his play Post Mortem to Bolitho, who would die two years later of peritonitis.</p>","wordcount":"492","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-04T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4p9c2","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/73070bad55e9d1b00267d3d03094de964ef93d31/34_260_5423_3254/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/booksellers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Booksellers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksellers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksellers","references":[]},{"id":"technology/elon-musk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Elon Musk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/elon-musk","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/amazon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webTitle":"Amazon.com","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/amazon","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alison Flood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"flood"}],"elements":[{"id":"73070bad55e9d1b00267d3d03094de964ef93d31","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/73070bad55e9d1b00267d3d03094de964ef93d31/34_260_5423_3254/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Napoleon en route to his exile on St Helena, painted by Sir William Quiller Orchardson.

It is about a notorious literary hoax, from an era when misery memoirs were all the rage. Ten years ago, the bestselling young author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/20/jt-leroy-story-modern-literary-hoax-\">JT LeRoy</a> – supposedly the son of a prostitute, writing harrowing fiction avowedly based on his horrific childhood – turned out to be a woman called Laura Albert. But was that a hoax? Didn’t Mary Ann Evans claim to be a man called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/12/road-to-middlemarch-george-eliot-review\">George Eliot</a>? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/20/jt-leroy-story-modern-literary-hoax-\">JT LeRoy unmasked: the extraordinary story of a modern literary hoax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albert was a troubled woman who had suffered abuse and found escapist release in phoning crisis helplines in assumed voices and fictional personae. She was also a talented writer and voracious reader, and through in-character fan phonecalls to authors, got an agent for her agonised faux-naïf southern gothic material, written by this mythical figure she’d dreamed up. The extraordinary twist came when Albert persuaded her sister-in-law Savannah Knoop to pose as the mysterious, reclusive author in wig and dark glasses for readings. Her cult following included celebrities such as Gus van Sant, Bono and Asia Argento, none too pleased to be hoodwinked, and Albert finally got a fraud conviction for signing a movie deal as “JT LeRoy”. </p> <p>It’s a strange story. Unlike James Frey’s fake memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/08/books.usa\">A Million Little Pieces</a> from 2003, Albert’s “LeRoy” work was at least billed as fiction – though with the promise of being based on truth. The film is curious, featuring apparently genuine tape-recordings of phone conversations that “LeRoy” had with her acolytes and friends. She doesn’t say why she made secret tape-recordings, and isn’t asked. Are these recordings real? Or a reconstruction – yet another fictional construct? The key question is: how did Savannah feel about living a lie? Knoop is only interviewed very briefly. The rest of the time, it’s Laura Albert monologuing. She’s a little tiresome and narcissistic. I would have preferred some stronger questioning of her, and a closer look at the question of whether any independent literary merit survives.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

Their answers, from Orkney to Dartmoor, blend weather and landscape with childhood memories<br>","byline":"Interviews by Robert Hull","body":"<h2><strong>Dartmoor</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Melissa Harrison</strong><br /><em>Author of </em><a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571328932-rain.html\"><em>Rain: Four Walks in English Weather</em></a><br />“There are certain landscapes that get under your skin and for me that’s Dartmoor. It is romantic – and English in a very particular way – but it’s not untouched, so if you see it that way you’re missing what makes it captivating. This is an uplands landscape of moorlands and granite and it is marked and scarred; it has layers of use there for you to see: medieval tin mines, neolithic stone circles and the remains of Victorian tramways from when that granite was being extracted. And what’s happening to it now, how it is being managed by the Duchy of Cornwall, the MoD, and as a national park, that’s another layer of use that will become part of its history.</p> <p>It’s part of my history in that it’s somewhere my family and I went every summer when I was a child. We used to visit my grandmother, who lived in Ashburton, and would rent a stone cottage in Buckland-in-the-Moor a few miles away. It was a happy time. There was, though, a long period when I didn’t go: my time at university and in my 20s. I found that you end up connecting places with your childhood and, in a way, feel like you’re exiled from them. It’s the land of childhood and you can’t go back. But, after the end of a difficult relationship, I did go back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9535c982b545e490c47bb89f288a644547dd4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9535c982b545e490c47bb89f288a644547dd4d/0_129_5769_3462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The High RoadThe road to Widecombe-in-the-Moor on Dartmoor taken from Haytor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Widecombe-in-the-Moor on Dartmoor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went for a break and stayed in a B&amp;B in Widecombe-in-the-Moor with an elderly couple who seemed concerned about me and would drive me in their Citroën 2CV to the start of my walks. It was astonishing to return to Dartmoor, to find that I didn’t dream it and that the places I remembered were still there. I think because of that absence and reconnection my relationship with the area has deepened.</p> <p>The south west can be wet: there are two sea coasts and between them a big hump of upland, so you get orographic rainfall on Dartmoor. I’ve written about that weather in a chapter of Rain, and I’ve also mentioned how, as kids, my dad used to take my brothers and sisters out for hikes in that sometimes dreadful weather. We’d be wearing cheap cagoules and complaining, but I’m glad we did it because it taught me resilience. It taught me that you can go out, get wet and be uncomfortable but that is fine. You don’t have to seek convenience. In fact, if you do your life is limited by it.”<br />• <em>To order a copy or Rain for £10.65 visit </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/376352/\"><em>theguardianbookshop.com</em></a><em> <br /></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/rain-four-walks-in-english-weather-melissa-harrison-review-wicken-fen-dartmoor-darent-valley-wrekin\"><em>Read Katharine Norbury’s review</em></a></p> <h2><strong>The Outrun, Orkney</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>by Amy Liptrot</strong><br /><em>Author of </em><em><a href=\"http://www.canongate.tv/the-outrun-ebook.html\">The Outrun</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f2b8228b7567b6b4cc9742dc8cffe15f0609824\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f2b8228b7567b6b4cc9742dc8cffe15f0609824/0_177_5667_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The neolithic settlement of Skara Brae, circa 3000 BC, the best preserved groups of prehistoric houses in Western Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The neolithic settlement of Skara Brae, Orkney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The weather is constantly changing in Orkney and you can watch it approaching over the sea. There is so much sea and so much sky and there are few trees – it feels like the landscape has been reduced to its raw elements.</p> <p>The Outrun is the largest field on my dad’s sheep farm on the west coast of the Orkney mainland, where I grew up. Outrun is an agricultural term … you have “in-bye” land, which is the closest land to the farm steading, then there is “out-bye” land, or outrun, which is further away and uncultivated. Historically, it was often hill ground or communal grazing shared between crofts.</p> <p>My Outrun is land edged by cliffs on the west side that look out on the Atlantic, all the way to Canada. To the south, on a clear day, you can see the mountains of Ben Hope and Ben Loyal on mainland Scotland. At the top [of the Outrun] is a seastack where birds nest and you can spot guillemots and puffins. You may also find <em>primula scotica</em> (Scottish primrose) growing, a tiny rare flower that survives in specific coastal conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d95ef220a6d5b3beb8ec0c45629326dd6e72112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d95ef220a6d5b3beb8ec0c45629326dd6e72112/0_83_5352_3211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marwick Head in summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marwick Head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The area isn’t inaccessible, there’s a coastal path and you can walk from Skara Brae, the famous neolithic settlement, up to the Kitchener Memorial at <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/m/marwickhead/\">Marwick Head</a>.

I was there in January and went for a walk when it was hailing, but I felt exhilarated with the high seas and the crashing waves. I love it in summer, too, when you can spot great yellow bumblebees and look out to sea and try to pick out Sule Skerry – once the UK’s most remote manned lighthouse – about 30 miles to the west.

Barn House Lane narrows to a steep-sided track, there’s a gate at the end, then you’re out onto the Brooks, with the river Arun running between banks on the left and a great expanse of marsh stretching away to where the bare downs rise in the distance. There’s nowhere else like it; I’ve looked. This was the landscape I loved when I was growing up, and it’s still my secret standard for understanding other places.</p> <p>It looks wild, but the flood plain is a working landscape shaped by human hands over centuries. The water level is precisely controlled by a network of drainage ditches which make grazing possible in summer, before the floods rise in winter and transform the humming grassland into an inland sea reflecting white skies. Even on warm days, when dragonflies flit in the meadowsweet, this place holds the memory of winter like a basin.</p> <p>Part of the marsh is owned by the RSPB, and people come with their binoculars. I don’t see what they see: lapwings pass me by. But there’s already more than I can take in with two eyes: the shape of the land as I move through it, the texture of the grasses which change day by day. Each clump of rough sedge has a character of its own that seems to demand attention.</p> <p>You can feel exposed and alone on the flat marsh, but there’s something sheltering and containing about this landscape too. Life has gone on, continuously, and left its traces on all sides. To the east is the site of a Roman bath; to the west there’s the Roman road, Stane Street (London Bridge to Chichester), which strikes confidently out across the wetland, undeterred by rising rivers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b140abb02baff23f575ba86b4fcca97c35b792a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b140abb02baff23f575ba86b4fcca97c35b792a/0_104_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of St Botolph’s Parish Church, Hardham, West Sussex, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The parish church at Hardham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hamlet of Hardham is little more than a lay-by, but what a lay-by it is. There are 12th-century paintings in the church: a cycle of bible scenes drawn with the muscular contours of the Romanesque. Adam and Eve have been losing paradise here for 900 years, as the traffic goes by outside and a cow coughs in the water meadows on the other side of the road.</p> <p>I don’t live in the area now, but perhaps the shape a place takes in the mind matters as much as what is verifiably there on the ground. At a distance, separate experiences fuse and colour each other. So the ochre of a painting in Hardham church becomes part of the tawny glow of a reed bank on the Brooks.”<br />• <em>To order a copy of Weatherland for £20.46 visit </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/333898/s/weatherland/\"><em>theguardianbookshop</em></a><em> <br /></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/30/weatherland-review-writers-and-artists-under-english-skies-alexandra-harris\"><em>Read AS Byatt’s review</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Wester Ross, Scottish Highlands</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>by Anna Pavord</strong><br /><em>Author of </em><em><a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/landskipping-9781408868942/\">Landskipping: Painters, Ploughmen and Places</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52b5378f8eb8a864d051220f83a5e3f91bc6ca38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b5378f8eb8a864d051220f83a5e3f91bc6ca38/0_327_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The isles of Raasay and Skye viewed from the Applecross Peninsula\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The isles of Raasay and Skye viewed from the Applecross peninsula</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My response to nature in no way includes wanting to conquer it. I love just to observe, to feel invisible, and one of the most amazing places to experience that is Wester Ross, in the north-west Highlands. When I first went there I was immediately hooked. Joy. Wonder. Respect. All of that. I remember thinking this is absolutely the place I want to be. That was 14 years ago and I’ve been back every year since.</p> <p>It has a savagery that I like very much. I can wander up a track and there will be strange things to see, dramas playing out. I remember watching a buzzard through my field glasses as it swooped down – you rarely see them dive – and came up with a long grass snake. The snake was whipping and bending and curling. It was an amazing battle. The buzzard was trying to keep its equilibrium with this heavy thing in its beak. The snake suddenly whip-lashed itself free and fell back to the ground. I watched the buzzard circling before it decided not to return for another attempt.</p> <p>Applecross peninsula is an amazing part of Wester Ross. From there, you can look west towards the horizon through five alternating planes of darkness and light: you have islands, water and mountain peaks. If you are there towards the end of the day and looking towards the sun, all colour is drained out of that landscape and the sea becomes a shimmering sheet of silver, ending in the jagged peaks of the Cuillins on Skye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a28fde40ca3c30f18baf67bbbcb8ef1f9418591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a28fde40ca3c30f18baf67bbbcb8ef1f9418591/0_252_3775_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liathach,  one of the Torridon hills, Wester Ross and a farm at the foot of a mountain in a plain heath seen at sunset in autumn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liathach, one of the Torridon hills, Wester Ross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I drive up in March, one of my favourite times, I have the excitement of seeing snow glistening on peaks and delight in the way shadows move over them. I enjoy the solitude around the cottage I rent to do my writing. October brings wonderful changes of colour: the rowan trees are full of berries, the birches become butter yellow and the bracken turns a fox-like colour. My only company then is the stags who bellow and fight – a magnificent sound to hear in the night.</p> <p>Our landscape and its wildlife are staggering; we need to understand them better and to grasp there are few things we do that some plant, animal or insect can’t do better. One of the things I hoped when I was writing the book was that it might make people care more – because until you care about something you can’t fight for it.”<br />• <em>To order a copy of Landskipping for £16 visit </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/363842/s/landskipping/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>theguardianbookshop</em></a><em><br /></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/04/landskipping-anna-pavord-review-countryside-theme-park\"><em>Read Alexandra Harris’s review</em></a></p> <h2><strong>High Dam, Cumbria</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>by Katharine Norbury</strong><br /><em>Author of </em><em><a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-fish-ladder-9781408859230/\">The Fish Ladder</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bb9f4b0db7a75da8ae554b1d2943ff12a841f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb9f4b0db7a75da8ae554b1d2943ff12a841f78/0_0_5139_3083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High Dam, Cumbria England UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High Dam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My book The Fish Ladder is about a manmade structure and the place I’ve chosen, High Dam, in Cumbria, is also manmade. I enjoy the contrast: you are in the Lakes, with all the hills and tarns, and here is something we have created. But High Dam is also the first place in nature that as a child I grew to love.</p> <p>My dad had helped his graduate supervisor at Liverpool University build a cottage near Newby Bridge and, as a result, we were able to stay there as a family every year. It was more of a bothy than a cottage: two rooms, no electricity, and water from a hosepipe off the side of the hill. We would walk behind the cottage to a wood, called Bell Intake, which led to a pool, Low Dam, and then we would come to High Dam.</p> <p>High Dam is shallow – not like the ice-scooped tarns on the tops of the mountains – and in summer one end is filled with water lilies. It has this lovely tea colour because of the peat, is surrounded by pines, silver birch and oak and, to me, has always had a Swallows and Amazons feel. The dam was created in 1835 to feed the water wheel at Stott Park Bobbin Mill on the shores of Windermere, and you can still visit it; it’s run by English Heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c1deffdff536d272e6976796bb9e0234287482a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c1deffdff536d272e6976796bb9e0234287482a/7_0_973_584/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stott Park Bobbin Mill\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stott Park Bobbin Mill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child it was an adventure to get to. There were footpaths, but they weren’t well-maintained then, and you’d be up to your thighs in mud if you slipped off the logs there for you to walk across. The <a href=\"http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/planyourvisit/travelandtransport/carparks/carparks_highdam\">Lake District national park</a> runs a car park near there now; it’s a beauty spot! The paths have been made good and bridges have been put over streams. I was horrified when that happened but then I was a child and I didn’t want to share it.</p> <p>Every time I visit there is this feeling of a new experience: the light on the water is different, the sound of the trees is different; go on a winter’s day and it’s covered in frost or snow; go on a glorious summer’s day and people are swimming in the tarn. I’ve visited so often all those imprints are in my memory. There are also memories of the people I’ve known.

From Virginia Woolf to Martha Gellhorn, it’s time we recognised the vital, transgressive work of the flâneuse","byline":"Lauren Elkin","body":"<p>It’s never been more fashionable to write about walking in cities. Books on psychogeography have become a cottage industry, their authors held up as philosophers of modernity. The roots of what they do lie in a 19th-century phenomenon – the <em>flâneur</em>, a figure of privilege and leisure, with the time and money to amble around the city at will. He is both stimulated and agitated by the buzz and hum of the city, the crowd; he is both part of and separate from the urban spectacle, both actor and observer.</p> <p>He is also, always, a man. It’s strange: for as long as there have been cities, there have been women living in them, yet if we want to know what it’s like to walk thoughtfully in the city, there is only a long tradition of writing by men that tells us, stretching from Thomas De Quincey to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andre-Breton\">André Breton</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/will-self\">Will Self</a>. But if we want to know how women experience the city? The flâneuse, if she can be said to exist, must be a streetwalker or a homeless woman, or some other unfortunate whose circumstances have forced her onto the street. Today, when most women you meet in the city have a tale or two of street harassment to tell, the notion of wandering the streets alone seems a fraught proposition.</p> <p>This, perhaps, explains why there is so little attention paid to writing by women about walking in cities: most people assume it doesn’t exist, or is the exception that proves the rule. Our most ready-to-hand sources for what the streetscape looked like in the 19th century are male, and they see the city in a particular way. Baudelaire’s mysterious and alluring <em>passante</em>, immortalised in his poem “To a [Female] Passerby”, from <em>Les Fleurs du Mal</em>, is thought to have been a woman of the night: “The deafening street roared around me/Tall, slender, in heavy mourning, majestic in her grandeur/A woman walked past me (…) Swift and graceful, with legs like a statue’s/Twitching like a madman, I drank in/Her eyes, a pallid sky where storms are born/the sweetness that charms and the pleasure that kills.” Baudelaire can barely gauge her: she is too fast (though somehow, at the same time, statuesque). He is disinclined to consider who she might actually be. For him, she is the keeper of mystery, with the power to charm and to poison.</p> <p>Women have overlooked the possibilities for flâneuserie as well. In 1888 the British poet, essayist and novelist Amy Levy wrote, “The female club-lounger, the flâneuse of St James Street, latch-key in pocket and eye-glasses on the nose, remains a creature of the imagination.” But there have always been women writing about cities, chronicling their lives, telling stories, taking pictures, making films, engaging with the city any way they can – including Levy herself. To suggest that there could be no flâneuse because she wasn’t literally a female flâneur is to limit the ways women have interacted with the city to the ways men have interacted with the city. Perhaps the answer is not to attempt to make a woman fit a masculine concept, but to redefine the concept itself. It’s time to recognise a counter-tradition of the flâneuse, looking back to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Sand\">George Sand</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/01/tvnews.books\">Jean Rhys</a>, or in our own day to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/23/sophie-calle\">Sophie Calle</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-oldfield-ford\">Laura Oldfield Ford</a>. If we tunnel back, we find there always was a flâneuse passing Baudelaire in the street.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than wandering aimlessly, like her male counterpart, the flâneuse goes where she’s not supposed to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a woman to be a flâneuse, first and foremost, she’s got to be a walker – someone who gets to know the city by wandering its streets, investigating its dark corners, peering behind façades, penetrating into secret courtyards. Virginia Woolf called it “street haunting” in an essay by that name: sailing out into a winter evening, surrounded by the “champagne brightness of the air and the sociability of the streets”, we leave the things that define us at home, and become “part of that vast republican army of anonymous trampers”. Out ostensibly to buy a pencil, Woolf is transformed by the quality of the light, of the air, of the road. As we progress through the cityscape there comes a point when we are no longer just reacting: we are interacting, created anew by this interaction.</p> <p>The 19th-century Russian painter Marie Bashkirtseff saw an explicit link between walking in the city and the work that artists could create. “I long for the freedom to go out alone: to go, to come, to sit on a bench in the Jardin des Tuileries, and especially to go to the Luxembourg, to look at the decorated store windows, to enter churches and museums, and to stroll in the old streets in the evenings. This is what I envy. Without this freedom one cannot become a great artist.”</p> <p>For Woolf, who had the idea for <em>To the Lighthouse</em> one afternoon <a href=\"http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/virginia-woolf-bust\">while walking in Tavistock Square</a>, there was a clear connection between walking and creativity. In a letter to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Smyth\">Ethel Smyth</a> in 1930, she wrote: “I cannot get my sense of unity and coherency and all that makes me wish to write the Lighthouse etc. unless I am perpetually stimulated.” This comes from engaging with the world, from “plung[ing] into London, between tea and dinner, and walk[ing] and walk[ing], reviving my fires, in the city, in some wretched slum, where I peep in at the doors of public houses.”</p> <p>The very first words spoken by Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway say it all: “‘I love walking in London,’ said Mrs Dalloway. ‘Really, it’s better than walking in the country.’” Mrs Dalloway is the flâneuse incarnate, as indicated by her surname: “a woman who likes to dally along the way,” as <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english/staff/rachel-bowlby\">Rachel Bowlby</a> pointed out. Woolf used the streets as research. What she saw there prompted her to wonder about people and their lives. The trick of capturing what they feel pushed her forward in her literary project – how to represent “life itself” on the page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc3339d13b5fbf9c04c21b55e658c868d0c8b927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc3339d13b5fbf9c04c21b55e658c868d0c8b927/0_0_1200_886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Calle Suite Vénitienne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scenes from Sophie Calle’s <em>Suite Vénitienne</em></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than wandering aimlessly, like her male counterpart, the female flâneur has an element of transgression: she goes where she’s not supposed to. Take the French artist Sophie Calle, whose celebrated career began the day that, out of boredom, she began secretly following people in the street whom she had chosen arbitrarily. One evening, at a gallery opening, she encountered a man she had been trailing earlier that afternoon. The coincidence seemed like a sign. When he mentioned he was travelling to Venice the next day, she decided to follow him there covertly, too, and she pursued him all over town until he recognised her under her blonde wig. Compiling her notes and photographs, she turned them into an installation and a book, called <a href=\"http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/sophie_calle_suite_vnitienne_duke_street_1997/\"><em>Suite Vénitienne</em></a>. Sophie Calle, as flâneuse, claimed her right to walk in the city – not merely following her man, but stalking her prey.</p> <p>The flâneuse walks the streets defiantly, as a 1929 photograph taken by Marianne Breslauer suggests. In the foreground, a woman stands on the street in Paris, about to light up a cigarette. Behind her, on the wall, the familiar injunction: Défense d’Afficher (No Advertisements), a late 19th- century ban intended to prevent the city from becoming a wasteland of billboards. Above the sign, some letters are stencilled – defiantly? Or were they there first? – announcing that charcuterie could once have been obtained there, or nearby. Below that, someone has drawn the crude outline of a face.</p> <p>A woman smoking in public had become a less unusual sight by the time Breslauer took her photo. But it still retains an element of sin: a woman, visible against the wall behind her, in a field of proscriptions and defiances, about to light up a cigarette. Breslauer’s photograph sets out the key problem at the heart of the urban experience: are we individuals, or are we part of the crowd? Do we want to stand out, or blend in? Is that even possible? How do we – no matter what our gender – want to be seen in public? Do we want to attract or escape the gaze? Remarkable or unremarked-upon? <em>Défense d’afficher</em>. Do not advertise. And yet there she is. <em>Elle s’affiche</em>. She shows herself. She shows up against the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05b5980792e3cc288aa7b75afbed4b7800623fd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b5980792e3cc288aa7b75afbed4b7800623fd2/0_0_3824_4249/900.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Gellhorn\" width=\"900\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha Gellhorn in May 1946.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FPG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can even expand the definition of the flâneuse to include the reporter. Flânerie, the great war reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/17/my-hero-martha-gellhorn-sinead-morrissey\">Martha Gellhorn</a> told Victoria Glendinning, “is as necessary as solitude: that is how the compost keeps growing in the mind”. Over a lifetime of work as a war correspondent, travelling from Spain to China, to Finland to Vietnam, Gellhorn put herself among the blood, and the filth and despair.</p> <p>In Madrid, to report on the Spanish civil war, Gellhorn felt she didn’t have the journalistic chops to cover the big stories, and turned, instead, to reporting on daily life in the besieged city. In a series of reports for Collier’s, an American magazine, she described her daily walks around the city, detailing the everyday impact of war on the people who lived there. She wrote about how strange it was to find a war just down the road, and described the people as simply waiting, for the next shelling, or for something else to happen. People were “standing in doorways and around the square, just standing there patiently, and then suddenly a shell landed, and there was a fountain of granite cobblestones flying up in the air, and the silver lyddite smoke floated off softly”. One man can’t bear waiting in a doorway, in a group, and says he thinks it’s over, but in any case he must go: “‘I have work to do. I am a serious man. I cannot spend my time waiting for shells. Salud,’ he said, and walked out calmly into the street, and calmly crossed it.” This is a kind of micro-reporting, telling the world not what happened at a meeting between generals, but how much a loaf of bread mattered to an architect and his children.</p> <p>In some ways, Gellhorn directly contradicts the image we have of the flâneur – that of the solitary, dissociated urban observer. The flâneuse faced with war and suffering cannot simply stand by: “It is too hard to sit on the outside and watch what you can neither help nor change; it is far easier to close your eyes and your mind and jump into the general misery, where you have almost no choices left, but a lot of solitary company.” In her dedication to exposing misery, Gellhorn turned flânerie into testimony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/29/walking-around-cities-urban-wandering-share-stories\">The art of wandering: share your stories of walking in cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How did she do it? Where did she find the energy to push back, to flout expectations, to travel so far from home? How did she negotiate the self-doubt, the anxiety, the shame of feeling out of step, excessive, inappropriate? Even today, it takes a daunting amount of conviction to convert natural curiosity into willpower. To up and go is the boldest statement of self-preservation. Laying claim to flânerie has always enabled women to reroute the paths they were expected to take, and disrupt the lives they were expected to live.</p> <p><em>• Flâneuse: Women Walk the City by Lauren Elkin is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.

In the dozen World Cups held since 1966, England’s best performance has been a single semi-final appearance, back in 1990. Germany, defeated in that tumultuous match 50 years ago this week, have since reached the final on six further occasions, winning three of them, including the most recent.</p> <p>In the European championships, the other major tournament for which England are eligible, the story is even worse. Germany, either in partial or unified form, have reached the final six times, winning three of them. England, despite not having to cope with Brazil and Argentina, who have combined to knock them out of the World Cup on three occasions, have never gone further than their appearance in the semi-final of Euro 96 – when, as in ’66, they enjoyed home advantage.</p> <p>Given that both countries are equally mad about football, the discrepancy is too glaring to be accidental. To explain the underperformance of one and the superperformance of the other, analysts identify possible structural and philosophical causes, to do with an underlying sense of authenticity conferred by the fans’ part-ownership of Bundesliga clubs and the strategic planning evident in the emphasis placed in Germany on the education of coaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f5aea39fbb4ce4c9feda0fd0b1a30ef71f7d510c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5aea39fbb4ce4c9feda0fd0b1a30ef71f7d510c/0_0_272_400/272.jpg\" alt=\"Jacket for Fifty Years of Hurt\" width=\"272\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fifty-years-of-hurt.html\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Fifty Years of Hurt</em></strong></a><em> </em>(Bantam, £20), <strong>Henry Winter</strong> credits the Germans with a rather different role in England’s continuing plight. A football writer whose big-money move from the Daily Telegraph to the Times last year was the equivalent of, say, Wayne Rooney switching from Manchester United to Chelsea, Winter seems to believe that it is the failure of the players to spend enough time learning about the two world wars of the 20th century which has forced them to surrender in penalty shootouts.</p> <p>Last month, a few days before the start of Euro 2016 in France, Winter fulminated in his schoolmasterly way against the decision of the sports scientists travelling with England to cancel plans for the players to visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thiepval_Ridge\" title=\"\">Thiepval Ridge</a>. The intention had been to salute the 73,367 British soldiers, including 37 former professional footballers, whose names are inscribed on <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Thiepval_Memorial_to_the_missing.jpg\" title=\"\">Sir Edwin Lutyens’ great memorial</a> to the casualties of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916. As Winter pointed out, those 37 included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Lintott\" title=\"\">Evelyn Lintott</a>, an England international and the first chairman of the <a href=\"https://www.thepfa.com/\" title=\"\">Professional Footballers’ Association</a>, to which all the England players belong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1278639da9919eb75948b2b17bdf8ee5ddb174d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1278639da9919eb75948b2b17bdf8ee5ddb174d2/0_0_1762_1438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Edwin Lutyens’ Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"816\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Edwin Lutyens’ Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Winter’s view, not until those young players are taken en bloc to such places – and he includes Auschwitz and Hiroshima in his personal <em>Baedeker</em> – will they win anything. Imbued with respect for the sacrifice of their forebears, they would be able to focus their emotions and abilities more effectively. The key to success, he believes, amounts to getting them out of the “bubble” in which they exist when brought together for a tournament: a world in which they are left to their own devices between training sessions and mealtimes, with only themselves and their team mates – and their iPhones and Xboxes – for company.</p> <p><em>Fifty Years of Hurt</em> is full of such claims. In his most sombrely reflective passage, Winter visits the <a href=\"http://www.thenma.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Memorial Arboretum</a> in Staffordshire. Pausing at the memorials to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Plate\" title=\"\">Battle of the River Plate</a>, the Falklands task force, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/dieppe_raid_01.shtml\" title=\"\">Dieppe raid</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Frankton\" title=\"\">Cockleshell heroes</a>, he muses on all the times, while travelling with England, that he has witnessed the players’ reluctance to visit the real-life sites of history: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial\" title=\"\">Hiroshima Peace Memorial</a> in 2002, for example, or <a href=\"http://www.robben-island.org.za/\" title=\"\">Robben Island</a> in 2010. He mentions with approval the current Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy, whose wedding guests were required to donate to the Help for Heroes charity (“someone with his profession in the right perspective”), and the occasion in 2010, during an under-19 tournament in France, on which the England players were taken to one of the D-Day beaches: “However briefly, it presses the pause button on chatter about cars, women and money, helping them become more rounded people.” Quite how the author comes to be so familiar with the content of the squad’s everyday chit-chat, he does not say. Unfortunately such Winter-approved conduct did not prevent Ruddy’s omission from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/roy-hodgson\" title=\"\">Roy Hodgson</a>’s squad this summer or help the under-19s in their semi-final against Spain, which they lost 3-1.</p> <p>Much more underlies England’s dismal record than a failure to salute <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blimp#/media/File:Colonel_Blimp_cartoon.png\" title=\"\">Colonel Blimp</a>, of course, but Winter’s long trawl for explanations goes largely unrewarded. The book incorporates interviews with former internationals from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/09/newsstory.sport\" title=\"\">Jack Charlton</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/steven-gerrard\" title=\"\">Steven Gerrard</a>, their recollections transcribed and presented in barely edited form, with all the considerable repetition and occasional self-contradiction tediously intact. Everything they say is taken at face value: nothing is seriously challenged or interrogated. On the one hand, we are told, today’s players concentrate on technique at the expense of passion; on the other, they need to control their emotions and work on their skills. Academies are the future; academies are a waste of time. Sam Allardyce, overlooked for the England’s manager’s job in 2006 but finally granted it last week, puts the blame for failure in recent international tournaments on the stifling of opportunities for English-born players by the Premier League clubs’ recruitment of foreign stars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Winter suggests bringing in more banners, flags and drums to make Wembley more intimidating. No thank you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Winter presents a few reasonable ideas of his own, such as opening some of England’s training sessions to the public, as Brazil used to do, and some wonky ones, like making Wembley “more intimidating” by bringing in more banners, flags and drums. No thank you. The way to make Wembley intimidating is to start winning big matches and big tournaments, and that relies solely on good coaches selecting the right players and tactics.</p> <p>There are times when Winter fires off short verbless phrases with the overbright ring of middle-market headlines – “the underhand hand of god” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/diego-maradona\" title=\"\">Maradona</a>), “the poacher turned presenter” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker\" title=\"\">Lineker</a>), “the clamour for glamour”, “putsch-and-run tactics” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/john-terry\" title=\"\">John Terry</a>’s one-man insurrection during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/worldcup2010\" title=\"\">World Cup in South Africa</a>), “California streamin” (the Premier League’s global digital future) – which add nothing and become irritating. Not half as irritating, however, as his decision to set the book entirely in the present tense, a persistent cause of annoyance as he skips between historical and contemporary time-frames. He skips, the reader stumbles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8c1d1d7e4aa948a35b1b3f415a7321953defd1c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c1d1d7e4aa948a35b1b3f415a7321953defd1c8/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Jacket for 1966 My World Cup Story\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/bobby-charlton\" title=\"\"><strong>Bobby Charlton</strong></a> seldom stumbled on the pitch, but his subdued role in the 1966 final was determined by the two opposing head coaches – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/alf-ramsey\" title=\"\">Alf Ramsey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-helmut-schon-1320761.html\" title=\"\">Helmut Schön</a> – who decided that he and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/franz-beckenbauer\" title=\"\">Franz Beckenbauer</a> should try to mark each other out of the game, thus relieving the afternoon of the keenly anticipated creative contributions of the best players on each side.

the run and the fears of those who wish to close borders","byline":"Kapka Kassabova","body":"<p>Writing from Calais last year, where she and Annie Holmes were gathering refugees’ stories, <a href=\"https://www.englishpen.org/pen-atlas/refugees-and-writers-conversations-in-the-calais-jungle/\">Olumide Popoola asked</a>: “What happens when we try to know another’s painful journey? When we try to hold it in some way, to say: you are here. I see you.” This, and other conundrums, is what the short stories in <em>Breach</em> illuminate with great narrative panache. The first in a series of specially commissioned fiction engaged with unfolding political crises, <em>Breach</em> was conceived as an attempt to explore, not through reportage but through literature, the lives of those on the run and also “the fears of people in this country who want to close their borders”. To my knowledge, it is the first full-length book of fiction about the current refugee crisis since it entered our consciousness, and it possesses a timeless quality, despite its obvious timeliness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/top-10-refugees-stories\">Top 10 refugees' stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is fine, suspenseful fiction springing from human lives <em>in extremis</em>; despite the historical distance, I was reminded of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/19/short-story-survey-varlam-shalamov-kolyma-tales-gulag\">Varlam Shalamov’s <em>Kolyma Tales</em></a> and the grace fiction can distil from desperate material. Here are two accomplished writers co‑authoring a work without taking credit for individual stories – the style and tempo are consistent throughout the changing perspectives. It would be fascinating to hear how Popoola and Holmes crafted this level of artistic unity, almost a sustained act of ventriloquism.</p> <p>Written entirely in the present tense,which here does a good job of conveying urgency, each story takes us on an exciting misadventure. Some are set in “the Jungle” – Calais and the wider world of refugees, smugglers, well-wishers and ill-wishers. In “Paradise”, an English volunteer takes her niece to Calais, hoping she would “fall in love with justice, with activism, not some boy”. Two Eritrean girls desperate for money try to prostitute themselves to local truck drivers, with tragicomic results; a smug volunteer’s attempt to be chummy with the two girls is equally tragicomic. In the striking “Ghosts”, a clear-eyed, articulate people smuggler nicknamed Ghostboy is indefinitely stuck in Calais because “our country is just plain out of date”. Ghostboy has some good lines – on the refugee condition: “For you and me, there’s only now.” On the human condition: “People are the same wherever. Greedy or lost or both.” A French unreliable narrator in “The Terrier” welcomes two young Syrian Kurds into her farmhouse, but frets: are they underage siblings, or terrorists?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/13/canterbury-tales-refugee-ali-smith-cleave-agbabi-tales-chaucer\">Canterbury Tales rebooted with refugee stories of trafficking and detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Popoola and Holmes’s vision of life on the edge is rich with ambiguity. We are given the experience from within, with panic attacks inside freezer trucks and texts to worried parents back home who have bankrupted themselves to pay for their child’s passage. In “Oranges in the River”, a punchy two-hander, Dlo is “weighed down by his father’s sacrifices”, but his friend Jan “drove himself forward, drilling towards the future, relentless and unstoppable”.</p> <p>We meet a guy who sleeps with his trainers on in case he has to run; a man living in Birmingham who wants to visit his sick mother in Iran but is trapped in a Kafkaesque confusion. We see what it’s like to have to bureaucratically “summarise” your predicament (“How do you summarise genocide?” says one deadpan Sudanese narrator), and discover the stark sensation of being an ‘involunteer’ at the mercy of pitiless forces. Most hauntingly, these stories explore the existential impasse of being young and filled with wasted energy, like Alghali, who has made it to Bolton just in time to be beaten up by locals on the day of the Paris bombing. He contemplates a “distant future that could come tomorrow, that could come months down the line. Or never.” By giving the voiceless of our time their voices back, voices vibrant with humour, truth, and knowledge, <em>Breach</em> serves everyone, greedy or lost or both, with a fresh dollop of humanity.

It was <a href=\"http://www.castelligallery.com/about.html\">Leo Castelli </a>who perfected the latter role in the 1950s and 60s, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/13/larry-gagosian-art-dealer-artreview\">Larry Gagosian</a> has since stretched it to an imperial extreme as owner of a global gallery chain this paper once called “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/mar/24/larry-gagosian-art-galleries\">the Starbucks of contemporary art</a>”.<br /></p> <p>All of these men are much better known to casual gallery-goers than the subject of <a href=\"http://judithestein.com/\">Judith E Stein</a>’s scrupulous biography <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/eyeofthesixties/judithestein\">Eye of the Sixties: Richard Bellamy and the Transformation of Modern Art</a>. Bellamy was a dealer with the enigmatic personality of an artist, and a visionary who launched the careers of such movement-defining figures as <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/claes-oldenburg\">Claes Oldenburg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jul/01/2\">Mark di Suvero</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jan/17/art2\">Donald Judd</a>. But his inability to convert masterpieces to paychecks reduced his legacy to a footnote. In rescuing him from obscurity, Stein constructs an alternative history of New York’s mid-century art world that keeps Warhol on the periphery and privileges creative breakthroughs over record-breaking sales.<br /></p> <p>Stein spent two decades piecing together his life story, having begun work on the book (which Bellamy tried to dissuade her from writing) well before his death in 1998. He was born in 1927 to a Chinese mother and a white American father. Bellamy’s mixed-race parentage made him an outsider in his suburban Cincinnati hometown, and he coped by cultivating a dreamy, distant persona. After dropping out of college, he found his people and learned about abstract expressionism in the Provincetown, Massachusetts, art scene. That he happened to be in town for <a href=\"http://www.iamprovincetown.com/history/art-colony-history.html\">Forum 49</a>, an influential series of cultural events in the summer of 1949, “was the first manifestation of his karmic propensity to be in the right place at the right time,” Stein writes.<br /></p> <p>Bellamy soon relocated to Manhattan, where he lived in bohemian squalor with his future wife Nancy Christopherson, the first in a series of long-suffering partners. His next karmic windfall came in 1955, when his artist friends at Hansa gallery, undaunted by his lack of experience and formal education, hired him to manage their co-operative space. He turned out to be a terrible salesman. “To Dick’s countercultural value system, it was bizarre to acquire art for its potential to appreciate,” explains Stein. “You bought art because you loved it, pure and simple.” Bellamy behaved strangely, too, often sleeping in the gallery. Stein sometimes glosses over his creepiest excesses – devoting just a few sentences to a party where “Dick had to be restrained as he lurched at his friend <a href=\"http://jilljohnston.com/\">Jill Johnston</a> with a carving knife” – but never loses sight of them.<br /></p> <p>After Hansa closed in 1959, Bellamy earned his place in history as the founding director of Green gallery, where his pioneering group shows fueled the explosion of smaller movements that succeeded abstract expressionism in the early 60s: pop, minimalism, conceptual art, op art. Bellamy was the first to show Warhol’s pop work, though he never capitalized on that foresight either. Aware of his own shortcomings, he tended to refer promising talents to rivals like Castelli. This suicidal approach made a split with his silent partner, the collector Robert Scull, inevitable. The gallery shut down in 1965. Bellamy worked as a dealer until his death, eventually operating (and sometimes living in) galleries in Tribeca and Queens. But his self-destructive lifestyle, irrepressible weirdness and disdain for commercialism meant he was increasingly treated as a character rather than a force. </p> <p>In a fitting tribute to her aesthete subject, Stein devotes more space to eloquent analyses of the art he loved and the shows he assembled than to art-market economics lessons most of her readers will already have absorbed. Her descriptions are fresh enough to cast new light on works that have already been critiqued to death. Of <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/works/78401\">Jasper Johns’ Green Target</a>, she writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The painting was a readable image of a bull’s-eye, with a choppy, encaustic surface that here and there revealed legible bits of newsprint and waxy tears, the accidental drips so cherished by abstract expressionists. But the overall effect had none of the emotional heat of the Hansa’s figurative expressionists.</p> </blockquote> <p>A critic and curator with a doctorate in art history, Stein anchors Eye of the Sixties in a deep understanding of the connections between artists, movements and even art forms. In one passage, Stein connects di Suvero’s unprecedented large-scale, abstract sculptures with the groundbreaking jazz of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ornette-coleman\">Ornette Coleman.</a> Bellamy loved music and lived for literature, so it’s impossible to understand his cerebral taste in visual art without viewing it through an interdisciplinary lens.</p> <p>Stein’s reporting is even more impressive than her criticism, supplementing a scant published record with letters, diary entries and dozens of interviews – many with key art world figures who have since died. A postscript hints at why her meticulous research took so long; she tracked down Christopherson in a nursing home, for example, and courted one reluctant artist with vintage postcards. Her attention to detail slows down the chapters on Bellamy’s aimless, pre-Hansa youth, though these early anecdotes end up illuminating his fascinating later years.</p> <p>Every good biography has a mystery to solve, but Stein wisely avoids asking obvious questions. She doesn’t waste time wondering why Bellamy ended up a peripheral figure in an art world driven by eight-figure sales. Instead, she focuses her inquiry on why his relatively untrained eye was able to identify so much genius, ultimately crediting his openness, genuine friendships with artists and “ability to feel at one with things that were external to him”.

He was also a significant figure in the foundation of the religious right as a political force in the US, through the creation of organisations such as the Moral Majority in the early 1980s.</p> <p>The Left Behind series, which came out annually between 1995 and 2007, sold at least 70m copies and at the height of its popularity brought its authors $15m (£11m) a year. The books, with their gloomy vision of the Saved and Unsaved, benefited from the shock to the American psyche caused by the attacks of 9/11 – the ninth in the series came out a month later – and undoubtedly struck a chord with fearful and credulous readers. In 2002 a poll found 62% of Americans believing in the imminent physical return of Jesus Christ to Earth.</p> <p>The books’ premillennialist premise, based on a doctrine originally propounded by the 19th-century English preacher <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/pastorsandpreachers/john-nelson-darby.html\" title=\"\">John Nelson Darby</a> from his literalist reading of the Book of Revelation, is the imminent coming of the Last Days, in which the saved elect are taken safely up to heaven while the forces of evil battle for seven years over control of the Earth until the triumph of the returning Christ at the Battle of Armageddon and the institution of a 1,000-year reign of peace and harmony. The doctrine is shared by modern sects such as Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Plymouth Brethren.</p> <p>The Left Behind series starts with the saved disappearing suddenly from among the passengers on a jumbo jet flying across the Atlantic, leaving only their clothes, jewellery, teeth fillings and surgical pins behind – LaHaye claimed to have got the original inspiration from watching cabin crew canoodling on a flight and wondering what would happen to them when the Rapture struck. In the book, cars on the ground are also suddenly left driverless – and the series continues excitingly through the following books with battles, helicopter chases, earthquakes, plagues of locusts and a supernatural horde of 200 million demonic horsemen. The books’ evil genius turns out to be a Romanian called Nicolae Carpathia, whose wicked Global Community regime, supposedly dedicated to fostering peace, world government and a single currency, bears a passing resemblance to the United Nations, or maybe the European Union.</p> <p>The series has been read, mainly in the US, turned into CDs, DVDs – though the big Hollywood deal LaHaye prayed for never quite came off – clothes with Rapture logos and even a board game. LaHaye did not actually write the books himself, but subcontracted that to a former sports journalist called Jerry B Jenkins. “I consider myself the creator of the series,” LaHaye told me when I interviewed him in 2006. “I work up Jesus and the biblical commentaries and that gives the writer the idea of how the storyline should go. I am not a control freak – once I throw the ball I want him to run for the touchdown with it.” Subsequent writers on this and the later series, Babylon Rising, proved less congenial, being less susceptible to LaHaye’s world vision.</p> <p>There were many more books, all propounding his apocalyptic philosophy and taking in traditional fundamentalist tropes. He did not care much for Jews, Anglicans, Muslims, and especially Roman Catholics – they were “pseudo-Christian and pagan” – and gay people, who were so “militant, organised and vile” that Leviticus’s injunction of capital punishment could only be seen as just and compassionate retribution. And he suspected that there was a worldwide conspiracy by the Illuminati, the secret society aiming to destroy every vestige of Christianity in order to establish a new world order. Socialists had taken over the education system as early as the 1830s, he insisted, and Europe, of course, was beyond the pale. “You over there in England, you’ve got false teaching, you don’t believe in the supernatural. You had this migration of Christians who came here and that’s stripped England of its religious base. The churches there are dead. What I want with my books is to force people to make decisions, to decide where they want to spend eternity … we are just laying it out plainly, making it as literal as possible.”</p> <p>Some of his views were even stranger: LaHaye may have been the last person to believe in the medieval idea that the body is controlled by humours – the LaHaye temperament analysis scheme was set up to prove this: “The Bible’s like looking at a medical book. This is the word of God – you can trust that,” he told me. His 1976 book The Act of Marriage propounded the theory that religious wives have more frequent and more enjoyable sex than their less religious counterparts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2123d7a63f0a7842f6adeaf246d9863891ac783\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2123d7a63f0a7842f6adeaf246d9863891ac783/7_0_1318_1484/888.jpg\" alt=\"Co-authors Tim LaHaye, left, and Jerry Jenkins sign copies of their book Glorious Appearing.\" width=\"888\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-authors Tim LaHaye, left, and Jerry Jenkins sign copies of their book Glorious Appearing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Bevel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this might have been only quaint, but for LaHaye’s infusion into the politics of the US religious right. Along with several other bombastic evangelicals including Jerry Falwell, Oral Roberts and Jim Bakker, LaHaye was among a party invited to meet Jimmy Carter for a White House breakfast in 1980, where they were shocked to find the president – himself a Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher – was fundamentally unsound because he supported equal rights and the supreme court’s abortion judgment. LaHaye immediately led the group in prayer outside saying: “God, we have got to get this man out of the White House and get someone in here who will be aggressive about bringing back traditional moral values.” They then mobilised their followers for the divorced, non-churchgoing, former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan instead.</p> <p>LaHaye, small, dapper, with dyed brown hair, was not mainly a televangelist. One of three children, he was the son of Frank LaHaye, a Detroit car worker of French Canadian origin, and his wife, Margaret (nee Palmer). His father died from a heart attack when his son was 10 years old and LaHaye dated his spiritual awakening from hearing the preacher at his father’s funeral promising that they would meet again one day when the Lord descended and they all gathered in the air. After wartime service in US air force bombers over Europe, LaHaye trained at the fundamentalist Bob Jones University in South Carolina and in 1950 received a doctorate in ministry at the Western Seminary in Washington state. In 1958 he and his family moved to San Diego in California, where he set up his own church and later a Christian college. Latterly he also contributed generously to Falwell’s Liberty University in Virginia, paying for a school of prophecy, a students’ union building and an ice hockey and skating centre.</p> <p>By the 1970s he was increasingly involved in politics: he and his wife, Beverly, whom he had married in 1947, were supporters of the conspiratorial, virulently anti-communist John Birch Society; he sat on the board of Falwell’s Moral Majority; founded an organisation called the American Traditional Values Coalition; and set up the <a href=\"http://www.pre-trib.org/\" title=\"\">Pre-Tribulation Research Center</a>, dedicated to looking out for signs of the coming Last Days and the imminence of the Rapture. Beverly started the conservative pressure group Concerned Women for America. Some of the ideas generated by LaHaye and his colleagues fed into public policy, most prominently in defence of Israel and its original biblical borders, since on the Last Day Jews will supposedly suddenly convert to Christianity and thus need to be cherished until they do.</p> <p>LaHaye’s own public political career was brief: he served as co-chairman of Jack Kemp’s presidential campaign in 1988 for four days until his anti-Catholic views became known and he was dropped from the ticket.</p> <p>LaHaye’s literary output slowed down after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2006. He died following a stroke. He is survived by Beverly and their four children, Linda, Larry, Lee and Lori.</p> <p>• Timothy LaHaye, minister of religion and writer, born 27 April 1926; died 25 July 2016</p>","wordcount":"1360","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-11T13:28:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4p8nd","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/66553524022dcab8091313f8d17d1e2a76a0451e/249_36_2239_1343/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","type":"tone","webTitle":"Obituaries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-obituaries","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Obituaries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-obituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stephenbates","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Stephen Bates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephenbates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/stephenbates","references":[],"bio":"<p>Stephen Bates is a former religious affairs and royal correspondent of the Guardian.

a cutthroat, disrespectful, low-life, motherfucking, crab-ass, lyin’, deceivin’, stab-you-in-the-back type of business, and that’s just the good part of it!” Darryl “DMC” McDaniels laughs (perhaps channeling Hunter S Thompson’s famous line about the record business). We’re discussing the Devastating Mic Controller’s autobiography <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.co.nz/9780062368799/ten-ways-not-to-commit-suicide\">Ten Ways Not to Kill Yourself</a>, which he has also forcefully voiced as an audiobook. <br /></p> <p>It is a raw, revealing memoir which bleeds like a stab wound. “I’m an addict,” writes DMC, the man who rhymed so enduringly about the crack epidemic on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgmyVLheqkQ\">Mary, Mary</a>. “For most of my early life, I smoked and snorted and guzzled my way through almost every day.”</p> <p>Lowering his booming voice a little, he adds: “If your soul is not right with what you’re doing, you will fall apart, like I did.” </p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSAdX1VCXc\">Eminem inducted Run-DMC into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009</a>, the second hip-hop group to make it after Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, he called them “something tough. Something dangerous. Something beautiful and something unique. They were the first movie stars of rap … they are the Beatles”.</p> <p>“That’s <em>crazy</em>,” DMC tells me, friendly and loquacious, sitting in his New Jersey home. “Busta Rhymes said, ‘Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"280097ca12997db8f523e12bdc7ce697d76dc446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/280097ca12997db8f523e12bdc7ce697d76dc446/0_0_3462_4942/701.jpg\" alt=\"Tougher than leather: Run DMC in 1986.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tougher than leather: Run DMC in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DMC, Joe “Run” Simmons and their DJ Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell were hip-hop’s first superstars. Between 1983 and 1988 the albums <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6028776/run-dmcs-run-dmc-at-30-classic-track-by-track-review\">Run-DMC</a>, <a href=\"http://theboombox.com/run-dmc-king-of-rock-album-30-years-later/\">King of Rock</a>, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11816-run-dmc-king-of-rock-raising-hell-tougher-than-leather/\">Raising Hell and Tougher Than Leather</a> unleashed classic tracks such as Hard Times, It’s Tricky, Proud to Be Black, Mary, Mary, and Walk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/04/walk-this-way-run-dmc-aerosmith\">This Way</a>. (Later highlights include Ghostbusters and Bounce.) “Run-DMC were so exciting live,” Jurassic 5’s <a href=\"http://lumiere.net.nz/index.php/an-interview-with-chali-2na/\">Chali 2na</a> told me. </p> <p>Despite all Run-DMC’s success, after Tougher Than Leather DMC collapsed into alcoholism, depression and OCD, as he increasingly lost his voice to spasmodic dysphonia, in which the larynx spasms during speech. For years, he recalls, he suffered suicidal thoughts. He had rising creative and personal conflicts with producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/18/urban.russellsimmons\">Russell Simmons</a>, Jay and, especially, Run (“anal as hell”). His childhood friendship with Run degenerated into a dysfunctional business relationship. DMC felt hustled by Run’s pastor E Bernard Jordan. By 1997, he “avoided Run like a virus”. In Japan later that year, hawking remixes (one of which, Jason Nevins’s take on It’s Like That, was nevertheless an international smash, selling 5m copies), DMC “felt used, pimped and dirty … Milk this cow till there’s powdered music coming out the udders.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/04/walk-this-way-run-dmc-aerosmith\">Walk This Way: how Run-DMC and Aerosmith changed pop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Ice-T asked Run how it was being top of the rap game, Run famously recalled an epiphany on excess – consuming the best of everything: presidential suites, women and drugs: “The ho’s knocking at the door. Rolling Stone’s behind the ho … I’m fuckin’ out of control.” DMC demurs: “I was never on it like him … Run and Jay smoked more weed than a Rastafarian god could grow.”</p> <p>Around 2002 things came to a head when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/31/nyregion/31RAP.html\">Jay was murdered in his Hollis recording studio</a>, DMC discovered he was adopted, and his father died. Despite a serious bout of alcohol-induced pancreatitis years earlier, DMC surrendered to industrial-scale drinking, downing “case of 40s every day”. He had a fridge in his SUV. Even when walking anywhere, a guy in his crew carried around beer in a portable chiller. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61af9a8195c2df2ab2eb327280a1ee053174b49a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61af9a8195c2df2ab2eb327280a1ee053174b49a/0_0_2000_1303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DMC in New York, 2005. ‘Therapy is the most gangsta thing you can do’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DMC in New York, 2005. ‘Therapy is the most gangsta thing you can do.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Cooper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DMC realised he had to get real about rehab. He also found counselling helpful. “Therapy is the most gangsta thing you can do,” he says. His ultimate salvation, though, was his wife Zury and his son Dson.</p> <p>Raised Catholic but “enjoying a wild time on the road rather than worrying about my eternal soul”, DMC now believes a higher, personal power lives within all of us. “I don’t care what you wanna call god: Yahweh, Buddha, Almighty, Allah, whatever you wanna call her. I think God’s a woman ’cause my wife and mother are so cool.”</p> <p>DMC is a Hillary Clinton supporter. “I’ve seen her, working in the community for foster kids. I fell in love with her ’cause she really cares about young people.” Clinton also reminds him of his mum. “Your mother can read bullshit, knows how to bring shit to order.” </p> <p>He believes Run DMC’s last three albums were “really awful” – and The School of Old, featuring Kid Rock, on 2001’s <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/crown-royal-mw0000248168\">Crown Royal </a>certainly was – in striking contrast to the previous quartet, dedicated to uplifting America. This year DMC put out a single Flames (Unnecessary Bullets), a call to stop all the violence. Did he draw on Fred Hampton Jr’s message that “we don’t fight racism with racism. We fight racism with solidarity”? “Oh for sure. That’s absolutely what Flames is about.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN1zuPyggBU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sN1zuPyggBU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>DMC is angry about police killing black people. “Those bullets should not have left the chambers.” He was moved by Dallas police chief David Brown’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/dallas-police-chief-david-brown-profile\">“I’ll be loving you always” eulogy for his five murdered cops</a>. “That was incredible!” he exclaims. He’s also impressed with Brown’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/07/08/what-dallas-pd-does-right-and-why-doing-those-things-could-now-be-more-difficult/\">community policing approach</a>, and that he has fired more than 70 sub-standard officers. “We’ve got to go through all of America’s precincts, one by one, and weed out all the bad weeds.”</p> <p>He raises murders within African American communities, recounting a recent forum. “A young girl gets up and says: ‘Here’s the truth, DMC: when a white cop shoots a black kid that’s wrong, but when a black kid shoots another black kid that’s how it is in the hood.’ That hit me in the gut. I said ‘Damn, that’s the fight right there’. It goes deep: I remember when Jay got shot …”</p> <p>Jay’s murder remains unsolved. Does DMC think anyone will ever be charged? “Nope. I really, really don’t think so,” he sighs. A 2012 <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/10-years-jam-master-jay-murder-sill-unsolved-article-1.1189868\">New York Daily News</a> article alleged people in Hollis know who did it, but are too scared to tell the police. “Yes, too scared.” He quotes the perspective of someone living in Hollis. “‘Jay travelled and they got Jay. I’ve got to live here everyday. I’ve got my wife and kids.’” DMC believes in an afterlife. “You will see Jay again,” he says, quoting the last line of Run-DMC’s Peter Piper. “You will. Right now he’s jamming in heaven with Biggie and Kurt Cobain.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo5-74dWGS0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oo5-74dWGS0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>DMC says contemporary hip-hop is overwhelmed by mediocre rap. “So illiterate, so disrespectful, so negative. Here in America, you can be a motherfuckin’ fool, as long as you’re making money. If you get a young positive brother talking like a Chuck D or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/01/krs-one-gospel-hip-hop\">KRS-One</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/11/rakim-hip-hop-preaching-profit\">Rakim</a>, America don’t want to hear from you. We need to go to these radio stations and say we don’t wanna just hear these same 10 records about sipping syrup, having sex and shooting motherfuckers.” </p> <p>DMC argues that hip-hop should be more about self-esteem, self-respect and “the force of education”. As he does frequently during our interview, he busts out a burst of verse, words from Raising Hell’s closing track: “I’m proud to be black yo.”</p> <p>He would love to see Public Enemy’s Chuck D shaking things up as a producer industry-wide. “A lot of motherfuckers would be fired. It would be a total re-haul in this music business. Ninety-nine percent of rap today is bad demos. It’s about responsibility. It’s not about censorship and freedom of speech. We let corporate America come in and exploit us, tell us how to do our own hip-hop. You get more money if you’re a knucklehead … In the 80s we challenged Reaganomics.” </p> <p>Today, DMC is enjoying making music again. “I don’t need no substances.” He’s working on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrchuckd/status/621626616490409984\">Coming Like a Rhino</a>, a new track with Chuck D, which aims to cross Rebel Without a Pause and Time Bomb. “We’re about to put the foot of God in the ass of the industry, in all rappers to come, the rappers that are still in their fathers’ nuts. Let ’em know they don’t call Chuck the hard rhymer and DMC the King of Rock for nothing. I’m just 52. I’m not a fuckin’ senior citizen. Coming Like a Rhino’s not for recognition; not for sales. Just dope ass beats and dope ass rhymes.

I have <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/12/21/crystallised-ginger-the-adventure-of-the-christmas-pudding\">written before</a> of their extraordinary generosity, and the wonderful relationship that we have. Whenever I am there, it is inevitably with some or all of my adopted siblings, and a fridge that is bursting at the seams with food. After Swedish Christmas, English Christmas and Boxing Day, we take it in turns to hunt out leftovers and turn them into something new. Roasts find their way into pies and risottos, root veg is mashed or diced to provide some sort of breakfast fodder – but more often than not, we will organise a ‘hotch potch’, where we pull everything out of the fridge and assemble it in the middle of the table. This meal in The Borrowers feels just like a ‘hotch potch’ dinner. Some chestnuts, a handful of raisins, crumbs of cinnamon toast and a single potted shrimp - food that doesn’t quite go together, but that a hungry family would make short work of. </p> <p>I have been through a lot of ingredients in the past week - while cooking over 50 recipes from my forthcoming book, I’ve bought kilograms of butter, over 100 eggs and 10 litres of milk. In the past couple of days, after the last of the leftover ingredients and dishes were slowly put to good use, I opened the fridge to discover that I was down to the bare minimum: eggs, milk, butter and bread. I could have reverted to my standby: scrambled eggs on toast, but I have been dreaming about cinnamon toast since re-reading The Borrowers earlier this year, and quickly latched onto that idea.</p> <p>Traditional cinnamon toast (the one I remember from childhood) is heavily buttered white toast, sprinkled liberally with sugar and cinnamon. This one is a little more substantial, slightly more grown up and - most importantly - used up what I had left in the fridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90e14863d0d7dfda69bdf4d9411a10fe778b461e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90e14863d0d7dfda69bdf4d9411a10fe778b461e/0_60_1797_1304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ingredients for cinnamon French toast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ingredients for cinnamon French toast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young of The Little Library Café</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cinnamon French toast</h2> <p><em>Serves 2</em></p> <p><em>Ingredients</em><br /> 2 large slices slightly stale bread <br />2 eggs <br />2tbsp milk <br />Pinch salt <br />2tbsp butter<br /> 1/2tsp icing sugar <br />1/2tsp ground cinnamon<br />Pinch nutmeg</p> <p><em>Equipment</em><br /> Flat dish <br />Fork<br /> Frying pan <br />Sieve</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/little-library-cafe/2016/jun/09/food-in-books-crab-avocado-and-mayonnaise-sylvia-plath-the-bell-jar\">Food in books: the crab, avocado and mayonnaise in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1.</strong> In the flat dish, whisk the eggs, salt and milk together. Push the slices of bread into the mixture, leaving them for around a minute before turning them over. The time here is really down to how robust your bread is - sourdough can take a minute a side (it would be fine if you forgot about it for a good few minutes, actually), softer bread will need less time.<br /></p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Melt the butter in the frying pan over a medium heat until it is frothing, then lay the bread in the pan. Cook for around two minutes, until golden underneath. Flip over and cook the other side for two minutes too. The butter will brown during this time – if you’d rather it didn’t, you can use clarified butter, but I quite like the nutty flavor that brown butter lends.</p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Remove the toast from the pan, then sprinkle with the icing sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon.

It also contains fragments from Virgil’s poem of the land, The Georgics, but the original manuscript is likely to have contained all of Virgil’s canonical works. <a href=\"https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine_books_blog/2016/07/vatican-digitizes-illuminated-manuscript-of-the-aeneid.phtml\">According to Fine Books magazine</a>, it is “one of the oldest [copies of The Aeneid] to survive the centuries”.</p> <p>The 1,600-year-old document is one of more than 80,000 manuscripts, running to 41m pages, in the library, which was founded in 1451 by Pope Nicholas V. With its delicate texts ranging from Sandro Botticelli’s 1450 illustration of The Divine Comedy, to a collection of 111 pages of manuscripts containing poems, technical notes, and preparatory sketches by Michelangelo, the library only allows access to its materials by specialised scholars. But even with these restrictions, according to the library, “the need to consult the library’s documents puts their very survival and their future availability and accessibility at risk every day”.</p> <p>A major project to digitise all 80,000 documents will ensure that scholars have less need to consult the originals, and also make the texts available to the general public. Digita Vaticana, which is raising the funds needed for the digitisation, has estimated that the project will take more than 15 years to complete and cost more than €50m (£42m). Its latest initiative is offering the first 200 people to donate €500 or more a limited edition reproduction of a page from the Vatican Virgil, <a href=\"http://www.digitavaticana.org/landing/?lang=en\">depicting Creusa trying to keep her husband Aeneas from battle</a>. </p> <p> “Our library is an important storehouse of the global culture of humankind,” said Cesare Pasini, prefect of the library. “We are delighted the process of digital archiving will make these wonderful ancient manuscripts more widely available to the world and thereby strengthen the deep spirit of humankind’s shared universal heritage.”

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/07/hans-fallada-alone-berlin-rereading\">Alone in Berlin</a> was the hit book of the summer six years ago, selling 300,000 copies and making a bestseller of an author who had been largely forgotten. Now the late German author’s Nightmare in Berlin, an autobiographical novel beginning on the day the war ends, is to be published in English for the first time.</p> <p>Released in German as <em>Der Alpdruck</em> (“The Nightmare”) in 1947, the year of Fallada’s death, the novel is the only book other than Alone in Berlin to have been written by the author in the post-war period. It tells of a man, Dr Doll, and his wife, who are taking shelter in the German countryside, haunted by nightmarish images at night, when the Russians invade. They return to Berlin after the end of the war, and attempt to resume their lives, but confronting the reality of life in the devastated city, they fall into morphine addiction, with each dose a “small death”.</p> <p>“More than anything, [Dr Doll] wishes to vanquish the demon of collective guilt, but he is unable to right any wrongs,” said the novel’s English-language publisher Scribe UK, which will publish the book in the UK in October. “As the German nation tries to awaken from the nightmare that Hitler’s state had descended into, Fallada’s protagonists slowly wrestle their way out of their own oblivion, eventually finding a way forward.”</p> <p>Scribe said the novel was “heavily autobiographical”, with the author’s “turbulent life … a mirror for the imploding society he documented”. Fallada’s biographer Jenny Williams writes in her biography of the author, More Lives Than One, that Der Alpdruck “draws on his experiences from April 1945 to July 1946”, and notes that the author himself called it “half fact, half fiction”. In Fallada’s preface, she adds, he describes the book as a “report, as true to the facts as possible, of how Germans felt, suffered and acted from April 1945 into the summer of 1946”.</p> <p>Williams calls Der Alpdruck “the book that cleared the way for Alone in Berlin”. Fallada, the pen name of the German author Rudolf Ditzen, rose to fame with the publication of the 1932 novel, <em>Kleiner Mann - Was Nun?</em> (“Little Man – What Now?”), but was addicted to morphine and spent his life in and out of psychiatric hospitals and prisons. </p> <p>Ditzen chose to stay in Germany when the Nazis came to power, and was put under pressure to write antisemitic works. He completed Der Alpdruck in August 1946, the year before his death. “It’s patently autobiographical,” said translator Allan Blunden. “He and his wife were both drug-addicted, and that figures largely.”</p> <p>Fallada would go on to write one more book, Alone in Berlin – in German published as <em>Jeder Stirbt Für Sich Allein </em>(“Each dies only for himself”) – in 1947, but, like Der Alpdruck, the book was not published until after his death that same year.</p> <p>Inspired by a true story, Alone in Berlin is set in Berlin in 1940 and follows the story of the couple Otto and Anna Quangel, who begin a campaign of resistance against the Nazi regime when their son is killed in France. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/23/hans-fallada-thriller-surprise-hit\">It topped charts in the US and the UK</a> when it was published for the first time in English in 2009, selling 300,000 copies in the UK, an extraordinary amount for a translated classic. A film adaptation starring Emma Thompson and Brendan Gleeson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/alone-in-berlin-review-film-festival-nazi-germany-emma-thompson\">is due out next spring</a>.</p> <p>Although other works by Fallada have been published in English – including The Drinker, A Small Circus and Wolf Among Wolves – this October marks the first English-language release for Der Alpdruck.</p> <p>“The moment I saw a sample translation, I was so impressed with it,” said publisher Henry Rosenbloom. “It’s one of only two postwar novels, along with Alone in Berlin. He was writing them around the same time, and in terms of his psyche, and what was happening in Germany at the time, they are closely related. It’s very compelling, very gripping. The thing about Fallada is that he’s got his extraordinary intensity when he writes. Every line is supercharged with vividness, and that’s especially the case with this novel, which is set in a very harrowing time in Germany, in Berlin immediately after the war. It’s a nightmare.”</p> <p>Williams writes in her biography that the novel contains inconsistencies, which she believes are “due largely to Ditzen’s inability to resolve the conflicts arising from his recent and current situation. Thus Doll, Ditzen’s protagonist and alter ego, feels at the same time both detached from and implicated in the fate of the German nation.”</p> <p>It “comes to life”, she writes, when the author describes “places with which he is familiar, like the sanatorium where Doll goes to be cured of his morphine addiction.”</p> <p>“The novel ends on a positive note, with Doll’s discharge from hospital and his optimism that ‘the nations will get their houses in order again, even Germany, this beloved, this wretched Germany, this ailing heart of Europe will become well again’,” says Williams. But it is unlikely, she adds, “that Ditzen shared this optimism”.</p>","wordcount":"868","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-03T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4p8ka","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c397199a244c7aa7512aa91bc03d812b950892a/0_1812_3898_2338/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/hans-fallada","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Hans Fallada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hans-fallada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/hans-fallada","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction-in-translation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction in translation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction-in-translation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction-in-translation","references":[]},{"id":"books/publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Publishing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alisonflood","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alison Flood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alisonflood","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alison Flood is a writer on guardian.co.uk/books and former news editor of the Bookseller</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/14/1300117336779/Alison.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"flood"}],"elements":[{"id":"6c397199a244c7aa7512aa91bc03d812b950892a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c397199a244c7aa7512aa91bc03d812b950892a/0_1812_3898_2338/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Hans Fallada (Rudolf Ditzen) in 1936.","caption":"‘Half fact, half fiction’ ...

This book is a guide to the latest exciting developments","trailText":"The transition to solar is happening faster than predicted, and now power can be stored when the sun isn’t shining. This book is a guide to the latest exciting developments","byline":"Peter Forbes","body":"<p>A sense of drift and apathy has pervaded the global warming and renewable energy debate for too long. The fossil fuel companies continue to dig coal and pump oil and gas; herbivorous idealists, scientists and ecowarriors emit their ritual opposition. The carbon load forced into the atmosphere continues to rise, and the general public seems resigned.</p> <p>But 2016 is the year this will really begin to change. Chris Goodall’s book is wonderfully up to date but, thanks to the pace of change, even he couldn’t keep up with the avalanche of news and initiatives conspiring to justify his subtitle. In May, Shell announced a major move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power\" title=\"\">into renewables</a>; on 15 May Germany received almost all its electricity from renewables; for four days from 7 to 10 May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/18/portugal-runs-for-four-days-straight-on-renewable-energy-alone\" title=\"\">Portugal did the same</a>. Goodall, who is an economist rather than a technologist or ecowarrior, explains why the change is happening now: the cost of solar electricity is falling much faster than anyone predicted. Solar power is approaching parity with fossil fuels and can only become cheaper as time goes by.</p> <p>Sunny Portugal might run fossil-free for four days but what happens when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind refuses to blow? The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows\" title=\"\">Ren21</a> global status report, while reporting that clean energy investment in 2015 ($286bn, or £217bn) was more than double that for fossil fuels ($130bn, or £99bn), added the rider: “But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels.” In the latter part of the book Goodall addresses this, explaining the missing factor – the final piece of the puzzle.</p> <p>Goodall writes that the sun supplies enough power in 90 minutes to meet the world’s total energy needs for a year. When solar and wind installations reach a certain critical level, there will be periods when they produce far more energy than can be used. Electricity cannot itself be stored but that surplus electricity and indeed sunlight itself can be used to create liquid hydrocarbons for fuel, plastics and other chemicals and methane to drive gas-fired power stations at times when renewable output dips. This is not a pipe dream. An exciting project, launched as the Global Apollo programme in 2015 and taken up, thanks to Bill Gates’ ministrations, by 20 major governments at the Paris climate conference in December 2015, is to produce liquid fuels and methane directly from carbon dioxide using sunlight – in effect, mimicking the photosynthesis that every plant accomplishes so easily.</p> <p>David Attenborough, one of the founders of the Global Apollo programme, has said: “If we could put a man on the moon in 10 years you mean to say we can’t solve the problem of getting one 500th part of the energy from the sun? It’s really a tiny technological problem.” It isn’t quite such a tiny problem, but lab scientists such as Peidong Yang at Berkeley and commercial companies such as LanzaTech in the US and Carbon Recycling International in Iceland are already showing the way.</p> <p>The surplus solar energy of summer will be squirrelled away into liquid fuel and gas for winter, rather as the sun’s past bounty produced the surplus we now consume as fossil fuels. And this project has the backing of scientists, technologists, economists, governments, great foundations, major investors and even giant energy companies from the fossil era (because the liquid fuels and gas will use the existing infrastructure: a huge economic boon).</p> <p>The “switch” is coming. It will probably take 20 years to make a major impact, but we should see the first fruits very soon. This book is the essential guide to this great benign change, although I could have done with some sense of the grandeur of what we are on the verge of achieving. For 4.5bn years, light has been pouring down on the earth, creating and sustaining the cornucopia of life. For two and a half centuries we have been living off hundreds of millions of years of stored sunlight. And for over half a century, scientists have been working to unlock the secrets of plant photosynthesis. This is now known down to the last atom, and this achievement should rank with Watson and Crick’s elucidation of the DNA structure. It’s time to put that knowledge to work for us.</p> <p>• To order <em>The Switch</em> for £8.19 (RRP £9.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/switch-437111.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture. I wrote them all; I told their stories.</p> <p>And then I started to write a book.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","byline":"Ben Myers","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/455m8"},"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jamesbaldwin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Baldwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamesbaldwin","references":[]},{"id":"books/franzkafka","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Franz Kafka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/franzkafka","references":[]},{"id":"books/fyodordostoevsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benmyers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Myers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benmyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benmyers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Myers is an author and journalist.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","byline":"Michelle Dean","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed.

high-quality, absorbing, easy-to-read African love stories set in cities as diverse as Lagos, Cape Town, and Jos and they’ve had African literary experts buzzing on Twitter for weeks.<br /></p>

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it? Marvelous! *in bridget jones&#39; voice.* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyweate\">@jeremyweate</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/XKz2ReQAqT\">pic.twitter.com/XKz2ReQAqT</a></p>&mdash; Ainehi Edoro  (@brittlepaper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/status/546265681302286336\">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missaminathula\">Amina Thula</a>’s Cape Town romance Elevator Kiss, the leading couple break all the rules when, as perfect strangers, they kiss on their first encounter. This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

Castle","byline":"Maev Kennedy","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"439","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44pzh"},"tags":[{"id":"culture/heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[],"bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142224016/Maev-Kennedy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142245982/Maev-Kennedy-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kennedy"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","wordcount":"1024","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44ev3"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum selects the definitive 100 novels written in English"},{"id":"books/malcolm-lowry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Malcolm Lowry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malcolm-lowry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/malcolm-lowry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Murder, intrigue and a beguiling protagonist make <strong>Adam LeBor</strong>’s international thriller <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062330017/the-washington-stratagem\"><strong>The Washington Stratagem</strong></a> a gripping and enticing read.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Edpilkington\">@Edpilkington</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I’m both addicted to and critical of mystery novels. You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign. From the first sentence, Gay presents the reader with the one of the most visceral and haunting depictions of trauma on the female body and spirit.</p> <p><em><strong>Sarah Galo, open intern (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahEvonne\">@SarahEvonne</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/shining-girls-lauren-beukes-review\"><strong>Lauren Beukes’s The Shining Girls</strong></a> taught me how to love the suspense novel with its precise and powerful tale of a time-traveling serial killer and the rough, young female out to stop him. Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country. Accessible without conceding authority, hugely detailed without surrendering clarity or literary flair. A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

again","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut Chris Hadfield’s You Are Here to Japanese novel The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, with just one memoir, neurosurgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm, in the lineup.</p> <p>At Waterstones, the Private Eye Annual was the chain’s Christmas No 1, followed by Martin’s autobiography, Jessie Burton’s debut novel, The Miniaturist, and Girl Online.</p> <h2><strong>Nielsen book chart for Christmas week

When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains. Open any of her books and there she is: the unbeatable, unmistakeable, irreplaceable, unforgettable Sue.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-24T09:00:10Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4488n"},"tags":[{"id":"books/sue-townsend","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Sue Townsend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sue-townsend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/sue-townsend","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","type":"series","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webTitle":"Obituaries of 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","references":[],"description":"The Observer's look back at some of those who died in 2014, remembered by those who knew them best"},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"culture/adrian-mole","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Adrian Mole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/adrian-mole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/adrian-mole","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/niccigerrard","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Nicci Gerrard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/niccigerrard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/niccigerrard","references":[],"bio":"<p>Nicci Gerrard is a novelist and author of Soham: A Story Of Our Times.

gap between what was said and what was done","byline":"Richard Coles","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","wordcount":"514","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448tj"},"tags":[{"id":"books/pdjames","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"PD
