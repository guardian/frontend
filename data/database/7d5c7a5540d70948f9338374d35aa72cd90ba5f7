        "headline":"Sinéad O'Connor's open letter to Miley Cyrus",
        "body":"<p>Dear Miley,</p><p>I wasn't going to write this letter, but today i've been dodging phone calls from various newspapers who wished me to remark upon your having said in Rolling Stone your Wrecking Ball video was designed to be similar to the one for Nothing Compares … So this is what I need to say … And it is said in the spirit of motherliness and with love.</p><p>I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos. It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether its the music business or yourself doing the pimping.</p><p>Nothing but harm will come in the long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent.<br />I am happy to hear I am somewhat of a role model for you and I hope that because of that you will pay close attention to what I am telling you.</p><p>The music business doesn't give a shit about you, or any of us. They will prostitute you for all you are worth, and cleverly make you think its what YOU wanted … and when you end up in rehab as a result of being prostituted, 'they' will be sunning themselves on their yachts in Antigua, which they bought by selling your body and you will find yourself very alone.</p><p>None of the men ogling you give a shit about you either, do not be fooled. Many's the woman mistook lust for love. If they want you sexually that doesn't mean they give a fuck about you. All the more true when you unwittingly give the impression you don't give much of a fuck about yourself. And when you employ people who give the impression they don't give much of a fuck about you either. No one who cares about you could support your being pimped … and that includes you yourself.</p><p>Yes, I'm suggesting you don't care for yourself. That has to change. You ought be protected as a precious young lady by anyone in your employ and anyone around you, including you. This is a dangerous world. We don't encourage our daughters to walk around naked in it because it makes them prey for animals and less than animals, a distressing majority of whom work in the music industry and it's associated media.</p><p>You are worth more than your body or your sexual appeal. The world of showbiz doesn't see things that way, they like things to be seen the other way, whether they are magazines who want you on their cover, or whatever … Don't be under any illusions … ALL of them want you because they're making money off your youth and your beauty … which they could not do except for the fact your youth makes you blind to the evils of show business. If you have an innocent heart you can't recognise those who do not.</p><p>I repeat, you have enough talent that you don't need to let the music business make a prostitute of you. You shouldn't let them make a fool of you either. Don't think for a moment that any of them give a flying fuck about you. They're there for the money… we're there for the music. It has always been that way and it will always be that way. The sooner a young lady gets to know that, the sooner she can be REALLY in control.</p><p>You also said in Rolling Stone that your look is based on mine. The look I chose, I chose on purpose at a time when my record company were encouraging me to do what you have done. I felt I would rather be judged on my talent and not my looks. I am happy that I made that choice, not least because I do not find myself on the proverbial rag heap now that I am almost 47 yrs of age … which unfortunately many female artists who have based their image around their sexuality, end up on when they reach middle age.</p><p>Real empowerment of yourself as a woman would be to in future refuse to exploit your body or your sexuality in order for men to make money from you. I needn't even ask the question … I've been in the business long enough to know that men are making more money than you are from you getting naked. Its really not at all cool. And its sending dangerous signals to other young women. Please in future say no when you are asked to prostitute yourself. Your body is for you and your boyfriend. It isn't for every spunk-spewing dirtbag on the net, or every greedy record company executive to buy his mistresses diamonds with.</p><p>As for the shedding of the Hannah Montana image … whoever is telling you getting naked is the way to do that does absolutely NOT respect your talent, or you as a young lady. Your records are good enough for you not to need any shedding of Hannah Montana. She's waaaaaaay gone by now … Not because you got naked but because you make great records.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, us females in the industry are role models and as such we have to be extremely careful what messages we send to other women. The message you keep sending is that its somehow cool to be prostituted … its so not cool Miley … its dangerous. Women are to be valued for so much more than their sexuality. We aren't merely objects of desire. I would be encouraging you to send healthier messages to your peers … that they and you are worth more than what is currently going on in your career. Kindly fire any motherfucker who hasn't expressed alarm, because they don't care about you.</p><p><strong>As posted on <a href=\"http://www.sineadoconnor.com/\">www.sineadoconnor.com</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418957377|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|f7f76c0d52924ed8c2c211cd04a5abc4d0a1e40a -->",

        "headline":"Labour calls on Mail titles to clean up act after memorial service gatecrashed",
        "body":"<p>Ed Miliband is demanding that Lord Rothermere mount an inquiry into the practices and culture of his flagship newspapers, arguing that an apology made by the peer after a Mail on Sunday reporter intruded on a private Miliband family memorial service did not go far enough.</p><p>Rothermere sent a private letter to Miliband on Thursday night in which he expressed regret at the episode – but rejected claims that the incident reflected a wider problem of culture and ethics at the Mail on Sunday and Daily Mail, which have been aggressively demonising the Labour leader over the past fortnight.</p><p>Labour officials said the apology from Rothermere was &quot;an important step&quot;, but noted that the letter made no reference to the controversial article published by the Daily Mail on Saturday in which the newspaper characterised Miliband's Marxist academic father, Ralph, as &quot;the man who hated Britain&quot;.</p><p>Stoking the row, a Labour spokesman said Miliband still believed the culture and practices of the two papers needed addressing and, until they were, &quot;many people will continue to believe that these newspapers are not upholding the values and decency of the British people&quot;.</p><p>Miliband had dragged Rothermere into the debate after the Labour leader wrote to the proprietor, suggesting that &quot;a common line of decency&quot; had been breached when the Mail on Sunday's reporter gatecrashed a memorial service for his uncle on Wednesday on the 29th floor of Guy's hospital in London.</p><p>Earlier in the day, the Mail on Sunday's editor, Geordie Greig, who had been seen as a candidate to one day succeed Paul Dacre on the Daily Mail, had issued his own unreserved apology for the intrusion. Two journalists, Jo Knowsley and Amy Iggulden, are understood to have been suspended.</p><p>But if Rothermere had granted the request for an inquiry, it would have amounted to a vote of no confidence in Dacre, the Daily Mail's long-serving editor, who is known for a tough and sometimes pugnacious approach. Dacre also acts as editor in chief at the two titles.</p><p>Privately, reporters were astonished that Greig moved to blame his reporters so quickly and believe that part of the job of a highly paid editor is to &quot;take the flak for the team&quot; and deal with the matter behind closed doors.</p><p>On Thursday night, Miliband gave an extensive interview to LabourList. He said: &quot;I want to know how these practices are allowed to happen. Not on the basis of being 'one rogue reporter' or 'one rogue editor', but what is it about the culture and practice of the organisation that makes these kind of things acceptable?</p><p>&quot;Because the decisions made by an individual in an organisation are shaped by the culture and practice of an organisation.&quot;</p><p>Earlier in the day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, intervened to defend Miliband. &quot;It seems to me that if anyone excels in denigrating and often vilifying a lot about modern Britain, it's the Daily Mail,&quot; Clegg said. &quot;They don't like working mothers, they don't like the BBC, they don't like members of the royal family, they don't like teachers, they don't like the English football team – the list goes on.&quot;</p><p>The circumstances leading up to Rothermere's letter are also thought to reflect tensions at the top of the newspaper group. It is understood that following Labour complaints on Wednesday night, Greig was full of remorse about the intrusion at the memorial service, saying he had not known about the actions of his reporters.</p><p>Yet in a conversation with Miliband on Thursday morning, no apology was offered, and instead, as if he was reading from a legal letter, Greig instead justified the story, adding that the reporter had identified herself. Some Labour sources concluded that Dacre – whose relationship with Greig is often described as tense – had imposed a tougher line overnight.</p><p>Following the fruitless conversation with Greig, Miliband wrote directly to Rothermere setting out the episode at the memorial service. He published the letter just before 11.45am on Thursday. Within 90 minutes, Greig issued a full apology and promised an investigation, adding it had been a &quot;terrible lapse of judgment. I unreservedly apologise for a reporter intruding into a private memorial service for a relative of Ed Miliband,&quot; Greig said. &quot;The reporter was sent without my knowledge; it was a decision which was wrong. I would further like to apologise to members of the family and friends attending the service for this deplorable intrusion.&quot;</p><p>The Mail on Sunday journalist arrived at the memorial service held at Guy's hospital for Miliband's uncle, Professor Harry Keen, a distinguished doctor who died this year. She is understood to have twice accosted distressed family members to ask them to comment on the Ralph Miliband controversy. They refused to do so. Labour sources said the memorial service was a private event and it is understood the reporter learned about it from a Facebook page.</p><p>In his letter to Rothermere, who inherited the Mail titles in 1998, Miliband wrote: &quot;My wider family, who are not in public life, feel understandably appalled and shocked that this can have happened. Sending a reporter to my late uncle's memorial crosses a line of common decency.&quot;</p><p>Labour officials were grateful for Greig's apology, but stressed Miliband in his letter had proposed that Rothermere conduct an investigation into &quot;who is responsible for the culture and practices of these newspapers which jar so badly with the values of your readers&quot;.</p><p>Some Labour officials believe the Mail titles operate under a bullying culture in which some reporters feel forced to put pursuit of a story before ethics.</p><p>Labour also wants, if possible, to expose before the election any newspaper efforts to portray Miliband as somehow apart from mainstream British culture.</p><p>Miliband declined to refer the matter to the Press Complaints Commission. Labour described it as a toothless tiger, not least because Dacre was chairman of the editor's code of practice committee, which sets standards for journalists.</p><p>Last night the issue was discussed on BBC1's Question Time. The Huffington Post's Mehdi Hasan was applauded by the audience when he asked who hated Britain more: Ralph Miliband, who he noted served in the Royal Navy during the second world war, or the &quot;immigrant-bashing, woman-hating, Muslim-smearing, NHS-undermining, gay-bashing Daily Mail&quot;. He also contrasted the newspaper's founder, Lord Rothermere, whom he accused of siding with the Nazis before the conflict, with Ralph Miliband.</p><p>The Daily Mail columnist Quentin Letts attacked his sister paper for sending a journalist to the memorial service, calling it &quot;clearly indefensible&quot;. But he was derided by the audience when he claimed the Mail was &quot;outside the political village&quot;.The PCC's chairman, Lord Hunt, issued a statement saying he was deeply concerned by the episode. The PCC said there had been 726 complaints from the public about the Daily Mail's original article.</p><p>The Conservative chairman of the culture select committee, John Whittingdale, also said the intrusion at the memorial service was a clear breach of the code.</p><p>The dispute comes by coincidence days before a crucial meeting of the privy council, before which ministers will decide whether to accept a royal charter enshrining the press industry's version of self-regulation. The meeting could reject the industry's version and then seal the one proposed by parliament, an outcome most newspaper groups strongly oppose.</p><p>It is generally agreed that the behaviour of the Mail on Sunday reporter would breach basic elements of press ethics code drawn up under either royal charter.</p><p>Lord Justice Leveson, the judge who chaired the inquiry into press ethics, is also due to appear in front of two parliamentary select committees next week.</p><p>Alastair Campbell, the former press secretary to Tony Blair, accused Dacre of being &quot;a bully and a coward&quot;, adding: &quot;He hates anyone who gets in the way of his rather warped and twisted view of the world.&quot; If he had an ounce of decency, he said, Dacre would retire to his Scottish estate with his &pound;15m pension. An online petition had garnered more than 30,000 signatures calling on Dacre to defend the role of the Mail in the UK's national debate.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419005985|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|4d4d392674b96c6f05c9892aa42e025dff4dfe8b -->",

        "body":"<p>The White House has ruled out using a legal veto to force Congress to extend the US debt limit as conservative Republicans threaten to take what the Treasury described as a potentially catastrophic economic standoff to the brink of a 17 October deadline.</p><p>President Obama had been encouraged by senior Democrats to call the bluff of hardline Republicans who want to add a debt limit refusal to an existing spending impasse that has already shut down much of the federal government.</p><p>Some Democrats argue that powers granted under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which was introduced to control southern states after the civil war, would allow the president to unilaterally borrow money if there was such a threat to the credit-worthiness of the US.</p><p>\"Using the 14th would show the Republicans he means business,\" one former aide to Bill Clinton told the Guardian last week.</p><p>But the White House ruled out the option on Thursday, ending days of Washington debate about whether this obscure legal authority might provide a way out for Obama – at least from one half of Republicans' fiscal pincer movement. \"The administration does not believe the 14th amendment gives power to the president to ignore the debt ceiling,\" said spokesman Jay Carney.</p><p>\"The fact that there is significant controversy around the president's authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to Congress raising the debt ceiling and would not be taken seriously by the market.\"</p><p>With options dwindling for forcing Republicans to drop their fight, Obama faces a protracted battle linking both spending and borrowing authority in a combined budget standoff.</p><p>Some conservative lawmakers are even questioning administration insistences that Congress must increase the debt limit by 17 October.</p><p>Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, one of several Republicans who first urged speaker John Boehner to link the budget with their demands to scrap healthcare reform, said the government shutdown may change the debt deadline by slowing down spending. \"I don't know if the drop dead date on the debt limit is going to be 17 October because the government is not spending any money now,\" he told the Guardian. \"This might get pushed back a little bit further.\"</p><p>Sensenbrenner also argued that public sympathy was shifting towards Republicans as the government shutdown wore on. \"What I'm hearing from the public, mostly from phone calls that we get here and in my Wisconsin office, is that for a while Republicans were getting blamed for stonewalling but after Sunday – when we sent five proposals over to the Senate – the pendulum is starting to swing the other direction,\" he said.</p><p>\"Where the public is at now is a lot different than in previous debt ceiling fights including August 2011. People are concerned about the debt because the debt has really ballooned and the president has got to be much more specific and convincing than just saying we've got to raise it so the government can pay its bills.\"</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, the US Treasury insisted that the shutdown would not affect its estimate of when the government would run out of cash, and warned that the US was heading toward a catastrophic event that could plunge the country into financial crisis.</p><p>A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic,\" Treasury said in a report. \"The negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse,\" the report said.</p><p>A row over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to a historic downgrade of the US's debt and panic on stock markets worldwide. \"As we saw two years ago, prolonged uncertainty over whether our nation will pay its bills in full and on time hurts our economy,\" Lew said.</p><p>\"Postponing a debt ceiling increase to the very last minute is exactly what our economy does not need – a self-inflicted wound harming families and businesses. Our nation has worked hard to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and Congress must act now to lift the debt ceiling before that recovery is put in jeopardy.\"</p><p>The report came as US investors appeared to be getting increasingly nervous about the impact of the government shutdown and the upcoming debt ceiling debate. The Dow was down more than 160 points in morning trading and has closed down eight of the last 10 trading days.</p><p>The Treasury report said that the last row over the debt ceiling, which was resolved at the 11th hour, had persistent, negative consequences on the wider economy. \"The financial markets stress that developed in August of 2011 persisted for many months. Then, as now, the economic expansion was vulnerable to adverse shocks,\" Treasury said.</p><p>Even the possibility of a default could decrease household wealth, increase borrowing costs and shake business confidence, the report said. \"In the event of a default, the US economy could be plunged into a recession worse than any seen since the great depression.\"  </p><p>The US dollar and Treasury securities are at the center of the international finance system. In the catastrophic event that a debt limit impasse were to lead to a default on Treasury securities, financial markets could be shaken to their core as was seen in late 2008,\" the Treasury said. </p><p>The Treasury reached its borrowing limit in May and has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to fund payments ever since. Treasury secretary Jack Lew expects to exhaust those measures by 17 October and the congressional budget office expects the nation could start defaulting on obligations by 22 October unless swift action is taken.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419013509|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|8fa7680a6c61065b8a5ab1c010124947485706de -->",

        "headline":"The Snowden files: why the British public should be worried about GCHQ",
        "body":"<p>In August, the editor of the Guardian rang me up and asked if I would spend a week in New York, reading the GCHQ files whose UK copy the Guardian was forced to destroy. His suggestion was that it might be worthwhile to look at the material not from a perspective of making news but from that of a novelist with an interest in the way we live now.</p><p>I took Alan Rusbridger up on his invitation, after an initial reluctance that was based on two main reasons. The first of them was that I don't share the instinctive sense felt by many on the left that it is always wrong for states to have secrets. I'd put it more strongly than that: democratic states need spies.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009941'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801639/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: reading illustration' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The philosopher Karl Popper, observing the second world war from his academic post in New Zealand, came up with a great title for his major work of political thought: The Open Society and Its Enemies. It is, in its way, a shocking phrase – why would the open society have enemies? (But then, the title of Charles Repington's The First World War, published in 1920, was shocking too, because it implied that there would be another one.)</p><p>We do have enemies, though, enemies who are in deadly earnest; enemies who wish you reading this dead, whoever you are, for no other reason than that you belong to a society like this one. We have enemies who are seeking to break into our governments' computers, with the potential to destroy our infrastructure and, literally, make the lights go out; we have enemies who want to kill as many of us, the more innocent the better, as possible, by any means possible, as a deliberate strategy; we have enemies who want to develop nuclear weapons, and thereby vastly raise the stakes for international diplomacy and the threat of terrorism; and we have common-or-garden serious criminals, who also need watching and catching.</p><p>I get all that. It doesn't thrill me to bits that the state has to use the tools of electronic surveillance to keep us safe, but it seems clear to me that it does, and that our right to privacy needs to be qualified, just as our other rights are qualified, in the interest of general security and the common good.<a name=\"reassuringread\"></a></p><h2>Reassuring read</h2><p>My week spent reading things that were never meant to be read by outsiders was, from this point of view, largely reassuring. Most of what GCHQ does is exactly the kind of thing we all want it to do. It takes an interest in places such as the Horn of Africa, Iran, and North Korea; it takes an interest in energy security, nuclear proliferation, and in state-sponsored computer hacking.</p><p>There doesn't seem to be much in the documents about serious crime, for which GCHQ has a surveillance mandate, but it seems that much of this activity is covered by warrants that belong to other branches of the security apparatus. Most of this surveillance is individually targeted: it concerns specific individuals and specific acts (or intentions to act), and as such, it is not the threat.</p><p>Even Julian Assange thinks that, and said as much in his alarming and perceptive book Cypherpunks: \"Individual targeting is not the threat.\" When the state has specific enemies and knows who they are and the kind of harm they intend, it is welcome to target them to make the rest of our polity safe. I say again, on the evidence I've seen, this is mainly what GCHQ does. I would add that the Guardian and its partners have gone to a lot of trouble to prevent any unnecessarily damaging detail about this work being published.<a name=\"problemsandrisks\"></a></p><h2>Problems and risks</h2><p>The problems with GCHQ are to be found in the margins of the material – though they are at the centre of the revelations that have been extracted from the Snowden disclosures, and with good reason. The problem and the risk comes in the area of mass capture of data, or strategic surveillance. This is the kind of intelligence gathering that sucks in data from everyone, everywhere: from phones, internet use from email to website visits, social networking, instant messaging and video calls, and even areas such as video gaming; in short, everything digital.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009942'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802093/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: magnifying glass' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In the US, the Prism programme may have given the NSA access to the servers of companies such as Google and Facebook; in the UK, GCHQ has gained a similar degree of access via its Tempora programme, and the two of them together have a cable- and network-tapping capabilities collectively called Upstream, which have the ability to intercept anything that travels over the internet. This data is fed into a database called XKeyscore, which allows analysts to extract information \"in real time\", ie immediately, from a gigantic amount of hoovered-up data.</p><p>In addition, the NSA has encouraged technology companies to install secret weaknesses or \"backdoors\" into their commercially available, supposedly secure products. They have spent a very great deal of money ($250m a year alone on weakening encryption), on breaking commercially available security products. Other revelations have been published in Der Spiegel, and concern the NSA exploitation of technology such as the iPhone.<a name=\"accessallareas\"></a></p><h2>Access all areas</h2><p>What this adds up to is a new thing in human history: with a couple of clicks of a mouse, an agent of the state can target your home phone, or your mobile, or your email, or your passport number, or any of your credit card numbers, or your address, or any of your log-ins to a web service.</p><p>Using that \"selector\", the state can get access to all the content of your communications, via any of those channels; can gather information about anyone you communicate with, can get a full picture of all your internet use, can track your location online and offline. It can, in essence, know everything about you, including – thanks to the ability to look at your internet searches – what's on your mind.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009943'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820803133/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: people reading' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>To get a rough version of this knowledge, a state once had to bug phones manually, break into houses and intercept letters, and deploy teams of trained watchers to follow your whereabouts. Even then it was a rough and approximate process, vulnerable to all sorts of human error and countermeasures. It can now have something much better than that, a historically unprecedented panoply of surveillance, which it can deploy in a matter of seconds.</p><p>This process is not without supervision, of course. In order to target you via one of these \"selectors\" – that's the technical term – the agent of the state will have to type into a box on his or her computer screen a Miranda number, to show that the process is taking place in response to a specific request for information, and will also need to select a justification under the Human Rights Act. That last isn't too arduous, because the agent can choose the justification from a drop-down menu. This is the way we live now.<a name=\"britishreaction\"></a></p><h2>British reaction</h2><p>And yet nobody, at least in Britain, seems to care. In the UK there has been an extraordinary disconnect between the scale and seriousness of what Snowden has revealed, and the scale and seriousness of the response. One of the main reasons for that, I think, is that while some countries are interested in rights, in Britain we are more focused on wrongs.</p><p>In Europe and the US, the lines between the citizen and the state are based on an abstract conception of the individual's rights, which is then framed in terms of what the state needs to do.</p><p>That's not the case in Britain: although we do have rights, they were arrived at by specific malfeasances and disasters on the part of the state.</p><p>Every right that limits the behaviour of the police, from the need for search warrants to the (now heavily qualified) right to silence to habeas corpus itself, comes from the fact that the authorities abused their powers.</p><p>This helps to explain why Snowden's revelations, perceived as explosive in American and Europe by both the political right and left, have been greeted here with a weirdly echoing non-response. In the rights-based tradition, the flagrant abuse of individual privacy is self-evidently a bad thing, a (literally) warrantless extension of the power of the state.</p><p>Here in the UK, because we've been given no specific instances of specific wrongs having been committed, the story has found it hard to gain traction. Even if there were such instances – just as there were 2,776 rule violations by the NSA last year alone – we wouldn't know anything about them, because the system of judicial inspections at GCHQ is secret.</p><p>So it is a perfectly sealed mechanism: we aren't interested in rights in the abstract, and we are prevented by law from hearing about any of the specific abuses which might start to focus our attention.</p><p>The documents make clear that GCHQ's eavesdropping abilities are on a scale unmatched anywhere in the free world, and they privately boast about the \"more permissive legal environment\" in the UK – and yet, nobody seems to care. It's tragicomic that the surveillance story which most gripped the public imagination concerned Poole borough council's use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) to spy on a family suspected of cheating in regard to school catchment areas.<a name=\"helpingthebadguys\"></a></p><h2>Helping the bad guys</h2><p>It's worth taking a moment to ask how helpful the publication of information about this is to the bad guys. (Girls too. But mainly guys.)</p><p>The answer is evident, I think, in the under-remarked fact that Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad didn't even have a telephone line running into it. In other words he not only didn't use the net, computers or phones in any way at all, ever, he was suspicious of the actual physical apparatus itself.</p><p>This means that the bad guys know very well that they have to be careful. (It should also be noted that the absence of any electronic footprint at the Abbottabad compound was – as depicted in the movie Zero Dark Thirty – a sign to the spies that something fishy was afoot. Nobody innocent has no electronic footprint.)</p><p>Some of the jihadi materials I read in the GCHQ documents make it clear that the terrorists are very well aware of these issues. There is a stinging jeer in one jihadi text, apropos a Swedish documentary that made clear certain bugging capabilities in Ericsson's mobile phones: \"It is customary in the Scandinavian countries to publish such helpful materials.\"</p><p>While the broad details of general strategic surveillance are shocking and need to be known, the thing that would be helpful to the bad guys is the publication of the specific technical details. These the Guardian and its partners have gone to great lengths to keep secret.<a name=\"theunkeepablesecret\"></a></p><h2>The unkeepable secret</h2><p>Bear in mind also that these documents were widely circulated: out of the 4.9 million Americans with access to classified information, 480,000 private contractors in the US had the \"top-secret\" security clearance issued to Snowden.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820803417/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: man on roof' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If hundreds of thousands of people had access to these secrets, how secure were they? The NSA and GCHQ had no idea that Snowden had this material, and apparently still don't know exactly what is in it – which is one reason they've been panicking and freaking out.</p><p>But if they didn't know that Snowden had copied it, how could they possibly be sure that someone else hasn't also taken a copy and slipped it to the Chinese or Russians or Iranians or al-Qaida? It was cheeky of Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser in the Cabinet Office, to harrumph about \"very poor information security practices\" on the part of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald who was detained at Heathrow under anti-terror laws.</p><p>Our spooks lost at least 58,000 pages of classified documents to a US civilian sitting at a workstation in Hawaii, and did so without realising it had happened. In effect they're saying, \"your secrets are safe with us, except when we lose them\".</p><p>There's one further conclusion to draw from the fact that so many people had access to this material. It means that this story would at some point have come out. A programme of this scale in a modern democracy, involving hundreds of thousands of people with access to the fact of total internet surveillance, was an unkeepable secret. It may be no comfort to Snowden as he faces his future, but someone somewhere would eventually have done what he did. Some dams are fated to burst.<a name=\"what'snew\"></a></p><h2>What's new</h2><p>This brings me to my second reservation about looking at the material: the question of whether it contained anything that we didn't already know. In the Tony Scott movie Enemy of the State, the paranoid former NSA spook played by Gene Hackman lays it out with complete clarity: \"The government's been in bed with the entire communications business since the 40s,\" he says. \"They have infected everything. They can get into your bank statement, computer files, email, listen to your phone calls.\"</p><p>That movie came out in 1998, and was a hit, seen by many millions, so even then, in some sense, everybody knew about the work of the NSA/GCHQ. People who kept informed on these subjects have for decades been careful about using specific words over the phone, especially over transatlantic phonelines.</p><p>I remember Christopher Hitchens, at the time that concern about Salman Rushdie's welfare was at its peak, wouldn't use his name over the phone but would instead refer to \"our mutual friend\".</p><p>So in some sense, perhaps it's true that everybody knew. This would be analogous to the manner in which we all know surveillance is pervasive in police work, and yet police methods are by law forbidden from being used in evidence, or indeed even mentioned in court. The ban on mentioning police surveillance is there because they don't want us to realise how much of it there is. We all know that, and yet it doesn't seem to matter much. Perhaps the GCHQ stuff was the same?</p><p>I've changed my mind about that. It was changing anyway as I thought more about the meaning of Snowden's exposures, and it has changed more still now that I've looked at them first-hand.<a name=\"broaddefinitions\"></a></p><h2>Broad definitions</h2><p>I've said that the concerns over GCHQ are at the margins of what it does: but those margins are very broad. They especially concern things that are referred to in the documents as \"SD\", which means \"sigint development\". \"Sigint\" is signal intelligence, which is what GCHQ does. \"Development\" means – well, that's the crux of it. It means finding out new things, exploring new technologies, and developing new ways of finding \"targets\".</p><p>When you look at the documents, it appears to be the case that SD provides the legal basis for mass surveillance of the kind revealed in the Tempora and Prism programmes. The mandate of GCHQ – which by the way didn't have a legal basis of any kind until 1994 – is surveillance for reasons of \"national security, economic well being, and serious crime\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009945'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801498/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: socket illustration\nLanchester NSA illustration: imagine spying through electrical sockets' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;\n</figcaption></figure><p>The main law concerning its activities is Ripa. If you read this 2000 act (which, by the way, I don't recommend, since it's tortured and laborious even by the standards of statute-speak), it's clear that the main focus of its provisions is targeted surveillance. It's about what the spies and cops are allowed to do to catch specific bad guys.</p><p>Ripa is pretty broad in its drafting, and it seems apparent that the intention was to let the authorities do anything they wanted with phones and email. And yet, it nowhere explicitly allows the mass interception of communications by people about whom the state has no reason for suspecting anything – which is what programmes such as Tempora and Prism permit.<a name=\"behindthetimes\"></a></p><h2>Behind the times</h2><p>The law always lags behind technology, that's inevitable. If you look at the first version of the modern Official Secrets Act, which was made law in 1911 and is still the main broad statement of government secrecy in effect today, its first provisions concern the making of \"maps and charts\".</p><p>It is evident that the kind of spying on the lawmakers' minds concerns a chap in plus-fours claiming that he's making drawings of seabirds, only why has he accidentally made accurate sketches of that nearby naval base, and why does he have a heavy German accent … ?</p><p>The current spying laws continue to lag behind reality, not only because the spies are less concerned with mysterious birdwatchers, but because life itself has changed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009946'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801773/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: CCTV illustration' width='460' height='440' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Formerly, the activities for which the spies were on guard were visible acts of wrongdoing and intelligence-gathering: enemies making maps of naval bases, or breaking into offices, or bribing civil servants, or seducing and blackmailing other spies, or any of the other ways in which they could try to steal secrets.</p><p>In the case of modern signals intelligence, this is no longer true. Life has changed. It has changed because of the centrality of computers and digital activity to every aspect of modern living. Digital life is central to work: many of us, perhaps most of us, spend most of our working day using a computer. Digital life is central to our leisure: a huge portion of our discretionary activity has a digital component, even things which look like they are irreducibly un-digital, from cycling to cooking.</p><p>(I once happened to visit Google's offices in Victoria, where there's a live stream of people's queries on a huge flat screen. Most of them were in Japanese. My host, who speaks Japanese, glanced at them and looked at her watch. \"Recipes,\" she said. \"It's 7pm in Japan, people have just got in from work and are thinking about what to cook.\")</p><p>As for our relationships and family lives, that has, especially for younger people, become a digital-first activity. Take away Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging and Skype and YouTube, and then – it's hard to imagine, but try – take away the mobile phone, and see the yawning gap where all human interaction used to take place. About the only time we don't use computers is when we're asleep – that's unless we have a gadget that tracks our sleep, or monitors our house temperature, or our burglar alarm, or whatever.</p><p>This is the central point about what our spies and security services can now do. They can, for the first time, monitor everything about us, and they can do so with a few clicks of a mouse and – to placate the lawyers – a drop-down menu of justifications.<a name=\"surveillanceambitions\"></a></p><h2>Surveillance ambitions</h2><p>Looking at the GCHQ papers, it is clear that there is an ambition to get access to everything digital. That's what engineers do: they seek new capabilities. When it applies to the people who wish us harm, that's fair enough. Take a hypothetical, but maybe not unthinkable, ability to eavesdrop on any room via an electrical socket. From the GCHQ engineers' point of view, they would do that if they could. And there are a few people out there on whom it would be useful to be able to eavesdrop via an electrical socket. But the price of doing so would be a society that really did have total surveillance. Would it be worth it? Is the risk worth the intrusion?</p><p>That example might sound far-fetched, but trust me, it isn't quite as far fetched as all that, and the basic intention on the part of the GCHQ engineers – to get everything – is there.</p><p>Consider the direction in which we're moving. Britain has more CCTV cameras than anywhere else in the world, by a huge margin. Nobody knows how many CCTV cameras there are in the country, but the most respectable estimate seems to be the one made by Cheshire police in 2011, which came up with a number of 1.85m. Add to this the capacity for facial recognition software, which already exists and is improving sharply.</p><p>Further add the capacity for surveillance brought by the \"internet of things\", involving the inclusion of internet-enabled computer chips in everything from cars (where they already are, in high-end models) to fridges to plants (which will tweet their minders when they need to be watered). This might sound like science fiction, but the current estimate is that there will be 20bn such devices in use worldwide by 2020.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009947'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801934/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: keyhole' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Add to this the fact that a lot of this electronic potential gives access not just to external real-world data – our locations, our conversations, our contacts books – but to the inside of our heads. I call this the \"knowing you're gay\" test. Most of us know someone who has plucked up the courage to reveal their homosexuality, only to be cheerfully told by friends and family, \"oh, we've known that for years\".</p><p>Now, though, search engines know facts about people's thoughts and fantasies long before anyone else does. To put it crudely, Google doesn't just know you're gay before you tell your mum; it knows you're gay before you do. And now GCHQ does too.<a name=\"newsociety\"></a></p><h2>New society</h2><p>What this means is that we're moving towards a new kind of society. Britain is already the most spied on, monitored and surveilled democratic society there has ever been. This doesn't seem to have been discussed or debated, and I don't remember ever being asked to vote for it. As for how this trend appears in the GCHQ documents, there is something of a gap between how the spies talk in public and how they can occasionally be found to talk in private.</p><p>It is startling to see, for instance, that the justification for the large-scale interception of everybody's internet use seems to be a clause in Ripa allowing interception of \"at least one end foreign\" communications. Whack on to this a general purpose certificate from the secretary of state, and a general warrant, and bingo, this allows full access to traffic via companies such as Google and Facebook – because their servers are located overseas. I can't believe that that was the intention of the people who drafted Ripa, who were surely thinking more of people taking phone calls from moody bits of Waziristan, rather than your nan searching for cheaper tights.</p><p>There is a revealing moment in the most recent piece written for the Guardian by Sir David Omand, former head of GCHQ. He said that \"the real debate we should be having … is about what privacy in a cyber-connected world can realistically mean given the volumes of data we hand over to the private sector in return for our everyday convenience, and the continued need for warranted access for security and law enforcement\".</p><p>That's a total non-sequitur: Omand seems to think that just because we hand data over to Google and Facebook the government automatically has the right to access it. It's as if, thanks to a global shortage of sticky gum, envelopes can no longer be sealed, so as a result the government awards itself a new right to mass-intercept and read everybody's letters.<a name=\"stayingwithinthelaw\"></a></p><h2>Staying within the law</h2><p>All through the GCHQ material there is a tremendous emphasis on the legal basis of its operations, particularly in respect of article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which grants: \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\"</p><p>It is repeatedly stated that \"GCHQ operates within the law\" and that \"GCHQ does it legally\" and that surveillance always has to be \"justified, necessary and proportionate\". Good – it would be terrifying if that weren't the case. But if GCHQ seldom breaks the law, it's because the law is so broadly drafted and interpreted it's almost impossible to break.</p><p>Also, in the GCHQ papers there are occasional glimpses of a different attitude, usually to be found in slides which are marked as \"hidden\" in PowerPoint presentations, or in the presenters' notes to other slides. (Many of the clearest documents are internal GCHQ briefings laid out in the form of PowerPoint talks. I was reminded of Malcolm Gladwell's great joke, in response to whether he needed audio-visual aids for a lecture: \"All power corrupts, but PowerPoint corrupts absolutely.\")</p><p>For instance, a legal briefing on the Human Rights Act lists the instances in which it is legal for the state to breach article 8: \"In the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"</p><p>The notes make the point that national security, public safety and serious crime are the three current reasons for which GCHQ is allowed to eavesdrop, but there is a chilling addition: \"'Just' 3 at the moment. No reason why GCHQ's remit would not be changed in the future but this is what we are allowed to do at the moment.\"</p><p>It's usually only in books that people's blood runs cold, but mine did when I read that. \"Just\" three at the moment: in other words, there are \"just\" three reasons why GCHQ can violate article 8, the right to privacy. But that could change. It would be legal in human rights terms for GCHQ's mandate to cover \"the prevention of disorder\", not to mention \"the protection of health or morals\".<a name=\"extendingstatepower\"></a></p><h2>Extending state power</h2><p>The totalitarian state in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four would need no broader legal justification than that: it really does allow a government to do anything it likes. It was at this point that I became convinced that Snowden's revelations are not just interesting or important but vital, because the state is about to get powers that no state has ever had, and we need to have a public debate about those powers and what their limits are to be.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009948'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802981/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: ' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>At a moment of austerity and with a general sense that our state's ability to guarantee prosperity for its citizens is in retreat, that same state is about to make the biggest advance ever in its security powers. In public, the state is shrinking; in private, it is shrinking until it gets just small enough to fit into our phones, our computers, our cars, our fridges, our bedrooms, our thoughts and intentions.</p><p>Another secret slide is headed SRA – a mysterious acronym that is not explained. The slide concerns 2P intelligence, 2P meaning second party, ie other countries in the \"five eyes\" alliance of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It says that an SRA, whatever it is, \"authorises receipt of 2P intelligence on UK based targets where GCHQ has no authorisation\".</p><p>Since GCHQ can spy on any foreign national it wants, this can only mean the surveillance of people on whom it isn't legal for GCHQ to spy. That looks to me an awful lot like a means of obtaining permission to spy on people – British citizens? – outside the law.</p><p>We've heard a lot of talk about the distinction between content and metadata – content being the stuff inside communications, metadata the who and when and where and how of the communication, but not the content. The idea is that the spooks focus on the metadata and ignore the content – so they notice your nan logging on to the net, where and when and for how long, but don't read the actual content of the search.</p><p>This distinction is written into the law in both the US and the UK. This would be reassuring, if the notes didn't say this: \"GCHQ policy is to treat it pretty much all the same whether it's content or metadata.\" Put all these together and it is no wonder the documents contain a boast about the UK's \"more permissive legal environment\".<a name=\"A new panopticon\"></a></p><h2>A new panopticon</h2><p>The prospect this presents is something like the \"panopticon\" which Enlightenment philosophers advocated as a design for the ideal prison in the 18th century, and about which the French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote in his book Discipline and Punish. \"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relations in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.\"</p><p>When I first read Foucault's account of the panopticon, where the individual at the centre can simultaneously see and judge a whole multitude of other individuals, I thought it was brilliant but overheated. Now, it actually seems like somebody's plan. That's what we risk becoming: a society which is in crucial respects a giant panopticon, where the people with access to our secrets can see, hear, intercept and monitor everything.</p><p>Members of the security establishment always want more abilities, more tools, more powers for themselves and fewer rights for us. They never say \"thanks a lot, we're good from here, we have everything we need\".<a name=\"publicenemies\"></a></p><h2>Public enemies</h2><p>From their point of view – the point of view of wanting ever more invasive secret powers – al-Qaida and its affiliates are the perfect enemy. Because al-Qaida combines the characteristics of an ideology and a network, it is everywhere, it is invisible, it is never more dangerous than when you can't see it.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009949'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802370/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: person arrested' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The new emphasis on anticipating the actions of \"lone wolf\" terrorists raises this danger even higher: the risk of terrorism from people who have never been caught committing a crime, who have no known terrorist affiliations, who are invisible, who could be anywhere … It is the ultimate version of the scare story that used to be called \"reds under the bed\". How can the state every hope to protect us against people like that, if not by permanent, omnipresent, ever-increasing surveillance?</p><p>If we are going to remake society in the image of the fight against terrorism, and put that secret fight at the heart of our democratic order – which is the way we're heading – we need to discuss it, and in public.<a name=\"exaggeratedrisks\"></a></p><h2>Exaggerated risks</h2><p>When we do so, it might be helpful to consider something called the banana equivalent dose (BED). This is a term used in physics to measure the amount of radiation emitted by a banana. It is a number popular with people who think the dangers of radiation are exaggerated, and who use it to make the point that almost everything is radioactive. A dental x-ray has a BED of 50; serious radiation poisoning takes a BED of 20m; sleeping next to someone for one night has a BED of 0.5 and living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant for a year has a BED of 0.9.</p><p>Since 9/11, 53 people have been killed by terrorists in the UK. Every one of those deaths is tragic. So is every one of the 26,805 deaths to have occurred on Britain's roads between 2002 and 2012 inclusive, an average of 6.67 deaths a day. Let's call that the SDRD, standard daily road deaths. The terrorist toll for 12 years comes to 0.0121 SDRD. This means that 12 years of terrorism has killed as many people in the UK as eight days on our roads.</p><p>The security establishment will immediately reply that this figure leaves out deaths of terrorism victims abroad and the lives saved by its secret actions, none of which can be made known without jeopardising current and future operations.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419009950'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802227/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: person walking' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Is that enough of a justification for the scale and extent of what is happening to our privacy? Is the current supervisory regime – which involves senior judges inspecting GCHQ's actions, \"within the circle of secrecy\", and issuing a secret report – adequate to the scale of the state's powers?</p><p>I'd repeat the point that as digital technology, and the ability to enact surveillance through technology, expands its remit, those powers are increasing almost by the day.</p><p>In the UK we have a strange sleepy indifference to questions of surveillance and privacy. \"The innocent have nothing to fear,\" says William Hague. But who gets to define who is innocent? Who gets to say what is contradictory to the \"economic wellbeing\" of the UK? If the innocent have nothing to fear, why is the state reading so many of our emails, and sucking up so much metadata from our phones and computers, under the umbrella of \"sigint development\"?<a name=\"policestate\"></a></p><h2>Police state</h2><p>People misunderstand what a police state is. It isn't a country where the police strut around in jackboots; it's a country where the police can do anything they like. Similarly, a security state is one in which the security establishment can do anything it likes.</p><p>We are right on the verge of being an entirely new kind of human society, one involving an unprecedented penetration by the state into areas which have always been regarded as private. Do we agree to that? If we don't, this is the last chance to stop it happening. Our rulers will say what all rulers everywhere have always said: that their intentions are good, and we can trust them. They want that to be a sufficient guarantee.<a name=\"myproposals\"></a></p><h2>My proposals</h2><p>There's no need for us to advance any further down this dark road. Here are two specific proposals. The first is that the commissioners who supervise GCHQ include, alongside the senior judges who currently do the work, at least one or two public figures who are publicly known for their advocacy of human rights and government openness. The \"circle of secrecy\" needs to include some people who are known for not being all that keen on the idea of secrecy.</p><p>My second proposal is for a digital bill of rights. The most important proviso on the bill would be that digital surveillance must meet the same degree of explicit targeting as that used in interception of mail and landlines. No more \"one end overseas\" and \"sigint development\" loopholes to allow the mass interception of communications. There can be no default assumption that the state is allowed access to our digital life.</p><p>As the second most senior judge in the country, Lord Hoffmann, said in 2004 about a previous version of our anti-terrorism laws: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws like these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-filesw.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">Follow all the latest developments on the NSA from the Guardian</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418980635|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|f2a17b9b45d8563c5b4f8655b2e05ac6842b01d7 -->",

        "body":"<p>A woman with a young child in her car attempted to breach a White House checkpoint on Thursday, prompting a high-speed chase through the security-heavy streets of Washington that&nbsp;ended near the US Capitol when police shot her dead.</p> <p>Government buildings on Capitol Hill were placed on lockdown and members of Congress sheltered in their offices as the incident unfolded.</p> <p>Capitol police said the woman was chased between the two centres of government, striking a police vehicle shortly before she was stopped. Officers shot the woman dead. The one-year-old child was unhurt.</p> <p>Less than three weeks after a fatal shooting at the nearby navy yard left 12 dead, the incident put security forces on full alert and led to the temporary suspension of business in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers were debating the government shutdown.</p> <p>The incident began at about 2.10pm ET when the woman attempted to get past an outer security checkpoint at the White House. She was challenged by secret service officers, and a police chase ensued. At one point, police cars surrounded the vehicle, but the woman reversed into one of them and drove off again. The chase eventually ended 1.7 miles from the White House, the US Capitol,&nbsp;where the woman was shot.</p> <p>Witnesses&nbsp;reported hearing several \"loud bangs&rdquo; outside the Capitol complex.&nbsp;Video later emerged of a black sedan being chased at speed around the heavily-guarded roads close to the US Senate buildings.</p> <p>\"We heard three, four, five pops,\" said Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat who was walking from the&nbsp;Capitol&nbsp;to an office building across the street. Police ordered Casey and nearby tourists to crouch behind a car for protection, then hustled everyone into the&nbsp;Capitol, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>\"There were multiple shots fired and the air was filled with gunpowder,\" said Berin Szoka, whose office at a technology thinktank overlooks the shooting scene.</p> <p>Cathy Lanier, chief of the Metropolitan police department in Washington, said the incident was not an accident and that the suspect attempted to breach two security barriers. \"This was a lengthy pursuit,\" Lanier said.</p> <p>Capitol police chief Kim Dine said the two scenes were quickly secured after a short security lockdown meant hundreds of government staff were told to &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo;. He told reporters on Capitol Hill:&nbsp;&ldquo;We have no information that this was related to terrorism or is anything other than an isolated incident.\"</p> <p>He confirmed that a Capitol police officer was hurt. The injured officer was evacuated by a helicopter which landed on the lawn in front of Congress. The officer was not seriously injured.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419000353|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|6764f647feff59546324c012ffe4c03e29708f54 -->",

        "headline":"Sinéad O'Connor – don't assume Miley Cyrus is a victim",
        "body":"<p>Sinéad O'Connor's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">open letter to Miley Cyrus</a> isn't entirely helpful to women. While O'Connor's warnings about young artists being exploited by the music industry should be taken seriously, the implication is that naked or other sexual images of women inevitably entails the woman being a victim. Why should this be the case? How boring a world without any images of nudity would be. There would be no celebration of the immense power of sexuality, no eroticism.</p><p>O'Connor doesn't use the word objectification in her letter, but the idea that looking upon women's naked or semi-naked bodies necessarily means the disempowerment of women underlies her words. When O'Connor writes, \"you ought be protected as a precious young lady\", and says that female nudity makes young women \"prey for animals and less than animals\", she equates women's bodies with vulnerability and violence.</p><p>It's a similar rhetoric to that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/10/anti-page-3-the-sun-campaigner\" title=\"\">No More Page Three campaign</a>. <a href=\"http://nomorepage3.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"\">A quote on its website</a>, for example, states that the Page 3 image is \"a sex object\" and then immediately, with no other nuance, relates this to \"300,000 women being sexually assaulted and 60,000 raped each year\".</p><p>Perhaps you can already see the problem here. It is not women's bodies or images of them that cause the exploitation of women or violence against women. The perpetrators are to blame. If women's bodies were to blame for any violence or exploitation of women, then rapists would be justified in claiming their victims were asking for it by looking attractive. The rhetoric of objectification actually feeds that which it claims to protect women against – the equation of female nudity with exploitation and violence. What the world needs is not the idea that women are precious victims. Women need to be able to behave in a sexual way without exploitation or violence being considered a necessary outcome.</p><p>O'Connor's line \"your body is for you and your boyfriend\" is not far off from saying that a woman should only be seen by her husband – which may be OK if that is what she wants, but where does that leave women who don't have boyfriends or husbands, or who want to be promiscuous?</p><p>We live in times when hugely powerful women like Rihanna and Beyonce could be said to objectify themselves and other women in their videos. But the simplistic formula that images of women's bodies are always objectifying is old-fashioned and plays into the idea of feminists as asexual. Young women need to know that when they take off their clothes, they are still in charge of themselves.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418993243|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|68592337130e6b43c72dc57e76f49cde9c3a94fa -->",

        "headline":"Sinéad O'Connor warns Miley Cyrus about believing it's 'cool to be naked'",
        "body":"<p>Sinéad O'Connor has written an impassioned open letter to Miley Cyrus, warning the singer of the dangers of objectification and declaring that she should not \"let the music business make a prostitute of you\".</p><p>The Irish singer's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">1,000-word post</a>, written on her <a href=\"http://www.sineadoconnor.com\" title=\"\">personal blog</a>, was triggered in response to Cyrus's comments in a recent Rolling Stone cover story. She explained that O'Connor's music video for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUiTQvT0W_0\" title=\"\">Nothing Compares 2 U</a> inspired her recent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8\" title=\"\">Wrecking Ball</a> video, which begins with a tearful close-up of the singer. But, unlike O'Connor's classic, the Cyrus video transforms into her posing provocatively in underwear and, ultimately, naked.</p><p>Throughout O'Connor's letter, she warns Cyrus about the music industry, stating: \"I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos.\" She adds: \"It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether its the music business or yourself doing the pimping.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419016383'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380800295168/Sinead-OConnor-010.jpg' alt='Sinead O'Connor' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sinead O'Connor: 'You shouldn't let them make a fool of you,' she warns Miley Cyrus.</figcaption></figure><p>Written \"in the spirit of motherliness and with love\", the 46-year-old singer pleads with Cyrus to reconsider her career's projection in the run-up to her Bangerz album launch, suggesting that the people around her are monetising her \"prostitution\".</p><p>\"I repeat, you have enough talent that you don't need to let the music business make a prostitute of you. You shouldn't let them make a fool of you either. Don't think for a moment that any of them give a flying fuck about you. They're there for the money … we're there for the music. It has always been that way and it will always be that way. The sooner a young lady gets to know that, the sooner she can be REALLY in control.\"</p><p>Referring back to her iconic look in the Nothing Compares 2 U video, O'Connor admits that she was asked by her label to reconsider her image for the 1990s video. \"The look I chose, I chose on purpose at a time when my record company were encouraging me to do what you have done. I felt I would rather be judged on my talent and not my looks. I am happy that I made that choice, not least because I do not find myself on the proverbial rag heap now that I am almost 47 yrs of age … which unfortunately many female artists who have based their image around their sexuality end up on when they reach middle age.\"</p><p>The singer ends her tirade by asking Cyrus to \"fire any motherfucker who hasn't expressed alarm, because they don't care about you\".</p><p>Since the letter was published this morning, Cyrus has tweeted a screen grab of O'Connor's Twitter feed from 2012, and compared the singer to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/amanda-bynes-meltdown-why-we-watch\">Amanda Bynes</a>, the actress who was placed on psychiatric hold involuntarily this year after a series of incidents including setting fire to a driveway in Thousand Oaks, California. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418956517|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|04dcdd5535477639fae3cc6b189e3354e78655c8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ryan Giggs has said there are no excuses for Manchester United's faltering start under David Moyes and denied that Sir Alex Ferguson's departure as manager has been a factor in the team's poor start to the campaign.</p><p>The 39-year-old made a record-breaking 145th appearance in the Champions League on Wednesday as United delivered a resilient display to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/02/shakhtar-donetsk-manchester-united-champions-league\" title=\"\">draw with Shakhtar Donetsk</a> at the Donbass Arena. The point leaves United level with the Ukrainian champions at the top of Group A, a contrast to their form in the Premier League, where three defeats in the past four matches has left the champions in 12th position.</p><p>Giggs admits the Scot's retirement has been felt at Old Trafford but believes the blame for United's poor run lies firmly with Moyes's players and insisted the club has overcome greater difficulties during his 22-year career at Old Trafford.</p><p>\"Sir Alex was a great manager and a great influence on the team and the club. You are going to miss someone like that,\" said the United midfielder. \"But I don't think that is an excuse when individuals aren't playing as well as they can. We are not playing well as a team. We haven't got injury problems as we have had in the past. There is no excuse.</p><p>\"It hasn't been a great start to the season but the good thing about that is we have plenty of time to turn it round. We know what this club is like, it is ups and downs and we don't get carried away if we are flying and we don't get carried away when we are not playing well. I can't put my finger on what has happened. We have just not played as well as we can, both individually and as a team.\"</p><p>Despite being eight points adrift of Arsenal after only six league games, Giggs believes the inconsistent nature of this Premier League season gives United opportunity to mount a defence of the title. He said: \"It is a weird season. City have been beaten twice. Nobody has hit the ground running who we'd have expected to. Obviously Arsenal are playing well, Tottenham and Liverpool are at the top, but there is enough time for us to turn it round and get back to the top and stay there.\"</p><p>Moyes and his coaching staff, which now includes Giggs, have been under fierce scrutiny after successive league defeats at Manchester City and at home to West Bromwich Albion. But Giggs insists United faced, and overcame, bigger problems during Ferguson's 27-year reign.</p><p>\"It's not the most difficult season I've had in my career,\" he stated. \"There have been topsy-turvy seasons in the past. I have been in the team for 20-odd years and I have seen more or less everything. You would rather be showing this form at the start of the season than at the end.</p><p>\"We have just got to hang in there to the turn of the year, as we always say, and then hopefully hit a bit of form like we historically do. We have to take responsibility as players and do that. The results have shown we haven't played as well as we can do. We know the quality in the dressing room. We are the champions, so we showed that quality last year and we have to show it again.\"</p><p>Giggs overtook the former Real Madrid striker Raúl as the record appearance holder in the Champions League on Wednesday, although his United tally includes qualifiers, and Uefa does not include qualifying matches in its official count. He added: \"I am obviously pleased with that record. It is the pinnacle of European football, the Champions League, and to overtake a legend like Raúl is special for me. It's just a shame it wasn't with a win but I think it was a professional European performance away from home. We wanted to make ourselves hard to beat and I think we did that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418986628|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|14d09ef9c6b727e36fae6114f279f5d5438d65e9 -->",

        "body":"<p>British detectives say the key to Madeleine McCann's disappearance could emerge from a \"targeted attack\" on mobile phone data from thousands of people who were around the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz at the moment she went missing.</p><p>The line of investigation was disclosed as it was announced that Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate, would appear on the BBC's Crimewatch programme with the British detective in charge of the case.</p><p>The programme will broadcast a reconstruction of the events before Madeleine disappeared and the McCanns will make an appeal for anyone who was in the resort at the time, and has yet to come forward, to contact police.</p><p>Similar appeals will be broadcast in Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland.</p><p>The \"footprints\" from the phones of holidaymakers, staff and local people who were in the vicinity of the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when the three-year-old disappeared in May 2007 are being examined and cross-referenced with other information coming into the British inquiry team, officers have said.</p><p>Forty-one individuals from several countries including the UK are being investigated as persons of interest by the Metropolitan police, and official requests for assistance have been sent to 31 countries including Portugal to identify other people whose mobile footprints have emerged in the sifting and resifting of tens of thousands of documents, communications data and eyewitness statements.</p><p>The new British investigation began as part of a £5m review of all the evidence after an appeal for help by Madeleine's parents to David Cameron.</p><p>It is not known how many of the 41 individuals – among them 15 Britons – are considered suspects.</p><p>Many are people who need to be questioned in order to be eliminated from the inquiry. But detectives are known to have uncovered new leads and theories about what happened to Madeleine while her parents were eating a meal with friends at a restaurant in the resort.</p><p>It is known that some of the people of interest are sex offenders who were in the area at the time.Police will analyse mobile phone data to track any calls that might have been made from the resort to others outside it, as they investigate whether there was any kind of ring involved in the girl's suspected abduction.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the investigation, said the analysis of mobile phone data originally collected by the Portuguese had gone beyond the stage of a general trawl, and was now being cross-referenced with other information.</p><p>His team have been cross-referencing tens of thousands of documents, communications data and witness statements from the Portuguese investigation, from eight private detectives and from the Leicestershire force.</p><p>\"The mobile phone data is a substantial amount of data and a significant amount of it is unattributed. Putting this with layers and layers of other information, we are carrying out a targeted attack on the information. We are doing this in a focused way, working back from the moment that Madeleine was found to have gone. It is like pulling back the layers of an onion. Every hour my officers work on this case is designed to get to that very moment and find out what happened,\" he said.</p><p>Six detectives in Portugal are working with the Met and making inquiries on their behalf. But the plan to send a team of Met officers to work out of Portugal has yet to be acted upon, as delicate negotiations continue with the Portuguese authorities, who closed their investigation and have refused all appeals to reopen it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991142|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|a9b5d1093bf1b345cb290769acf581e262855fc0 -->",

Human rights campaigners said that the tragedy could easily have been prevented.</p><p>\"A terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe. And not for the first time,\" said Jean-Claude Mignon, head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly. \"We must end this now. I hope that this will be the last time we see a tragedy of this kind, and I make a fervent appeal for specific, urgent action by member states to end this shame.\"</p><p>The Italian government declared on Friday a national day of mourning as rescue workers continued to search the seas off the Sicilian island in a desperate attempt to find any more survivors. Initial rescue attempts managed to save 159 people but the 20-metre-long boat was believed to have been carrying between 450 and 500 passengers.</p><p>As the island's quayside was lined with corpses, hopes for more survivors dimmed. When coastguard divers began an inspection of the area around the wreck, they found 20 more bodies underwater. Asked on Italian radio what help was needed, Pietro Bartolo, chief of health services on Lampedusa, replied: \"Coffins. Coffins and hearses.\"</p><p>Giusi Nicolini, the island's mayor, said: \"It's horrific, like a cemetery. They are still bringing them out.\"</p><p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the tragedy should be a spur to action. In Italy Napolitano and government ministers said the time had come for the world to shoulder its share of the burden in the growing problem of migrant boat arrivals.</p><p>Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister, said: \"We hope the EU realises that this is not an Italian but a European disaster.\" He headed to Lampedusa vowing to \"make Italy's voice heard loudly\" with José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission.</p><p>Napolitano said there was now an \"absolute necessity for decisions and actions by the international community and primarily the EU\". The integration minister, Cécile Kyenge, told journalists: \"It is not the moment to point the blame at anyone, but we will ask countries to each do their bit.\"</p><p></p><p>Their message was echoed by Pope Francis, who said: \"Let's unite our efforts so that tragedies like this don't happen again. Only a decisive collaboration of everyone can help and prevent them.\" In impromptu remarks, he added: \"The word disgrace comes to mind. It is a disgrace.\"</p><p>The alarm over the unfolding disaster was raised shortly after 6am by fishing boats who noticed a vessel in trouble off the Lampedusa coast near Isola dei Conigli (Rabbits' Island). Lampedusa, where the interior ministry says more than 8,000 migrants landed in the first eight and a half months of this year – out of a national total of more than 17,000 – is just 70 miles from the Tunisian coast.</p><p>Alfano said the boat's motor was believed to have stopped working, causing water to come into the vessel and prompting the passengers to burn a sheet to try to attract rescuers. \"Once the fire started, there was a concern about the boat sinking and everyone moved to one side, causing the boat to go down,\" he said. The passengers, mostly Eritreans and Somalians, were just half a mile from the shore.</p><p>A young Tunisian man was arrested by Italian police on suspicion of being one of the people smugglers responsible for organising the crossing. Unnamed survivors quoted in the Italian media, who said the boat had left the Libyan port of Misrata two days earlier, said that three fishing boats in the area had seen their vessel was in trouble but had not come to their rescue. Alfano rejected this, saying that the boats nearby had not seen them. \"If they had, they would have intervened,\" he said. \"Italians have big hearts.\"</p><p>But Codacons, an Italian consumer group, said it would ask prosecutors to look into the allegations, which it said, if true, would represent a very serious failure.</p><p>The controversy echoed a similar tragedy in March 2011, revealed in the Guardian, in which dozens of African migrants en route to Lampedusa died after being apparently ignored by a number of European military units.</p><p>Human rights groups have long been calling on Italian and European authorities to rethink their approach to the crossings, which brought about 15,000 migrants to Italy and Malta last year, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees.</p><p>Judith Sunderland, senior western Europe researcher of Human Rights Watch, said \"the lack of solidarity from the rest of the EU\" had caused an \"almost utter failure of any proposals for greater burden-sharing\".  Member states needed to do more to help Italy shoulder the burden, she said, calling also for a \"presumption of rescue\" policy to be implemented to ensure that any overcrowded migrant boat spotted by passing ships would have to be offered help.</p><p>Andrea Iacomini, spokesman for Unicef in Italy, urged Enrico Letta, the prime minister, to go to Europe and demand more co-ordination and help. He urged the interior ministers of all Mediterranean nations to hold an immediate conference focused on how to prevent  tragedy from happening again.</p><p>\"We need to go to Europe and say that there is a humanitarian emergency in Italy. What are we doing about it? … We cannot have the victims on our consciences only afterwards,\" Iacomini said, claiming the Mediterranean had \"become a cemetery. And it will become even more so.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419000089|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|51a9e274c3cf4b889bcc451634d687af87c4efe9 -->",

        "headline":"The Shard can eat its heart out – this is Britain's beauty",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://ribastirlingprize.architecture.com/\" title=\"\">The 2013 Stirling prize for&nbsp;architecture</a>, announced last week, received almost no publicity. The reason must have been that the&nbsp;winner was not so much a building as architecture itself. This should have made it all the more significant.</p><p>The best work was the former ruin of a medieval fortified manor, converted into a house for holiday renting. Astley Castle in Warwickshire is a creative collaboration between the owner, the Landmark Trust; the architects, Witherford Watson Mann; and the regulator, English Heritage. It is a brilliant marriage of old and new.</p><p>Nor was Astley alone. Each of the six finalists departed from the run of Stirling winners, traditionally \"iconic statements\", computer-generated shapes by \"starchitects\" and shouting \"put me in the colour supplement\". Each was understated and deferential to&nbsp;context. Collectively they suggest British architecture turning over a new leaf and discovering a surprising humility. This is wonderful news.</p><p>When I wandered round Astley Castle 10 years ago it was a dripping misery of a wreck. The Victorians would have confidently set about rebuilding such places, but the 20th century dared not touch them for fear of accusations of \"dishonesty\". Either ruins would be left to rot or someone from the ministry would stabilise them with concrete.</p><p>What is remarkable about Astley is that every usable bit of surviving fabric has been retained. The outside is little changed from the old, but the interior is a spirited conversation of ancient and modern. Elizabethan windows and fireplaces sit beside new red-brick walls and oak furnishings, distinct yet harmonious. There is none of the glass and steel aggression that modern architects feel obliged to insert into old buildings, as if  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier\" title=\"\">Le Corbusier</a> were frowning over their shoulder. At Astley, old and new collude without confusion.</p><p>The other finalists were no less exciting. One was a rescue job of a brutalist horror, the sweeping cliff of flats on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Hill,_Sheffield\" title=\"\">Park Hill</a> overlooking Sheffield. I would happily have seen these demolished and replaced, but the renovation is sensational. Another was a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-23349978\" title=\"\">serene circular chapel</a> fitted into a corner of the Victorian Ripon College, in Cuddesdon, outside Oxford. Another was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24032248\" title=\"\">Giant's Causeway visitor centre</a> in Ulster, tucked beneath the crest of the hill. (I declare an interest, as it was for the National Trust) Another was an unassuming but handsome <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24013665\" title=\"\">terrace of courtyard houses in Harlow</a>.</p><p>So classy is this collection, and so much of a piece, that I wondered if the judges had just attended a lecture on contextual design, followed by a good lunch. Or perhaps they read the book most often quoted, yet always disregarded, by architects and planners: Jane Jacobs's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/14/jane-jacobs-death-and-life-rereading\" title=\"\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>. She ended with a plea for architecture to be messy and complicated, not to vanish in a \"bog of misconception\" and a fear of the \"dark and foreboding irrationality of cities\". She called for buildings and streets to be seen in the round, a melange of the average and \"unaverage\", of human experiences and uses, not demolishing and replacing but evolving over time.</p><p>Astley is just such a melange. Likewise Giant's Causeway buries its roof in earth and grass. The Harlow terrace might be a loose variation on an Islington street. Park Hill respects the geometry of its lofty site and gives dignity even to bleak concrete. As for Cuddesdon, the historian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rykwert\" title=\"\">Joseph Rykwert</a> remarks in his citation that it echoes the \"four primary skills from which all the arts derive\": the massing of masonry, the whittling of wood, the weaving of stone, and the moulding of glass and metal. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard\" title=\"\">The Shard</a> can eat its heart out.</p><p>All these designs show trees in their photographs – even if British architects still cannot bear also to include people. In the two conservation cases, Astley and Park Hill, credit should also go to English Heritage for its role in dictating the form of the eventual outcome. I hope next year the shortlist will include the new <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/09/26/kings-cross-square-opens-to-the-public-after-550m-revamp-4119576/\" title=\"\">King's Cross station</a>, a development immeasurably helped by architects being forced by regulators to respect London's industrial past.</p><p>These are grim times for those who care for the appearance of Britain's public realm. In town and country alike government has come to equate ugliness with economic growth, and beauty as an impediment to it. For the past five years government has merely achieved ugliness with recession.</p><p>Roadside meadows sprout advertisements, skylines erupt in wind turbines, green belts are being asphalted, and urban renewal is starved of incentive and stimulus.</p><p>A strange philistinism has descended&nbsp;on the UK's visual character. The guardianship of nature and the courteous planning of towns and countryside were among Britain's gifts to postwar European culture. They&nbsp;are&nbsp;in rampant retreat, thanks to&nbsp;David Cameron's metropolitan cabinet. Modern architects have been&nbsp;no&nbsp;help in this, grabbing every opportunity to build wherever and however the money talked, craving the&nbsp;most ostentatious structures and&nbsp;most garish individualism.</p><p>This worm at least appears to be turning. There are thousands of battered old buildings and rundown neighbourhoods that merit the Astley treatment, retaining the spirit of place that comes with the continuous occupation of land. Here is a ruin brought back into constructive use. Its celebration is the result of an architectural sensibility that honours the debt of the past to the future. Let us hope it is widely imitated.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418995009|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|beab155358b0d718d5e049842685e14aaab1dbb0 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Coffee</h2> <p>I often have to explain to people that the best coffee you can get is in Australia. They can’t quite believe it. It’s starting to happen in the UK and there’s some great emerging coffee in Scandinavia, but they are not inspired by Italy, they are inspired by Australia.</p> <p>The bar is being raised in London but people are truly obsessed by coffee in Australia.There’s a reason why you don’t really see many Starbucks here. There’s a quality and expertise to coffee. There’s knowledge around the process, such as the right beans, the milk temperature, the grinding techniques.</p> <p>People are on autopilot in Australia when it comes to coffee. It’s so ingrained in the culture to drink it. And people will pretty much spit it out if it’s no good.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ccfae376-876a-445f-a91a-ba96ca5882e5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380844281181/2fb14822-3782-4595-98e8-581855cd9ebd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Coffee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Australians will pretty much spit their coffee out if it's no good. Photograph: Steve Cavalier/Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Tim Tam slam</h2> <p>I’d certainly like to bring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHzMfZ1FaqA\">the Tim Tam slam</a> to the UK. I was introduced to it a couple of months ago and was amazed by it. It’s basically where you bite the corners off the ends of a Tim Tam and then suck tea through it, like some sort of straw.</p> <p>I tried it in a very public way too, on MasterChef. On one of the master classes they said “we know you love your tea, how about this?” I then had to do the Tim Tam slam in front of an audience. It absolutely worked, first time. I was fairly proud of that.</p> <p>I really don’t know if there’s any UK equivalent to suck tea through. A Penguin maybe? Or a Kit Kat? The choice would be key.</p> <h2>Beef</h2> <p>Australia has the best beef in the world. You’ve got Wagyu in Japan of course, but that’s a very specific type of beef. In Australia, there’s a huge range of beef, grass-fed and corn-fed. There’s great beef from Tasmania and there are great people like <a href=\"http://www.blackmorewagyu.com.au\">David Blackmore</a>.I’ve seen how good it is and it really ups the ante. There’s Angus and Hereford in the UK but Australia has really done a lot of work on the quality of its beef.</p> <p>With steak, it’s all about how the animal is raised and slaughtered. At the end of the day, the chef just has to flip it onto the grill. The important bit is the process before that. Back<a href=\"http://www.mandarinoriental.com/london/fine-dining/dinner-by-heston-blumenthal/\"> at the Mandarin</a>, we have to search and fight hard to get the best possible beef.</p> <h2>High street food</h2> <p>It seems that every other high street place in Australia is a charcoal chicken place. Good charcoal chicken places would be a good addition to the high streets of the UK, rather than just have McDonald’s and KFC.</p> <p>There are lots of good pop-up places on high streets in Australia, especially in Melbourne – cafes that seem to be aimed at young couples, and that don’t cost much money to set up.</p> <p>When it comes to fast food in Australia, a lot of it is Asian. It’s happening a bit in London, but if you want Ramen, there’s a lot more of it here&nbsp;– those noodle places are everywhere.</p> <h2>Families eating together</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-11aa2b6a-0057-4c5f-8d14-f6b155adf6d6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380845842863/881978c4-302f-4184-b721-60e2b16c0240-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Family eating together\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Families eat together more in Australia. Photograph: Ashley Mackevicius/AAP</figcaption> </figure> <p>Apparently, many families <a href=\"http://www.goodfood.com.au/lifestyle/cuisine/bitesize-view-of-a-nation-20120317-1vbna.html\">eat together five times a week</a> in Australia. It’s just once a week in the UK. If I could change anything back in the UK, it would be that. Culturally, it seems very different, and something the UK could improve on.</p> <p>The first book I wrote was Family Food, which has a lot of recipes which families could use. I don’t know what else you can do other than encourage people and show them the kind of food they could be making together at home</p> <p><strong>•</strong> Heston Blumenthal has recently launched a partnership with Coles supermarket to develop a range of products</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419018338|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|0291d1528c1c6ae3ddb37c7efa2d0e066ece3d22 -->",

        "body":"<p>To his dying day, Michael Foot always referred to Lord Rothermere's Daily Mail as \"the Forgers' Gazette\". This was because it had been the publisher of the notorious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/04/uk.politicalnews6\" title=\"\">Zinoviev letter</a>, now known to have been faked by White Russian <em>émigrés</em> in collusion with MI6. Its purport was that the Communist International in Moscow was trying to influence British foreign policy through the Labour party. It became a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1924\" title=\"\">major issue in the 1924 general election</a>, and it helped to bring down the very first Labour government.</p><p>That rancid smell has hung round the Daily Mail ever since, and the aroma got a lot worse when the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">paper became the leading supporter of Sir Oswald Mosley's fascist blackshirts in the mid-30s</a> and then went on to back the appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938. The supporters of appeasement were still trying to patch up a deal with Nazi Germany even after the war had begun.</p><p>A year later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/01/daily-mail-distorted-book-ralph-miliband\" title=\"\">the 16-year-old Ralph Miliband was trudging on foot across Belgium</a> to escape the advancing German panzers and catch the last boat from Ostend to England. A couple of years later he was back at sea, this time as a Royal Navy volunteer fighting for his adopted country. The climax came at the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_3499000/3499352.stm\" title=\"\">D-day landings in June 1944</a>, when the allies began the liberation of western Europe, including Belgium.</p><p>But Miliband stayed in Britain after the war, becoming first a brilliant student, then a hugely admired teacher at the London School of Economics, where he was a protege of the no less charismatic Harold Laski. It was some time later that he married, and then fathered those two leading lights of the Labour party, David and Ed Miliband.</p><p>I first met Ralph just after the war, when he had just come out of the navy and I had just gone in. We met at the kitchen table of a remarkable American woman who had gathered up an extraordinary collection of young people, most of them students at LSE. All of them were friends of her son, Dick Clements, who later became editor of the leftwing Tribune magazine.</p><p>Among those who gathered round that table in a flat just off Baker Street was a survivor of Buchenwald concentration camp, a former US bomber pilot, and Nan Miliband, Ralph's younger sister (and aunt to Ed). She had miraculously survived the entire war inside Belgium along with her mother, thanks to a brave and humane Belgian farmer who had taken them in. He hid them in a hayloft whenever German troops came by.</p><p>By far the most sparkling figure in the dozen or so youngsters round this table was Ralph. His knowledge was prodigious, his opinions strongly held, and his command of language – not his own – enabled him to express himself cogently. He was also tall and strikingly good looking, and bowled over the female members of the group.</p><p>He was, however, very much a Marxist – a fact that clashed with the views of his hostess, Sonia Clements. She was a Tolstoyan anarchist and a follower of Prince Kropotkin, and had no time for the determinism and dirigisme that was central to Marx's philosophy. But I doubt if Sonia would have passed the Daily Mail's test of British patriotism any more than Ralph did. That paper seems to believe that anything less than a certificated enthusiasm for the Queen, the Brigade of Guards and the Church of England disqualifies one as a genuine patriot. I doubt if any of us at that table would have matched up to that.</p><p></p><p>And neither, of course, would millions of others of our fellow citizens. For the central tenet of Marxism is that those who have nothing to sell but their labour have diametrically opposed interests from those who own the means of production – the owners make their profit by paying their hired workers less than the true value of their labour. That is a proposition implicitly endorsed by anyone who seeks higher pay, either through a trade union or individually. Even high-flying bank employees think they get less wealth than they generate – that's why they want those bonuses.</p><p>But the idea that being a Marxist, whether consciously or unconsciously, makes you a de facto traitor is both absurd and outrageous. No one at Clements's table supported the Soviet version of Marxism, and Ralph Miliband was the most eloquent among us in denouncing it as a distortion of true Marxist teaching. He believed passionately in the good old British values of tolerance and generosity, from which he had benefited.</p><p>Yet those, of course, are precisely the values that the Daily Mail rejects, not only in the case of Ralph and Ed Miliband, but in its overall coverage. Its aim is a strange one: each morning it wants to enrage its readers about some feature of contemporary British life, such as a judge being over-lenient with a criminal, a hospital messing up an operation, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/03/romanians-honesty-gang-hysteria-media\" title=\"\">too many crooked Romanians</a> getting through our borders.</p><p>The message is: there you are, that's what Britain is like these days, isn't it awful? So we can deduce that the Britain the Daily Mail is loyal to is not contemporary Britain but a legendary Britain of some golden age in the distant past, when everything was shipshape and Bristol fashion and Oswald Mosley was firmly in charge. If anyone hates contemporary Britain, it is the Daily Mail.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418985906|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|e50ae592e6a8d0c596cb9486450dad2b52a5630c -->",

        "body":"<p>Bully, coward, hypocrite, shameless, remorseless, ruthless, malignant – add your epithets for the Mail here. In London's Guy's hospital, at the private memorial event for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/23/harry-keen\" title=\"\">Professor Harry Keen</a>, distinguished diabetes consultant, a Mail on Sunday reporter took the hand of his close relative and offered her deepest condolences. Then she tried to pummel views out of guests about Ed Miliband's father, hoping for some juicy follow-up to their \"man who hated Britain\" assault.</p><p>I knew Harry Keen, since he set up the <a href=\"http://www.nhsca.org.uk/pages/alliedOrganisations/NHSFed/NHSFed.html\" title=\"\">NHS Support Federation in 1989</a> to oppose Margaret Thatcher's purchaser-provider reforms. Shortly before he died we spoke at the same meeting, where he told a moving story. As a young GP he visited a sick child whose mother tried to send him away, unable to afford the medicine. It was the very day the NHS was born and he described that mother's amazed relief when he said he could treat all her family for free for ever. Keen fought passionately against the dismantling of the NHS and I imagine he might relish the row over the Mail's despicable behaviour at his memorial. But his is not a story to warm the cockles of the Mail's heart.</p><p>Outraged, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/03/mail-on-sunday-gatecrashes-miliband-memorial-ed\" title=\"\">Miliband wrote to the Mail's owner, Lord Rothermere</a>, and two reporters were suspended. It's not uncommon in the more savage newsrooms for reporters sent on unspeakable missions to take the rap if it all blows up. Paul Dacre of the Mail never explains, never apologises – and is said to have tried to stop the Mail on Sunday's editor backing down. Never forget, Dacre is guardian of the nation's journalistic ethics as chair of the editors' code of practice committee, the self-regulation he is fighting to keep along with most of the press. Miliband supports a royal charter agreed by all three parties that would be entirely independent of both press and politicians.</p><p>So this is war, no holds barred and extraordinarily dangerous for Labour. The fight with the Mail is not of Miliband's making, but he has nothing much to lose – and, just possibly, much to gain. Once he dared to take on the frightening might of Rupert Murdoch by calling for a public inquiry into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">hacking scandal</a>, the die was cast. David Cameron couldn't refuse and the Leveson process began – to the alarm of most of the press. Miliband went further, demanding new press ownership laws to stop Murdoch domination of some 40% of press readership plus Sky. That fits the Miliband template for breaking up cartels and monopolies to make markets function better for the consumer. That's not socialism, but heeding Adam Smith's warnings of business conspiracy. There's no retreat now, no role left but Daniel in the lions' den.</p><p>How those lions roared at <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/ed-miliband-speech-conf-2012\" title=\"\">his conference speech</a>, a reminder of how a few press barons dominate Britain's daily discourse. The Mail splashed, \"Back to the bad old days … Red Ed revives 70s socialism\". The Daily Express: \"Return of Red Ed as Labour lurches Left\". The Sun went with \"Red Ed power cut fear\"; the Times, now equally on Murdoch message, \"Blackout threat over Miliband's fuel pledge\"; while the Telegraph opted for \"Miliband's 'Stalinist' plan to seize land for homes and build on fields\".</p><p>Here's the big question: can Labour ever win against the browbeating of Britain's 80% rightwing press? Tony Blair, scarred by the monstering of Neil Kinnock, grovelled to the Sun before the election and crossed the world to bend to News Corp executives. That's why Labour triangulated, ducked and dived to neutralise the worst. It worked, more or less, at high cost. Even on departing, when Blair finally called the press \"feral\", he only dared name the gentle Independent. Gordon Brown's approach was achingly, tragically pathetic, the bullied boy licking the boots that kicked him, courting Dacre ceaselessly. Worst of all, he invited Dacre to the funeral of his daughter. Did that bind the old monster to Labour's cause? Of course not.</p><p>Miliband seeks attention for his assaults on powerful vested interests – but will they trample him underfoot? He thinks things have changed since 1997: people are angrier about the powers-that-be. Politicians and journalists are equally reviled, so standing outside the establishment is the place to be.</p><p>Cameron, William Hague and Michael Gove were badly wrong-footed this week when they dared not criticise the Mail. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/03/daily-mail-nick-clegg-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg plunged in late</a>, though better late than never. Splendid to see those brave old Thatcher-era lords <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/ed-miliband-daily-mail-regulation-william-hague\" title=\"\">Heseltine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/thatcher-ally-daily-mail-ralph-miliband-lies\" title=\"\">Moore</a> piling in against Dacre – but it's easy to be brave once a political career is over. The Mail has few friends – only those too frit to speak out. There is scarcely a public figure who hasn't suffered its prurient or poisonous pen wielded against family, friends or colleagues – with many a private citizen caught in its web too. The humbling of Dacre would have multitudes dancing in the streets, but it wouldn't last any longer than Murdoch's \"most humble day of my life\". Before Dacre, the Mail was less vile but always beastly, following its founder's formula: \"a daily hate\".</p><p>Miliband's answer is to try talking to the people direct, not through distorting newspaper megaphones, but relying on new media and broadcasters. Can that be done? Not easy when new media is infested with yet more rabid rightwing hate-speech. As for the broadcasters, in the hothouse of the Westminster lobby their agenda is often warped by the group-think of the rightwing press. Dead trees in a flailing industry maybe, but watch how often the BBC, ITV and Sky use an array of hostile headlines as a story in itself – so who makes the news?</p><p>Miliband ends the conference season confident that he made the weather, his speech set the agenda, his intervention on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/aug/29/ed-miliband-syrian-intervention-video\" title=\"\">Syria prevented US bombing</a>. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/13/ed-miliband-attack-coalition-cost-living-crisis\" title=\"\">cost of living crisis</a> is what Cameron forgot in his speech, now rushing out briefings to the Times with rail fare and bank fee promises. Miliband means to lift politics and press out of the gutter, appealing to common decency – tough call.</p><p>And yet – the Red Ed framing is dangerous. The stronger he gets, the more relentless will be the character assassination, smears and mockery. Will enough people rally to an anti-establishment cause and ignore these foghorn harassers? Not since 1945 has Labour beaten a formidable press red scare. He will need escape velocity to get ahead of the hounds at his heels, and that needs a noisy and imaginative campaign on the side of citizens, against the business baronies Cameron defends. But for today Miliband can revel in the Mail's disgrace.<em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419001970|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|519de5228438ec8fcf5c8a8f381c68d88a7b2a2f -->",

        "headline":"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review - is it a tablet, or a phone?",
        "body":"<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the third iteration of Samsung's popular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/phablets\">phablet</a> series that has just become even bigger.</p> <p>With its large 5.7in screen and S Pen stylus, the Note 3 is unashamedly a phablet that will stretch prospective buyers hands and pockets, but provide fast and fluid experience while its at it.</p> <h2>Design: You'll need at least two hands</h2> <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is anything but small. A phablet through and through, it has a very large footprint compared to most other smartphones with screens between 4.7 and 5in, and while it's thin at just 8.9mm thick, it certainly feels big in your hand.</p> <p>The sheer size of the device basically makes one-handed operation impossible. Samsung's given the Note 3 an entire settings menu dedicated to trying to make it easier to use one-handed, but even with my adult male-sized hands it's a struggle to reach even half of the screen without dropping the device.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ad1b7e2b-55bd-4e86-91ce-e1fa3858c05d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380790962451/3a4cfe03-5fbc-409d-88a4-7d17f4f426a0-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a 5.7in phablet.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Samsung has used its characteristically plastic phone construction for the Note 3, matching the design ethos displayed by the rest of the Samsung Galaxy Android phone line, including its current flagship phone, the Galaxy S4.</p> <p>However, instead of a glossy plastic back, Samsung has given the Note 3 a fake leather back reminiscent of a cheap &quot;pleather&quot; sofa.</p> <p>I wouldn't call that an upgrade. Combined with chromed and ridged plastic edges, it makes the Note 3 feel anything but premium.</p> <p>Despite the cheap feel, the Note 3 is solidly built and displays little to no give, flex or creak in the body when twisted, while being lightweight.</p> <p>The front of the device is dominated by an excellent, bright and colourful large 5.7in screen. With a full HD 1920x1080 resolution the display is pin sharp making text on websites and ebooks easily legible, images crisp and detailed, while making watching videos a joy.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>5.7in full HD Super AMOLED</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;2.3 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800</li> <li><strong>RAM:&nbsp;</strong>3GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;32/64GB plus microSD slot supporting up to 64GB cards</li> <li><strong>Operating&nbsp;system&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Android 4.3 with Samsung TouchWiz</li> <li><strong>Camera:&nbsp;</strong>13-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE, Wi-Fi (n/ac), NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 with BLE, IR and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;168g</li> </ul> <h2>Powerful - and excellent for gaming</h2> <p>Samsung has given the Note 3 a top of the line processor in the form of a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800, and it really shows. The phablet absolutely flies along, with near-instant app loading and no perceptible lag anywhere within the operating system (more on that later).</p> <p>Even the most graphically intensive games run as smooth as butter, making the Note 3 excellent for gaming, while 3GB of RAM mean it should be up to any sort of multi-tasking you're likely to throw at it.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c32d4163-df9d-4043-9baa-f3dd5905882b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791055950/8567b134-a393-49cf-8ce6-91cc893b1a3e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is both powerful and lag-free.</figcaption> </figure> <p>To keep you fully stocked with apps, games and movies, the Note 3 sports ample storage with either 32GB or 64GB built-in, depending on model, of which the operating system takes up 5.64GB of space. A microSD card slot also stands ready to add up to another 64GB, should you need more.</p> <p>The Note 3 comes with USB 3.0 support, which makes transferring movies and music to the device much faster than most other smartphones that are saddled with the slower USB 2.0 standard.</p> <p>Charging the Note 3 is also fast via the included USB 3.0 cable, which from the mains charger adds about 1% of battery life per minute up until around 90% of capacity. It's 3,200mAh battery then gives it a very decent battery life of just about two days of real world use.</p> <p>That generally means you might have to top up the battery a little towards the end of the second day, but it should easily manage to last a day's mixed use even for the most demanding of users.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Software: TouchWiz is cluttered and confusing</h2> <p>The Galaxy Note 3 runs Android 4.3 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot; and has unfettered access to all the Google apps and services that are available through the Google Play Store, including Gmail, Chrome and Google Now.</p> <p>However, like most manufacturers, Samsung chooses to customise the Android experience on its devices. Samsung's modifications are known as TouchWiz, and include things like a custom keyboard, modified settings menus, and a custom home screen.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46c6698e-d466-4e07-a875-a4666fbf54ab\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791130851/d3524d8d-d355-4c0b-aba7-b0223573b437-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 runs Samsung's customised version of Android 4.3 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot;.</figcaption> </figure> <p>TouchWiz is a bit like Marmite - you will either love it or hate it. Personally, I loathe it, and find it cluttered and overly complicated. For instance, the settings menus are confusingly laid out at best, and the keyboard's strange, inefficient key spacing makes hitting the right touchscreen keys harder than it needs to be.</p> <p>Within the TouchWiz experience lays a whole host of gimmicky features that are of little practical use, including 'Air gesture' that allows you to wave your hand over the device to turn pages, but only in specific apps, and 'Smart screen', which uses the phablet's front-facing camera to watch for your gaze and pause video among other things when you look away.</p> <p>Generally they are confusing at best to use, and put additional drain on your device's battery at worst. Your mileage might vary, but I found myself turning them off within a frustrating first day of trying to use them.</p> <h2>Stylus: Completely ignore it</h2> <p>Samsung's 'S Pen' stylus also has a high potential for being relegated to just a gimmick. For the most part, there's little you can do with the stylus that you can't with a finger, which is often quicker and more convenient.</p> <p>The Note 3's 'Air command' function brings up a circular quick action menu that allows you to annotate a screenshot, but also provides access to 'Pen Window'.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-257c9640-19fb-49b3-ad19-e216dde94cd0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791254318/f1469cfd-fd9d-41c3-8c02-1b478f63107c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes equipped with Samsung's new and improved S Pen stylus.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Pen Window allows you to perform multi-window multi-tasking, by drawing out a window of your desired size with the stylus that you can fill with a select few apps that include Google Hangouts, a browser and a calculator - something that sounds potentially useful, but ends up being laborious to use and slower than just switching between dedicated full-screen apps.</p> <p>Some of the drawing and annotation functions within Samsung's apps such as S Note, SketchBook and Scrapbook could be useful for someone who can draw well, but they're lost on me.</p> <p>On the whole, the stylus doesn't detract from the Note 3's experience, as it slots neatly into the back, but it can often be completely ignored unless you're trying to actually sketch something on-screen.</p> <h2>Camera: Great for stills, but ultra HD is a gimmick</h2> <p>The Note 3 packs the same camera as the Samsung Galaxy S4, which at 13-megapixels produces clean, colourful and sharp images in decent lighting.</p> <p>In poor lighting, the camera can struggle to focus properly, however, it compares well to most other smartphone cameras and will capture pictures of a similar quality to most dedicated compact cameras.</p> <p>Samsung's camera software is easy and straightforward to use. It also manages to incorporate useful functions like an 'Eraser Mode', which is capable of removing unwanted objects like passers-by from your photos, and 'Drama Shot', which captures a series of shots and then stitches them together to make one over-laid action shot of a bike leaping off a ramp, or a football's flight through the air.</p> <p>Along with 13-megapixel stills, the Note 3's camera is capable of capturing video at up to 4K ultra high-definition, which at 3840x2160 has four times the number of pixels as full high definition.</p> <p>Since the Note 3's screen is only full HD, and 4K TVs are few and far between at the moment, capturing video in 4K UHD is a gimmick and will fill up the Note 3's storage very quickly with its large file sizes.</p> <p>The Note 3 will, of course, capture decent lower resolution video, including smooth normal full HD, and will even provide slow motion video at up to 120 frames per second if required.</p> <h2>Price: More expensive than iPhone 5S</h2> <p>Available in black, pink or white, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a large, flagship phone and therefore commands a premium price. Bought outright, the Note 3 costs &pound;650, which makes it one of the most expensive smartphones available at &pound;100 more expensive than an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/iphone-5s-review-apple\">iPhone 5s</a>&nbsp;and around &pound;230 more than a 5in Samsung Galaxy S4.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-32f69b25-f798-4b83-a593-1734d3fa8a11\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791368210/a1085af8-2d7d-4485-9192-80d4772497ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes in three colours: black, white and pink.</figcaption> </figure> <p>However, bought with a mobile phone contract in the UK, the Note 3 is available for free on contracts starting at around &pound;42 a month for 24 months.</p> <h2>Verdict: a great phablet but too big for most</h2> <p><strong>If you're after a phablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the best one available right now. </strong></p> <p>It's a snappy, lag-free experience, with great battery life and fast charging, but it's just not big enough to be a proper 7in tablet replacement.</p> <p>It's also likely be too big for most users looking for a smartphone, who will struggle to fit it in their pockets and will find it near-on impossible to use one-handed. Samsung's TouchWiz customisations to Android are often gimmicky and confusing, but they can be turned off to save frustration and battery life.</p> <p>The S Pen is responsive and easy to use, but actually using a stylus on a phone feels clumsy and fiddly, meaning it can safely be ignored in favour of a finger unless you're actually trying to sketch something on-screen.</p> <p>Overall, Samsung hopes to continue dominating the phablet category and maintain its 50% market share of a device type that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/02/phablets-asia-pacific-tablets-laptops-growth\">equals tablets and laptops combined</a>&nbsp;in sales in Asia-Pacific. The Note 3 is an improvement on the previous Galaxy Note 2 in every way, and is therefore probably the device to do that.</p> <ul> <li>Star rating: 3</li> </ul><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418877623|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|5ad18dc3be63c9af90a04bc2ad022455b9fa5742 -->",

        "headline":"Hamzah Khan starved to death by mother Amanda Hutton, jury decides",
        "body":"<p>A mother was on Thursday found guilty of starving her four-year-old son to death and letting his body mummify unseen in a cot for two years.</p><p>Amanda Hutton, a 43-year-old mother of eight from Bradford, fed Hamzah Khan so little that when his corpse was found he fitted in a babygrow designed for a six- to nine-month-old. His remains were mummified, mouldy and swarming with insects when police discovered them in September 2011.</p><p>None of Hutton's children were on the at-risk register or part of a child protection plan at the time the body was found, Bradford council said. A council spokeswoman rejected a claim by West Yorkshire police that numerous referrals had been made by officers to social services each time Hutton made an allegation of domestic violence against her ex-partner, Aftab Khan.</p><p>\"Hamzah's is yet another tragic story of a child who was invisible to society and died at the hands of a parent,\" said Shaun Kelly, head of safeguarding at Action for Children. \"It all adds up to a systemic failure to protect the most vulnerable.\"</p><p>Following a two-week trial, a jury at Bradford crown court found Hutton, had a problem with alcohol, guilty of manslaughter by gross neglect. That came at the end of a hearing that had begun with prosecuting QC Paul Greaney asking: \"How had a child starved to death in 21st-century England?\"</p><p>Five children aged between five and 11 were found by police when they searched Hutton's house two years ago. The court heard that they were malnourished, with head lice and fungal infections that had left them with missing toenails.</p><p>Some were wearing nappies despite being of school age, and appeared to crawl upstairs using their hands rather than walking. None had been seen by doctors for years. In May 2007 the family had missed so many medical appointments that their GP practice suspended appointments for the whole family indefinitely.</p><p>Neighbours said they had never seen some of the children in the two and a half years the family had lived in the terrace house. But some gave evidence admitting they had heard prolonged crying and shouting through the thin joining walls. Hamzah's body was found only when a neighbour complained about dirty nappies being thrown in his garden in the middle of the night, prompting a visit from a particularly tenacious police officer.</p><p>Aftab Khan, who in 2009 was convicted of assaulting Hutton and was described in court by the prosecution as having a \"not at all attractive personality\", said she had \"well hidden\" Hamzah's death and her neglect of the other children.</p><p>In an interview with the Guardian this week, Aftab Khan denied being a violent man but said he felt guilty about Hamzah's death. \"I feel guilty. Of course I should have done more,\" he said. \"I feel responsibility as a father. But this was nothing to do with me. It's clear cut. Believe me, if police had any evidence I'd been involved I'd be in that dock too.\" He said social services had to accept some responsibility for failing Hamzah. \"They knew for a long time there had been problems,\" he said.</p><p>After the verdict police described Hutton as an \"obstructive\" woman who refused offers of help and went to great lengths to conceal Hamzah's death in December 2009.</p><p>Detective Supt Lisa Griffin, the senior investigating officer, said the case was the worst she had seen in 28 years in the police service. \"She [Hutton] was obstructive, she was difficult and she failed in her ability to parent that child, to look after his basic needs, and sadly he died in the most difficult of circumstances. I can only imagine the pain and the suffering that that child endured.\" A spokeswoman for Bradford council said a serious case review would be published later this year after an inquest is held into Hamzah's death. Hutton will be sentencedon Friday, alongside her eldest son, Tariq, 24, who with his mother had already pleaded guilty to preventing Hamzah's lawful burial. Hutton also pleaded guilty to five charges of neglect involving her five surviving school-age children.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419004700|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|aca6403c2b4b1d0d78d0ca4f81fc5deb08ab7c46 -->",

        "body":"<p>Before interviewing Heather Cassils I get an email: \"In terms of pronouns I&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;he but I'm okay with she. I&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;to be called&nbsp;Cassils&nbsp;but don't mind if people call me Heather. I state it because I know it is not obvious.\"</p><p>This is not only considerate but also a fantastic understatement. From the high, soft Canadian voice and sleek, cropped hair to the rippling abs and occasional slick of scarlet lipstick, Cassils' identity is resolutely ambiguous.</p><p>By playing with body art, gay male aesthetics and extreme physical training – from weightlifting to martial arts – the artist has adapted his own female body into a series of powerful physical shapes that challenge any notion of binary gender.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I resist the idea that you have to live as a man or as a woman,\" Cassils explains. \"I didn't know any queer people until my 20s, let alone have any language for a trans identity. I just remember wanting to present my body in a more male fashion. The crux of my work is to create something that isn't so black-and-white.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418965478'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/3/1380798590410/Heather-Cassils-010.jpg' alt='Heather Cassils' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rough-hewn … Cassils performs Becoming an Image. Photograph: Heather Cassils and Manuel Vason, courtesy of Ronald Feldman Fine Art</figcaption></figure><p>Cassils' latest project, <a href=\"http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival-2013/programme/becoming-an-image\" title=\"\">Becoming an Image, comes to Birmingham's Fierce festival</a> on&nbsp;5 October. It was originally conceived as a site-specific work for the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.onearchives.org/\" title=\"\">ONE Archives&nbsp;in Los Angeles, the oldest active lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender archive in the US</a>. \"I built this 2,000lb clay sculpture, moved the archive out, moved the audience in, then attacked the sculpture in the darkness,\" says Cassils.</p><p>The blows delivered during the 20-minute performance are illuminated only by intermittent flashes of a camera. The flash burns the image into the viewer's retina, creating a series of \"live\" photographs. \"It represents senseless acts of violence against trans and queer bodies beyond the historical lens,\" says Cassils. The audience becomes both camera and witness to the&nbsp;beating, and the clay remains are then put on display.&nbsp;</p><p>\"I wanted to draw attention to the fact that our genderqueer and trans brothers and sisters are so much more likely to experience physical violence: worldwide, transgender murders increased by 20% in 2012.\"</p><p>Audiences may see Cassils' muscle-heavy body as a way of challenging such violence, confronting bullying with strength. Through weight training, Muay Thai martial arts, traditional boxing, diet manipulation and supplements, the artist pushes the definition of a \"biologically female body\" to its visual extreme without taking testosterone or having surgery. Cassils is almost unfeasibly strong, almost entirely naturally.</p><p>\"I started using weights when I was 16,\" says Cassils. \"I had undiagnosed gall bladder disease in my teens, which may sound benign now, but back in 1987 it wasn't something doctors looked for in young girls.\"&nbsp;</p><p>And benign it certainly wasn't. \"It got to the point where my insides were rotting, my bile ducts ruptured, my skin turned green and I went septic,\" says Cassils. \"I was hospitalised, eventually.&nbsp;I had tubes in every orifice, two surgeries and a full blood transplant.\"</p><p>That's where Cassils' interest in physical discipline came from. \"Training helped me feel strong again, and being ill made me want to articulate my own sense of wellness.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418965479'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/3/1380798821796/Heather-Cassils-010.jpg' alt='Heather Cassils' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Claymaker … Cassils reshapes the 2,000lb clay sculpture.

Just as Antin went through this sacrificial act of starving, I thought [taking steroids] was a necessary act.\"</p><p>It was, by all accounts, a deeply unpleasant process. \"The&nbsp;project took over my life,\" says Cassils.&nbsp;\"I had to force-feed myself to get enough nutrients, I couldn't leave the city because I'd vowed to take daily photographs, I needed to eat every three hours and train five times a week for at least two hours. My muscles became so tight my wife had to take my T-shirt off at night because I wasn't flexible enough to do it myself.\"</p><p>Cassils is very clear on the link between politics and performance art: \"Our bodies are sculptures formed by society's expectations. I am a visual artist, and my body is my medium.\" And it is a medium that undergoes constant evolution. Does that make the struggle to be an artist even harder?</p><p>\"It is difficult to be an artist,\" says Cassils. \"Most people would probably prefer you not to be. But just hold true to your intentions. It's almost like artistic Darwinism – if you can keep going, eventually there will be a breaking point.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418949682|2013-10-04T08:21:07Z|4512b9ce0fe1b21f492ce104b568fa22b954d548 -->",
