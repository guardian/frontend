        "headline":"Shell spending millions of dollars on security in Nigeria, leaked data shows",
        "body":"<p>Shell is paying Nigerian security forces tens of millions of dollars a year to guard their installations and staff in the Niger delta, according to leaked internal financial data seen by the Guardian. The oil giant also maintains a 1,200-strong internal police force in Nigeria, plus a network of plainclothes informants.</p><p>According to the data, the world's largest company by revenue spent nearly $1bn on worldwide security between 2007-09: if it were a country Shell would have the third highest security budget in Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p><p>The documents show that nearly 40% of Shell's total security expenditure over the three year period – $383m (£244m) – was spent on protecting its staff and installations in Nigeria's volatile Niger delta region. In 2009, $65m was spent on Nigerian government forces and $75m on \"other\" security costs – believed to be a mixture of private security firms and payments to individuals.</p><p>Activists expressed concern that the escalating cost of Shell's security operation in the delta was further destabilising the oil rich region and helping to fuel rampant corruption and criminality. \"The scale of Shell's global security expenditure is colossal,\" said Ben Amunwa of London-based oil watchdog Platform. \"It is staggering that Shell transferred $65m of company funds and resources into the hands of soldiers and police known for routine human rights abuses.\"</p><p>The financial documents, <a href=\"http://t.co/fHAITY4j\">passed to Platform</a>, suggest Shell's worldwide security costs almost doubled between 2007-2009, coinciding with the rise of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/may/10/oil.world\" title=\"\">armed insurgency in the Niger delta</a>.</p><p>In 2008, 62 Shell employees or contractors were kidnapped and three killed, many Shell-operated pipelines, well heads and offshore oil platforms were attacked and the company was forced to halt oil exports for several weeks after attacks by groups including the Movement for the emancipation of the Niger delta.</p><p>Nearly a third of Shell's global security budget in 2008, or $99m, was spent on \"third parties\". This was double what the company spent on its own security staff and is believed to include the services of 600 Nigerian government police and 700 members of the controversial state \"joint task force\" (JTF) comprised of army, navy and police.</p><p>Shell denies having any direct control over JTF forces, amid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/21/hundreds-killed-niger-delta\" title=\"\">numerous accusations of human rights abuses</a>, including a large-scale military attack in 2009 which the US state department said led to the displacement and loss of livelihood of tens of thousands of residents.</p><p>But in the past Shell has supplied government forces with gunboats, helicopters, vehicles and satellite phones to better patrol the myriad creeks and waterways of the delta.</p><p>\"This proves what we in the Niger delta have known for years – that the air force, the army, the police, they are paid for with Shell money and they are all at the disposal of the company for it to use it any how it likes,\" said Celestine Nkabari at the Niger delta campaign group Social Action.</p><p>According to Platform, a significant amount of Shell funding is channelled via senior military officials which provides \"ample opportunities for corruption\". US cables, released by WikiLeaks in 2010, alleged that the company paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the deployment of 350 soldiers in the delta in 2003.</p><p>But Shell International said that any allegations of corruption should be addressed to the Nigerian authorities, and that its spending is necessary to protect its staff and operations.</p><p>Although armed insurgency in the oil producing regions of the delta has declined since a 2009 amnesty, the company says it faces widespread criminality, organised crime and massive oil theft. It has stated that 15-20% of its output is stolen by international gangs.</p><p>\"Protecting our people and our assets is Shell's highest priority,\" it said. \"Our spending on security is carefully judged to meet this objective, wherever we operate in the world. We have always acknowledged the difficulties of working in countries like Nigeria. In the period that this report refers to, the armed militancy in the Niger delta was at its height, requiring a relatively high level of security spending there.</p><p>\"All our staff and contractors are expected to adhere to the highest levels of personal and corporate ethics, as set out in our code of conduct. We support the Voluntary principles on security and human rights (VPSHR), and we recognise that these principles help maintain the safety and security of our operations in a manner consistent with upholding human rights. We also investigate grievances under the VPSHR.\"</p><p>The company declined to comment on whether worldwide costs for security were increasing because of the Arab spring. The company has recently left Syria and has interests throughout the Middle East.</p><p>But the scale of Shell's spending, revealed by the data for the first time, raises questions about the effectiveness of its security policies. \"What is striking about the amount being spent in Nigeria is its ineffectiveness,\" said Amunwa. \"Shell spent many millions of dollars each year on government forces who failed to provide the company with adequate security.\"</p><p>Nkabari said: \"Shell cannot call this spending 'security'. If it was really providing security, then why do we continue to have vandalisation, why do we have bunkering [theft of oil], why do we have the security mess that we have in the Niger delta? They give protection to the oil workers but they are not providing the region with 'security'.\"</p><p>\"These figures are alarming – it is a scandal that so much money is spent on security instead of on the local communities whose livelihoods are destroyed as a result of the oil exploitation,\" said Jaff Napoleon Bamenjo of Relufa, which campaigns for environmental justice in west Africa.</p><p>\"Across Africa oil, mining and agro-industry companies regularly pay for the services of local security forces that have deplorable human rights records; sometimes as a contractual obligation,\" said Bamenjo. \"This is an extremely unethical practice held over from the colonial era which must end immediately. Not only is it bad for local communities who are the primary victims of police and military predation, but as Shell well knows, it exposes foreign companies to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394922833|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|03c69278f408d76e7c118f1365915a9d8f143f4f -->",

        "standfirst":"<a href=\"http://www.curseoftheblackgoldbook.com/\">Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta</a>, by the photojournalist <strong>Ed Kashi, </strong>documents the consequences of 50 years of oil extraction in the Niger delta. Oil companies operated here for decades with very little environmental supervision and the delta, notoriously beset by conflict and poverty, has been steadily pushed towards ecological disaster. Villagers struggle to live off land and water poisoned by years of oil spills, and crops fail under the acid rain caused by gas flares. An exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.hostgallery.co.uk/index1.html\">HOST gallery</a> in London runs until 3 April 2010",

        "body":"<p>The embattled Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell was today facing fresh embarrassment as an internal report said it could have to pull out of Nigeria because of violence in the Niger delta region.</p><p>The confidential report, dated December 2003 and obtained by the Bloomberg news agency, was commissioned as part of the company's efforts to help develop a \"peace and security strategy\" in the area. </p><p>It said violence in the Niger delta, where a majority of Nigeria's oil reserves are located, kills around 1,000 people each year.</p><p>The 93-page survey - carried out by WAC Global Services, Nigeria-based specialists in conflict resolution - said Shell itself \"feeds\" the violence, and may have to leave the area by 2009.</p><p>The oil company admitted that conflict \"had the potential to get worse\" if no action were taken, but did not agree that it would have to withdraw. </p><p>\"The government and local communities must take the lead, but we are determined to help,\" Simon Buerk, a Shell spokesman, said. He added that Shell was creating partnerships with non-governmental groups and aid organisations to help local communities in the delta region. </p><p>\"We have signed a partnership with USAid &#91;the US Agency for International Development&#93; to develop capacity in agriculture, health and business enterprise, and with Africare &#91;a non-governmental organisation&#93; on reducing deaths from malaria,\" Mr Buerk said.</p><p>The Niger delta is rich in oil but is also an area of great poverty, creating a volatile situation. The two million barrels of oil pumped from the delta each day provide more than 90% of Nigeria's foreign income, but the delta communities have little to show for it beyond contamination and violence, with youths resorting to hostage-taking and extortion. </p><p>Emmanuel Etomi, the community development manager for the Shell Development Company of Nigeria, said on Shell's website: \"I live in a society in serious conflict. This is being fed by corruption, poverty and high unemployment among youth in a region where little of the oil wealth has been returned to the people.\"</p><p>Mr Etomi, alluding to the report commissioned by Shell, said research by conflict experts had highlighted how the company \"sometimes feeds conflict by the way we award contracts, gain access to land, and deal with community representatives; how ill-equipped our security team is to reduce conflict; and how drastically conflict reduces the effect of our community development programme\".</p><p>The confidential report comes at an already difficult time for Shell, which is struggling with the aftershock of downgrades of its oil reserves by one fifth. The downgrades were followed by the resignation of chairman Sir Philip Watts and explorations director Walter van de Vijver. </p><p>Around one third of the recent reserves downgrade came in Nigeria, where oil and gas account for 10% of Shell's current production. </p><p>With Nigeria a thorn in its side, it was little small surprise that Shell was considering a 20% reduction of its Nigerian workforce, although cutting 1,000 jobs in a poor country could further strain the company's relations with the Nigerian government. </p><p>Those are already difficult, with the civilian government of Olesegun Obasanjo trying to recover hundreds of millions of pounds worth of tax credits handed to oil companies during previous military dictatorships. </p><p>Shell's record in the Niger delta has come under fire from environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth.</p><p>Brian Shaad, a parliamentary campaigner for the group, who has just returned from the Niger delta, said it was unlikely that Shell would get out of Nigeria because it accounted for an important chunk of the company's production.</p><p>\"What is clear from meeting a number of communities is that Shell is not meeting its environmental and social expectations of the community,\" he said. \"However, many leaders do not want Shell to necessarily pull out, but to behave itself.\"</p><p>Mr Shaad spoke of frustration among the delta communities because their first point of contact with the company often came through Shell's security forces, a situation he described as \"guns first\". </p><p>He said there was also frustration among those working for Shell, because workers were employed by subcontractors rather than the company, meaning that they did not get the full benefits accorded to full Shell employees.</p><p>Mr Shaad also criticised the Nigerian government for what he called lax standards in regulating the behaviour of oil companies, which have long stood accused of not cleaning up oil spills and pipeline blowouts.</p><p>The problems at Shell have attracted the attention of Calpers, the largest US pension fund, which has demanded a high-level review of its boardroom structure. </p><p>The California public employee's retirement scheme has put the oil group on its annual list of companies needing to boost performance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/4945275|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|f19a3d7119de066b6d170d5469571770db9732b0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Shell has started to \"streamline\" its operations in the delta region of Nigeria as it appears to have accepted that it is fighting a losing battle against armed militants - and the government.</p><p>The company announced yesterday that it had taken a $716m (&pound;359m) charge in its fourth-quarter accounts to pay for the cost of restructuring the business in the light of a deteriorating security situation and a problem getting its state partners to properly fund projects.</p><p>Nigeria has always been controversial for Shell, with criticism from campaigners worried about human rights and environmental problems. Despite militant attacks on its installations in the delta, Shell has previously played down the scale of the difficulties although a third of its production is shut.</p><p>But at the annual results conference, Jeroen van der Veer, chief executive, accepted the company was facing \"very serious difficulties\" and was reducing its financial exposure to Nigeria.</p><p>\"We have taken measures to streamline our operations taking into account the difficult circumstances we had to face,\" he explained. \"The Nigerian government is slow funding their share of the costs [of new developments].\" Van der Veer said he had held face-to-face talks with the Nigerian president last week to discuss funding and security issues. He declined to comment on speculation that the authorities are putting pressure on Shell to hand over a bigger equity stake in the business.</p><p>The oil group has already been forced to hand over a larger stake in its Sakhalin scheme in Russia and Kashagan project in Kazakhstan to local state-owned entities as part of a rising trend towards \"resource nationalism\".</p><p>Van der Veer said Shell remained committed to Nigeria, where it has had a presence for 50 years, and was unwilling to say how many jobs or offices were being cut. He stressed that the offshore and liquefied natural gas sides of the business were progressing well. </p><p>Nigeria has made money for Shell but it has also brought it a lot of criticism since the company was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the hanging of the poet and oil company critic Ken Saro-Wiwa. Shell has also been attacked by green groups over the use of \"flaring\" in Nigeria where gas is burned off, causing carbon emissions. Several deadlines for halting the practice have passed with Shell complaining that the work has been delayed because of violence and a lack of government funding.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/332330053|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|91dc1c051480890e37f9c87b3510a38546b52cc2 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong></strong>Serious allegations of human rights abuses caused by oil companies in the Niger Delta, the oil-producing region in southern Nigeria, have been published  today.</p><p>A 141-page report by Amnesty International quotes sources suggesting that in the last 50 years at least 9m barrels worth of oil have leaked into land and rivers in the region.</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell is singled out by Amnesty as the most powerful operator in the region. The report will make uncomfortable reading for the energy group's new chief executive, Peter Voser, who starts work tomorrow.</p><p>The report gives evidence of oil spill cover-ups, gas flaring near villages and waste dumping leading to serious pollution of wetlands and the destruction of farming and fishing. The Niger Delta is notorious for violence and gangs are often used as security forces by oil firms to prevent terrorist attacks, hijackings and assaults on oil installations. The region has become unstable, with Nigeria's military launching fierce attacks on villages to flush out suspected terrorists, but this has led to the displacement of thousands of people.</p><p>The Amnesty report lays the blame for the region's intractable problems on the oil industry. \"Decades of pollution and environmental damage, caused by the oil industry, have resulted in violations of the right to an adequate standard of living, including food and water, violations of the right to gain a living through work and violations of the right to health,\" it says.</p><p>\"A lack of accountability and the inability of those affected to access justice or receive adequate reparations and remedies, has perpetuated the context of human rights violations and encouraged them to occur again and again. So long as impunity for abuses of the environment and human rights remains entrenched, so too will the poverty and conflict that has scarred the Niger Delta.\"</p><p>Shell, which trades in Nigeria through the Shell Petroleum Development Company – a consortium which also includes the Nigerian government, Total and Agip – disputes much of the Amnesty report. It argues: \"About 85% of the pollution from our operations comes from attacks and sabotage that also puts our staff's lives and human rights at risk.\"</p><p>Amnesty says oil firms treat communities as a \"risk\" instead of as stakeholders.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/349588264|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|317ec22c049da8acad2644d77145a07e6f4edcf3 -->",

It just adds to the list of Shell's environmental atrocities in the Niger delta.\"</p><p>The spill, one of the worst off the coast of Nigeria in 10 years, is particularly embarrassing for Shell, coming only four months after <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2649&amp;ArticleID=8827\" title=\"\">a major UN study</a> said it could take Shell and other oil companies 30 years and $1bn to clean spills in Ogoniland, one small part of the oil-rich delta.

        "headline":"Shell Nigeria oil spill '60 times bigger than it claimed'",
        "body":"<p>A Shell oil spill on the Niger delta was at least 60 times greater than the company reported at the time, according to <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20076\" title=\"\">unpublished documents obtained by Amnesty International</a>.</p><p>According to Shell, the 2008 spill from a faulty weld on a pipeline resulted in 1,640 barrels of oil being spilt into the creeks near the town of Bodo in Ogoniland. The figure was based on an assessment agreed at the time by the company, the government oil spill agency, the Nigerian oil regulator and a representative of the community.</p><p>But a previously unpublished assessment, carried out by independent US oil spill consultancy firm Accufacts, suggests that a total of between 103,000 barrels and 311,000 barrels of oil flooded into the Bodo creeks over the period of the leak. Accufacts arrived at the figure following analysis of video footage of the leak taken at the time by local people. This suggested that between one and three barrels of oil were leaking every minute. A similar method was used by spill assessors to gauge the scale of the BP Deepwater spill underwater in the gulf of Mexico in 2010.</p><p>\"The difference is staggering: even using the lower end of the Accufacts estimate, the volume of oil spilt at Bodo was more than 60 times the volume Shell has repeatedly claimed leaked,\" said Audrey Gaughran, director of global issues at Amnesty International.</p><p>\"All oil spill incidents are investigated jointly by communities, regulators, operators and security agencies,\" said a Shell spokeswoman in London. \"The team visits the site of the incident, determines the cause and volume of spilled oil and impact on the environment, and signs off the findings in a report. This is an independent process – communities and regulators are all involved. This is the process that was employed with the two spills in question, and we stand by the findings [of 1,640 barrels].\" Shell has argued the community prevented the company being allowed near the pipeline to repair it.</p><p>The amount of oil spilled by Shell at Bodo will be key to a high court case expected to be heard in London later in 2012. Shell is being sued by nearly 11,000 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/03/shell-oil-spills-niger-delta-bodo\" title=\"\">Bodo inhabitants, who say their lives were devastated</a> by the spill which destroyed their fishing grounds, caused long-lasting ill health and polluted fresh water sources. The community, represented by the London law firm Leigh Day, is thought to be seeking more than $150m (£93m) to clean up the creeks, which, even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/09/niger-delta-shell-oil-spills\" title=\"\">four years after the spill, remain coated in oil</a>.</p><p>Oil spill compensation in Nigeria is based largely on the amount of oil spilt. But negotiations over the Bodo spill broke down earlier in 2012 in London when the gap between what Shell was offering and what the community wanted could not be bridged. Neither party can agree on when the 40-year-old pipeline started to leak.</p><p>In a letter to Amnesty International, Shell wrote: \"The court will decide what the volume of the spill was. We suggest you might be better to wait for the authoritative view on the volume of the spill and publish at that stage rather than risk misleading the public with Accufacts estimate.\"</p><p>But this was dismissed by Amnesty's Gaughran: \"Even if we use the start date given by Shell, the volume of oil spilt is far greater than Shell recorded. More than three years after the Bodo oil spill, Shell has yet to conduct a proper cleanup or to pay any official compensation to the affected communities. After years of trying to seek justice in Nigeria, the people of Bodo have now taken their claim to the UK courts.\"</p><p>\"The evidence of Shell's bad practice in the Niger delta is mounting,\" said Patrick Naagbanton, co-ordinator of the local oil watch group Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD). \"Shell seems more interested in conducting a PR operation than a cleanup operation. The problem is not going away; and sadly neither is the misery for the people of Bodo.\"</p><p>Amnesty and CEHRD have repeatedly called for an independent process to investigate oil spills in Nigeria, and an end to the system that allows oil companies to have such influence over the process.</p><p>• This article was amended on 23 April 2012 to correct the reference to the amount of oil flooding into the Bodo creeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/389092585|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|a0b150d5cbb573fa672730dfdbebfc20a48bb46a -->",

        "body":"<p>Just why did the Financial Times pull our Shell advert so late?</p><p>I'd find it hard to believe that Shell lent on them. Did the Financial Times get cold feet about upsetting this British blue-chip company? Who knows, but there are many out there <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/may/18/financialtimes-royaldutchshell\" title=\"Guardian Media: Why did the Financial Times pull an anti-Shell advert? | Roy Greenslade\">who are suggesting something stinks about this</a> – and it is not just the air that the people of the Niger Delta are forced to breathe. Certainly, by pulling the ad at 4.58pm on Monday, with <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18765\" title=\"Amnesty International UK: Hard-hitting video exposes Shell's appalling human rights record\">Shell's AGM</a> taking place at the Barbican in central London on Tuesday, the timing was awkward for Amnesty.</p><p>Of course, newspapers are free to turn away any ads they chose. But in this case, and by leaving the decision to the last minute, the FT must have known that there would be speculation about the reasons behind their move. Their official statement, <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=45457&amp;c=1\" title=\"Press Gazette: FT refuses to run Amnesty ad condemning Shell\">quoted in the Press Gazette</a>, is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\"Editorially, the FT was more than willing to run the advertisement for Amnesty. Unfortunately, whilst Amnesty gave us written assurances that they would take full responsibility for the comments and opinions stated in the advertisement, it became apparent that Amnesty's lawyers had not had a proper opportunity to advise Amnesty on those opinions. As a result, from a legal perspective we were unable to rely on Amnesty's assurances.\"</p></blockquote><p>In Amnesty's view, we gave the FT plenty of opportunity to come back to us beforehand: a final version of the ad was submitted to the paper last Friday – well within normal advertising copy deadlines. We also gave the FT written reassurances that we would take full responsibility for the comments and opinions stated in the advertisement.</p><p>Now, we will be writing back to everyone who contributed to explain what happened, and of course, anyone who asks for their donation to be refunded will get their money back. Happily, we were able to get the ad into the <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/home/\" title=\"Metro.co.uk homepage\">Metro</a> – and doesn't that make it even more puzzling that it was happy to take it at such short notice, while the FT, with days to consider the advert, were not?</p><p>The ad itself compares <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/shell-profits-rise-60-helped-by-oil-price-1957331.html\" title=\"Independent: Shell profits rise 60%, helped by oil price\">the company's profits</a> with the consequences of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/05/shell-oil-spill-niger-delta\" title=\"Guardian: Shell reports record oil spillages in Nigeria\">pollution Shell has caused for the people of the Niger Delta</a>. Local communities claim that the numerous oil spills, which have not been adequately cleaned up, have left them with little option but to drink polluted water, eat contaminated fish, farm on spoiled land and breathe in air that stinks of oil and gas.</p><p>That's what is really important here: the future for the people of the Niger Delta. The fact that 2,000 individuals eagerly accepted the opportunity to pay for this ad shows that many people share our concern. The irony of this row over the ad is that it will make even more people aware of these vital issues and, we hope, force Shell – quite literally – to clean up its act.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/362782884|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|eb9add99ef4c14f46ac39792d527db04171fb1c9 -->",

        "body":"<p>There's not much left of Goi, an Ogoni village on the Niger delta.</p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/06/shell-oil-spills-niger-delta-pollution\" title=\"\">I went there two years</a> ago large parts of it and the surrounding land still hadn't recovered from a series of spills of Shell oil that had taken place in 2004. Most Goi people had been farmers and fishermen, but they had mostly moved out because the water, the houses, the mud in the creeks all still reeked of crude.</p><p>I had met Eric Dooh whose family comes from Goi, and who has spent years fighting Shell for compensation. This week he's in Amsterdam representing his father and on Wednesday, he and three other farmers from other parts of the polluted Niger delta will hear the verdict of a Dutch court on the case.</p><p>Dooh and his colleagues have come to Europe because they say they cannot get justice in Nigeria. At stake is not just whether they get compensation from the Anglo-Dutch giant that made £19bn profit last year, but whether Shell – and other multinationals – can be sued for pollution in the Netherlands. Behind Dooh stand possibly a long line of litigants and lawyers.</p><p>Shell says the individual spills were caused by sabotage and under Nigerian law, oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills. They also claim they had cleaned them up to the satisfaction of the Nigerian authorities, so they had no case to answer.</p><p>But the reality is that despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/04/niger-delta-oil-spill-clean-up-un\" title=\"\">condemnation by the UN Environment programme in 2011</a>, despite Nigerian government promises, NGO fury and mounting despair in the communities, Shell's oil spills go on, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/24/world-bank-gas-flaring\" title=\"\">the gas flaring continues</a> and the people of the delta remain as poor as ever.</p><p>Shell's whole network of thousands of miles of pipelines, flow stations and pump houses is corroding fast in the equatorial heat and rain. <a href=\"http://www.codewit.com/investing-and-trading/5067-shell-spills-over-26-000-barrels-of-oil-in-13-months\" title=\"\">New figures on the company's Nigerian website</a> shows that nearly 26,000 barrels of Shell oil was spilled last year from 200 spills in the delta. Of those, 144 were said to be due to people \"sabotage\" and people breaking into the pipes, but 55 came from \"operational mishaps\" – the admitted fault of the company.</p><p>After 50 years of oil exploitation, pollution is now the norm on the delta, and the companies working there appear de-sensitised and immune to criticism. Over 50 spills a year in Canada or Mexico, Australia or Britain would be an outrage and draw political fury; but in the delta this is considered normal, or even better than usual. No other region of the world has to endure so much pollution on a regular basis. The fact is that western oil companies apply different standards to clean-ups and compensation in Nigeria compared with the rest of the world.</p><p>I talked to people on the delta this week ahead of the Dutch verdict. They told me that nothing has changed in the past few years, even that the pollution was getting worse. According to them, the oil companies and the Nigerian government do not just fail to meet their own standards, but that the process of investigation, reporting and clean-up is deeply flawed in favour of the firms and against the victims. \"Spills in the US are responded to in minutes; in the Niger delta, which suffers more pollution each year than the Gulf of Mexico, it can take companies weeks or more\", one said.</p><p>Shell likes to claim that nearly all its spills in the delta are as a result of sabotage and crude theft. But there is increasing evidence that the  greatest thefts comes not from the villagers and farmers of the delta but from sophisticated rackets with organised gangs at the heart of local and even national government and the military stealing and spilling on a massive scale.</p><p>The communities admit they do take oil from Shell, and that they set up small local refineries. But they argue that they do it to survive, and they accuse Shell of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/09/ecocide-crime-genocide-un-environmental-damage\" title=\"\">\"ecocide\"</a>. \"Our people are displaced by spills, we have reduced life expectancy and no livelihoods,\" Dooh said.</p><p>The verdict is due tomorrow. It may change the life of people of Goi and other polluted villages who came to Europe to make their case, but that's a long way from cleaning up the whole delta.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/403195416|2013-07-02T13:01:02Z|8a7a356f72c7a9e60f4e24849ae431f6570a5021 -->",
