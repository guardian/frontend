        "body":"<p>International inspectors have arrived in Syria to begin overseeing the destruction of President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons program, kicking off a mission that must navigate the country's bloody civil war as well as the international spotlight.</p><p>Twenty inspectors from a Netherlands-based chemical weapons watchdog crossed into Syria from neighbouring Lebanon on their way to Damascus to begin their complex mission of finding, dismantling and ultimately destroying an estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal.</p><p>The experts have about nine months to complete the task, which has been endorsed by a UN security council resolution that calls for Syria's chemical stockpile to be eliminated by mid-2014. It is the shortest deadline that experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have ever faced in any nation, and their first mission in a country at war.</p><p>The team arrived in Damascus late on Tuesday afternoon in a 19-vehicle convoy that was escorted from the border by two representatives from Syria's foreign ministry. The inspectors were expected to meet officials from the ministry later in the day.</p><p>Experts at The Hague, where the OPCW is based, said at the weekend that the inspectors' priority was to achieve the first milestone of helping Syria scrap its ability to manufacture chemical weapons by 1 November, using any means. That may include smashing mixing equipment with sledgehammers, blowing up delivery missiles, driving tanks over empty shells or filling them with concrete, and running machines without lubricant so they seize up and become inoperable.</p><p>Some of the inspectors will verify Syria's initial disclosure of what weapons and chemical precursors it has and where they are located. Others will begin planning the logistics for visits to every location where chemicals or weapons are stored.</p><p>Within a week, a second group of inspectors is scheduled to arrive – fewer than 100 combined – and form teams that will fan out to individual sites. Their routes are secret – both for their safety and because Syria has the right not to reveal its military secrets, including base locations.</p><p>The inspectors' mission was born out of a deadly chemical attack on opposition-held suburbs of Damascus on 21 August. The US and its allies accuse the Syrian regime of being responsible, while Damascus blames the rebels.</p><p>The chemical attack prompted the Obama administration to threaten punitive missile strikes against the Assad regime, beginning weeks of frantic diplomacy that ended with Friday's UN resolution to purge Syria of its chemical weapons program.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418771863|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e14775d000bec1f61cad05d22ce0ff79526216b7 -->",

        "headline":"Syria given November deadline to destroy all chemical weapons facilities",
        "body":"<p>Syria will have to destroy all its chemical weapons production facilities by November and dismantle all its poison gases and nerve agents by the middle of next year, under an accelerated timetable drawn up by the world's chemical weapons watchdog.</p><p>The governing council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) agreed last night in The Hague for a disarmament plan starting on Tuesday when inspectors arrive in Syria to embark on the task of checking Syria's declared stockpile of chemical munitions, delivery systems and production facilities.</p><p>\"This decision sends an unmistakable message that the international community is coming together to work for peace in Syria beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in that country,\" said OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu. </p><p>The international agreement to secure Syria's chemical arsenal follows a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held suburbs in eastern Damascus on 21 August, and the subsequent threat of US military action.</p><p>The UN said yesterday that its weapons inspectors in Damascus were investigating a total of seven sites where chemical weapons were allegedly used, including three incidents after the 21 August attack. They were in Bahhariyeh and Jobar, both east of central Damascus, on 22 and 24 August, and Ashrafiat Sahnaya to the south-west of the capital on 25 August. The UN gave no further details. </p><p>The UN security council voted unanimously on Friday for a resolution that makes the OPCW legally binding on Bashar al-Assad's regime. But under a compromise between Russia and the west clinched on Thursday, the resolution does not include automatic punitive measures against the Syrian government if it fails to comply. </p><p>Any punitive measures, from sanctions to military action, would require a second resolution. The OPCW plan, however, gives the inspectors a broad mandate. According to a draft published on the Trench website, run by Belgian chemical weapons expert Jean Pascal Zanders, Syria will have to give OPCW personnel \"the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in the Syrian Arab Republic\".</p><p>The plan also sets a much faster pace for Syria compared with the requirements of the chemical weapons convention. The clock starts ticking for the government to meet its deadlines from the moment the OPCW council agrees the plan rather than the date on which Syria's membership of the convention formally starts, 14 October.</p><p>The plan states that Syria should \"complete as soon as possible, and in any case not later than 1 November 2013, the destruction of chemical weapons production and mixing/filling equipment\". </p><p>As the main production facilities lie in the heart of government-held territory, the destruction process is not expected to be held back by the continuing fighting. The OPCW plan then gives the Syrian government until the middle of 2014 to eliminate the rest of its arsenal. This deadline is far more challenging as the dismantling of munitions already loaded with chemical agents is a painstaking task.</p><p>The biggest question mark over the plan is what happens if Syria is caught cheating or dragging its heels. The west lost the battle to have the UN resolution implementing the plan under chapter seven of the UN charter, involving automatic punitive measures. Any such measures would require a further resolution. </p><p>But a senior US administration ­official argued that the wording of the draft ­resolution due to be voted on was tough, and implied serious consequences for noncompliance. \"I think you'll see in the final language that, in fact, for the first time, we have said that the use of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace and security,\" the official said.</p><p>After the security council vote, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: \"Security council shows diplomacy can be so powerful, it can defuse the worst weapons. If this resolution is implemented, we will have eliminated one of the biggest chemical weapons arsenals on earth, in one of the most volatile regions on earth.\"</p><p>The UN secretary general said that the resolution banning Syria's chemical weapons could not become \"a licence to kill with conventional weapons\".  He called for a new Syria peace conference in mid-November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418468106|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|db251f70c3a914ee527f1d363e3e5860465ee1b7 -->",

        "headline":"Syria: the strategy has backfired",
        "body":"<p>What a curious turn of events: from the very brink of a military intervention in Syria that might have precipitated a wider regional conflagration, we have moved to one of those rare \"points of inflection\" over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/obama-phone-call-iranian-president-rouhani\" title=\"\">Iran</a> which seems fecund with potential possibilities, including a solution in Syria. Of course, such tipping points can&nbsp;tip either toward new solutions, or&nbsp;into a new phase of conflict.</p><p>Why should the possibility of US talks with Iran hold out such potential? It is because an earlier such point of inflection over Iran, a decade ago, tipped toward conflict, into the \"axis of evil\" versus the western-backed \"moderates\". It was the fierce push-back by Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and (at that time) Hamas against this attempt to impose a \"hegemony of moderation\" across the region, that caused regime change in Syria to become such a priority for the Sunni monarchies of the Gulf.</p><p>After the 2006 Lebanon war, Saudi Arabia took further fright at the mounting popularity of Iran and Hezbollah within its own Sunni streets. Revolutionary Islam seemed to be gaining the upper hand. And – finally, the straw that broke the camel's back for the Gulf states: the outbreak of Arab upheaval of 2011, with its evident disdain for established authority. Gulf states decided to do whatever it takes to halt Iran and the new currents of thinking (such as a rising Muslim Brotherhood). Their very survival, it seemed, hinged on it. Overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad became the explicit cornerstone of this strategy of confronting Iran.</p><p>But this Gulf containment strategy of igniting a Sunni \"intifada\" against Shia influence seems to have collapsed, as the Gulf monarchs absorb the significance of Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress\" title=\"\">U-turn on Syria</a>, and the opening to Iran. What made it so traumatic was that not just Obama but the US system itself had buckled (public and Congress together). It represented rather a strategic lurch. President Assad would stay, and Iran would not be dismantled but emerge strengthened.</p><p>We have seen much <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10333513/Wake-up-William-Hague-change-is-in-the-air-and-we-must-respond.html\" title=\"\">sabre-rattling </a>from Gulf leaders as a consequence. They <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/opinion/global/saudi-arabias-proxy-wars.html?WT.mc_id=AD-D-E-OTB-GLOBOP-0913-WT.mc_ev=click&amp;WT.mc_c=__CAMP_UID__&amp;_r=2&amp;WT.mc_c=__CAMP_UID__&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">threaten to stand steadfast</a> to the cause – in spite of US \"weakness\" – determined to remake the Middle East in their authoritarian image. But this is evidently fanciful (in spite of their possibly pyrrhic victory in Egypt). What is emerging (just as it did three decades ago in Afghanistan) from their firing-up of Sunni Islam, is extremism rather than moderation – and inter-Sunni strife.</p><p>The Gulf strategy in Syria is also in tatters: its aspirations are not succeeding in the field, and – paradoxically – it seems that the imminent prospect of US military intervention in Syria created a schism within the Syrian opposition. So apprehensive were the jihadist groups that they would be the prime object of US attacks – as a prelude to the west setting up the Free Syria Army as a copy of the Sunni awakening councils in Iraq – that several days of bloody inter-factional fighting among the opposition ensued. Its perverse outcome has been a further radicalisation of Syria's jihadist groups, so that 13 of the most powerful, led by al-Nusra Front, now flatly reject the western-backed opposition group's leadership, and have committed instead to Sharia. Who now can be said to represent the <a href=\"http://www.bariatwan.com/english/?p=1964\" title=\"\">opposition</a>?</p><p>In the Gulf, anger and resentment at this turn of events is to be expected, but how far realistically can these monarchs step out of the western orbit, to which they are tied in so many ways? Ultimately this point of inflection offers the chance to undo that earlier tip towards conflict. Iran is already signalling its readiness to help Saudi Arabia make the necessary transition, as the latest appointment of Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani – well known to King Abdullah for his earlier mediation – as national security adviser clearly signals. In undoing the axis of evil and moderation, a political solution in Syria becomes possible. As <a href=\"http://blogs.rediff.com/mkbhadrakumar/2013/09/13/sheikhs-are-eastbound-but-on-business-trips/\" title=\"\">one ex-diplomat notes</a>: \"The Persians and the Sunni sheikhs quarrel all the time, but also can patch up without outsiders' help.\" If this initiative bears fruit, Syria is likely to be a key part of this.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418568189|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|aa41f415669d4987d74bfb4cd99c3f8c79dccad3 -->",

        "headline":"Syria: the strategy has backfired",
        "body":"<p>What a curious turn of events: from the very brink of a military intervention in Syria that might have precipitated a wider regional conflagration, we have moved to one of those rare \"points of inflection\" over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/obama-phone-call-iranian-president-rouhani\" title=\"\">Iran</a> which seems fecund with potential possibilities, including a solution in Syria. Of course, such tipping points can&nbsp;tip either toward new solutions, or&nbsp;into a new phase of conflict.</p><p>Why should the possibility of US talks with Iran hold out such potential? It is because an earlier such point of inflection over Iran, a decade ago, tipped toward conflict, into the \"axis of evil\" versus the western-backed \"moderates\". It was the fierce push-back by Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and (at that time) Hamas against this attempt to impose a \"hegemony of moderation\" across the region, that caused regime change in Syria to become such a priority for the Sunni monarchies of the Gulf.</p><p>After the 2006 Lebanon war, Saudi Arabia took further fright at the mounting popularity of Iran and Hezbollah within its own Sunni streets. Revolutionary Islam seemed to be gaining the upper hand. And – finally, the straw that broke the camel's back for the Gulf states: the outbreak of Arab upheaval of 2011, with its evident disdain for established authority. Gulf states decided to do whatever it takes to halt Iran and the new currents of thinking (such as a rising Muslim Brotherhood). Their very survival, it seemed, hinged on it. Overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad became the explicit cornerstone of this strategy of confronting Iran.</p><p>But this Gulf containment strategy of igniting a Sunni \"intifada\" against Shia influence seems to have collapsed, as the Gulf monarchs absorb the significance of Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress\" title=\"\">U-turn on Syria</a>, and the opening to Iran. What made it so traumatic was that not just Obama but the US system itself had buckled (public and Congress together). It represented rather a strategic lurch. President Assad would stay, and Iran would not be dismantled but emerge strengthened.</p><p>We have seen much <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10333513/Wake-up-William-Hague-change-is-in-the-air-and-we-must-respond.html\" title=\"\">sabre-rattling </a>from Gulf leaders as a consequence. They <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/opinion/global/saudi-arabias-proxy-wars.html?WT.mc_id=AD-D-E-OTB-GLOBOP-0913-WT.mc_ev=click&amp;WT.mc_c=__CAMP_UID__&amp;_r=2&amp;WT.mc_c=__CAMP_UID__&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">threaten to stand steadfast</a> to the cause – in spite of US \"weakness\" – determined to remake the Middle East in their authoritarian image. But this is evidently fanciful (in spite of their possibly pyrrhic victory in Egypt). What is emerging (just as it did three decades ago in Afghanistan) from their firing-up of Sunni Islam, is extremism rather than moderation – and inter-Sunni strife.</p><p>The Gulf strategy in Syria is also in tatters: its aspirations are not succeeding in the field, and – paradoxically – it seems that the imminent prospect of US military intervention in Syria created a schism within the Syrian opposition. So apprehensive were the jihadist groups that they would be the prime object of US attacks – as a prelude to the west setting up the Free Syria Army as a copy of the Sunni awakening councils in Iraq – that several days of bloody inter-factional fighting among the opposition ensued. Its perverse outcome has been a further radicalisation of Syria's jihadist groups, so that 13 of the most powerful, led by al-Nusra Front, now flatly reject the western-backed opposition group's leadership, and have committed instead to Sharia. Who now can be said to represent the <a href=\"http://www.bariatwan.com/english/?p=1964\" title=\"\">opposition</a>?</p><p>In the Gulf, anger and resentment at this turn of events is to be expected, but how far realistically can these monarchs step out of the western orbit, to which they are tied in so many ways? Ultimately this point of inflection offers the chance to undo that earlier tip towards conflict. Iran is already signalling its readiness to help Saudi Arabia make the necessary transition, as the latest appointment of Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani – well known to King Abdullah for his earlier mediation – as national security adviser clearly signals. In undoing the axis of evil and moderation, a political solution in Syria becomes possible. As <a href=\"http://blogs.rediff.com/mkbhadrakumar/2013/09/13/sheikhs-are-eastbound-but-on-business-trips/\" title=\"\">one ex-diplomat notes</a>: \"The Persians and the Sunni sheikhs quarrel all the time, but also can patch up without outsiders' help.\" If this initiative bears fruit, Syria is likely to be a key part of this.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418568189|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|aa41f415669d4987d74bfb4cd99c3f8c79dccad3 -->",

This is our history to comply with every treaty we sign,\" he said.</p><p>The inspectors are due to arrive in Damascus  on Tuesday. They will need to work quickly to meet the tight deadlines agreed by the security council on Friday.</p><p>In the first few days, a group of 20 inspectors drawn from about a dozen countries will have to fill the gaps in Syria's initial disclosure of its inventory of poison gases, nerve agents, delivery systems and production sites and fine tune the logistics for visiting the declared sites.</p><p>At that point, some of the documentation and political liaison specialists in the team will leave, and other experts will arrive, including chemical engineers, analytical chemists and medical specialists in case of accidental contamination. Within days the reinforced contingent will be split into field teams that will fan out to the declared weapons sites and laboratories. The inspectors will not say how many locations are involved as the Syrian declaration was confidential, but it is believed there are about 25 on the list.</p><p>Their first priority will be the locations where the weapons are produced. Under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/syria-deadline-destroy-chemical-weapons-november\" title=\"\">UN resolution</a>, all chemical production and mixing plants, as well as equipment used for filling rockets and shells with nerve agents or sulphur mustard gas, must be destroyed by 1 November, so as to crush the heart of the programme as quickly as possible. But to get the job done in time, the Syrians – with international oversight – will have to use some rough and ready methods.</p><p>\"We could fill reactors with concrete, perhaps, or they could smash them up if they're particularly delicate – if they're glass-lined reactors for example. Or equipment can be destroyed with explosives or by having a tank drive over it,\" said one senior OPCW official involved in the planning of the operation.</p><p>The official stressed that everything would be done in partnership with Syrian technicians: \"We'll identify, in conjunction with our Syrian colleagues, critical pieces of equipment and then invite them to destroy them,\" he said. \"The whole process will be conducted in a collaborative manner. It's not as if we turn up and point at something and say: blow that up; drive that over that equipment; fill that with concrete.\"</p><p>He said that the Syrian government had co-operated so far: the organisation submitted its initial list of inspectors to Damascus on Friday and got approval the next day, with no objections to any team members on the basis of nationality.</p><p>\"We have already seen from dealings with them there is a willingness and an engagement to do this,\" the official said. \"They have made a strategic decision.\"</p><p>The provisional plan is to concentrate the Syrian arsenal in a couple of major sites where mobile chemical neutralisation plants and incinerators can be used to destroy it. Russian and US intelligence analysts have said that much of the stockpile is in the form of precursor chemicals, or chemical ingredients, which are easier and quicker to destroy than pre-mixed and weaponised chemical weapons.</p><p>The deadline for destroying the whole arsenal has been set at mid-2014. Whether or not this is feasible or not will depend on the ebb and flow of the war, analysts say.</p><p>The Syrian government has reportedly consolidated its chemical weapons in roughly two dozen sites to stop them falling into the hands of rebels, but some of those sites are close to the frontlines.</p><p>\"The Syrian disclosure has identified a number of locations,\" the official said. \"Some are in areas completely controlled by the Syrian government. Others are in areas that are close to confrontation lines, but some may require us having to drive through opposition territory.\"</p><p>To cross the lines, inspectors will rely on UN officials based in Syria who have contacts with most parties in the conflict to negotiate safe passage. The same approach was taken when inspectors investigated the large-scale attack in eastern Damascus in August, which triggered a threat of US-led air strikes and ultimately the Assad regime's agreement to disarm.</p><p>The method was far from fail-safe. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/26/syria-un-no-impunity-chemical-attack\" title=\"\">UN vehicle came under sniper fire as it crossed the lines</a>, but there are no plans at present to bring in foreign troops to protect the inspectors. That would be a decision for the UN, which is playing a facilitating role for the mission.</p><p>Some of the members of the initial inspection team are ex-military munitions experts who have had experience of combat zones, but the fighting across shifting frontlines adds an extra layer of danger to an already hazardous task, and another physical burden.</p><p>\"We will have protective suits and hand-held monitors for self-protection,\" the senior inspector said, adding: \"Doing that kind of activity while wearing body armour and helmets is not ideal. It is really at the top end of the scale of physical burden and stress and contamination control. Wearing protective suits and body armour is physiologically pretty hard.\"</p><p>The risks of being in or near the front line of a civil war, in 35C heat, while trying to secure toxic chemicals, will give the team no shortage of dilemmas: \"At that point, we start to look into what's more hazardous: the guys going down with heat exhaustion, the guys being exposed to toxic agents or the guys being shot at,\" the official concluded.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418584804|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|f50ef7ad41e135061daed2af383cb80826038b1c -->",

        "headline":"Iraq and Syria: cross infection",
        "body":"<p>The Saudis think Barack Obama has gone soft on Bashar al-Assad and Iran – \"a weak pussycat\" is one phrase in use – and that although they would prefer to stay behind the bead curtains, someone, they claim, has to step forward with arms for the Syrian rebels. The rebels themselves are now so split that the term has to be used selectively. Jihadi groups have rolled into town across northern and eastern Syria, and intense clashes have broken out with rebel brigades in the past three weeks.</p><p>The fragmentation of the opposition does not stop there. Brigades once considered to form the bulk of the fighting force last week broke with the western-backed coalition based in Istanbul. They continue, however, to accept arms from the Syrian supreme military council. If they stopped doing that, they would really have split off, but they have little other choice. Thirteen of them, however, have formed a new alliance that excludes the most powerful al-Qaida-linked group in Syria.</p><p>As&nbsp;the&nbsp;civil war degenerates into a multisided conflict, the question is now put: could what happened in Anbar in 2007 be repeated in Syria in 2013? Could the model of Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq who helped drive al-Qaida out, in a movement known as the awakening (al-Sahawa), be used as a template for the same thing in northern Syria? The parallel is there, but it is still a long way from being a blueprint.</p><p>For a start, the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has done much to reverse the work of the awakening, which he never trusted and always thought worked as a stalking horse for the jihadis. When the Americans stopped paying the salaries of the Sunni brigades in Anbar, they were supposed to be integrated into the Shia-controlled armed forces, but that never fully happened. Today Anbar is up in arms. It does not take much to trigger an anti-government demonstration, the latest one in Samarra caused by an assault by security forces on the house of<a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/03/iraq-new-sunni-awakening-anbar-protests.html\" title=\"\"> Rafi al-Issawi</a>, former finance minister and a Sunni politician. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/syrian-jihadists-wreak-havoc-violence-iraq\" title=\"\">Ahmed Abu Risha</a>, one of the leaders of the awakening, told the Guardian that what happened in Anbar in 2006 and is starting again with random bombings today could be repeated in Aleppo. This time, one theatre of war could be used to feed and supply another.</p><p>The second difference is that if militias rise up, a nation state has to intervene to support them. And there is increasingly less chance of the Americans fulfilling that role as Mr Obama probes the possibilities of a grand bargain with Iran. He now has little other option. This has provoked the suspicion that Syria will be traded away as a result. The rebels still have to come to terms with the probability that they could end up in a sectarian landscape, like Iraq or Lebanon. It could be a long time before Syria feels like a liberated country.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418676286|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|866af4c649ae437fc07a9694026196855538584d -->",

        "body":"<p>The Syrian government has accused the Obama administration and other unspecified western countries of supporting terrorist groups inside Syria and of supplying chemical agents for use in poison gas attacks launched by al-Qaida and its affiliates.</p><p>In a defiant speech to the general assembly of the United Nations, Syria's deputy prime minister, Walid al-Moualem, accepted no blame for the recent sarin nerve gas attack on suburban Damascus that killed hundreds of civilians. Instead, he pointed the finger for the outrages at what he described as western-backed terrorist groups.</p><p>Referring to the 9/11 attacks on New York, he asked: \"How can some countries, hit by the same terrorism we are suffering now in Syria, claim to fight terrorism in all parts of the world while supporting it in my country?\"</p><p>In colourful language, he went on to claim that terrorist insurgents were engaging in cannibalism inside Syria. \"The scenes of murder, manslaughter and eating human hearts were shown on TV screens, but did not touch blind consciences.</p><p>\"In my country, there are innocent civilians whose heads are put on the grill just because they violate the extremist ideology and deviant views of al-Qaida. There are murderers who dismember human bodies into pieces while still alive and send their limbs to their families, just because those citizens are defending a unified and secular Syria.\"</p><p>Al-Moualem's breathless rhetoric came as an international team of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/un-inspectors-syria-dismantle-chemical-weapons-cache\">chemical weapons experts set out from The Hague</a> bound for Syria under the mandate of last week's UN security council resolution calling for the dismantling of Syria's large arsenal. Twenty inspectors will arrive in Damascus on Tuesday.</p><p>Al-Moualem told the UN that his government had accepted the Russian initiative to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons and had acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But his resounding criticism of US backing for opposition groups in Syria's ongoing civil war underlines how delicate the task facking the UN inspectors will be.</p><p>\"I assure you of Syria's commitment to the full implementation of the provisions of the convention,\" the deputy prime minister said. But he then added: \"There remains the challenge whether those who are supplying terrorists with these types of weapon will abide by their legal commitments, since terrorists, who used poisoned gases in my country, have received chemical agents from regional and Western countries that are well known to all of us.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418657157|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|9356a6de32c41716de1b2b2b4b62dd91592da014 -->",

        "body":"<p>From his desert compound near the green banks of the Euphrates river, Ahmed Abu Risha has been nervously watching as the jihadists he helped oust from Iraq with the help of the US army once again grow in strength all around him.</p><p>In towns and villages on the flat lands south towards Baghdad and in the communities that dot the sprawling desert west towards the border with Syria, militant groups are imposing their influence with brutal efficiency.</p><p>Random, savage and relentless violence is once more a reality in this part of Iraq, with almost daily bombings and killings stirring ghosts of a time, not long ago, when Anbar province was almost lost to al-Qaida and when hopes for a civil and stable country seemed futile.</p><p>But with Anbar again immersed in anarchy, Abu Risha's eyes are fixed far away from the reborn troubles at home, on battlefields far from his purview – across the border in Syria. There, as in Iraq, jihadists are wreaking havoc, attempting to assert themselves in a revolution that aimed to reorient a nation state, but is now increasingly dragging the region into chaos.</p><p>Abu Risha, and the tribal leaders of Anbar who helped drive the anti-al-Qaida movement in 2007 known as the awakening (in Arabic, al-Sahawa) are deeply troubled by what they are seeing.</p><p>\"If somehow a democratic state is not eventually established in Syria, there will be a problem for all the region,\" said Abu Risha. \"It cannot be an Islamic state.\"</p><p>Yet an Islamic state is unambiguously what the jihadist groups now fighting alongside the opposition in Syria are aiming for. \"They want strict Islamic law and they want Syria to be a stage for a jihad elsewhere,\" said Abu Risha. \"This has to be stopped.\"</p><p>Across northern and eastern Syria, where the jihadist groups are strongest, talk of an Iraq-style awakening has been prevalent since the start of the year. While the resurgent violence in Iraq is nothing to aspire to, the four years of relative quiet there from the end of 2007, and the temporary crippling of al-Qaida's ability to wreak havoc at will, at least offer some form of respite from a situation in Syria that is fast slipping from their control.</p><p>The al-Qaida-aligned groups that started mustering in Syria from July 2012 onwards have been consolidating in large swaths of the north and east and spreading out, just as they have been in Anbar and the farmlands north of Baghdad. With their creeping presence has come the enforcement of new ways in the rural north; summary justice, fear and intimidation. There is a sense of lurking danger.</p><p>\"We welcomed them at the beginning,\" said Majid Abu Lail, a shopkeeper from al-Bab, north-east of Aleppo. \"Even though we don't share their values. They told us they had saved Anbar from the Americans and that they weren't here to fight us. But they <em>are</em> here to fight us, to try and dominate our ways of life with theirs. And now we must fight them.\"</p><p>Black flags now fly above many mosques and civic buildings in towns across Syria's north and in Iraq's border towns. Local residents near Aleppo walk silently past school walls with white horses painted on a black background – an image widely used by al-Qaida in the north. \"We don't want their paintings, or their jihad,\" said Abu Saed, a member of the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo. \"They can take the stallion back to the dark past that they came from.\"</p><p>Talk of how to get an awakening under way is now well advanced here, just as it is in the corridors of power in Riyadh, and even Baghdad, where Iraq's prime minister, Nour al-Maliki, is convinced that the jihadist push in Syria is bleeding directly into the rising terror menace he is facing at home.</p><p>Abu Risha, who in 2007 became the Iraqi face of al-Sahawa, which ousted al-Qaida for a while and helped the US military partly restore security in Iraq, said little could be done in Syria without the backing of a powerful nation state.</p><p>\"An awakening would only succeed if it was not done by militias, or tribes,\" he said. \"It has to be done by a state.\"</p><p>While the tribes of Anbar were the first to turn on al-Qaida, they had limited means to turn their resentment into action, or to sustain a fight against a powerful foe that had made inroads across the society. Sensing a moment to turn around an increasingly hopeless situation, the then commanding general of US forces in Iraq, David Petraeus, in early 2007 partnered first with the Anbar tribes, then Iraq's security forces in a year-long campaign that cost much blood and treasure but ultimately freed the province from the grip of jihadists. Until now.</p><p>Abu Risha acknowledges that there is little chance that the US army would make such a commitment to Syria and he fears that US allies in the region have a similar lack of appetite for a direct intervention.</p><p>\"If the Americans in all good conscience cannot help [the Syrian opposition] now after all the deaths of the children, the chemical attacks, then what can be done for them. How will this end? People can't just use the name of the awakening. It is more than just a slogan.</p><p>\"The Gulf countries are the ones who should help destroy Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida. They have to be regarded as terror groups and not supported in any way.\"</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the Emirate states, which support the Syrian opposition, have looked on with alarm as the jihadist influence has risen in the north and the likelihood of any western power taking them on continues to fade. \"There is a serious risk that the opposition can no longer achieve its main objective up there,\" said an influential backer of the Syrian opposition.</p><p>On the ground, much of the opposition fears that such a moment is now upon it. Last week, 13 armed opposition groups formed a new alliance that ostensibly breaks away from the western-backed opposition structure, which it claims is disconnected from realities on the battlefields and whose backers who have little willingness to bring the war to an end.</p><p>The new structure omitted the most powerful al-Qaida-aligned group in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Isis), which is directly linked to the main al-Qaida group in Iraq and whose leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, helps direct the insurgency in both countries.</p><p>Isis itself was a breakaway from the first al-Qaida group in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, which was subsumed by the Iraqi-led body in a power struggle in May and has remained resentful ever since. Ever since, its influence has faded in the north, while elsewhere in the country it has remained strong.</p><p>The move followed several weeks of intense clashes in the north between Isis and brigades aligned with the Free Syrian Army, which saw the jihadists overrun the border town of Azaz, and al-Bab, in the first of what it said would be other similar moves.</p><p>\"We could see that remaining with the military council [the western-backed body] would get us nowhere,\" said a leader of Liwa al-Tawheed, the largest opposition unit in the north and a key signatory to the new alliance.</p><p>\"The Americans want to trade Syria away as part of a regional solution with Iran. Iran is not part of a solution, they are central to the problem.\"</p><p>Other members of the nascent body say that while they support the newfound distance from the military council, the main reason for the split is to isolate Isis. \"There is a broad understanding that they have to be stopped,\" said a leader of Ahrar al-Sham, a salafist group with some al-Qaida links. \"This is still a Syrian revolution. We will not let it become a toy for them.\"</p><p>A third opposition leader, from the Suqour al-Sham unit, said the new grouping, while ostensibly Islamic, was the first foundation stone of an awakening that many in the north had tried to delay, for fear of losing the war, but now felt was inevitable.</p><p>\"The regime doesn't bomb their bases,\" he said. \"All those flags and trucks outside and they hit hospitals and schools next door. Bashar may be happy with what we have done, but we will get to him soon.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418652279|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e1d5878b778c216645813fab143bf2d708436d3c -->",

        "body":"<p>Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into the vast property portfolio of an uncle of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, after two anti-corruption groups filed a complaint alleging he illegally acquired millions of pounds' worth of assets in France.</p><p>Rifaat al-Assad, a former military commander, has been accused by the French anti-corruption campaign groups <a href=\"http://www.asso-sherpa.org/\" title=\"\">Sherpa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.transparency-france.org/\" title=\"\">Transparency International France</a> of  corruption, money-laundering, embezzlement of public funds and misuse of corporate assets.</p><p>The groups claim that Assad's fortune is far beyond what he earned as a military commander or vice-president before he left Syria in 1984. They allege that his holdings, including a luxurious seven-storey townhouse on one of Paris's most expensive streets and several dozen others apartments, must have been amassed by pilfering Syrian public funds and abusing power.</p><p>Last month Le Monde estimated the value of his French property was more than €160m (£134m). His portfolio allegedly includes a chateau with 45 hectares of land just outside Paris, a series of apartments and a plot of land in the west of Paris, and a vast townhouse on the exclusive Avenue Foch with a view of the Arc de Triomphe said to be worth about €90m.</p><p>There are echoes of another case in which French authorities are investigating the conspicuous Paris fortunes and alleged ill-gotten-gains of three serving African leaders and their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/06/france-africa-autocrats-corruption-inquiry\" title=\"\">families</a>. The anti-corruption campaign groups argue that France should not serve as a refuge for the questionable cash of ruling families, and have called for Assad's assets to be frozen.</p><p>The state prosecutor's office has opened a preliminary inquiry to inventory the fortune and determine whether a formal investigation should be launched, but no assets have been frozen at this stage. Rifaat al-Assad's lawyer and family have denied the allegations against him.</p><p>Assad, 76,  lives in exile between Spain and France, where he has been decorated with the Legion of Honour. He fled Syria and went into exile in Europe in 1984 after staging a failed coup attempt against his brother, Hafez al-Assad, the then president and father of Bashar.</p><p>A sworn opponent of the current regime from which he has firmly distanced himself, there are no international sanctions against him. But human rights groups accuse him of playing a leading role in the bloody crushing of an 1982 uprising against his brother, in which tens of thousands were killed in Hama. He has denied the accusations.</p><p>Assad's lawyer, Marcel Ceccaldi, told French media his client denied any wrongdoing, and said his property holdings, dating back to 1984-86, were legal and transparent.</p><p>In a 2011 interview Assad told the Associated Press that he had lost all his money in the stock market and lived off the largesse of his 16 children. His son Siwar said at the time that the holdings mostly included property but also two TV networks, hotels and a restaurant in Syria.</p><p>Siwar said this week that his father was unconcerned  about the latest French allegations because he was too busy with his work organising one faction of Syria's opposition. Siwar said his father had filed a suit against the anti-corruption groups alleging false and slanderous denunciations. \"The origin [of the fortune] is completely legal,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418736901|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|9256d4d6cec5c4bde8205231b03a2a3e688bf8b1 -->",

        "body":"<p>International inspectors have arrived in Syria to begin overseeing the destruction of President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons program, kicking off a mission that must navigate the country's bloody civil war as well as the international spotlight.</p><p>Twenty inspectors from a Netherlands-based chemical weapons watchdog crossed into Syria from neighbouring Lebanon on their way to Damascus to begin their complex mission of finding, dismantling and ultimately destroying an estimated 1,000-ton chemical arsenal.</p><p>The experts have about nine months to complete the task, which has been endorsed by a UN security council resolution that calls for Syria's chemical stockpile to be eliminated by mid-2014. It is the shortest deadline that experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have ever faced in any nation, and their first mission in a country at war.</p><p>The team arrived in Damascus late on Tuesday afternoon in a 19-vehicle convoy that was escorted from the border by two representatives from Syria's foreign ministry. The inspectors were expected to meet officials from the ministry later in the day.</p><p>Experts at The Hague, where the OPCW is based, said at the weekend that the inspectors' priority was to achieve the first milestone of helping Syria scrap its ability to manufacture chemical weapons by 1 November, using any means. That may include smashing mixing equipment with sledgehammers, blowing up delivery missiles, driving tanks over empty shells or filling them with concrete, and running machines without lubricant so they seize up and become inoperable.</p><p>Some of the inspectors will verify Syria's initial disclosure of what weapons and chemical precursors it has and where they are located. Others will begin planning the logistics for visits to every location where chemicals or weapons are stored.</p><p>Within a week, a second group of inspectors is scheduled to arrive – fewer than 100 combined – and form teams that will fan out to individual sites. Their routes are secret – both for their safety and because Syria has the right not to reveal its military secrets, including base locations.</p><p>The inspectors' mission was born out of a deadly chemical attack on opposition-held suburbs of Damascus on 21 August. The US and its allies accuse the Syrian regime of being responsible, while Damascus blames the rebels.</p><p>The chemical attack prompted the Obama administration to threaten punitive missile strikes against the Assad regime, beginning weeks of frantic diplomacy that ended with Friday's UN resolution to purge Syria of its chemical weapons program.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418771863|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e14775d000bec1f61cad05d22ce0ff79526216b7 -->",

        "body":"<p>UN security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2118(2013)\" title=\"\">resolution 2118</a>, which will underpin the process of ridding Syria of its chemical weapons, marks a watershed in the conflict. After a number of attempts to get the world to take action, this could now have a decisive impact on the civil war, clearing the path to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/friends-syria-talks-geneva-peace-conference\" title=\"\">Geneva II</a>, the long-delayed and internationally agreed forum for a \"grand settlement\" of the Syrian crisis.</p><p>Beyond this, a new reality has dawned: Syria is not to be master of its own fate. It is now firmly in the hands of the powers, whether international or regional, who will negotiate and possibly enter into geopolitical horse-trading without regard for the footsoldiers, whether on the side of President Assad or the opposition. Syrians have been remorselessly battering each other, and the country they claim to love, which has resulted in the virtual surrender of the nation's sovereignty and independence – and very possibly the territorial integrity achieved in 1946 after a long and heroic struggle against French rule.</p><p>If the Syrian government looks bad after the latest diplomatic twist, the same can be said about the opposition. Divided and lacking credibility at the best of times, it pinned its hopes on an American military strike, hoping it would inflict a fatal blow on the regime. When no such attack materialised it was left humiliated: for being \"betrayed\" by an ally who again promised but did not deliver; and for being seen in the Arab street as inviting a western imperial armed assault on its own country.</p><p>The episode revealed again the official opposition's lack of a coherent strategy. Instead of showing statesmanship and leadership and rallying the Syrian people, of all sects and ethnic backgrounds, behind a programme of democratic transformation, it allowed itself to be led by Islamist hardliners into a narrowly defined agenda that alienated many secular-minded Syrians. Too late it sees its Islamism usurped by the rising tide of al-Qaida jihadism, which it naively believed could be easily drafted into an alliance against the common enemy. Now that ally is showing as much ferocity in striking at the \"moderates\" of the Free Syrian Army as against the regime.</p><p>In the meantime, as the forces within battle it out to a stalemate, the country and its people are experiencing unprecedented levels of abduction, imprisonment, torture, displacement, death and destruction. It is no wonder that many Syrians will be desperately longing for any process that might put an end to their plight, as the international community finally finds its voice.</p><p>A new nexus of powerbrokers, including a less entrenched Iran under its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/iranian-president-speech-walks-middle-ground\" title=\"\">new president</a>, may now hold the key. And should Geneva II lead to a ceasefire and a new hybrid authority to administer Syria in the lead-up to democratic elections and a new constitution, Syrians will breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>However, such an outcome cannot be assured. The chances of success will increase if the Syrians taking part include a strong representation of not just the regime and the official opposition – a recipe for endless argument and deadlock – but also of Syrian civil society networks and activists. These were the original organisers of the largely peaceful protest movement, before the brutal government crackdown and the armed reaction produced the current bloody conflict.</p><p>Even so, many pitfalls could eventually bring this process grinding to a halt, not least the growing strength of al-Qaida and its acolytes, particularly in northern Syria. These forces have no interest in the emergence of a stable and democratic country. Indeed, part of Geneva II's agenda must be establishing a plan of action to deal with the threat of an Islamic emirate spreading its roots throughout the country. Post-settlement regime loyalists and the mainstream forces of the opposition could find themselves needing to form a common front – despite their current enmity – to confront those who want to destroy whatever remains of Syria's rich diversity and tolerance.</p><p>This remains an unlikely scenario; but the more the jihadists, especially the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iraq/al-qaeda-iraq-k-islamic-state-iraq-greater-syria/p14811\" title=\"\">Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria</a>, provoke outrage with acts of barbarism – such as the recent sacking of Christian churches in al-Raqqa – the more Syrians of all shades of opinion will realise the mortal danger they collectively face and will resolve to end the suicidal internecine conflict they are currently locked in.</p><p>In that respect an agreement in Geneva will be just the starting point. The real battle for Syria's soul lies in wait. The earlier Geneva II can deliver a settlement, the better prepared Syrians will be to wage that battle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418887576|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e453212ed361685eab1d4922781b25125908f746 -->",

        "body":"<p>For more than two years, as fighting has escalated throughout Syria, a group of villages peopled by government supporters in the mountains above this coastal city has been spared any attacks.</p><p></p><p>In spite of their proximity to the Turkish border, across which rebel fighters are armed and financed, farmers continued their lives as normal, even though as Alawites allied to the Shia sect to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs they could have been obvious targets.</p><p></p><p>At dawn on 4 August their peace was shattered. Armed rebels, led by local jihadis as well as members of Jabhat al-Nusra and the al-Qaida linked group, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, left their headquarters in the largely Sunni town of Salma. They sneaked into the al-Akrad mountains, taking control of five Alawite villages. The rebels called it Operation Liberation of the Coast and the aim was to send the government a message that even the Alawite heartland was no longer safe.</p><p></p><p>Rumours of massacres spread as some 25,000 Alawite villagers fled to Latakia. The next day the rebels captured more Alawite villages and reached Aramo, about 12 miles north of Qardaha, the Assads' home town where Hafez al-Assad, the former president, is buried in a mausoleum. Over the next few days government forces regrouped and gradually recovered the lost ground with help from air strikes as well as local paramilitaries.</p><p></p><p>On 19 August  Syrian state TV reported that all the Alawite villages had been freed. But they did not highlight any massacres and refrained from showing graphic images of mutilation.</p><p></p><p>\"For the first time the government acted discreetly because they feared a sectarian war could break out all along the coast. At the beginning they even denied massacres took place\", Rajaa Nasser, an opposition politician in Damascus told the Guardian. He speculated that the attacks on the Alawites could have been revenge for the slaughter of Sunnis in Banias and Baida in May, two places about 30 miles south of the city of Latakia. Human Rights Watch said 248 Sunni civilians were executed there.</p><p></p><p>The Syrian army has not allowed foreign reporters into the Alawite villages to check the massacre reports, but in Latakia city the Guardian spoke to three officers who took part in recapturing the villages. Each was interviewed in separate locations. Two were relaxing off-duty in beach-front hotels and villas. They spoke of executions and other atrocities.</p><p></p><p>\"The attacks started with treachery,\" said Hassan, an officer in Syria's special forces. \"There was a unit of 40 troops. A Sunni defected from it and took 30 other Sunnis with him. A few days later they were part of the attack that started with the village of Hambushiya. The 10 Alawite troops left behind in the area were killed.\" Hassan said he could listen to the rebel's radio communications. \"I heard a rebel telling another rebel: 'Kill this one, but not that one' . One rebel asked: 'What do I do about the girls?' The answer came: 'I'm sending a truck to pick them up'. Several were taken and raped, and have not been seen again,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>\"They kidnapped Sheikh Badr Ghazal and stripped girls and the sheikh to humiliate him. The sheikh was then killed. Rebels videoed the events and we found the pictures on the mobiles of dead rebels when we retook the villages. They have not been shown on Syrian TV or media because they are too distressing.\"</p><p></p><p>Shadi, a 32-year-old officer in a local defence unit that is separate from the Syrian army, was lightly wounded during the government's counter-attack. \"When we got into the village of Balouta I saw a baby's head hanging from a tree. There was a woman's body which had been sliced in half from head to toe and each half was hanging from separate apple trees. It made me feel I wanted to do something wild,\" he recalled.</p><p></p><p>Ali, a member of the regular army, said he also saw the baby's head. \"We found two mass graves with 140 bodies. They were not shot. They had their throats slit. About 105 people of different ages were kidnapped,\" he said. \"It's really scary what happened. Nobody has gone home to the villages because so much has been destroyed and many houses have been burnt. The whole area is unusable. Salafists from abroad were behind the attack.\"</p><p></p><p>The officers' accounts cannot be independently verified but the Guardian has obtained lists, compiled by local activists, with the names of victims from Hambushiya, Balouta, and five other villages. They include 62 people listed as killed, 60 kidnapped and 139 people who are missing. The dead range in age from a toddler of two to a man of 90. The vast majority are women, children and the elderly since most men in the villages were away on duty as part of the volunteer defence forces elsewhere in the region. They did not expect their own villages to come under attack.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418807839|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e2ec03cc701eb243edd59606b76bc79c81177ab7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ten-year-olds on bicycles circled the dusty courtyard between the houses. Elderly neighbours in cheap chairs chatted outside their front doors.</p><p>But as we walked round the corner, silence fell. The road was empty. Jasmine blooms dropped on to deserted pavements. No children played on the rusty metal swings in an abandoned park.</p><p>In single file we followed the men in uniform to al-Zubair mosque, its window panes shattered, the minaret dimpled by shrapnel and bullets. Another group of men emerged in combat fatigues, urging us to stand away from the windows. Opposition snipers watched and fired from the buildings at the far end of the street, they warned.</p><p>This is the frontline in Tadamon, a district of closely packed blocks of flats on the south-eastern edge of Damascus. To the immediate south is the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk and beyond that the sprawling district of rebel-held Ghouta, which came under gas attack in August.</p><p>All round Damascus there are similar battlelines, separating the city centre from poorer districts that were once farming and smallholder communities but are now dotted with shoddy breeze-block buildings that have mushroomed without permits being sought. Sometimes, as in Tadamon, the front goes through a poor area, splitting a community equally underprivileged on both sides of the line.</p><p>With his strong mane of wavy white hair, 70-year-old Abu Emad does not look his age. Wearing a lapel badge bearing President Bashar al-Assad's face, he commands a small unit of volunteers from a guard post near the mosque. They are part of the National Defence Force (NDF), a grandly named organisation of local people that was formed last year in almost every Syrian neighbourhood as a kind of home guard.</p><p>Abu Emad used to be a salesman. \"I joined up because my eldest son was killed by a remote-controlled bomb attached to his car in February. We are defending our homeland,\" he said.</p><p>The frontline in Tadamon wobbled last November when the rebels managed to capture al-Zubair mosque and a few streets around it. Abu Emad pointed out where the rebels had fortified the building's north-facing windows with sandbags. But after a week the NDF men counter-attacked with army help and regained the lost ground. The frontline has been static ever since.</p><p>In the NDF headquarters on the second floor of a house on Tadamon's main street Abu Elie, the area commander, was working in an office with five pictures of Assad on the walls. He explained how the NDF consisted mainly of men with military experience, either as conscripts or from former army careers. The aim was to supplant the informal militias, known as the \"<em>shabiha</em>\", who were often accused of massacres, with a more disciplined and better armed force. Each man receives the Syrian equivalent of £60 a month.</p><p>In the hour that we talked we heard the boom of three outgoing tank rounds nearby. Asked if the army was firing, Abu Elie said the NDF also had tanks and mortars. \"We do our own operations and we also work with the Syrian army. We are a parallel army. The tide of battle turned with the activation of the NDF. By protecting our neighbourhoods we took the burden off the army and let them do more extensive operations in more dangerous areas,\" he said.</p><p>The NDF has given the Syrian government new manpower but the steady increase in the number of Syrian rebels as well as foreign jihadist fighters has resulted in a stalemate on the Damascus battlefield. Neither side has made significant gains for at least a year. A major government offensive on Ghouta in August, which coincided with the sarin gas attacks, has not won it any ground.</p><p>Abu Elie conceded that Tadamon was part of a wider Damascus deadlock. \"We have the ability to advance, but we don't have complete intelligence about the other side. There's no need to lose more men and have more martyrs. Anyway, if we advance we can't hold the areas, so we just do hit-and-run attacks. It's a war of attrition.\"</p><p>The break would only come, he believed, when the rebels stopped getting supplies of weapons from abroad.</p><p>The rebels appear to have more firepower than in February. Mortars regularly rain down on government-held areas. They may not have as much destructive force as the Syrian army's artillery, but they are as indiscriminate in their choice of victims.</p><p>In the last two weeks of August 123 mortars landed in the Christian quarter of the Old City, an area with no military targets, Gregorios III, the Greek Catholic patriarch, said. The tessellated marble fountain in the courtyard in front of his church now has a hole the size of a large soup-plate. A mortar had crashed in the previous evening. Splinters of marble and metal shattered two cars parked nearby. One Tuesday last month another mortar landed outside the Old City walls, killing 15 people.</p><p>Many Damascenes who oppose the regime, including most of the activists who organised the street protests of 2011, have left for Beirut. Arrests continue, and those activists who remain in Syria avoid being seen with foreign journalists. As a result, the overwhelming mood in the capital is support for the government, either with genuine enthusiasm or out of fear of chaos if it falls.</p><p>There is widespread anxiety that Islamists now dominate the armed opposition. Their attack on the Christian village of Maaloula just north of Damascus a fortnight ago confirmed people's fears that the jihadists are no longer fighting only in Syria's north and east but are close to the capital.</p><p>The threat of US missile strikes led many government officials to send their families abroad. Senior figures in the regime requisitioned empty homes and moved their offices there. Their concern was not just about being hit but that the rebels would exploit the pandemonium to break the frontlines and occupy the city centre. Now that the threat is off the table, better-off families are returning to Damascus. At the border with Lebanon over recent days, there have been more people entering than leaving Syria.</p><p>By some estimates, given that large tracts of the north and east are in opposition hands, the government controls only a third of Syria. But as long as it is in charge of Damascus and the coastal strip there is no chance of collapse, mass defections or implosion.</p><p>The tide may be turning in its favour. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/syria-army-seizes-qusair\" title=\"\">recapture of the town of Qusair in June</a> was a big psychological boost for the government, as was British MPs' decision to block any UK role in Obama's air strikes. \"I want to thank England's parliament and people for saving the situation. They understood it was all about destroying Syria,\" said Nizar Moussa, the governor of Tartous.</p><p>Safwan Koudsi, the leader of an old Nasserist and pan-Arab nationalist party allied with the government, said: \"I believe the UK vote was very effective. Fewer and fewer countries are supporting this war. Now is the time for negotiations.\"</p><p>In government circles as well as among the regime's democratic opponents, talk centres on the much-delayed Geneva conference to end the war and find a political solution. Rajaa Nasser, general secretary of the National Co-ordination Body for Democratic Change, said his group did not take the armed opposition's refusal to attend Geneva seriously now that the US and Russia had agreed to reconvene the conference.</p><p>\"The Syrian National Coalition [the western-backed  opposition] is not independent. If the United States really wants Geneva, they will come. Qatar [one of the SNC's main supporters] will also have to agree,\" he said. He also expects pressure will be needed from Russia to get the regime to come to Geneva with serious proposals.</p><p>Diplomats working with Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN and Arab League envoy to Syria, have been told that the government plans to call for a ceasefire when the Geneva talks take place. Qadri Jamil, the Syrian deputy prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/19/syrian-government-civil-war-stalemate\" title=\"\">confirmed this to the Guardian</a>. Although he later claimed he was not speaking for the government, his retraction can be interpreted as a sign of the issue's sensitivity while Assad's team prepares its agenda for Geneva.</p><p>At one level, a ceasefire is unrealistic since the jihadists will never accept one and could attack rebels from the western-backed Free Syrian Army if they do. But to propose a ceasefire makes sense for Assad, since it further divides the rebel camp, as well as looking sensible to Syrians and statesmanlike on the international stage.</p><p>Louai Hussein, who runs an opposition thinktank, Building the Syrian State, believes US pressure over chemical weapons was designed with an eye on Geneva in order to give Obama a military option that could stay on the table and be used as leverage.</p><p>It was, in his view, the second stage of a policy shift which began in May when the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, agreed to reconvene Geneva. \"There are too many warlords and the US started to feel the conflict was getting out of control, and this was not in Israel's interest. They wanted stability. The Russians also want to restore control, so the two governments have to work together,\" he said.</p><p>Assad's victory in Qusair jolted the Americans, he argued. \"After Qusair there was some kind of agreement between the US and Russia for the regime not to advance into other areas. The US, France and the Gulf Arab states talk of having a balance before Geneva.\" The US threat of air strikes was designed to create that balance.</p><p>The Geneva conference could promote a dialogue among Syrians that would produce a transitional government of national unity with ministers from the moderate opposition and the regime as well as independents. It would have to be accepted that Assad stayed on as president at least until his term ends in April, and perhaps beyond it.</p><p>Some analysts claim Assad is winning the military war. That is wrong. The battlefield is deadlocked and will  remain so as long as the rebels continue getting arms. But thanks to  Lavrov  and Putin and the growing international fear of the jihadists, Assad is winning the political war.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983556|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|64d83322d97bee5e5df15ad954190a47aa7ecac3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Weapons inspectors have begun work with Syrian officials on securing the Assad regime's chemical arsenal, taking the first steps towards destruction of the weapons next year.</p><p>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said a team of about 20 inspectors had completed a first day of work in Syria on Thursday.</p><p>\"Joint work with the Syrian authorities has begun on securing the sites where the team will operate, especially in outlying areas,\" a web bulletin said. \"The team has also been considering the health and environmental hazards which they may have to confront. In addition, planning continues for one of the team's immediate tasks, disabling Syria's chemical weapons production facilities, which should begin soon. Discussions on the size of Syria's stockpiles are also under way, as well as long-term planning, so that deadlines unanimously imposed by the executive council of the OPCW and the UN security council are met.\"</p><p>The OPCW executive council has set a 1 November deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons production. The destruction of the entire Syrian arsenal, estimated by western intelligence at 1,000 tonnes of sarin nerve agent and other poison gases, has to be completed by mid-2014, according to the OPCW decision backed unanimously by the UN security council last Friday.</p><p>OPCW officials had predicted that the first few days in Syria would be spent going through paperwork on the country's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile to ensure it included all the relevant information, and to make plans with Syrian officials to visit the production plants and munitions. The announcement that work had already started on locking down those sites suggests that the process could be ahead of schedule.</p><p>The weapons inspectors believe some of the sites they will have to visit will be close to the front lines in the Syria's civil war. Other visits will involve crossing rebel-held territory, and will require UN staff negotiating safe passage with the opposition. OPCW officials are concerned about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/un-inspectors-syria-dismantle-chemical-weapons-cache\" title=\"\">the health effects of wearing chemical protection suits</a> together with body armour, possibly with air tanks, in the 35C heat at some of the sites.</p><p>In its statement, The Hague-based organisation said: \"In their discussions with the authorities, the OPCW-UN team was keen to stress that the onus was on the Syrian government to meet the verification and destruction deadlines. It was however reiterated that the joint mission will provide the necessary technical support to meet these obligations. Meeting the regular reporting requirements will be one indication of compliance.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418999876|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|62157d53214459db54b5ca22c7efbd7dd6092a21 -->",
