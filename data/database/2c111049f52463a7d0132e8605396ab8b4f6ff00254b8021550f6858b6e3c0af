You’re an occasional listener, then.</p> <p><strong>I don’t listen, I just hear. It goes in one ear and out the other. </strong>In that case, you’ll probably have missed the latest news.</p> <p><strong>Oh God, what’s happened now? Has Ruth lost a wellie or something?</strong> No, there has been a departure.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t they just kill off a bunch of people in a flood? </strong>That was last year. And, anyway, it’s not that kind of departure. Sean O’Connor is leaving.</p> <p><strong>Who is Sean O’Connor? Is he the one that sells eggs?</strong> He’s the editor.</p> <p><strong>The editor of what? Borsetshire Life?</strong> He’s the editor of the show.</p> <p><strong>Wait, are we talking about an actual person? </strong>Yes. After two and a half years with The Archers, O’Connor is moving to EastEnders.</p> <p><strong>He should find Albert Square quite a bracing change, after working on a soap where people pull lambs out of sheep all day.</strong> O’Connor has already worked on EastEnders. Indeed, he has been criticised for bringing some of the TV soap’s breathless sensationalism to Ambridge.</p> <p><strong>I wouldn’t go that far.</strong> Perhaps you’re forgetting about all those dramatic storylines: the sudden deaths, the fights, the affairs, the bypass …</p> <p><strong>Not to mention the abuse Helen Titchener, née Archer, is currently suffering at the hands of that scumbag, Rob. </strong>Are you sure you’re not a loyal listener?</p> <p><strong>Don’t be ridiculous. Sometimes, when I visit my mum on Sundays </strong>… It’s nothing to be ashamed of – 4.8 million people regularly tune in.</p> <p><strong>So who is O’Connor’s replacement going to be?</strong> It’s not yet known, but whoever they choose will have to strike a difficult balance between maintaining ratings and satisfying the traditionalist fanbase.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps the new editor could organise a huge cake sale in a barn, and then burn the barn down? </strong>Your idea will be passed on to the relevant department.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “This job would be perfect for anyone with experience in radio drama, a deep knowledge of the show’s history and a real drive to innovate.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Except you, Helen darling. You need to rest.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11275051","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2460145","internalRevision":"71","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Sean O’Connor is leaving Ambridge and heading east after a semi-controversial stint that brought death and chaos to rural Britain.

Is this about that thing she said?</strong> It is. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/emma-thompson-uk-would-be-mad-not-to-stay-in-eu\">She was in Berlin promoting her new film and said she would vote to stay in the EU</a>, calling Britain “a tiny little cloud-bolted, rainy corner of sort-of Europe, a cake-filled, misery-laden, grey old island”.</p> <p><strong>What a splendid turn of phrase she has. How neatly that captures the British spirit of tender self-deprecation.</strong> Yeah, about that. The Sun has responded by superimposing a slice of Victoria sponge on a picture of her face and put it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs/the_papers\">on the cover with the headline: “Shut yer cakehole!”</a></p> <p><strong>They don’t like tender self-deprecation?</strong> That’s not really their thing, no. They also call her a “pro-EU super-luvvie”.</p> <p><strong>Sounds fair.</strong> Many of the MPs were rather meaner. “Ms Thompson is typical of the worst sort of fat-cat luvvie,” Burns said. “Most Brits love Britain and will see the referendum as a celebration of democracy our ancestors died to defend. Sadly, they also died to allow snooty ladies like Ms Thompson to vent their metropolitan elitist snobbery.”</p> <p><strong>Wait a minute. Is she against democracy, too?</strong> No, that’s just some word-twisting on Burns’s part. I think he’s confusing her with Isis, Hitler, etc.</p> <p><strong>Easily done. So, basically, he’s saying she’s entitled to her opinion?</strong> Yes, kind of. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goddersbloom/status/699607378291982336\">Bloom volunteered to “spank her silly bottom”</a>.</p> <p><strong>I bet he did. Unfortunately, no ancestors died for that.</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanHannanMEP/status/699529803448377344?lang=en-gb\">Hannan brings up a technical issue with her</a>. “In what sense is Britain a ‘tiny little island’, Emma Thompson?” he asked. “Geography? Economics? Diplomatic reach?”</p> <p><strong>Well?</strong> It’s geography. He was right the first time. Within Europe, the island of Great Britain is smaller than France, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Finland, Poland, Italy and Romania.</p> <p><strong>Still, you shouldn’t admit that in front of a bunch of Germans, should you?</strong> No. That’s our little secret.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I’m pretty sure our ancestors died so that Europeans would stop fighting each other.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And to defend the British empire, which was – ahem! – far from democratic.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 February 2016. An earlier version referred to Godfrey Bloom as an MEP, rather than a former MEP.<br

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The very elixir of eternal life.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong> <strong>Book clubs make you live for ever? </strong>Well, no. But they might make you live a little longer.</p> <p><strong>Because in my friend’s book club, everybody drinks enough wine to fell an elephant.</strong> It’s only true if you’re part of a certain demographic.</p> <p><strong>Explain yourself.</strong> <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/2/e010164.full?sid=8cb77b19-ec32-4851-ae68-b533dc25294a\">According to results published this week in BMJ Open</a>, a UK medical journal, people enjoy healthier lives if they maintain social bonds after they retire. Something like a book club, where you regularly meet friends and chat, can significantly reduce your risk of death in the first six years post-retirement.</p> <p><strong>So it’s the social interaction that keeps you alive, not the book club itself? </strong>That’s right. You could also be a member of a sporting club or a church society.</p> <p><strong>So I wouldn’t actually have to read the books?</strong> I suppose not. Like you said, it’s the social interaction that counts.</p> <p><strong>So I could just memorise the book’s Wikipedia summary on the way there and I’d still live longer?</strong> Listen, I’m not really sure you’re fully grasping the point …</p> <p><strong>I hate books.</strong> You’re weird.</p> <p><strong>How else can I live longer?</strong> Well, the study is all about the negative effects of social isolation in the elderly, and how it can increase the risk of dementia or cognitive decline. And one thing that can stop social isolation is …</p> <p><strong>Don’t say it.</strong> Formal employment.</p> <p><strong>Goddamn it. </strong>Sorry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/02/the-rise-of-the-alternative-book-club\">The rise of the alternative book club</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So that’s my choice, then? Work for ever or read boring books?</strong> No, that isn’t your choice at all. If you’ve just retired, you should try to remain as active as you possibly can. Maintaining strong social relationships with likeminded people is important for your health, but you can achieve this in a number of ways. It doesn’t have to be a book club.</p> <p><strong>What about if I started an I Hate Books club? </strong>I suppose that could also work, if you found enough people to join.</p> <p><strong>I definitely would. Books are idiots.</strong> Maybe you should just go and have a lie down.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “In today’s book club, we’re discussing A Short Guide to a Long Life by David B Agus.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And don’t forget that next week’s book is Swimming in a Sea of Death by David Rieff.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11263982","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2457995","internalRevision":"42","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Being a member of a reading group may extend your life, according to a new study.

age?</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> What do you mean? It looks like people complaining. I wish I could say I expected better, but honestly, this is just the kind of lazy journalism that’s typical of the Guardian nowadays.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, I am trying my best. I just thought you might want to know that the famously stoical people of Britain (including you, it would seem)</strong> <strong>are complaining about things more than they used to. </strong>Oh, really?</p> <p><strong>Yes. According to data just released by Ombudsman Services, there were 52m complaints made about products and services in Britain </strong><a href=\"https://www.ombudsman-services.org/2015-complaints-top-50-million.html\" title=\"\"><strong>last year</strong></a><strong>, which is 21% fewer than the 66m that were made </strong><a href=\"https://www.ombudsman-services.org/more-brits-taking-action-against-poor-service.html\" title=\"\"><strong>in 2014</strong></a><strong>.</strong> What do you mean fewer? I thought you said people were complaining more?</p> <p><strong>I did say that. But maybe they just had fewer things to complain about?</strong> Did they?</p> <p><strong>Yes. According to the data, the number of “conceived complaints” – ie the average number of times during the year that someone might have complained – has also fallen, from 2.9 to 2.4.</strong> These people must live charmed lives if they didn’t even get three things to complain about all year.</p> <p><strong>Nevertheless, when we compare this to the number of times people actually complained, we get a complaining rate of 46% for 2015, which is similar to the 48% from 2014. But both of those show British people being much more complainy than they were </strong><a href=\"2013 https://www.ombudsman-services.org/downloads/CAM_Research_Report.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>in 2013</strong></a><strong>, when the rate was just 32%.</strong> Riii-ght. What were they complaining about?</p> <p><strong>Things they bought from shops last year, in 23% of cases, followed by the service they got from telecoms (16%) and energy companies (13%), then various others. Interestingly, there are often big differences in where people did the most complaining. </strong>Oh yes?</p> <p><strong>In both 2013 and 2014, Londoners on average made more complaints per person than people in any other British region.</strong> Typical. They think the world revolves around them, those Londoners.</p> <p><strong>But in 2015 a new region came storming into the lead: Yorkshire and Humberside. </strong>By ’eck! Now I’m even less surprised.</p> <p><strong>But these figures show only the number of complaints, not the rate at which people were complaining, or how justified the complaints were, or … </strong>Don’t spoil it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “In my day we didn’t complain about things. We just got on with it.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “But you’re complaining when you say that!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11261570","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2457536","internalRevision":"61","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The last two years have seen a big jump in how much the average Briton complains – with 2015’s whinges being led by those from God’s own country and the capital","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Yorkshire and London are the UK's moaniest places","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-15T15:38:26Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e/0_76_2045_1228/140.jpg","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e/0_76_2045_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What are you complaining about?

your face.</p> <p><strong>Eurgh!</strong> Yeah, that’s right! “BBC3 is a badge of quality and shorthand for content that will stimulate emotions and provoke reactions!” says controller Damian Kavanagh.</p> <p><strong>I thought it was the at-times-good, at-times-awkward marriage of BBC Television and yoof kulcha?</strong> It can be two things. And now it can be anything, because an exciting new dawn beckons online!</p> <p><strong>What kind of new dawn? I thought their budget had been cut from £85m to £25m?</strong> Well yes, but to quote from the BBC again: “On Tuesday 16 February, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58_cUHX6Fgc\" title=\"\">BBC3 will switch from a linear broadcast channel to an online first destination</a>.”</p> <p><strong>From a what to a what now?</strong> From a TV channel to a website.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t it already a website? Most of its shows are on iPlayer.</strong> Yes, I suppose. Although the website will now feature a Tumblr-ish page called The Daily Drop and another section called The Best Of, which will host original programmes.</p> <p><strong>So they’re changing the website. </strong>Yes. And they’ve “announced a range of comedy, drama and documentary commissions and formats featuring new talent, new writers and new directors”.</p> <p><strong>Which all channels do all the time.</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>So the actual new dawn in this case is being taken off TV?</strong> Yes. Although Kavanagh doesn’t see it as a question of being “taken off”. It’s more about being “freed from the constraints of”. For instance, they can now mix up blogs and websites and videos as they please. “Because we’re freed from the schedule, we can use whatever format and platform is most appropriate,” he says.</p> <p><strong>Except TV. </strong>Yes, except TV obviously. Although all BBC3 originals will later be repeated on BBC1 or BBC2.</p> <p><strong>So it’s going to be a website where some of BBC1 and BBC2’s lesser programmes get uploaded early?</strong> I suppose you could look at it that way if you’re determined to be negative. But we’re entering a new era for media, in case you hadn’t noticed. <a href=\"www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34932688\" title=\"\">Getting the right balance is tricky for the BBC</a>, like it

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Concerned.</p> <p><strong>Who he?</strong> A medical professor. Principal of the Cancer Vaccine Institute. Specialist in cancer immunology and HIV/Aids research.</p> <p><strong>Good for him! Is he in the news with a treatment breakthrough? Is there something to uplift us all for once rather than send us yet further into the deepening slough of despond?</strong> Umm …</p> <p><strong>Go on. </strong>He says the NHS is on its knees and “could collapse completely” because of immigrants from the EU that we are legally obliged to treat.</p> <p><strong>Did he perhaps say this while drunk at a private dinner party? </strong>No, it’s part of a speech he will deliver at a conference entitled “The Good Life After Brexit”.</p> <p><strong>Oh. This depresses me. </strong>He is a member of Ukip.</p> <p><strong>This depresses me more. </strong>He stood as its general election candidate last year in Sutton and Cheam.</p> <p><strong>But I expect doctors to be liberal! By which I mean intelligent! By which I mean liberal! </strong>We expect much. And sometimes we are disappointed.</p> <p><strong>Is he right, though? When a cancer expert says things, I sort of think maybe they are right? </strong>They are often right if they are saying things about cancer. About the cost of immigrants to Britain’s health services, not so much.</p> <p><strong>How so? </strong>Well, there’s the 2013 research that showed traffic – and money – flows many ways.</p> <p><strong>For example? </strong>Eighteen British hospitals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/24/medical-tourism-generates-millions-nhs-health\" title=\"\">made £42m from people coming here for treatment on 2010</a>. Health tourists in total spent about £219m on shopping, eating, transport and accommodation while they were here. And while an estimated 52,000 came here for treatment, about 63,000 Brits went abroad. To say nothing, of course, of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/26/nhs-foreign-nationals-immigration-health-service\" title=\"\">11% of NHS staff and 26% of doctors who are non-British</a>.</p> <p><strong>So the picture is more complicated than the not-quite-member of Sutton and Cheam suggests? </strong>Just a bit, yes. It would take a global initiative to accurately measure international patient mobility.</p> <p><strong>Until then, we just count the cost of incomers – unless they’re staff we’ve siphoned out of other, poorer countries – and ignore the rest? </strong>It turns out you shouldn’t always do what your doctor tells you.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> Physician, listen to thyself.</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Empirical research is for diseases, not thoughts!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11241929","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-10T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2453077","internalRevision":"89","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Professor Angus Dalgleish is one of the country’s leading cancer specialists – and his diagnosis for the NHS is terminal<br />","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Is this doctor (and Ukip candidate) right that EU migrants will destroy the NHS?","byline":"Pass notes","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-09T11:40:40Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/140.jpg","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cancer expert, europhobe, and Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam 2015, Angus Dalgleish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Non-empirical … Angus Dalgleish, renowned cancer expert, committed europhobe and unsuccessful Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam, 2015. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ggqj","wordcount":"380","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56b9c9f8e4b07a94592e8b1a","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-14T11:13:00Z","standfirst":"Professor Angus Dalgleish is one of the country’s leading cancer specialists – and his diagnosis for the NHS is terminal","creationDate":"2016-02-09T11:14:00Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-02-09T22:00:52Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"502453077"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/feb/09/ukip-cancer-europe-angus-dalgleish-brexit","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/feb/09/ukip-cancer-europe-angus-dalgleish-brexit","sectionName":"Politics","elements":[{"id":"30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© 2015 Bloomberg Finance LP.","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760","suppliersReference":"UK UKIP FARAGE","altText":"Cancer expert, europhobe, and Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam 2015, Angus Dalgleish","caption":"Non-empirical … Angus Dalgleish, renowned cancer expert, committed europhobe and unsuccessful Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam, 2015.

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 2,000 years</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>An attractive mix of new and old buildings.</p> <p><strong>And what is it known for?</strong> Not much. It’s a historic but unglamorous middle-sized city in the east midlands of England, noted for its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/10/10/al_leicester_backgrounder_feature.shtml\" title=\"\">south Asian population</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkers_(snack_foods)\" title=\"\">crisp factory</a>.

But now Leicester is world-famous. Firstly because the body of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/richard-iii\" title=\"\">Richard III was discovered under a car park there</a>, then reburied on 26 March 2015. Secondly, because the local football team, Leicester City, are living through what could become the greatest story in the history of English football.</p> <p><strong>Seriously?</strong> Seriously. On 21 March 2015, Leicester lost to Tottenham Hotspur and were distant last in the Premier League, having won four of their first 29 games. Then, out of nowhere, they won seven of their last nine to achieve an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Leicester_City_F.C._season\" title=\"\">incredible escape from relegation</a>.</p> <p><strong>Well done Leicester!</strong> And it doesn’t end there. The summer began disastrously, when the club’s Thai owners took the squad on tour to Thailand, only for a <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/leicester-city-racist-orgy-video-5794654\" title=\"\">video to emerge</a> showing three youth players verbally abusing a group of sex workers during an orgy. One of the men was James Pearson, son of the team’s manager, Nigel, who was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city/11682068/Leicester-City-trio-sacked-over-racist-orgy.html\" title=\"\">sacked soon afterwards</a>. Then in August one of their best players, Jamie Vardy, was videoed shouting <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6581386/England-ace-Jamie-Vardy-in-racism-storm.html\" title=\"\">angry, racist insults at a man in a casino</a>.</p> <p><strong>Cripes.</strong> However … under their new manager, a likable old pro called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson\" title=\"\">Claudio Ranieri</a>, Leicester City have risen to the top of the Premier League. After their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/06/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-1 victory over Manchester City on Saturday</a>, they are now favourites to win the league, something the club has never done in its 132-year history. Vardy, who was still playing non-league football when he was 25, is now <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/top-scorers\" title=\"\">top of the goalscoring table</a>, and has set a new Premier League record for scoring in successive games.</p> <p><strong>Amazing. So you’re saying that the Leicester City team </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/oilysailor/status/693090940668485632\" title=\"\"><strong>miraculously improved from the moment that Richard III was reburied</strong></a><strong>?</strong> I am.

movie out of this!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “They might want to skip the racism and

a-t-il?</strong> Oh, it goes back thousands of years, to ancient Greece.</p> <p><strong>Apparence:</strong> Like a lovely little sunhat. It’s a diacritic that sits on top of letters in many modern languages, although most famously in French.</p> <p><strong>Et les Français? Pourquoi do they it use?</strong> Oh, it’s just part of how they write some words, to denote a vanished letter, usually an “s”.</p> <p><strong>Pourquoi need-they un diacritique special pour telling tout le monde que il y a un “s” disparu?</strong> Well, occasionally it helps distinguish between different words, such as <em>cote</em> (meaning level) and <em>côte</em> (meaning coast), but most of the time it just hangs around on words such as <em>être</em>, looking cool, but not really doing much.</p> <p><strong>Un peu comme les Français eux-selves?</strong> You might say that about our dear neighbours and allies. I couldn’t possibly comment. Although, as it happens, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/not-the-oignon-fury-france-changes-2000-spellings-ditches-circumflex\" title=\"\">Académie Française agrees with you, at least about the circumflex</a>.</p> <p><strong>L’académie Française! Les world-famous ultra-fogeys qui détestent le franglais?</strong> I’m not sure they would agree with the description, but, yes, them. They have issued a list of approved alternatives to some written French words, which have removed a lot of hyphens and the circumflex on such words as <em>coût</em> and <em>paraître</em>.</p> <p><strong>Mon dieu!</strong> Yes, that’s how France has reacted.</p> <p><strong>When ont-ils issued ces alternatives?</strong> Well, that’s the thing. In 1990.</p> <p><strong>Vingt-six years ago?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>So pourquoi le brouhaha now? </strong>It seems that French publishers are as speedy as French bureaucrats, because <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-grammar-uproar-over-decision-to-implement-26-year-old-reform-of-spelling-rules-a6854441.html\" title=\"\">they only updated the school textbooks this year</a>. That was duly noticed by the TV station TF1, then social media got involved ... then student groups and politicians ...</p> <p><strong>Mais, changing la langue française! C’est un big deal, n’est-ce pas?</strong> Not very big in this case. Remember, these are only approved alternatives. Where the circumflex on an “i” or “u” has no effect on meaning, it is no longer obligatory, but no one will be marked wrong for continuing to use it.</p> <p><strong>So les Français ont overreacté to un very petit adjustment à leur way of life?</strong> That’s right.</p> <p><strong>Typique!</strong> Yes. No one ever overreacts to things over here.</p> <p><strong>Dire:</strong> “How could they ban a harmless little hat?”</p> <p><strong>Ne pas dire:</strong> “Well, they banned the veil.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11232256","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2451594","internalRevision":"47","publication":"The

shock of red hair?</strong> Yep.</p> <p><strong>And that Phil Collins is a bald bloke from Chiswick? </strong>Oh fine, then. It’s not an exact resemblance. But still, that’s what he looks like spiritually. Phil Collins is the reincarnation of John W Smith. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1333165/How-psychic-cook-called-Carolyn-convinced-Phil-Collins-hes-reincarnated-American-hero.html\">A psychic told him</a>.

Isn’t Phil Collins only newsworthy because he’s back with his ex-wife? </strong>Right, OK, yes. It has been reported that Phil Collins and Orianne Cevey have got back together, even though he is said to have paid her £25m in a divorce settlement nine years ago, and she got married to someone else and had a baby in the interim. </p> <p><strong>So what does that have to do with all this stuff about reincarnation? </strong>It’s linked, I promise. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3429274/How-Phil-Collins-won-ex-wife-never-stopped-loving-d-married-man-d-paid-25m-divorce-money.html\">Reports</a> about the reunion suggest that – among other things – Phil’s obsession with the Alamo is what helped to drive Cevey away in the first place.</p> <p><strong>OK.</strong> And that in 2014, just as relations between the pair were starting to thaw, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/100-million-phil-collins-alamo-collection-in-the-works-20141029\">he gave away most of his $100m Alamo collection to a museum in San Antonio, Texas</a>.</p> <p><strong>So Phil Collins has shed himself of Alamo paraphernalia in order to have a happy life with the woman he loves? </strong>I think that’s where we’ve gone with this.</p> <p><strong>And why are you bringing it back up? Because you want to remind him of an old obsession that may have helped to ruin his marriage? </strong>I never said that.</p> <p><strong>It is, though, isn’t it? You hate the idea of Phil Collins being happy. </strong>No, that’s not it! Just, you know, reincarnation is weird and it’s in the public interest to know if any pop stars have ever believed in anything that is slightly non-traditional, even if it’s completely benign.</p> <p><strong>No, it isn’t.</strong> No, you’re right, it isn’t.
