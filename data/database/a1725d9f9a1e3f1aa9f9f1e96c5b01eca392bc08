        "body":"<p>Russell Brand has singled out the \"Oxbridge\" education of Robert Webb, as he hit back at his fellow comedian for urging him to \"read some fucking Orwell\" after Brand called for revolution and urged young people not to vote.</p><p>Webb, best known as one half of the comedy double act Mitchell and Webb and star of Channel 4 sitcom, Peep Show,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/30/robert-webb-russell-brand-vote\" title=\"\"> wrote an open letter to Brand</a> after he published <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">an essay in the New Statesman</a> entitled \"We no longer have the luxury of tradition\", which implored readers to abandon the current political system.</p><p>Brand repeated a call for a \"total revolution\", encouraging young people to abstain from voting, adding \"I will never vote and I don't think you should, either.\"</p><p>Webb wrote in reply: \"I understand your ache for the luminous, for a connection beyond yourself. Russell, we all feel like that. Some find it in music or literature, some in the wonders of science and others in religion.</p><p>\"But it isn't available any more in revolution. We tried that again and again, and we know that it ends in death camps, gulags, repression and murder. In brief, and I say this with the greatest respect, please read some fucking Orwell.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/russell-brand-revolution-_n_4213849.html\" title=\"\">In an interview with the Huffington Post UK</a>, Brand responded by joking that Webb, a University of Cambridge graduate, could have written a private letter, and criticised his Oxbridge education.</p><p>He said: \"Why didn't he just write me a normal letter? He don't know where I live, I suppose. And no, no death camps. Just for the record, in case anyone else from Peep Show is worried, I'm definitely against death camps – just in case the bloke who plays Super Hans thinks I'm a Nazi.\"</p><p>\"Definitely no killing. I'm against that; I'm a vegetarian, I think we're all equal. I'm not saying smash people's stuff up, and definitely no killing.\"</p><p>In his letter, published on 30 October, Webb challenged Brand to value the \"vanishingly small\" chance of being born in 21st century Britain, asking: \"What were the chances, in the course of human history, that you and I should be born into an advanced liberal democracy?</p><p>\"That we don't die aged 27 because we can't eat because nobody has invented fluoride toothpaste? That we can say what we like, read what we like, love whom we want; that nobody is going to kick the door down in the middle of the night and take us or our children away to be tortured?\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/russell-brand-revolution-_n_4213849.html\" title=\"\">In response, Brand told the Huffington Post's Mehdi Hasan</a>: \"Maybe [it's good] for him, mate. Maybe it's okay for Robert Webb; no one is going to take his kids away, but I've heard some examples.</p><p>\"I don't claim to be a politician, like all things I'm sure there are people in the room who know more about this than I do, I didn't have an education like Robert Webb had. But there are people from Leicester in Guantánamo Bay.</p><p>\"If you went to Oxbridge, if you went to a private school, no one is coming for your kids. They're not coming for you if you're from Oxbridge. That's my open letter to Robert. I hope it doesn't go to the other one by mistake – David Mitchell – who I really like.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421665975|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|ffaf1f3346cacdf87bbcbfce8d37845e2a4a3148 -->",

        "headline":"Fresh Meat's Zawe Ashton, AKA Vod, is the coolest thing on TV right now",
        "body":"<p>Television's coolest characters often come with a signature \"thing\". The Fonz from Happy Days had his leather jacket and his thumbs. Master William from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air had his hi-top fade and loud trousers. In the Channel 4 comedy Fresh Meat, Vod has her off-the-wall clothes and that withering gaze that cuts down foolishness at 20 paces. She's easily the coolest character on television at the moment, but when I tell that to the woman who plays her, the response is charmingly modest. \"I would really like to keep anyone who says that in my pocket, as I go about my daily life,\" says Zawe Ashton (the Zawe is pronounced like \"Bowie\"). \"When I hit a low point, I'd just ask, 'What's that you're saying in there? I'm the coolest person on TV? OK, I'll take that!'\"</p><p>With the third season of the show starting on Monday, it feels fair to say that Ashton is the breakout star of Fresh Meat. Her many memorable moments include preparing coq au vin with a sword (at posh boy JP's family home) and a lecture-hall monologue about Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (\"I feel like I've got this pompous, fat, naked man sitting on my face, and he's resting his big, overrated bollocks on my airways\"). She is the show's wry centre, looking askance at the dubious decisions made by her housemates and doling out wisdom as necessary. The character works best in concert with the others, though, and the ensemble is excellent, something Ashton puts down to a meticulous casting process and a writing team who really understand  the characters. \"Everyone in this show was put through a very rigorous process,\" she says, \"and I think that's real testament to Sam and Jesse [Bain and Armstrong, the show's creators]. They were determined to find a group that worked together, and not just go, 'Who's hot right now?'\"</p><p>In person, Ashton is only superficially like her plain-speaking, no-holds-barred alter ego: her speaking voice is slightly less deep, far less estuary than Vod's, and she's clearly more prone to both chuckling and thinking before speaking. The source of Vod's cool – The Essence Of Vod, if you will – can be boiled down to a simple but powerful philosophy: she doesn't care what anyone thinks. \"I always describe her as having no subtext, no filters,\" says Ashton. Combined with the fact that she's a girl – and a black girl at that, which is almost never brought up as an issue to be \"tackled\" – Vod was primed for cult status from the start.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634419'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148036838/Zawe-Ashton-as-Vod-in-Fre-008.jpg' alt='Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2</figcaption></figure><p>\"The door has felt very open in terms of the interpretation of Vod,\" continues Ashton. \"I've never had to take into consideration any external factors, I've been able to find out who this girl is from the inside out.\" The lack of extra racial baggage has paid dividends – last November she won a Creative Diversity Network Award for her performance, with the board praising Vod as a great example of racial diversity on our screens that didn't come served with a side-order of self-congratulation. \"That was so moving for me, because I do think about these things. I'm not the kind of actor who blocks out the undertones of the industry. I've been acting on TV since I was six, so 23 years would be a long time to keep your eyes averted.\" She arches an eyebrow.</p><p>Let's talk about those eyebrows. And lips, and clothes. Where on earth does Vod shop? And how hard is it for Ashton to \"become\" her? She laughs again. \"I'm telling you, once the head was shaved and the dummy was round the neck and the leather jacket and bovver boots were on, it was like, OK, we're ready. The whole birth of that character was so much about hair and makeup and wardrobe. RiRi's only just catching up to the dark blue lip!\" She gives high praise to Janet Horsfield and June Nevin who head the makeup and wardrobe departments. \"They're so collaborative in the process. I was cast the day before we moved to Manchester. I literally got there and was like, 'This is who I think she is – is that all right?' and they just worked in record time and completely understood what all the references were.\" Like what? \"We imagined what her parents listened to musically: a lot of Bowie, dancehall, ska. Plus I feel like her nan had a lot of influence over how she grew up because she's never been close to her mum or dad. Sometimes Vod dresses like an old man, and I feel like she's kind of empathising with her grandparents. She's a forager.\"</p><p>We gain an insight into Vod's mysterious background in an upcoming episode, when her mum comes to visit. \"It's another layer to Vod. [Writer] Penny Skinner met up with me before series three started, and said, 'Look, I really want to write something for Vod. We need something from her past, some kind of key to her upbringing to continue that identification that audiences are having.' I just went, 'Thank you, let's do it.' And the result deepened my empathy for her.\" The character of Vod has evolved over the series and the process, Ashton thinks, has been organic and natural, the big change being that she's now formed real bonds with her housemates. \"I don't imagine she lets people in very easily,\" Ashton says. \"I think Vod is a sage. If she gives you some serious insight into your life, you're going to consider it. Because those nuggets come few and far between, but when they do come, they land.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634420'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148115270/Zawe-in-Dreams-Of-A-Life-008.jpg' alt='Zawe in Dreams Of A Life' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe in Dreams Of A Life</figcaption></figure><p>Ashton's parents still live in the east London house where she was raised, the eldest of three children. Her mother Victoria emigrated to the UK from Uganda as a teenager. She became a teacher and married fellow educator Paul, an Englishman who later worked for Channel 4 in educational programming. Victoria encouraged her daughter into drama and she attended the famous Anna Scher school from the age of five. Childhood roles in Desmond's and The Demon Headmaster were followed by parts in Holby City, Casualty and the St Trinian's sequel. Since then, she's popped up in BBC1's Case Histories (as Jackson Brodie's assistant Deborah) and E4's Misfits (as a virgin with an overprotective killer dad). Most notable of all, however, was her performance in Carol Morley's film Dreams Of A Life; Ashton was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for her portrayal of Joyce Vincent, a woman whose lonely death went unnoticed for three years.</p><p>Ashton is more than an actor, too. In 2000 she won the London Poetry Slam Championships, while her play Harm's Way was performed at The Lowry in Salford and nominated for the Verity Bargate award for new writing in 2007. She has just written and directed a short for BBC Films, Happy Toys. \"They approached me because of Fresh Meat and my BIFA nomination,\" she says. \"The film is about a woman who is struggling to get up in the morning and struggling to be a mother.\" Even before playing Joyce Vincent, Ashton was interested in black women and mental health: she wrote a play, For All Those Women Who Thought They Were Mad, which was selected  for the Royal Court's playwriting festival in 2009. \"These are things that affect us all,\" she says. \"Happy Toys has a black actress as the lead, the fabulous Jenny Jules, but it's not a 'banner' film. I'm just trying to make all the dots connect.\" She describes the film-making experience as \"stressful but elating. I'm almost gleeful to be putting something out to the world.\"</p><p>We touch briefly on the recent Doctor Who casting and the Guardian poll that saw her edge out Chiwetel Ejiofor, Stephen Mangan and Ben Whishaw as our readers' favoured Tardis occupier. She thought it was a joke until she saw it online herself. \"I never in a million years would've thought I'd end up on that poll,\" she says, still somewhat incredulous. \"Me, as a mainstream character on the BBC, in a role previously filled by white men! What a wonderful way to illustrate how attitudes towards mainstream casting are beginning to change.\" She cackles. \"It wasn't even that I wanted to be Doctor Who!\"</p><p>It's time for her photoshoot. I accompany Ashton to the studio and, on the way, we see food critic Jay Rayner walking towards the front door. Ashton's eyes go wide. \"Oh my God, it's Jay Rayner. Look!\"  Vod wouldn't even have noticed.</p><p><strong><em>Series three of Fresh Meat starts  Mon, 10pm, C4</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421297519|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|8608f7aad91c8394bec0e5ef071229b6168b0f45 -->",

        "body":"<p>The inaugural <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/youtube-music-awards-live-stream-video-watch-2013-ytma/\">YouTube music awards</a> aired live across the internet from Pier 36 in New York on Sunday night, a messy affair that achieved its goal of being the antithesis of regular awards ceremonies: not least because the hosts, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/jason-schwartzman-youtube-music-awards-652622\">Jason Schwartzman and Reggie Watts</a>, ended the night covered in paint and fake blood.</p> <p>Somewhere among the chaos, the hosts presented awards in seven categories – giving winners a small, shiny, YouTube logo or, as innovation of the year winner <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/DeStorm\">DeStorm</a> called it, “the dopest paperweight”.</p> <p>The goal of the show's creative director, Spike Jonze, was to be prepared for as little as possible – each host was armed solely with a list of bullet points about the awards, all of which were voted on by YouTube users.</p> <p>“I’m used to that and that’s the way I like to work,&quot; said Watts, whose favourite YouTube video is an hour-long UFO documentary.</p> <p>“I cannot reiterate how we had no idea what was going to happen, ever,&quot; said Schwartzman after the show. &quot;All we had on the cards were the next award, but there were no lines and nothing scripted and we had no idea what was going to happen next.”</p> <p>That simple premise did not satisfy the show producer, so the hosts were also presented with &quot;obstacles” . Just 20 minutes into the show, the hosts’ humorous diatribe was interrupted as they were sent to the VIP section where actress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamrashidajones\">Rashida Jones </a>presented them with two babies, then walked away once the hosts had them in hand.</p> <p>Schwartzman, a father, was visibly upset as the baby he held cried, and repeatedly said he was concerned about the loud music – one of several elements that helped create an over-stimulating environment, even for mature adults watching from the comfort of their screens.</p> <p>&quot;I can’t speak for the baby, nor can the baby speak for itself, but it seemed like the baby just wanted its mother more than it was nervous to meet me,” he joked later, adding that the baby stopped crying when she was returned to her mother.</p> <p>The show had glimmers of promise during the live music video segments, in which filmmakers including Jonze, <a href=\"http://fafi.net/\">Fafi</a> and <a href=\"http://milk.co/\">Chris Milk </a>showed off their talent and seized on the crowd of revellers to create some genuinely impressive images.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VevSFuDm12E\">Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler the Creator rapped Sasquatch</a> in a pink cube filled with enthusiastic kids fight-dancing toward the cameras. Lady Gaga dressed as a male skateboarder for a piano ballad – <a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/news/lady-gaga-strips-herself-bare-for-dope-at-youtube-music-awards-watch\">the live premiere of her song Dope</a>, backed by an enraptured audience. MIA held a brightly-lit parade filled with hula-hooping dancers and paint-throwing for her <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/mia-performance-come-walk-with-me-2013-ytma/\">Come Walk With Me</a> video.</p> <p>The consistently artful videos strayed into gimmick territory in DJ Avicii's short film, which paired a sullen concert-goer with the mocking stereotype of a rave girl, against a foreign DJ and the concertgoer's ex-girlfriend, played by <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2486926/Vanessa-Hudgens-gets-thrown-floor-overzealous-fan--But-dont-worry-music-video.html\">Vanessa Hudgens</a>.</p> <p>Towards the end of the film, both pairs froze in place and the in-house audience was invited to vote on whether the prior pair could “hail a taxi, meet each other's parents and have some soup” or partake in a “double tragedy”. Audience members were overwhelmingly in favour of tragedy, which resulted in a mock double-suicide from the ceiling, replete with red string guts splayed on the audience below.</p> <p><strong>Award winners:</strong></p> <p><strong>Video of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E\">Girls' Generation – I Got A Boy</a></p> <p><strong>Artist of the year</strong><br /> Eminem</p> <p><strong>Response of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-72yBP7sw\">Lindsey Stirling and Pentatonix – Radioactive</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube phenomenon</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y\">I Knew You Were Trouble</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube breakthrough</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\">Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis</a></p> <p><strong>Innovation of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6FepyR0KuE\">DeStorm – See Me Standing</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421591893|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|a55bbb7c68b76def97fd2ed8ded658929c4925dd -->",

        "body":"<p>It's such a wide-ranging topic it's difficult to cover it all in one program. I have OCD around contamination and checking, and intrusive thoughts. Socialising becomes almost impossible: I can't have people back to the house if you're saying to them, \"Don't touch that.\" It's very costly – I was spending five hours a day washing my hands, using four bottles of handwash a day. It used to take me two hours to wash my hands in&nbsp;order to get the clothes out of the machine; I had&nbsp;visions that if I had any chemicals on my hands that got on the clothes, they would burst into flames. It's so outlandish, and yet it seems so real to me. The cruel thing is that the very thing I&nbsp;find the most difficult, doing the&nbsp;washing, is the very thing the&nbsp;OCD creates plenty of.</p><p>It got to the point where I was sitting on a tiny sitting-room table, because that was easy to clean off, rocking backwards and forwards, frightened to touch anything, to talk to anybody, to do anything. That's what it showed on the programme – one minute the guy is going to university, the next he's stuck in the toilet all the time. And the lass who was frightened of harming others, I can relate to myself. I can stand at the bus stop and be petrified that I'm accidentally going to push someone in front of a bus – I'm not going to, and that isn't in my thoughts, but the OCD plays on your worst fears.</p><p>I found the editing a bit strange – it jumped all over the place. But then I suppose that's the way a lot of people with OCD's minds work. One minute I'm concentrating on getting the washing out of the machine, then I think: \"No, I'll make sure I turned the tap off in the kitchen.\" Your mind is jumping backwards and forwards.</p><p>It's nice to see how other people approach their OCD – I think we can bounce ideas off each other. At one point it looked like they weren't going to get through, and then they turned a corner and they do succeed. It gives everyone hope.</p><p>• Trudy&nbsp;Angus is a volunteer for OCD Action</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421480289|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|dc53ef74a3f330e761480c61abebd463a1f61ab6 -->",

Why are the trio dancing? Who can say. What are they thinking? Well, Godard cuts in and tells us. Arthur (Claude Brasseur) is thinking of Odile’s mouth, Odile (Anna Karina) is worrying about the movement of her breasts beneath her sweater, and Franz (Sami Frey) is wondering if the world’s a dream. The sense of detachment is heightened by Michel Legrand’s obviously dubbed-in soundtrack, and the way the actors never quite nail the steps. But can we stop watching? Could we ever be as cool?",

Muzaffar Ali’s Umrao Jaan is the tale of a Lucknow dancer, hauntingly portrayed by the south Indian actress Rekha, whose heart is broken when she falls in love with a high-born nawab. In this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oFm4MYbb9ohttp://\">gorgeously seductive number</a>, voiced by Asha Bhosle, Umrao dances as her lover waits in his carriage outside.

        "body":"<p>Remembering the fifth of November is somewhat unnecessary these days: this weekend is when many Bonfire Night fuses are lit in earnest. In London, <strong>Back With A Bang!</strong> looks set to be one of Saturday's most explosive offerings, with 2013 British firework championships winners, Star Fireworks, painting the skies above Alexandra Palace (Sat, N22). As well as that there's a funfair and German beer festival among the ground-based amusements on offer.</p><p>For a closer encounter, there's Bridgwater's <strong>Guy Fawkes Carnival</strong> (Sat) whose illuminated float procession culminates in the centuries-old tradition of squibbing: 180 people lining the town's high street, fireworks held above their heads in a simultaneous blaze. Similarly Metallica-esque pyrotechnics can be found at the <strong>Ottery St Mary Carnival </strong>(Tue), when young and old carry flaming tar barrels through the streets. Only locals have the honour of barrel-bearing, but the evening also includes a giant community bonfire.</p><p>Austerity may have its jaws fastened tightly around local councils, yet many have still rustled up free displays to lift the spirits. The prize for the best setting goes to the crumbling towers and mirrored moat of <strong>Caerphilly Castle </strong>(Sat); Newham council is promising a laser show and pop soundtrack for their display at <strong>Wanstead Flats</strong> (Sun, E7); while<strong> Glasgow Green</strong> (Tue) is set to draw collective \"oohs\" from around 60,000 people on 5 November itself.</p><p>For the Guy Fawkes sympathisers, meanwhile, <strong>Diwali</strong> falling this weekend brings the chance to enjoy some torture-and-execution-free sparkle, with Leicester's sizeable celebrations on Sunday offering fireworks as the climax of an evening's entertainment. For those who just can't stand the decibels, <strong>Bristol Zoo Gardens</strong>' two family-friendly low-noise displays (Sat &amp; Sun) offer all the whizz without the bang.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421389569|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|3d645148e13d9d590123d0cb1df08b2afdc3471a -->",

        "headline":"Chris Womersley's world of mullets, music and Coco Pops at the Black Cat",
        "body":"<p>The place and time where you come of age always remain special &ndash; and for Chris Womersley the &rsquo;80s were all about Fitzroy. His latest novel Cairo mythologises the Melbourne suburb in all its gritty, arty splendour, beginning with a block of modernist flats and their dissolute inhabitants on the suburb&rsquo;s western edge. These apartments of the book&rsquo;s title are still there, behind iron railings on Nicholson Street, &ldquo;Cairo&rdquo; picked out in a 1930s font.</p> <p>Today Womersley and I are on a walking tour of Fitzroy, a rectangle on the inner-city map with Brunswick Street as its spine. This was Melbourne&rsquo;s first suburb: Victorian terraces, brick factories and cobbled lanes lining the streets that sprang up from 1839.</p> <p>The area had a mix of migrants, Aborigines and Bohemians, and mixed fortunes. Womersley moved to Fitzroy when his parents divorced in his early teens, when young apprentices in high waisted jeans and mullets swaggered in the blood-house pubs of the now largely gentrified suburb. His friends at Melbourne High were blunt. &ldquo;I remember kids at school saying &lsquo;you must be really poor&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll get stabbed there&rsquo;,&rdquo; he reminisces.</p> <p>Instead, Fitzroy became the centre of the writer&rsquo;s world. Not necessarily a healthy one, Womersley admits, but one that met all his basic needs. &ldquo;There was a period in the late &rsquo;80s when I worked on Brunswick Street, lived on Brunswick Street and I drank on Brunswick Street &ndash; so my world had a radius of about 200 metres,&rdquo; he says.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s also the starting point for our trip around the suburb, where the writer still lives. We meet the<a href=\"http://www.blackcatfitzroy.com/\"> Black Cat</a>, which he describes in Cairo as having &ldquo;waiters so laid back they barely served at all, Tretchikoff prints on the wall, Coco Pops available all day.&rdquo; </p> <p>Those were in the days of its founder, jazz musician Henry Maas, who opened the cafe in 1982, and it now has different owners, though a similar vibe. Back then, Womersley explains, it was the very first cool cafe on Brunswick Street, almost the first in Melbourne, with great music and a hip clientele (Jack Kerouac and Sylvia Plath were its patron saints), and afterwards, a thousand dark and funkily decorated venues bloomed.</p> <p>The palimpsestic nature of cities fascinates Womersley, as does their depiction in fiction. &ldquo;I remember reading<a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780143180036/monkey-grip\"> Monkey Grip [by Helen Garner]</a> when I was a teenager,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;and being really thrilled because Bell Street got a mention and I was living in Bell Street when I read it.&rdquo; With Cairo, he aimed to combine realism with a quality of nostalgia and mythologising that comes through in the voice of its narrator Tom Button.</p> <p>&ldquo;I was debating when writing Cairo as to how fictional to make it and my aim was always to write a book that was &lsquo;real&rsquo; but felt fictional,&rdquo; he says. He wanted people to think: &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be a band called Shower Scene From Psycho and then googling it<a href=\"http://www.messandnoise.com/icons/3817018\"> and finding that there was</a>.&rdquo;</p> <p>At the centre of the novel is an art heist that fits that bill: the theft of Picasso&rsquo;s Weeping Woman from the National Gallery of Victoria in 1986. A group calling itself the<a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2006/05/03/who-stole-picassos-weeping-woman/\"> Australian Cultural Terrorists</a> claimed responsibility and demanded the establishment of an annual acquisitive prize, to be called the Picasso Ransom, and an increase in art funding. The painting was returned after 17 days, demands unmet and the thieves have never been caught. &ldquo;There must be at least a dozen people who know who did it,&rdquo; he says.</p> <p>Womersley&rsquo;s pale, floppy haired Cairo protagonists, meanwhile, are wasting their fictional time at the Black Cat cafe, flicking ash and quoting Rimbaud, heading down the road to Rhumbarellas, or, for late night drinks, El Nidos, the Spanish cafe and pool hall around the corner in Johnson Street.</p> <p>The speciality of the house was a highly alcoholic sol y sombre, served in coffee cups to get round the licensing laws, which only began to liberalise in 1986. Tom Button&rsquo;s flamboyant composer friend Max Cheever drinks here. So did Womersley.</p> <p>For more illicit treats, fictional and factual, there was Seray&rsquo;s, a Turkish cafe. As a 16-year-old, Womersley and his callow friends had heard the legend that if you went in there and asked for Jimmy, you could buy marijuana. Sure enough, it worked: &ldquo;We said &lsquo;is Jimmy here?&rsquo; and this guy just chucked a few foils on the counter and said &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> <p>Out on the street, we pass another landmark in our walking tour: Womersley also points out the brothel at number 417, which he lived next door to, and the premises of the famous<a href=\"http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/4129579\"> Punters&rsquo; Club</a>, heart of Fitzroy&rsquo;s live music scene. It has been closed for a decade, a victim of gentrification.</p> <p>At least<a href=\"http://www.polyesterrecords.com/\"> Polyester Records</a> is still there; it&rsquo;s where Womersley would agonise about which album to buy with his wages as a dish pig; he worked at Restaurant Monet in nearby Nicholson Street, as does 17-year-old Tom Button when he moves into his aunt&rsquo;s old flat in Cairo. The restaurant&rsquo;s no longer there, but there&rsquo;s a commemorative plaque on the wall.</p> <p>Our final stop is on the corner of Brunswick and James at 115a &ndash; the site of<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/melbourne-life/artists-reunite-from-roaring-80s-20110222-1b42s.html\"> the Roar Studios</a>, founded by a bunch of anti-establishment artists very like the ones that stalk the pages of the novel. Fitzroy has a strong Aboriginal heritage but also attracted Mediterranean migrants, students and a bohemian crowd whose retro patron saints, Womersley notes in his novel, were Sylvia Plath and Jack Kerouac.</p> <p>But Womersley was always a bit of an outsider and like Tom Button he observed their antics and harboured dreams of being a famous writer, waiting to be discovered without putting in the hard work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young man&rsquo;s fantasy,&rdquo; he says, though as the author of three novels, he&rsquo;s since applied himself. Like his fictional hero, he&rsquo;s also now, middle-aged, looking back slightly wistfully at his youth and the forging of his identity.</p> <p>At its heart, Cairo is a coming of age story that captures a place and a time, he says.</p> <p>&ldquo;I thought, why not make it as close to my own chronology as possible? If you don&rsquo;t know the area it won&rsquo;t make a difference to your understanding &ndash; but if you do it will give you an extra thrill.&rdquo;</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/cairo/\">Cairo is published by Scribe</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421424631|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|2078760d5107f51e05f45f6cc6495b86ea422958 -->",

        "headline":"A flood of inspiration: Will Self's Thames trudges",
        "body":"<p>A few years ago, I decided to walk on the foreshore of the Thames from Battersea Park as far to the east as I could. I had observed over the years that, at especially low tides, quite large areas of hardened mud were exposed; these were either studded with pebbles and flints, or gave way to chunks of concrete slipway, or elided into true shingle. Naturally, being the sort of man I am, I hadn't made a comprehensive survey of either the littoral or the tide table, so I soon found myself wading thigh-high in the obscuring mocha of the waters, and feeling the thick silt ooze between my sandals and my soles. Impulsiveness has at least this virtue: it impels you.</p><p>I've lived in Stockwell, about half a mile south of the Thames, for the past 17 years. At best, it has provided me with amazement: like the time when I was cycling over Vauxhall Bridge, saw a small crowd gathered by the parapet, and dismounted to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/10/london-whale-plaque-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a poor whale who, scrambled up by sonar, had made his way upriver to die</a>. And at worst, it allows me some sense of the physical landscape that underlies London's portentous human geography: its hulking blocks and loitering street furniture set along elongated and repetitive arterial roads. To feel the city's location as topographically (rather than financially) determined, it's necessary to either gain sufficient height to see the lazy S-bends uncoiling along the floor of the valley, or go down to that river itself.</p><p>On pewter-grey and claustrophobic days, I'll walk for 10 minutes to the riverbank and, despite the oppressive sense of the city as a coagulation of human futility, my blues will be diluted by the Thames itself – because it doesn't care. Its great glaucous surge will continue, regardless, as its embanked pharynx sucks in the sea and spurts it out again. On the evening I walked along the foreshore from Battersea Park, I ended up wading at least half the distance to the strange rusty old freighter that's been tied up permanently beside Albert Embankment. It's been converted into a bar bistro called, suitably enough, <a href=\"http://www.tdock.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tamesis</a>. When I wasn't wading, I was marvelling at the&nbsp;strata the low tide had exposed: the old and oily piles, the weedy sections of wall, the slipways to and from nowhere. In the lee of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/21/whicharetheworldsugliestbuildings\" title=\"\">the ghastly St George's Wharf development</a>, there's an info-board that tells the idle stroller she is within a few yards of the oldest Thames crossings – a neolithic bridge, or pontoon, that stretched out&nbsp;across the waters when they were still ungirded.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642692'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383585891032/Thames-Frost-2010-by-Kurt-001.jpg' alt='Thames Frost, 2010, by Kurt Jackson' width='460' height='436' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thames Frost, 2010, by Kurt Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>But really, you've only to take the ramp beside <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/sismi6-headquarters-vauxhall-cross-london-uk\" title=\"\">the MI6 building</a> in order to acquire a direct apprehension of the river as an artery wending through the ages. When I reached Tamesis, I was waist-deep in this lifeblood, and although it was perfectly clear to me that were I to push on towards the irrelevance of Westminster – a reef sustaining but a meagre and worsted biodiversity – I would soon be sucked under, to be found days or months later at Gravesend, with eels exiting from my eyes. Yet I longed to go on, for the Thames remains the source of the epiphany I had 30 years ago, one that sent me spiralling into a new relationship with my natal city.</p><p>Standing on a sunlit Mayfair street, aged 25 with time to kill and no money to spend, it flowed into me – from the oceanic and collective consciousness perhaps – that although I'd been born within 100 yards of its banks, I had never seen the mouth of the Thames, nor, for&nbsp;that matter, had I much conception of what it might be like. It struck me almost simultaneously that, were you to encounter some benighted peon 30-odd miles from the mouth of the Amazon and ask him what it was like where the great river meets the sea, and he were to say that he had absolutely no idea, you'd think him a very benighted peon indeed. Driving east through Erith and Dartmouth, and then on to Gravesend, I was that peon. But I was about to be freed – and it was the Thames that freed me, as it spread out&nbsp;between the Grain and Canvey, a&nbsp;great electrolyte bath in which, over&nbsp;the next quarter-century, my imagination would be silvered.</p><p>In the intervening time, since I stood at the mouth of the Thames and&nbsp;watched the container ships struggle out to sea like multi-storey blocks in full flood from Thatcher's privatisation, I've been up and down the length of the river a fair amount. I've rowed on it and swam in it, but mostly I've walked beside it – sometimes fanatically – in search of that rare&nbsp;combination of the transcendent and the haptic that only the work of a serious artist can achieve. Looking at&nbsp;Kurt Jackson's canvases, which manage this feat so triumphantly for the Thames, it occurs to me that I might as well have stayed at home, waiting for them to come into being.</p><p>• This is an edited extract from Will Self's catalogue essay on Kurt Jackson.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421635063|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|ae039778cf2c81fa312fe4ad3bdc4e4a6e821714 -->",

It was a horror show! There was one shot where I call, 'Cut!' and suddenly she turns her head and mechanically stares right into the camera. It was incredibly disturbing.\"</p><p>Commenting on the new clip for the box set, producer Wyck Godfrey added: \"You're trying to create something that's otherworldly with Renesmee in the movie that has to be preternaturally intelligent yet still look like a baby but actually look a little bit more mature than one would be at one-day-old.</p><p>\"So we ended up pulling the thing out on the day and shooting it.

He started his career at the political Scottish company 7:84 in the early 1990s before graduating to the National in 1995 and the RSC a year later, and has made a point of returning to live drama as often as he can. He <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008z74b\">once described theatre as his \"default way of being\"</a> &ndash; something it's easy to believe if you've ever seen him live.</p> <p>In other words: plenty to ask him about, and we're chuffed that David will be joining us online to answer your questions. Perhaps you want to quiz him on playing Shakespeare's vacillating monarch, or how he's preparing for the <a href=\"http://onscreen.rsc.org.uk/richard-ii/\">RSC's first-ever live cinemacast next week</a>. Maybe you're <a href=\",%20live%20from%20Stratford-upon-Avon%20at%202pm%20on%20Wednesday%206%20November,\">fishing for views on Doctor Who</a>, or his upcoming film and TV work.

David will be joining us live from Stratford-upon-Avon at <strong>2pm on Wednesday 6 November</strong> &ndash; so do come back then to see what he has to say for himself.</p> <p>&bull; Richard II will be <a href=\"http://onscreen.rsc.org.uk/\">streamed live to cinemas on 13 November</a>, followed by a <a href=\"http://onscreen.rsc.org.uk/education/\">broadcast to UK schools on 15 November</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421694216|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|c9ab5aa11e26cb839fca249d34e0016c3848b6f5 -->",

        "headline":"Huey Morgan and the fine art of the TV walkout",
        "body":"<p>Never Mind The Buzzcocks loomed large in everyone's cultural consciousness for the first time in a long time this week, as Huey Morgan, the radio presenter once of 90s lounge lizards Fun Lovin' Criminals, smashed a mug in explosive fashion before storming off just before the credits rolled.</p><p> Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p70kdlOCEk0\">Click here to watch</a></p><p>Morgan has form in violent outbursts, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/15/huey-morgan-twitter-rant\" title=\"\">ranted extensively on Twitter</a> after failing to win a Sony radio award. Back then he fearlessly put shock-jock firebrands like Lauren Laverne and Fearne Cotton in his crosshairs, and now he's managed to get wound up by Rizzle Kicks' brand of ASOS-clad bantz. No doubt he'll have a full-on murderous Falling Down moment on next year's I'm A Celebrity after one of Lawson flicks him with a towel.</p><p>But Morgan is far from the first person to see the red mist unexpectedly descend while on a light entertainment format – he's not even the first on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, with The Ordinary Boys' Preston having created one of the show's most memorable moments. After Simon Amstell – not admittedly with an excess of class – read out passages from the autobiography of Preston's reality TV newlywed Chantelle Houghton, Preston's face went through various shades of glower before walking out.</p><p> Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHJgFJTEHLI\">Click here to watch</a></p><p>Meanwhile the other Morgan at the heart of much walk-out rage is rejected Thomas The Tank Engine face Piers Morgan, who fills his CNN studio with so much blithe, unflappable smugness that it drives certain guests deranged – perhaps seriously undermining the special relationship as he does so. Republican and Tea Party fave Christine O'Donnell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/aug/18/christine-o-donnell-piers-morgan-video\" title=\"\">complained that</a> \"don't you think as a host, when I say this is what I want to talk about, that's what we should address?\", before Piers continued his lifelong upholding of journalistic standards and said no. Her minder stood in front of the camera and she disengaged. Other meta-attempts include Welsh TV heartthrob Steve Jones <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aYoD38j-C8\" title=\"\">simulating high dudgeon</a>, and Kelsey Grammar <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/347360/kelsey-grammer-walks-out-of-piers-morgan-interview-after-cnn-airs-camille-grammer-photo\" title=\"\">storming off</a> before he even went into the studio.</p><p> Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKNr2LOkXYE\">Click here to watch</a></p><p>Amongst many other examples, Tracy Emin's walkout from a panel debate on the Turner prize is a real keeper – she's at the level of drunkenness where you oscillate between moments of genuine insight and those that merely seem insightful when viewed through a matrix of gin and tonic. During an arid arts debate with some tuxedo-clad toffs she yells \"are really real people watching this programme?\" and tells the panel they've lost her, then leaves saying she's going to call her mum. This is how to do a walk-off: grab the show by the scruff of the neck and expose its failings in the plainest possible language, as otherwise you can merely seem humourless.</p><p>But we should cherish even the most grumpy, harrumphing stompings, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdvfmGPDVkk\" title=\"\">the Bee Gees on Clive Anderson</a> – these grouches are standing up for their art and what they believe in, be it the right to sing in a high girlish voice or the right for your wife to write bad autobiographical prose. In a British culture where raw feeling is still cringed at, too often in public life are people encouraged to be modest, PR-slicked and self-effacing – it's far more bracing to skewer something you don't believe in, however innocuous. But what are your favourite stormings-off?
