A <em>warung</em> is a family-owned business and <em>deeksha</em> means blessing. Surfers will enjoy watching beach breaks from the comfort of their beds, while other guests may be satisfied with the panoramic sea views. There are large outdoor decks, foldable doors that open the place to the elements, and a superb kitchen. It's accessed by 108 steps, so if you weren't fit when you arrive, you will be when you leave. <br /> <em>• </em><a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/52613\" title=\"\"><em>airbnb.co.uk/rooms/52613</em></a></p><h2>Pen-y-Parrog, Pembrokeshire</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426669994\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389267795945/Pen-Y-Parrog-Pembrokeshir-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pen Y Parrog, Pembrokeshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for</strong> walkers and wild swimmers<br /><strong>Sleeps </strong>six (two doubles, one bunk room)<br /><strong>Cost </strong>from<strong> </strong>&pound;466 a week <br />Walk out of the front door of this cottage and you are on your own sandy shale beach. Built in typical Pembrokeshire style – whitewashed with thick stone walls and low-beamed ceilings – it was used as the home of Rosie Probert (played by Elizabeth Taylor) in the film of Under Milk Wood. Modern introductions include a hot tub in a cabin with sea views, and a woodburning stove. Situated just off the Pembrokeshire coastal path, it is ideal for walkers or anyone keen on rockpooling, swimming and feasting on locally grown mussels. <br /><em>• 0844 5005 101, </em><a href=\"http://www.underthethatch.co.uk/penyparrog\" title=\"\"><em>underthethatch.co.uk/penyparrog</em></a></p><h2>The Waterhouse, Koh Yao Noi, Thailand</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426669995\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389264212986/Outside-the-waterhouse-Ko-001.jpg\" alt=\"Outside the waterhouse, Koh Yao Noi, Thailand\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for</strong> water-babies<br /><strong>Sleeps</strong> six<br /> <strong>Cost</strong> from &pound;284 a week <br />A soothing soundtrack of bobbing fishing boats, panoramic sea views, and sublime sunsets are in store at this over-water holiday house on one of Thailand's least developed islands, Koh Yao Noi or Little Long Island. Located midway between Phuket and Krabi, and accessible by boat from both, the traditional timber-stilted house is typical of the architecture of the Muslim south. Low tide reveals mud flats, but it's a short amble to a fine swimming beach.<br />• <a href=\"http://www.khaodham.com/listings/waterhouse/\" title=\"\"><em>khaodham.com/listings/waterhouse</em></a><em>/</em></p><h2>The Beach House, Dahab, Egypt</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426669996\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389264049388/The-Beach-House-Dahab-Egy-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Beach House, Dahab, Egypt\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for</strong> water sports enthusiasts<br /><strong>Sleeps</strong> 4<br /><strong>Cost</strong> from &pound;372 a week<br />This is a good example of the type of self-catering property it's now possible to book through Tripadvisor – mixing recycled furniture with Egyptian art and driftwood. Its walled garden with hammocks for chilling out in leads on to the beach.

You walk through tropical gardens to a pristine beach for hammock-swinging, sandcastle-building and swimming on a safe shelf beach. Or there's a pool with a shallow end. There are board games, beach toys, boogie boards and buckets, and there's surfboard and kayak hire nearby. A turtle reserve releases baby turtles into the wild here in winter; in summer they return to lay their eggs. Interiors are classic Mexican chic: tiled floors, crisp linens, and exuberant colours. A cook can be arranged for $30pp a day extra (kids $10-20), including food.<br /><em>• + 1 212 905 6065, </em><a href=\"https://www.kidandcoe.com/destinations/mexico/the-palmeras-residence\" title=\"\"><em>kidandcoe.com/destinations/mexico</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Shore Cottages, Berriedale, Caithness</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426669999\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389265702184/Shore-Cottages-Caithness-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shore Cottages, Caithness\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for </strong>a remote getaway <br /><strong>Sleeps </strong>Two (cottage one); six (cottage two) <br /><strong>Weekly cost</strong> from &pound;179 (cottage one) or &pound;471 (cottage two)<br />Built in the 1840s to house four fishermen and their families, this terrace of cottages was abandoned when fishing went into decline. The Landmark Trust has since reconfigured the row into two cottages: one at the original size, sleeping two, and the other three knocked through to sleep six. Reached by a footbridge, the front doors open directly on to the beach known as The Shore. Both have tongue-and-groove panelling and plump armchairs to sink into after a day exploring Mull. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/Search-and-book/landmark-groups/shore-cottages/\" title=\"\"><em>landmarktrust.org.uk</em></a><em>, 01628 825925</em></p><h2>Villa Jarrow, Barbados </h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426670000\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389267534271/Villa-Jarrow-Barbados-001.jpg\" alt=\"Villa Jarrow, Barbados\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for</strong> Caribbean luxe on the cheap<br /><strong>Sleeps</strong> 6<br /><strong>Cost</strong> from &pound;854 a week<br />This charming three-bedroom Victorian villa is gingerbread-pretty and perfect for an extended family looking to experience classic Barbados without the high price.

From the kitchen, deck and living space there are princely sea views – great for observing the rituals of island life, especially if you want to snaffle something for dinner from the fishermen.

The Folly is for crews of surfers and swimmers who can appreciate this stilted home's bright decor and bargain price. It's spacious and modern, with two porches for taking in the Atlantic views. While the screened-in lower deck is a godsend for escaping mosquitos on summer evenings, the half-covered upper deck is a good sunbathing spot. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3516923#summary\" title=\"\"><em>homeaway.com</em></a></p><h2>Riviera Villa, Latchi, Cyprus<br /></h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-426670002\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389265135599/Riviera-Villa-Latchi-Cypr-001.jpg\" alt=\"Riviera Villa, Latchi, Cyprus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Good for </strong>families with under-fives<br /><strong>Sleeps </strong>six<br /><strong> Cost </strong>from &pound;600 a week<br />It may be Ikea'd up to the nines, but this house has been kitted out with exactly what you need if you have toddlers in tow, with wipe-clean furniture and a pool that can be watched from almost every room.

Request Spahouse 579, closest to the water, and you can hear the waves crash at night. Go on blustery walks, ride the stout ponies, splash about in the indoor waterpark, or cycle the coastal paths.
