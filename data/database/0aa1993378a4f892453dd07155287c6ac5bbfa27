But it was also a time for anger to re-emerge that Bridger still refuses to say what happened to her body, which remains missing despite the biggest search in British policing history.</p><p>The Rev Kathleen Rogers, who led the service, said the number of mourners who packed St Peter's church showed how many lives April had touched in her five years. They had come, she said, to celebrate the life of a \"sweet, innocent girl\" but said there remained anger and confusion that she had been so cruelly taken. People were feeling \"pain, emptiness, anger and despair\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418434522'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380200417038/April-Jones-funeral-churc-010.jpg' alt='April Jones funeral church' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mourners outside St Peter's church. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>April was abducted by Bridger as she played with a friend close to her home on 1 October last year. In the spring, he was convicted of her murder and will spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>At the end of his trial, the girl's family appealed for him to reveal where her body was, saying that they would find it hard to move on until they could recover&nbsp;it.</p><p>Bridger has refused to help. All the parents have been left with are 17 fragments of bone found in the fireplace of his cottage in the village of Ceinws, four miles from Machynlleth.</p><p>Those scant remains, in a cream-coloured coffin, were driven from the family home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in a hearse drawn by two horses wearing pink feathered plumes. April's parents, Paul and Coral, and her brother Harley, 11, followed in a car while her 17-year-old sister, Jazmin, walked the mile or so to the church, leading scores of mourners who followed the cortege on foot. April's mother sobbed as she walked into the church while Harley shook and choked back tears.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418434523'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380193569335/April-Jones-funeral-009.jpg' alt='April Jones funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A horse-drawn carriage takes the coffin to the church in Machynlleth.

The 250-strong congregation inside the church included schoolfriends of April, police officers who investigated the case and rescue workers who helped in the search following her disappearance. Also present were counsellors who have worked with residents to try to help the community recover.</p><p>Others who had not been able to get into the church listened to the service relayed via loudspeakers. Among them was a former partner of Bridger and one of the jurors at his trial.</p><p>Hymns included one composed by a bereavement counsellor following the Dunblane tragedy and Blest Are the Pure in Heart, sung in Welsh. A poem by a local writer was read out by one of April's teachers. Entitled April, it began: \"On this beautiful sunlit autumn day, A desperate sadness casts long shadows across our anxious and questioning world.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418434524'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380200546541/April-Jones-010.jpg' alt='April Jones' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>April Jones, five, who was abducted on 1 October last year.

The girl will be sponsored until she finished her education and any spare money will be used to help other villagers.</p><p>Not all wellwishers had heard the request: one bouquet left at the church read: \"April, star shining bright in the sky, sleep well.\" Another said: \"Taken far too soon.

Donations will be used to sponsor a five-year-old girl in Africa.</p><p></p><p>April was abducted by Bridger on 1 October last year as she played with a friend close to her home. Earlier this year, Bridger was convicted of her murder and told he will serve the rest of his life behind bars.</p><p></p><p>At the end of his trial the girl's family appealed to him to say where her body was, explaining that they would find it hard to move on until they recovered it, but Bridger has insisted he cannot remember what he did with the girl's remains.</p><p></p><p>An inquest held earlier this month concluded the formal proceedings connected to the case and cleared the way for the family to organise a funeral just five days short of the grim anniversary.</p><p></p><p>The Rev Kathleen Rogers, who is officiating at the ceremony, said she hoped the service would give comfort to April's family and the community.</p><p></p><p>She said: \"A funeral plays a significant part in the grieving process and the funeral of little April will be even more important for her family as the probability of such a service was very remote until the inquest two weeks ago.</p><p></p><p>\"Our prayer is that it will be a starting point for them as they travel the long and painful journey of healing. It will also, I think, give the community permission to bring some sort of normality back to our town.\"</p><p></p><p>Pink ribbons adorned the town and, as requested, mourners wore bright colours. At the time of the girl's disappearance townsfolk, searchers and police officers wore pink ribbons as a sign of hope; now they are a symbol of solidarity with the family and a bright reminder that April will not be forgotten.</p><p>The service was to include a montage of images created by April's older sister, Jazmin, as part of GCSE coursework showing scenes of family life.</p><p>A picture of April on a beach decorated the front of the order of service, which was to begin with Psalm 23, The Lord is My Shepherd, and conclude with the Welsh language version of Blest are the Pure in Heart.</p><p>Also to be sung was Memories Sad and Beautiful (to the tune of All Things Bright and Beautiful) and the hymn O, Father, on Your Love We Call, written by the Scottish bereavement counsellor Jean Holloway in response to the Dunblane tragedy.</p><p>Two poems composed by a local writer, one called April, the other An Autumn Night, will be read out by teachers from April's school.</p><p>Not all well-wishers had heard that the parents had requested that no flowers be sent. One bouquet left at the church gates read: \"April, star shining bright in the sky, sleep well.\" Another said: \"Taken far too soon. Spread your angel wings.\"</p><p>One neighbour of Coral and Paul, who did not want to be named, said: \"I can't really explain how I feel about today. It still feels unreal – everything that happened.</p><p>\"In a sense, everyone around here feels a bit relieved that April can finally have a proper funeral. The fact that Coral and Paul have been denied that for so long has made their pain even worse.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that today will help April's family gain a degree of closure – though they'll obviously never get over what happened. People here will never forget April and will always be here for her family.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>April's parents have asked that donations go to a church project to sponsor a five-year-old girl in Uganda. Rogers said the girl would be sponsored until she finished her education and any spare money would be used to help other villagers.</p><p></p><p>In recent weeks a memorial garden has been created on the green close to where April lived. It includes a doll's house, cuddly toys and flowers – all pink. A wooden seat – dubbed \"April's bench\" – and a picnic table have been crafted by staff from the nearby Centre for Alternative Technology.</p><p></p><p>A horsedrawn hearse will carry April's coffin from the Bryn y Gog estate along the high street to the church for the noon service.</p><p></p><p>Among the mourners will be Detective Superintendent Andy John, who led the investigation into April's murder, along with family liaison officers and members of the search teams who combed the hills, rivers and fields around Machynlleth looking for the girl.</p><p></p><p>John told April's inquest that on the \"balance of probabilities\", the youngster died at Bridger's cottage, Mount Pleasant in the village of Ceinws, just outside Machynlleth, on the day she was abducted.</p><p></p><p>The trial judge ruled that Bridger's crime was sexually motivated. After his arrest police found images of children being sexually abused on his laptop.</p><p>John has previously said he believes the girl's body was dismembered and scattered in different locations, possibly including a river. Bridger's skill as a former abattoir worker and his knowledge of the area would have helped him hide the remains.</p><p></p><p>Donations should be sent to Sponsor a Child, C/O <a href=\"http://www.machynllethstpeters.co.uk\" title=\"\">St Peter's church, Machynlleth</a>.</p><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418295493|2013-10-07T11:13:02Z|b4b7ff9142d015202f6b750ac983cefb44130c08 -->",

But it was also a time for anger to re-emerge that Bridger still refuses to say what happened to her body, which remains missing despite the biggest search in British policing history.</p><p>The Rev Kathleen Rogers, who led the service, said the number of mourners who packed St Peter's church showed how many lives April had touched in her five years. They had come, she said, to celebrate the life of a \"sweet, innocent girl\" but said there remained anger and confusion that she had been so cruelly taken. People were feeling \"pain, emptiness, anger and despair\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418434522'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380200417038/April-Jones-funeral-churc-010.jpg' alt='April Jones funeral church' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mourners outside St Peter's church. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>April was abducted by Bridger as she played with a friend close to her home on 1 October last year. In the spring, he was convicted of her murder and will spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>At the end of his trial, the girl's family appealed for him to reveal where her body was, saying that they would find it hard to move on until they could recover&nbsp;it.</p><p>Bridger has refused to help. All the parents have been left with are 17 fragments of bone found in the fireplace of his cottage in the village of Ceinws, four miles from Machynlleth.</p><p>Those scant remains, in a cream-coloured coffin, were driven from the family home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in a hearse drawn by two horses wearing pink feathered plumes. April's parents, Paul and Coral, and her brother Harley, 11, followed in a car while her 17-year-old sister, Jazmin, walked the mile or so to the church, leading scores of mourners who followed the cortege on foot. April's mother sobbed as she walked into the church while Harley shook and choked back tears.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418434523'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380193569335/April-Jones-funeral-009.jpg' alt='April Jones funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A horse-drawn carriage takes the coffin to the church in Machynlleth.

The 250-strong congregation inside the church included schoolfriends of April, police officers who investigated the case and rescue workers who helped in the search following her disappearance. Also present were counsellors who have worked with residents to try to help the community recover.</p><p>Others who had not been able to get into the church listened to the service relayed via loudspeakers. Among them was a former partner of Bridger and one of the jurors at his trial.</p><p>Hymns included one composed by a bereavement counsellor following the Dunblane tragedy and Blest Are the Pure in Heart, sung in Welsh. A poem by a local writer was read out by one of April's teachers.

        "body":"<p>A fellow prison inmate slashed April Jones's murderer from temple to chin, severing an artery, to try to get him to reveal where the child's body was, a court has heard.</p><p>Juvinal Ferreira attacked Mark Bridger – who claims he does not know what he did with April's body – with a weapon fashioned out of a prison-issue razor at the high security Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire.</p><p>Ferreira, 24, himself a murderer and sex attacker, was sentenced to a second life term and was told it will be 2036 before he can be considered for release.</p><p>Leeds crown court heard that Ferreira and other life prisoners had talked about attacking Bridger to make him reveal what he had done with the body of April, whom he abducted as she played near her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales, a year ago.</p><p>Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said: \"He said that Bridger's crime had been discussed and he claimed people had suggested that if Bridger was attacked, rather than say befriended, Bridger would then be more likely to reveal where April Jones's body was.\"</p><p>The premeditated attack happened in July, a few weeks after Bridger was jailed and just three days after he was allowed to associate with other prisoners for the first time.</p><p>Ferreira fashioned a weapon out of a prison-issue razor with extra blades attached to the handle. Sharp said Ferreira strode up to Bridger with the blade held between thumb and forefinger. \"He then slashed him down the face, causing a deep wound extending from temple to chin.</p><p>\"He paused for a moment and looked Bridger directly in the eyes, in Bridger's own words 'as if to admire his work or show me who it was'.\"</p><p>Bridger also suffered a cut to his arm as he tried to defend himself.</p><p>He required more than 30 stitches to the face wound, which required surgery under general anaesthetic. He will be scarred for life.</p><p>Ferreira admitted wounding with intent. Mr Justice Coulson said: \"Convicted murderers cannot appoint themselves as unpaid investigators of another crime, no matter how serious. They plainly cannot do that by themselves committing violent crime to do so.\"</p><p>Robin Frieze, defending, said Ferreira did not attack Bridger to enhance his own status in prison, for reward or because he was incited to do it.</p><p>\"He does not suggest he was put up to it, but he listened to talk within the prison and he was under the impression that if he put the complainant in a state of fear then it was more likely it would achieve closure for the family of his victim,\" Frieze said. \"He appreciates that was a wholly misguided and wrong thing to do.\"</p><p>In April 2008 Ferreira raped and murdered 47-year-old <a href=\"http://www.norfolk.police.uk/newsandevents/newsstories/2008/december/elainewalpolemurder.aspx\" title=\"\">Elaine Walpole</a> in Dereham, Norfolk, after befriending her. He stabbed her through the neck and there were bite marks on her face.</p><p></p><p>Bridger is serving a whole-life term for April's sexually-motivated abduction and murder on 1 October last year. April's funeral took place last week when the family buried a few burned bones found in Bridger's fireplace.</p><p>Last month two prisoners who killed a fellow inmate, convicted child killer Subhan Anwar, in the high security Long Lartin prison were told they will serve the rest of their lives behind bars.</p><p>Gary Smith, 48, and Lee Newell, 44, who were already serving life for killings, were both given whole-life sentences by a judge for the \"chilling\" murder of Anwar, who was bound and strangled with his own tracksuit bottoms.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/23/prisoners-life-murdering-child-killer\" title=\"\">Smith and Newell</a> followed 24-year-old Anwar into his cell armed with weapons fashioned out of a pen and a toothbrush before binding his ankles with tape. After Anwar's death, Smith made Newell a cup of hot chocolate before they let prison guards into the cell and were taken away into segregation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418858934|2013-10-07T11:13:02Z|a56231ca460b32a5e3385915d1fd5aa2b70df789 -->",
