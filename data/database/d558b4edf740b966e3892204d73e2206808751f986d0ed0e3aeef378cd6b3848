Is the capital&apos;s rash of new skyscrapers the result of lazy, unimaginative designs waved through by council planners for political and commercial gain? Or do high buildings bring a sense of ambition to a city&apos;s idea of itself – and provide desperately needed space on the vertical plane? The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We&apos;d like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings ­– the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are. Share your images using GuardianWitness – and if you get them to us before 10am on Friday 18th, the best will be published on the Guardian site.</p> <p>Closes 5pm Wednesday 24 April 2013.</p> <p><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.

It has also opened up a whole new world for those outside of newsrooms to tell their stories.</p><p>We believe that journalism gets stronger when these worlds collaborate. This is open journalism.</p><p>Today, in partnership with EE, we launch <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> – a new platform that takes the Guardian another step further on this open journalism journey. </p><p>Of course working with you, our readers, is something that the Guardian has always been proud to do.</p><p>We are lucky to have amazing communities that come to our site to share their passions and interests. From politics to poetry our community members regularly work with us to bring additional insight and depth to our coverage. </p><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greenland\">Greenland</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, West Africa's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guinea-bissau\">Guinea-Bissau</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tuvalu\">Tuvalu</a> in the Pacific, over the past year Guardian readers have accessed our site from almost every country in the world. Working together with our journalists - from picture and multimedia editors to correspondents and columnists - together we can help bring stories to light from across the globe.</p><p>In recent years alone, you have been involved in some of the biggest news stories of the age: helping us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/mps-expenses\">review MPs' expense claims</a>; providing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">eyewitness accounts of the Arab Spring</a>; unpicking<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarah-palin-emails\"> Sarah Palin's emails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\">covering</a> – and later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">understanding</a> - the UK riots.</p><p>When police told us that there was nothing suspicious about the death of the newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson, it was a reader that sent us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/07/ian-tomlinson-g20-death-video\">a video which clearly showed a police officer knocking Tomlinson to the ground</a>. When we started to investigate unfair Government work schemes, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/12/poundland-ruling-government-work-schemes\">Cait Reilly submitted her story</a> and subsequently challenged the Government's workfare scheme in court.</p><p>You have helped us tell <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/series/breadline-britain\">the human story of public spending cuts</a> with heartfelt and emotional personal stories, added depth and insight to our culture site's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/music+tone/albumreview\">album</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/series/reader-reviews-roundup\">book reviews</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/culture+tone/q-and-as\">quizzed actors, authors, musicians, dancers and artists</a> to find out exactly what makes them tick, and created our own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/series/not-the-booker-prize\">alternative to the Booker prize</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness platform</a>, and supporting <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/guardianwitness/id587343125?mt=8\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian.witness&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5ndWFyZGlhbi53aXRuZXNzIl0\">Android apps</a> will help us to carry on this tradition. It will allow you to tell your story - by desktop or mobile - by submitting pictures, videos and text to journalists directly from an assignment.</p><p>It also has its own <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">site</a>, which allows you to submit and browse news, opinions and creations submitted to those assignments.</p><p>If your submission is picked up by a journalist it could go on to be featured across the Guardian - in print and online - which means you can help set the news agenda and become part of the Guardian's award-winning journalism.</p><p>If you've seen something you think we should know about, you can also send us your own stories via the website or mobile apps.

Is the capital&apos;s rash of new skyscrapers the result of lazy, unimaginative designs waved through by council planners for political and commercial gain? Or do high buildings bring a sense of ambition to a city&apos;s idea of itself – and provide desperately needed space on the vertical plane? The Observer has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\">RIBA</a> to organise a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/RIBAObserverPanelDiscussionAreTallBuildingsBlightingourSkyline.aspx\">panel discussion</a> on the subject, on Tuesday April 16, between Rowan Moore, City of London chief planning officer Peter Rees, author/journalist Simon Jenkins and architect Julia Barfield, chaired by Kevin McCloud.</p> <p>We&apos;d like to illustrate our report of the event with your images of tall buildings ­– the beautiful or the banal, not just in London but wherever you are. Share your images using GuardianWitness – and if you get them to us before 10am on Friday 18th, the best will be published on the Guardian site.</p> <p>Closes 5pm Wednesday 24 April 2013.</p> <p><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.

How you see light and how you choose to record it is fundamental to shooting good video, and you certainly don’t need a fancy camera to have a go. Your eyes are much more important than your kit for this exercise.</p> <p>As the series continues, someone from the Guardian will be on-hand to offer some constructive criticism after each assignment, and to highlight the best responses.</p> <p>We’re also hoping you will let us know if there’s a topic you’d like to see covered or if there are other issues you think we should be addressing.</p> <p>There’s an option in the <a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> app to ‘Send us an assignment idea’ for you to do just that, and we’ll open comments here once we’ve got some videos from you.</p> <p>So without any further ado, take a look at our first episode, then get outside with your camera and show us what you’ve got!</p> <p>Closes 1pm Tuesday 30 April 2013.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://witness.guardian.co.uk/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of user-generated content on the Guardian.
