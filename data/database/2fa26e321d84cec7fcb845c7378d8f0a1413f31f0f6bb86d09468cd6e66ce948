However, believing that the bargain would not spare him further jail time, he fled the US for France, where he has lived ever since as a dual French-Polish citizen. No concerted attempts to extradite him back to the US have been made, but he was placed under house arrest in Switzerland in 2009 when he entered the country for a film festival.</p><p>To avoid a similar situation, Polanski is now looking for an official word that he won't be placed under threat of extradition. \"Both the artistic and technical conditions proposed by Polish studios fulfill expectations,\" <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanski-prepping-next-feature-715697\">said</a> his producer Robert Benmussa of the forthcoming film. \"But the final decision ultimately depends on the legal security of Roman Polanski in Poland.\"</p><p>He is hoping to make An Officer and a Spy, a biopic of Alfred Dreyfus, a 19th century French officer falsely accused of attempting espionage. He hasn't avoided his native Poland entirely though – he scouted for locations for the film in Krakow and Warsaw, and last year appeared in an unannounced masterclass at the Gdynia film festival.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/17/judge-roman-polanski-rape-case-questioned\">Earlier this year</a> emails leaked to the New York Times revealed that there may have been misconduct by a judge in the original Polanski trial, which, were Polanski to face trial again in the US, could see the director absolved of guilt. But Polanski is clearly not taking any chances.</p><p>His latest film Venus in Fur, starring his wife Emmanuelle Seignier and Mathieu Amalric as an actor and director embroiled in power games, premiered at this year's Cannes film festival. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/01/venus-in-fur-review-roman-polanski-sexual-politics\">a four-star Observer review</a>, Jonathan Romney wrote: \"Of all Polanski's latter-day chamber pieces, this is the liveliest: taut, witty and, while very much a male film, nevertheless a sly dismantling of the sexual politics of performance.\"</p>","headline":"Roman Polanski to film in Poland – as long as he won't be extradited","trailText":"<p>Roman Polanski intends to film his next project in Poland, but only if the government can assure that he won't be extradited to the US on child sex charges</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404205086354/Roman-Polanski-003.jpg","wordcount":"355","commentable":"false","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T11:41:28Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/01/roman-polanski-poland-extradition","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/01/roman-polanski-poland-extradition","tags":[{"id":"film/romanpolanski","webTitle":"Roman Polanski","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/romanpolanski","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"law/extradition","webTitle":"Extradition","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/extradition","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/extradition","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.

Chief executive Phil Clapp said: “Customers will be requested not to wear these into cinema auditoriums, whether the film is playing or not.” Meanwhile Vue, the UK's third-largest cinema chain, said it would ask filmgoers to remove the eyewear \"as soon as the lights dim\".</p><p>The ban follows similar moves in the US, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/google-glass-banned-cinemas-us-drafthouse\">independent Drafthouse chain said last month that it was banning Google Glass</a> over piracy fears. Industry bodies The National Association of Theaters Owners (Nato) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have also introduced rules outlawing all recording devices, including Google Glass. The devices have been available in the US since last year, but filmgoers opting to wear them in cinemas have faced draconian interventions. In January, a wearer was removed from an AMC site in Columbus, Ohio, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\">taken for questioning by </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\"> homeland security</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\">officials</a> partway through a screening of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.<br></p><p>Google Glass is a new piece of hardware from the technology giant that resembles a pair of glasses, and features an inbuilt camera for recording your surroundings. It can also display information via the internet on a small screen next to the eye.<br>Google itself has poured scorn on suggestions the wearable devices could be used to record films for redistribution. A spokesman said in a statement: \"We recommend any cinemas concerned about Glass to treat the device as they treat similar devices like mobile phones: simply ask wearers to turn it off before the film starts. Broadly speaking, we also think it's best to have direct and first-hand experience with Glass before creating policies around it. The fact that Glass is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up whenever it's activated makes it a fairly lousy device for recording things secretly.\"</p><p>A Nato spokesman <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/google-glass-banned-at-uk-movie-theaters/\">told the Wrap</a>: “As part of our continued efforts to ensure movies are not recorded in theatres, we maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward using any recording device while movies are being shown. As has been our long-standing policy, all phones must be silenced and other recording devices, including wearable devices, must be turned off and put away at show time. Individuals who fail or refuse to put the recording devices away, may be asked to leave. If theatre managers have indications that illegal recording activity is taking place, they will alert law enforcement authorities when appropriate, who will determine what further action should be taken.\"<br><br></p>","headline":"Google Glass banned in UK cinemas","trailText":"Wearable devices forbidden over piracy fears as users may record films direct from screen<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199589055/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"446","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T07:35:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/01/google-glass-banned-in-uk-cinemas","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/01/google-glass-banned-in-uk-cinemas","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google-glass","webTitle":"Google Glass","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-glass","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google-glass","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-4f850962-7924-484f-af34-1d4f6dd98e7c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199588429/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199588429/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Sean Gallup","altText":"Google Glass","height":"132","credit":"Sean Gallup/Getty Images","caption":"Does this look like a pirate? ...

Much as I love music, football and film, I've never wanted to be a particular musician, footballer or actor. Nor have I ever watched a film and wished I could be a particular character. I've had moments of wishing for particular characteristics: certainly, there were times in my adolescence when I longed for the stylish, dark hair of the young crop of British actors – Grant, Graves, Firth and so on – rather than my own unkempt ginger mop. I've had moments, too, of falling in love with female characters, though it's always safe to do that from a cinema seat, when you don't actually have to deal with the neuroses that make those people interesting on screen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d6d1aad3-e039-495a-a5f3-43a2cb15e4be\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404206614341/b6a232a4-8223-47af-97e0-23decf6ab4ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> Carell and Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But wanting to be someone from a film?

There's more to the film than that, but that's the only bit that counts.</p><p>Now, if I've long been distrustful of the notion of \"role models\", I've been even more suspicious of the notion of remaking oneself. You are what you are, I have always thought. Which allowed me to be a fortysomething man wearing trainers, T-shirts and jeans bought from the Gap. Did I look crap? Very possibly. Did I care? No. Well, I thought I didn't.</p><p>And then Ryan Gosling changed my mind. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a5c69b9b-e189-4219-a45c-855026557fc4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404195407202/8aadec01-060a-403f-b5a7-61c98fba2701-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Carell, wearing the correct size clothes, in Crazy Stupid Love\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Steve Carell, wearing the correct size clothes, in Crazy Stupid Love</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's not that I held out any expectation of transforming myself into Ryan Gosling (there's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cephI-s26g\">a marvellous scene later in the movie</a> in which Emma Stone takes one look at his six-pack and exclaims: \"Fuck! Seriously? It's like you're Photoshopped!\"). And that's despite Gosling coming second only to Cusack in my list of men-I-am-happy-to-watch-in-pretty-much-anything-even-when-they-play-wankers. But getting somewhere close to Carell didn't seem wholly unattainable. </p><p>But the thought slipped out of my mind when I got home, until a couple of months later, when the film was on TV and I suggested to my wife we watch it together. Watching a film about a marital breakup with her, I became uncomfortably conscious of the fact that someone so beautiful, funny and clever might well think she could do better than a middle-aged schlub in a grubby T-shirt and ill-fitting jeans. Gosling's homilies to Carell hit home, hard. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zckciw8lD1k\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zckciw8lD1k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Gosling: \"Are you Steve Jobs? Hold on a second, are you the billionaire owner of Apple Computers?</p><p>Carell: \"No.\"</p><p>Gosling: \"Oh, OK. Well in that case you got no right to wear New Balance sneakers, ever.\"</p><p>And so I resolved never to wear trainers, except for weekend slobbery, ever again. And so I haven't.</p><p>Carell: \"Can't we just go to the Gap?\"</p><p>Gosling: \"Cal, be better than the Gap. Be better than the Gap. Say it.\"</p><p>And so I resolved never again to buy jeans from the Gap. And so I haven't.</p><p>The next day, in my lunch hour, I took the tube down to Oxford Street and spent the best part of £500. A rather nice moleskin suit became mine, some trousers that weren't jeans, a couple of shirts. I followed Gosling's advice to make the suit jacket a size smaller than I actually felt comfortable with, and when I showed my wife she was amazed. \"That looks so good! You look so much slimmer in it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-28b5eb38-0075-4b23-8348-fc5ec7331784\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404195190160/10aee1e8-d216-404a-bacf-b151c986d4fc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Carell smartens up his act in Crazy, Stupid Love.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Carell smartens up his act in Crazy Stupid Love</figcaption> </figure>  <p>For months, I stopped wearing jeans to work. I only wore proper trousers. Given that I work in the field of pop music, this did make me look a little middle-aged. But I <i>am</i> middle-aged. So what if I'm no longer trying to dress like a kid? I haven't once worn a T-shirt in the office since that evening, nor trainers. I possess fitted shirts, rather just baggy old bags. And though I've slipped back on the trouser front, and do wear jeans most of the time, none of them are from the Gap anymore.</p><p>None of which is to say you would ever mistake me for a fashion guru. But these days, I hope, you would not say: God, that man's a slob. Because you know what? I'm better than the Gap. And Ryan Gosling taught me that.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/27/goldie-hawn-private-benjamin-like-to-be\">Celine Bijleveld: why I'd like to be Goldie Hawn</a><br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/25/role-model-robert-de-niro\">• Rowan Righelato: why I'd like to be Robert De Niro</a></p>","headline":"Why I'd like to be Steve Carell groomed by Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love","trailText":"Continuing our series in which writers reveal the movie characters they want to emulate, <b>Michael Hann</b> explains why he took inspiration from Steve Carell's de-slobbing makeover (with a little help from Ryan Gosling) in Crazy, Stupid Love<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404194879181/c067fba4-3963-4cda-a1fd-a642694576d6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"857","commentable":"true","byline":"Michael Hann","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T07:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/01/why-id-like-to-be-steve-carell-groomed-by-ryan-gosling-in-crazy-stupid-love","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/01/why-id-like-to-be-steve-carell-groomed-by-ryan-gosling-in-crazy-stupid-love","tags":[{"id":"film/series/role-model","webTitle":"Role model","description":"Writers on which movie characters they emulated growing up - or they still model themselves on today","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/role-model","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/ryan-gosling","webTitle":"Ryan Gosling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/ryan-gosling","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/stevecarell","webTitle":"Steve Carell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stevecarell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/stevecarell","references":[]},{"id":"film/emma-stone","webTitle":"Emma Stone","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/emma-stone","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelhann","webTitle":"Michael Hann","rcsId":"GNL004716","r2ContributorId":"16128","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/michael_hann_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael Hann is music editor of the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelhann","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelhann","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-8e04e579-c296-4317-9631-d93f8f92b3a2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404206574956/a6880f16-75ac-481b-a2ae-8f81df29280e-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404206574956/a6880f16-75ac-481b-a2ae-8f81df29280e-68x68.jpeg","source":"Courtesy of Warner Bros.

director</a>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>This may be a heretical thought, but we at the Guardian have always found James Bond films a tiny bit boring. Even the successful, \"exciting\" ones, like Skyfall or Casino Royale. We may be in the minority though: Skyfall, the 23rd in the hoary old series, became by far its most lucrative. In fact, it's currently the ninth highest grossing film of all time, ahead of Jurassic Park, the first Hobbit film and The Dark Knight Rises.</p><p>Still, the question arises: where does it go next. Having classed up the joint by hiring Sam Mendes as director for Skyfall, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/11/james-bond-sam-mendes-daniel-craig\">persuading him to return for Bond 24</a> (presumably by sending lorryloads of cash over after he claimed not to want to) alongside Daniel Craig, series producers Eon were no doubt metaphorically cackling and rubbing their hands with glee – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/24/john-cleese-james-bond-humour-asian-markets-bourne\">the sneers of John Cleese notwithstanding</a>.</p><p>Now, however, it looks like Bond 24 has a crisis of identity already. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2671471/BAZ-BAMIGBOYE-Bond-turmoil-new-script-fails-thrill.html\">According to reports</a>, writer John Logan's effort was greeted with quiet dismay and – irony of ironies – Logan has been replaced by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, the very writers who were jettisoned when Logan was brought in by Mendes to polish up Skyfall. The suggestion is the script needs more \"punch\" – and we're thinking that means more of the action-gag combo that 007 pioneered back in the day.</p><p>So where do you think the Bond franchise should go? More action, or more \"character\"? Less gadgets, or less emoting? Let us know in the comments below.</p>","headline":"After Skyfall: which way now for the Bond movie?","trailText":"<p><strong>Open thread: </strong>As Bond 24 runs into script troubles, we want your thoughts on what direction the franchise should take</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/8/1349692151124/2012-SKYFALL-006.jpg","wordcount":"253","commentable":"true","byline":"Guardian film","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-07T14:20:19Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/30/james-bond-movie-script-which-way-now","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/30/james-bond-movie-script-which-way-now","tags":[{"id":"film/jamesbond","webTitle":"James Bond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/jamesbond","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/skyfall","webTitle":"Skyfall","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/skyfall","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/skyfall","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-440879315","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/8/1349692159517/2012-SKYFALL-011.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","photographer":"Allstar/UNITED ARTISTS","altText":"2012, SKYFALL","height":"276","credit":"Allstar/UNITED ARTISTS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","caption":"Which way now? ...

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/mar/16/1\">Peter Bradshaw's review of Takashi Miike's Audition</a></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Hollywood’s latest proposal to remake a cult Asian horror film could see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/audition-miike-odishon-horror\">Takashi Miike’s infamous Audition</a> reimagined for US audiences, <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/audition-remake-mario-kassar-murakami-miike\">reports Deadline</a>.</p><p>Producers of the new project say they will base their film on the 1997 source novel by Japanese author Ryu Murakami, which was translated into English in 2009, rather than Miike’s adaptation. Both versions tell the tale of a middle-aged man who enters a world of pain after mounting a series of auditions for a new (much younger) partner.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/17/audition-ryu-murakami-irvine-welsh\">Reviewing the English translation of Audition</a> for the Guardian in 2009, Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh wrote: “It is in the third act that Murakami’s writing is at its strongest, in what is a genuinely shocking and grisly climax. Those who know his previous novels, particularly Piercing and Almost Transparent Blue, will be aware that his strongest suit as a writer is how he portrays tripped-out, hallucinogenic sex and violence, and both the sex between Aoyama and Yamasaki in the hotel room and the subsequent violent denouement are mesmerising and compelling.”</p><p>Deadline says the remake will focus on a man named Sam Davis, who lives alone with his son following the death of his wife seven years prior, and is convinced by a film-maker friend to stage fake auditions. He meets a ballerina with a mysterious past and finds himself falling in love.</p><p>Miike’s 1999 film is known as one of the most excruciating examples of Asian horror. Hollywood has had mixed success in mounting English-language versions of such films in recent years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/oldboy-review\">In 2013 Spike Lee delivered a poorly received remake of Oldboy</a>, another harrowing cult thriller originally directed by South Korea’s Park Chan-wook.</p><p>Richard Gray will direct the US remake from his own screenplay. The Melbourne-born film-maker is best known for the 2013 time-travel thriller <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1928337/\">Mine Games</a>.</p>","headline":"Hollywood to remake Audition: English-language version of cult Japanese horror planned","trailText":"<strong>Ben Child</strong>: Producers to base new film on Ryu Murakami’s original 1997 novel rather than Takashi Miike’s 1999 film, with Australian director Richard Gray at the helm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404126790331/89b4e6bc-7be0-4c94-a900-209f736fcfbd-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"294","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-03T12:45:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/30/hollywood-to-remake-audition-cult-japanese-horror","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/30/hollywood-to-remake-audition-cult-japanese-horror","tags":[{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-adaptations","webTitle":"Film adaptations","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-adaptations","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film-adaptations","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"film/world-cinema","webTitle":"World cinema","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/world-cinema","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/world-cinema","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-525f593b-e25e-4e8a-b663-16e054d4d45b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404126789847/89b4e6bc-7be0-4c94-a900-209f736fcfbd-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404126789847/89b4e6bc-7be0-4c94-a900-209f736fcfbd-220x132.jpeg","source":"Kobal","photographer":"Kobal","altText":"Eihi Shiina in Takashi Miike's 1999 notoriously nasty horror film Audition","height":"132","credit":"Kobal/Kobal","caption":"Eihi Shiina in Takashi Miike's 1999 notoriously nasty horror film Audition, which Hollywood now plans to remake.

The Transformers franchise is one of the best there is at what it does – and does it when you absolutely, positively gotta eliminate everybody else in the field. There was a relatively late start to the marketing campaign for Transformers: Age of Extinction when Paramount booked a teaser trailer during Super Bowl 48 in February, but then again, when a property is so familiar, why spend lots of cash to raise awareness far in advance? And so the fourth entry in the noisy sci-fi series arrived at the weekend, delivering the kind of landing nobody could compete with. The estimated $100m (£59m) debut was the biggest US opening weekend of 2014 so far, although not quite as good as the $108m scored by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-megan-fox-michael-bay\" title=\"\">Revenge of the Fallen</a> in 2009. Not to matter: the sparkle of those double zeroes is all the fuel the marketing and distribution teams at Paramount need to drive this baby into the sunset. Fourth of July weekend will almost certainly belong to Transformers and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/09/why-we-love-michael-bay-transformers\" title=\"\">Michael Bay</a>'s cacophony – starring Mark Wahlberg, to boot – is on its way to achieving the $402.1m lifetime gross franchise pinnacle set by Revenge of the Fallen. It may not get there, but it won't half be a close-run thing, by which time all the people who prefer VoD or digital viewing will enter the fray. Job done. Ker-ching.<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/28/transformers-age-extinction-review-michael-bay-robots\">• First look review: Transformers: Age of Extinction</a></p><h2>A pause to reflect on China</h2><p>The might of China grows each week and this is relevant to Hollywood because beasts such as Age of Extinction get greenlit precisely because the studios know they'll do so well there. This drives the all-important international box office, which can account for 60-65% of a tentpole's global gross. There was a spot of bother last week when it emerged that Pangu Investments, owner of a hotel featured in the movie, threatened legal action that might delay the Chinese release. But guess what? It all got resolved in time and the movie opened on 27 June as planned, but not before studio executives got scared out of their wits. A fawning statement issued by Paramount vice-chairman Rob Moore on Sunday praising several Chinese partners in the movie's success said it all. Age of Extinction arrived there on around $90m – that's 90% of what it grossed in North America. How long before a Chinese opening weekend takes more than the US equivalent? I'd say we'll see this momentous occasion by the end of summer 2015, the mouth-watering season that promises Avengers 2, Jurassic World and the Terminator reboot, to name a few. One of these will gross more in its first weekend in China than it will in North America. There, I said it. Now it's downhill all the way.</p><h2>Jersey Boys settles into middle age</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440864578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/18/1403106064170/Jersey-Boys---2014-011.jpg' alt='Jersey Boys - 2014' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Clint Eastwood's biopic about the Four Seasons arrived with a whimper last weekend and did not fare much better in its second session, indicating that the director was right when he reportedly questioned a decision by Warner Bros to release it when they did. The second weekend was all about seeing if the older demographic would come out in support and judging by the 43% drop, you'd have to say some did, but this was not an overwhelming vote in favour, and nothing like the game-changing U-turn the movie needed to steer the story to one of slow-burning success. If it can stick around a couple more weeks as a counter-programmer with appeal to older audiences, there's a chance Jersey Boys will cross $45m (£27m). Either way, we can expect a Golden Globe campaign at the end of the year ... but don't let the marketing mavens tell you that this was a box-office success, because the $40m drama would need around $80m in theatrical receipts to start looking in good shape and it's not going to get much help from international markets.</p><h2>The Fault in our Stars rockets past $100m</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439909273\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault/140620TGFSFault.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>By contrast, Fox Searchlight's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green\" title=\"\">young adult adaptation</a> is a palpable hit in the US and further afield. The movie crossed $100m last week in North America and is about to do the same in the international market place. At a cost of around $12m, this is a bona fide smash. The studio reached out to harness the mighty social footprint of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jun/15/review-the-fault-in-our-stars-john-green\" title=\"\">book's author John Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/ansel-elgort-the-fault-in-our-stars-interview-im-happy-to-be-a-role-model\" title=\"\">banked on the appeal</a> of rising stars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/04/shailene-woodley-young-adult-badass-divergent\" title=\"\">Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, with whom she starred in Divergent</a>. Definitely one of the hits of the summer, whatever happens, and a potential awards contender on the indie circuit.</p><h2>Toronto premiere Begin Again starts well</h2><p>As anybody who has seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/17/once-the-musical-enda-walsh\" title=\"\">Once will attest, John Carney knows how to charm an audience</a>. Last autumn his Toronto 2013 world premiere Can a Song Save Your Life? was well enough received for Harvey Weinstein to shell out $7m and commit around $20m to market the movie, which means this weekend's limited release in five theatres is merely appetisers. Weinstein is the master at creating a narrow debut to sell out the theatres and get audiences clamouring for more. So $148,000 from five bodes well for the wider expansion that will come in the weeks ahead. Weinstein also changed the name of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/09/can-a-song-save-your-life-toronto-2013-review\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo drama with music to Begin Again</a>, which is slightly snappier and one letter closer to A, making it quicker to access on VoD.</p><h2>North American top 10, 27-29 June 2014</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/transformers-age-of-extinction\" title=\"\">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>, $100m</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/22-jump-street\" title=\"\">22 Jump Street</a>, $15.4m.

It is based on a real-life impasse which affected the west African team prior to their exit at the group stage last week, though fictional elements will be incorporated to further spice up the proposed movie.</p><p></p><p>The plot sees the $3m stolen after the courier is ambushed. He then has fewer than 12 hours to recover the money or face the wrath of his employers (and presumably the Ghanaian footballers).</p><p></p><p>\"The world has soccer fever and Hollywood has caught it,\" said Wharton-Rigby, a former staff writer for Homicide: Life on the Street, the celebrated Emmy-winning TV series from producer David Simon which predated the even more successful The Wire.</p><p></p><p>The screenplay has been optioned by US production company Bugeater, whose founders Dan Mirvish and Barry Hennessey will produce the film. Hennessy, an Emmy winner for reality TV show The Amazing Race, told the Wrap: \"I've shot extensively in both Ghana and Brazil, and this is a perfect project to capture the raw energy that both countries have to offer.\"</p><p></p><p>Ghana's president, John Dramani Mahama, was forced to send a plane containing $3m to Brasília for the players to share after a row over appearance fees threatened to see the team go on strike. Ghana, who at one point refused to train due to lack of renumeration, subsequently lost their final group match 2-1 to Portugal and exited the competition.</p><p></p><p>Wharton-Rigby's 1998 film Detention won the best director prize at the Urbanworld film festival.

I probably don't even have that much influence over my son's birthday parties.</p><p>He is, meanwhile, perhaps the most dapper male character in modern film (I'd call it a tie with <a href=\"http://heracliteanfire.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/tony.jpg\" title=\"\">Tony Leung in In the Mood for Love</a>). Yes, I have occasionally, in mid-summer, donned a pair of Jep-like white trousers, but with the nagging and very British worry that the achieved look is less \"Rome high life\" and more \"at Cliff Richard's villa with the Blairs\". As a wheezy asthmatic I can't even smoke with any conviction.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-409278563\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/5/21/130521GreatBeautyTrailer_FromRemote-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/5/21/130521GreatBeautyTrailer_FromRemote_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/5/21/130521GreatBeautyTrailer_FromRemote_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/5/21/130521GreatBeautyTrailer_FromRemote/130521GreatBeautyTrailer_FromRemote.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>It's not as if Gambardella is a particularly admirable figure. A man who cheerfully concedes he has squandered his talents – after a promising youthful novel he fell into an intellectually shallow life as a gossip journalist – he is simultaneously a deeply social creature and emotionally distant, with few genuinely close confidantes. He can even be openly cruel, as when he callously and publicly dissects the hypocrisy of a rich and hypocritical friend's left-wing pretensions.</p><p>So why the identification? In part it's because Gambardella is such an engaging presence: playful, impish, watchful, simultaneously of his world of slightly grotesque socialites and an amused, detached observer.</p><p>He enjoys one of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/27/guardian-film-awards-longlist-best-scene\"> truly great cinematic introductions, amid the decadent chaos and thumping, anonymous electropop of his own 65th birthday party. Sorrentino spends a full five minutes leading us around the rooftop festivities, the camera swooping between revellers, before we finally encounter, at the centre of it all, Gambardella, slowly turning to face the viewers with an expression of exquisite, subtle mischief</a>. Who would not wish to be him?</p><p>The real kinship comes with Jep's paradoxical everyman status. He might occupy a rarefied world, but his preoccupations are universal. After his birthday he learns of the death of his first, and possibly only, love – who, he subsequently discovers, never lost her feelings for him – sparking something of an existential crisis, albeit an exceedingly urbane one.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440842330'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/9/4/1378317972215/La-Grande-Bellezza-The-Gr-007.jpg' alt='La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty)' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Suave … Toni Servillo and Galatea Ranzi in The Great Beauty</figcaption></figure><p>While occupied by his looming demise and the nagging idea that he has wasted his life, Gambardella's defining characteristic, as suggested by the film's title, remains a permanent awareness of the beauty all around him. He pads around unrealistically empty Roman streets at night, at once deeply familiar with the city's marvels and quietly, gratefully appreciative. In one scene he slips away from a grisly party where a precocious and anguished child artist is splattering paint over giant canvases to lead a friend around a usually-locked palace filled with treasures.</p><p>Jep's sense of everyday magic is sometimes deliberately exaggerated by Sorrentino, for example when an aged, Mother Theresa-like nun, sitting wrinkled and beatific on the majestic terrace of Gambardella's city centre apartment, wordlessly communes with a flock of flamingoes.</p><p>Indeed, Jep's attitude to religion is something of a microcosm of his wider perspective. While notably sceptical – he repeatedly encounters a senior cardinal apparently interested only in discussing recipes for duck – this arguably never becomes cynicism; never precludes the possibility of transcendence.</p><p>There's an obvious rejoinder to all this: it's one thing appreciating the beauty around you when you have no worries about money and, seemingly, little in the way of work commitments beyond occasional lunches with a diminutive, wise editor. Being Jep Gambardella on jobseekers' allowance in Croydon might prove more of a struggle.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440842331'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2013/5/9/1368115308443/The-Great-Beauty-aka-La-G-010.jpg' alt='The Great Beauty aka La Grande Bellezza film still' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Engaging presence ... Toni Servillo in The Great Beauty</figcaption></figure><p>That is, to an extent, to miss the point. Since first watching The Great Beauty, Jep's worldview hasn't necessarily percolated into my life through canary yellow linen jackets accessorised with elegantly folded pocket handkerchiefs, though I'll confess to having been occasionally tempted. His story is a more universal reminder: however glorious and ubiquitous we believe ourselves, that metaphorical Kierkegaardian roof tile could land on our head around the very next corner. Don't be taken in by the falsehood and vanity, Jep tells us, but equally don't let it obscure the view of all that is worthy of worship.</p><p>So what of me? I might be mainly found cycling round a grey London in corduroy, not gallivanting between high-end Rome parties in linen and silk, but at any moment I can channel my inner Jep to reveal to wonder all around.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/great-beauty-toni-servillo-sorrentino\">• Read an interview with Servillo </a></p><h2>More why I'd like to be …</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/27/goldie-hawn-private-benjamin-like-to-be\" title=\"\">• Celine Bijleveld: why I'd like to be Goldie Hawn</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/26/roger-moore-james-bond-007-role-model\" title=\"\">• Martin Pengelly: why I'd like to be Roger Moore</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/25/role-model-robert-de-niro\" title=\"\">• Rowan Righelato: why I'd like to be Robert De Niro</a></p>","headline":"Why I'd like to be … Toni Servillo in The Great Beauty","trailText":"<p>Continuing our series in which writers reveal which movie characters they emulate, <strong>Peter Walker</strong> explains why he so admires Servillo's exceedingly urbane Jep Gambardella: it's not the linen suits but the keen awareness of life's everyday magic</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/30/1404114541061/Toni-Servillo-in-The-Grea-004.jpg","wordcount":"794","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Walker","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-05T11:10:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/30/toni-servillo-the-great-beauty-role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/30/toni-servillo-the-great-beauty-role-model","tags":[{"id":"film/the-great-beauty","webTitle":"The Great Beauty","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-great-beauty","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-great-beauty","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/role-model","webTitle":"Role model","description":"Writers on which movie characters they emulated growing up - or they still model themselves on today","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/role-model","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/paolo-sorrentino","webTitle":"Paolo Sorrentino","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paolo-sorrentino","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/paolo-sorrentino","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

Or rather, Dick Lester did, by understanding them exactly, and filming their crazy everyday lives at the height of British Beatlemania as a sardonically funny, lightly surreal faux-documentary with priceless musical inserts. The main point was: the pop group plays the pop group. Sounds easy, right? Wrong: anybody could imitate it, but nobody could replicate it. Not even Lester, as the more bloated and sluggishly madcap Help! proved 18 months later.</p><p>And not John Boorman, in his early apprenticeship as a director, who took a similar approach with his Dave Clark Five movie Catch Us If You Can. The Five weren’t the Fab Four (despite that Daily Express headline “Tottenham Sound Has Crushed The Beatles!”), not musically and definitely not charisma-wise, but you can still watch the movie for some great songs, cute period cars, and for the band members’ clothes and shoes, which are too-too haute-mod 1965, and just to die for. In retrospect, I’m glad Boorman got it all out of his system early on; his next film, his first masterpiece, was Point Blank.</p><p>A Hard Day’s Night lit up the London outposts of the Hollywood Studios, who at the time were spending money like water in Britain. So it’s surprising that so few pop-group movies ended up being made, because to hear tell, almost every band got an offer. Even Gerry And The Pacemakers got to star in Ferry Cross The Mersey, which soon vanished completely for decades. And Herman’s Hermits – truly the most execrable cultural waste byproduct of the entire Invasion, who yet became huge family-friendly moptops in the USA – first played themselves in a Connie Francis MGM movie, then starred in Mrs Brown, You’ve Got a Lovely Daughter, and every time it plays on TCM, I reach for my Ted Turner voodoo doll and pins. Its absolute polar opposite, the Monkees’ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/monkees-head-jack-nicholson-interview\">Head</a> – cynical and surreal – may be the best pop group movie after A Hard Day’s Night, but it was also the genre’s death-knell.</p><p>Apart from the Beatles, the really great bands avoided movies: the Kinks, the Who, the Animals, the Hollies, the Small Faces, the Zombies. The Stones’ movie offers only resulted, years later, in Performance, the second-greatest British movie ever made (so there!). Be thankful for that, because if the Stones had ever made their own Ferry Cross The Mersey, I fear we’d think very poorly of them today • </p>","headline":"A Hard Day's Night: the only worthwhile Beatlemania movie","trailText":"Though Hollywood's British outposts were spending like mad, and every 60s pop group got film offers, in movies as in music, the Beatles were ahead of the pack","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403708384439/a1ce21a2-9491-4005-ae3c-e98e5929fa44-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"472","commentable":"true","byline":"John Patterson","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-05T00:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/30/a-hard-days-night-the-only-worthwhile-beatlemania-movie","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/2014/jun/30/a-hard-days-night-the-only-worthwhile-beatlemania-movie","tags":[{"id":"film/a-hard-day-s-night","webTitle":"A Hard Day's Night","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/a-hard-day-s-night","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/a-hard-day-s-night","references":[]},{"id":"music/thebeatles","webTitle":"The Beatles","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/music/thebeatles","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johnpatterson","webTitle":"John Patterson","rcsId":"GNL297119","r2ContributorId":"15873","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/john_patterson_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Patterson writes about film and is based in Los Angeles.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpatterson","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/johnpatterson","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/theguide","webTitle":"The Guide","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/theguide","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/theguide","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-f68b22f7-1b8b-4d61-bb20-9088df935ced","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403708383741/a1ce21a2-9491-4005-ae3c-e98e5929fa44-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403708383741/a1ce21a2-9491-4005-ae3c-e98e5929fa44-220x132.jpeg","source":"Redferns","photographer":"John Rodgers","altText":"Patti Boyd, Tina Williams, Pru Bury, Susan Whitman, The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night.","height":"132","credit":"John Rodgers/Redferns","caption":"Patti Boyd, Tina Williams, Pru Bury and Susan Whitman comb the hair of four blokes from Liverpool on the set of A Hard Day's Night.

In the gripping opening movement of this self-consciously pulpy, 80s-set thriller, fidgety father and husband Richard Dane (Michael C Hall, shedding the killer instinct of his title role in <em>Dexter</em>) loads and then accidentally discharges his daddy's gun, responding with trembling hands to the sound of an intruder. In the aftermath of the shooting, which messily redecorates the Danes' living room in tones far from floral, Richard is hailed a local hero by the east Texan townsfolk who previously held his manhood in doubt. But death is never blood simple and even low-life scumbags have relatives, in this case, grizzled ex-con Ben (Sam Shepard) who comes looking for familial vengeance and finds more than he bargained for.</p><p>The fourth feature from writer/director team Nick Damici and Jim Mickle is an altogether more masculine, mainstream affair than their previous outing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/14/we-are-what-we-are-review\" title=\"\"><em>We Are What We Are</em></a>. In that under-appreciated remake of Jorge Michel Grau's bleak Mexican cannibal movie, Damici and Mickle flipped the gender roles, following the story's matriarchal threads with impressively subversive results. Here, they have fun with the macho stereotypes of hard-bitten potboilers, pitching an uncertain dork who has apparently never before wielded a gun into a world in which real men shoot first and ask questions later. \"Must be hard for a man like you,\" says a sneering cop (played by Damici), surveying the crimson results of Richard's newly discovered trigger finger. \"A civilian, I mean,\" he corrects himself, although he clearly meant nothing of the sort.</p><p>Based on the novel by Joe R Lansdale, whose knowingly absurdist prose provided the source material for the undead Elvis and JFK horror comedy, <em>Bubba Ho-Tep</em>, this intermittently spicy, shape-shifting romp revels in its wildly veering tonal jolts, flipping like a catfish on a pole as it struggles to evade genre definition.</p><p>What starts out as a throwback neo-noir (think John Dahl's <em>Red Rock West</em> with a hint of Carl Franklin's <em>One False Move</em>) mutates variously into good-ole boy slapstick (enter Don Johnson in a white stetson and fire-apple red convertible), earnest, hard-boiled grit (Shepard looming menacingly over the beds of sleeping children and the grave of his recently departed son) and video-nasty era sleazy urban legend (more <em>Snuff</em> than <em>8mm</em>).</p><p>In some ways, the film forms a flipside companion piece to David Cronenberg's <em>A History of Violence</em>, another tale of a quiet man drawn into a world of comic-strip brutality, littered with broken-backed narrative left turns that wrong-foot the audience, leaving them wondering how much of this is but a bloody, fevered dream.</p><p>Sticking very specifically to the original time frame of Lansdale's 1989 novel, <em>Cold in July</em> plays out to a soundtrack that counterposes short blasts of mullet-haired soft-rock with squidgy analogue electronica, the latter pitched somewhere between Giorgio Moroder's score for <em>Midnight Express</em> and John Carpenter's homemade <em>Halloween</em> riffs. Like the VHS videotapes that become an integral part of the plot (and indeed the briefcase-size \"portable\" phone on which Johnson's caricatured Jim Bob signally fails to get a signal), Jeff Grace's music nails the narrative in the period before the dawn of the digital age, when it was still possible for weird stuff to happen without everybody finding out about it and social networking meant having a beer in a bar with someone on whom you couldn't run a quick Google search. A soundtrack album of Grace's music is available on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/jeff-grace/id103033249\" title=\"\">iTunes</a>, although the idea of downloading it seems oddly anachronistic – surely this is one you'd want to own on vinyl?</p><p>As always, what defines Mickle and Damici's work is their genre literacy; from the low-budget shivers of <em>Mulberry St</em> to the western-gothic inflections of <em>Stake Land</em> and the insular satire of <em>We Are What We Are</em>, their movies are rooted in the dank, fertile soil of fandom, a term I invoke&nbsp;as&nbsp;a compliment rather than&nbsp;criticism.</p><p>Although <em>Cold in July</em> doesn't entirely hang together as it slips recklessly between the gruelling, the goofy and the gory (sometimes the shifts work against the story, undercutting rather than enhancing the tension), the attention to detail is devilish, from the understated horrors of Hall's excruciating 80s hair and tache arrangement, to the nostalgic splatter palette of the overcooked third act, stills from which wouldn't look out of place in a well-thumbed back-issue of <em>Fangoria</em>.</p><p>As for the performances, they're ripe and rich, even though the three core characters sometimes appear to be starring in entirely different movies. While Johnson has a hoot building on the self-parody that has given his career a second wind, Shepard plays it straight as the man with little to say and even less to lose. But it's Hall who steals the show, pitching it just right as an emasculated antihero seduced by the dinosaurs of old-school machismo, learning ugly lessons about what it means to walk like a man.</p>","headline":"Cold in July review – an everyday 80s tale of guns 'n' poses","trailText":"<p>Nick Damici and Jim Mickle are back with a fine, shape-shifting romp that veers from gory to goofy, harking back to a more macho age, writes <strong>Mark Kermode</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403708785739/Cold-In-July-004.jpg","wordcount":"830","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Mark Kermode, Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-02T08:00:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/29/cold-in-july-review-guns-and-poses","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/29/cold-in-july-review-guns-and-poses","tags":[{"id":"film/cold-in-july","webTitle":"Cold in July","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/cold-in-july","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/cold-in-july","references":[]},{"id":"film/thriller","webTitle":"Thriller","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/thriller","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/thriller","references":[]},{"id":"film/crime","webTitle":"Crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/crime","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/crime","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","webTitle":"Mark Kermode's film of the week","description":"Films of the week reviewed by the Observer's film critic Mark Kermode","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","references":[]},{"id":"stage/shepard","webTitle":"Sam Shepard","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/shepard","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/stage/shepard","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/markkermode","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/markkermode","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-440840393","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403708785739/Cold-In-July-004.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Rex Features","altText":"Cold In July","height":"84","credit":"Rex Features","caption":"Sam Shepard, Michael C Hall and Don Johnson in Cold in July.

Invited to join his famous bro on tour, Tom sets about documenting the band's triumphs and his own mishaps: awkward interviews (\"Do you ever get … tired on stage?\"), shambolic backstage chores (\"You've got the towels and water, right?\"), botched guest lists (\"Werner Herzog has been waiting out there for, like, 40 minutes!\"), and a failure to board the tour bus that finally gets him fired. At which point Tom retreats to the safety of the family home, and the film becomes a domestic study of sibling rivalry and support. It's an uneven affair, embraced as unguardedly \"intimate\" by some fans of the band, but in reality less moving than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/22/anvil-music-documentary-review\" title=\"\"><em>Anvil!

sounds flimsily, flirtily promising. Sadly, the results (which debuted in Toronto back in 2012) are completely disposable, as Firth's divorced dad pulls a Reggie Perrin identity switch, and teams up with Blunt's glamorously overdosing waif. On the run from their respective pasts, the odd couple head off in search of his under-par dreams, stopping en&nbsp;route to have break-in sex with falsely assumed identities and underwear. For a while, the leads make the most of it – Firth all bumbling Englishness (despite a wobbly American accent) and Blunt alternately stroppy, pouty and needy. But fun turns to fatuousness as the past rears its messy head, leaving the movie to wrestle clumsily with estranged sons, schizophrenic twins, and a frankly inexplicable Anne Heche.</p>","headline":"Arthur and Mike review – Colin Firth in below-par identity-switch drama","trailText":"<p>Firth and co-star Emily Blunt make the most of their odd-couple roles but are overwhelmed by a clumsy denouement, writes <strong>Mark Kermode</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/26/1403788479913/Emily-Blunt-and-Colin-Fir-006.jpg","wordcount":"136","commentable":"true","starRating":"2","byline":"Mark Kermode, Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-01T23:09:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/29/arthur-and-mike-review-colin-firth-emily-blunt-drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/29/arthur-and-mike-review-colin-firth-emily-blunt-drama","tags":[{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/arthur-and-mike","webTitle":"Arthur and Mike","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/arthur-and-mike","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/arthur-and-mike","references":[]},{"id":"film/colin-firth","webTitle":"Colin Firth","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/colin-firth","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/colin-firth","references":[]},{"id":"film/emily-blunt","webTitle":"Emily Blunt","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-blunt","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/emily-blunt","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/markkermode","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/markkermode","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-440840146","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/26/1403788479913/Emily-Blunt-and-Colin-Fir-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Michael Tackett","altText":"Emily Blunt and Colin Firth in Arthur and Mike","height":"84","credit":"Michael Tackett","caption":"Misfits united: Emily Blunt and Colin Firth in Arthur and Mike.

Man's</em> Jon Favreau goes back to his swinging indie roots – albeit with a VIP guest list. Working from his own script, he plays frustrated chef Carl Casper, forced by his restaurateur boss (Dustin Hoffman) to repeat the same old dishes until a snippy review provokes a meltdown that goes viral. Out of a job, and out of sorts with his habitually disappointed son (Emjay Anthony), Carl decides to reinvent himself with the aid of a Twitter account and a taco food truck. For all its reheated film-food cliches (cooking as a metaphor for bonding – sexual, fraternal, familial) and refried road-movie beans, <em>Chef</em> slips a few tasty side dishes around its meat-and-potatoes main course. John Leguizamo's sous-chef sauciness lends spice to Favreau's honest Joe schtick, while Robert Downey Jr makes a meal of an <em>amuse-bouche</em> cameo as Carl's ex-wife's ex-husband. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara are on hand to prove that, in Hollywood, sexy heft remains an essentially male prerogative. At times it resembles a glorified advert for Twitter, but compared to Google-backed abomination <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155768/internship\" title=\"\"><em>The Internship</em></a> with which Favreau's former partner-in-crime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/vince-vaughn-delivery-man-will-ferrell-bill-murray\" title=\"\">Vince Vaughn</a> sold what's left of his soul, such product placement appears innocuous indeed.</p>","headline":"Chef review – Jon Favreau cooks up a tasty food movie","trailText":"<p>The indie film-maker goes back to his roots with this tale of a chef who rediscovers his love for cooking, writes <strong>Mark Kermode</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/26/1403789199298/Jon-Favreau-centre-in-Che-006.jpg","wordcount":"208","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Mark Kermode, Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-26T13:23:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/29/chef-review-jon-favreau-tasty-food-movie","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/29/chef-review-jon-favreau-tasty-food-movie","tags":[{"id":"film/chef","webTitle":"Chef","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/chef","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/chef","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/critics","webTitle":"Critics","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/critics","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/markkermode","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/markkermode","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-440840258","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/26/1403789199298/Jon-Favreau-centre-in-Che-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Merrick Morton","altText":"Jon Favreau, centre, in Chef.","height":"84","credit":"Merrick Morton","caption":"Jon Favreau, centre, in Chef.

Loach's <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/screen/story/0,6903,595331,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>Land and Freedom</em></a> and the British director's influence is much in evidence in this powerful, truthful and often harrowing account of young people making the perilous trek from Guatemala to the US. We open with arresting images of teenagers fending for themselves on the streets of Guatemala City: feisty Juan striding through back streets, money sewn into his trousers; Sara cropping her hair and binding her breasts in a public toilet, hoping to hide her gender; Samuel scavenging for scraps on a vast rubbish heap, an emblematic snapshot of a derelict home life. Abandoned by adults, the trio embark upon a journey fraught with life-threatening danger, from jumping trains to being kidnapped, robbed and beaten by thugs and authorities alike. En route, they fall in with the Tzotzil Indian Chauk, who speaks no Spanish but is better able to understand their situation than most, his young eyes blending innocence with knowledge beyond his years. The terrifying tribulations the ramshackle group encounter are culled from the recollections of hundreds of migrants – a microcosm of a far wider human tragedy, made all the more alarming by its apparent mundanity. Yet it's the warmth and compassion of the storytelling that really strikes home. Quemada-Díez meets his young charges on equal terms, viewing the world through their eyes, seeing its strange wonder even as they gaze unflinchingly at an unforgiving future. The result is at once urgent, defiant, and heartbreaking.</p>","headline":"The Golden Dream review – harrowing account of migrants' journey to US","trailText":"<p>Three teenagers embark on a perilous

I've had moments of wishing for particular characteristics: certainly, there were times in my adolescence when I longed for the stylish, dark hair of the young crop of British actors – Grant, Graves, Firth and so on – rather than my own unkempt ginger mop.

Or, specifically, in front of one scene that led me to change my lifestyle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2011/sep/21/crazy-stupid-love-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1636473\"                data-video-name=\"Crazy, Stupid, Love: 'A makeover as a metaphor for rediscovery' - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-379325292\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1172989910001_110922crazystupidlove2-5226733.jpg?pubId=281851582\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2011/9/21/110922crazystupidlove2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110922crazystupidlove2/110922crazystupidlove2.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1172989909001_110922crazystupidlove2-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2011/9/21/110922crazystupidlove2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Crazy, Stupid, Love: 'A makeover as a metaphor for rediscovery' - video</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/143219/crazy-stupid-love\">Crazy Stupid  Love</a>, Steve Carell is the sweet bloke who's been dumped by his wife, Julianne Moore. He takes to hanging out in a local bar, drowning his sorrows, where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWJd1jaYaeU\">lothario Ryan Gosling</a> takes pity on him, tells him he needs to be remade – and duly takes him to the mall to do so. There's more to the film than that, but that's the only bit that counts.</p><p>Now, if I've long been distrustful of the notion of \"role models\", I've been even more suspicious of the notion of remaking oneself. You are what you are, I have always thought. Which allowed me to be a fortysomething man wearing trainers, T-shirts and jeans bought from the Gap. Did I look crap? Very possibly. Did I care? No. Well, I thought I didn't.</p><p>And then Ryan Gosling changed my mind. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a5c69b9b-e189-4219-a45c-855026557fc4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404195407202/8aadec01-060a-403f-b5a7-61c98fba2701-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Carell, wearing the correct size clothes, in Crazy Stupid Love\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Steve Carell, wearing the correct size clothes, in Crazy Stupid Love</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's not that I held out any expectation of transforming myself into Ryan Gosling (there's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cephI-s26g\">a marvellous scene later in the movie</a> in which Emma Stone takes one look at his six-pack and exclaims: \"Fuck! Seriously? It's like you're Photoshopped!\"). And that's despite Gosling coming second only to Cusack in my list of men-I-am-happy-to-watch-in-pretty-much-anything-even-when-they-play-wankers. But getting somewhere close to Carell didn't seem wholly unattainable. </p><p>But the thought slipped out of my mind when I got home, until a couple of months later, when the film was on TV and I suggested to my wife we watch it together. Watching a film about a marital breakup with her, I became uncomfortably conscious of the fact that someone so beautiful, funny and clever might well think she could do better than a middle-aged schlub in a grubby T-shirt and ill-fitting jeans. Gosling's homilies to Carell hit home, hard. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zckciw8lD1k\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zckciw8lD1k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Gosling: \"Are you Steve Jobs? Hold on a second, are you the billionaire owner of Apple Computers?</p><p>Carell: \"No.\"</p><p>Gosling: \"Oh, OK. Well in that case you got no right to wear New Balance sneakers, ever.\"</p><p>And so I resolved never to wear trainers, except for weekend slobbery, ever again. And so I haven't.</p><p>Carell: \"Can't we just go to the Gap?\"</p><p>Gosling: \"Cal, be better than the Gap. Be better than the Gap. Say it.\"</p><p>And so I resolved never again to buy jeans from the Gap. And so I haven't.</p><p>The next day, in my lunch hour, I took the tube down to Oxford Street and spent the best part of £500. A rather nice moleskin suit became mine, some trousers that weren't jeans, a couple of shirts. I followed Gosling's advice to make the suit jacket a size smaller than I actually felt comfortable with, and when I showed my wife she was amazed. \"That looks so good! You look so much slimmer in it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-28b5eb38-0075-4b23-8348-fc5ec7331784\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404195190160/10aee1e8-d216-404a-bacf-b151c986d4fc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steve Carell smartens up his act in Crazy, Stupid Love.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Carell smartens up his act in Crazy Stupid Love</figcaption> </figure>  <p>For months, I stopped wearing jeans to work. I only wore proper trousers. Given that I work in the field of pop music, this did make me look a little middle-aged. But I <i>am</i> middle-aged. So what if I'm no longer trying to dress like a kid? I haven't once worn a T-shirt in the office since that evening, nor trainers. I possess fitted shirts, rather just baggy old bags. And though I've slipped back on the trouser front, and do wear jeans most of the time, none of them are from the Gap anymore.</p><p>None of which is to say you would ever mistake me for a fashion guru. But these days, I hope, you would not say: God, that man's a slob. Because you know what? I'm better than the Gap. And Ryan Gosling taught me that.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/27/goldie-hawn-private-benjamin-like-to-be\">Celine Bijleveld: why I'd like to be Goldie Hawn</a><br></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/25/role-model-robert-de-niro\">• Rowan Righelato: why I'd like to be Robert De Niro</a></p>","headline":"Why I'd like to be Steve Carell groomed by Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love","trailText":"Continuing our series in which writers reveal the movie characters they want to emulate, <b>Michael Hann</b> explains why he took inspiration from Steve Carell's de-slobbing makeover (with a little help from Ryan Gosling) in Crazy, Stupid Love<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404194879181/c067fba4-3963-4cda-a1fd-a642694576d6-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"857","commentable":"true","byline":"Michael Hann","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T07:00:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/01/why-id-like-to-be-steve-carell-groomed-by-ryan-gosling-in-crazy-stupid-love","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/01/why-id-like-to-be-steve-carell-groomed-by-ryan-gosling-in-crazy-stupid-love","tags":[{"id":"film/series/role-model","webTitle":"Role model","description":"Writers on which movie characters they emulated growing up - or they still model themselves on today","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/role-model","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/series/role-model","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/ryan-gosling","webTitle":"Ryan Gosling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/ryan-gosling","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","references":[]},{"id":"film/stevecarell","webTitle":"Steve Carell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stevecarell","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/stevecarell","references":[]},{"id":"film/emma-stone","webTitle":"Emma Stone","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/emma-stone","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelhann","webTitle":"Michael Hann","rcsId":"GNL004716","r2ContributorId":"16128","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/michael_hann_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael Hann is music editor of the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelhann","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/michaelhann","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-8e04e579-c296-4317-9631-d93f8f92b3a2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404206574956/a6880f16-75ac-481b-a2ae-8f81df29280e-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404206574956/a6880f16-75ac-481b-a2ae-8f81df29280e-68x68.jpeg","source":"Courtesy of Warner Bros.

actor has revealed.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=120091\">Brosnan told ComingSoon.net</a> he had discussed joining the franchise with producer Avi Lerner. \"I said to Avi Lerner, 'If it works out and you have a good script, Avi, you know where to find me if you still want me.' It's as simple as that really,\" he said.</p><p>Added Brosnan: \"Sylvester Stallone is the one that's given us these wonderful platforms for actors who have and had careers to go play and have fun and to entertain. To bring a bunch of guys together who saved the world, fought the bad guys, and put them all on the same stage, that's crazy good.</p><p>\"It's just about entertainment. Avi is somebody I've heard about and his movies always have big brash entertainment value to them. You can really change the world and that's great, but The Expendables? Yeah, I'd love to do The Expendables. It's just a kick in the pants.\"</p><p>The two Expendables films, starring action icons such as Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham and Jet Li, have so far have grossed more than $579m at the global box office. A third instalment, The Expendables III, is due to hit cinemas in August. It features Mel Gibson as the main villain and also sees Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford and Antonio Banderas joining the cast. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/14/pierce-brosnan-james-bond-never-good-enough\">Brosnan revealed in April</a> that he did not rate his performances as 007 in four films between 1995 and 2002. \"I have no desire to watch myself as James Bond. 'Cause it's just never good enough,\" he said. \"It's a horrible feeling.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/19/pierce-brosnan-interview-long-way-down\">• From March 2014: 30 Minutes with Pierce Brosnan</a><br><br></p>","headline":"Pierce Brosnan angling to join next Expendables movie","trailText":"Former Bond star wants to join crew of not-so-young action heroes in next of Sylvester Stallone's series of films","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404205828522/171f1ba8-e055-40ee-b3b5-eab6e0e03086-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"288","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T10:15:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/01/pierce-brosnan-angling-to-join-next-expendables-movie","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/01/pierce-brosnan-angling-to-join-next-expendables-movie","tags":[{"id":"film/pierce-brosnan","webTitle":"Pierce Brosnan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/pierce-brosnan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/pierce-brosnan","references":[]},{"id":"film/sylvester-stallone","webTitle":"Sylvester Stallone","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sylvester-stallone","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/sylvester-stallone","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-a6cca9ef-09f5-4e62-be75-c2ddc8018de3","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404205829704/171f1ba8-e055-40ee-b3b5-eab6e0e03086-68x68.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404205829704/171f1ba8-e055-40ee-b3b5-eab6e0e03086-68x68.jpeg","source":"Stewart Cook / Rex Features","photographer":"Stewart Cook / Rex Features","altText":"Pierce Brosnan","height":"68","credit":"Stewart Cook / Rex Features/Stewart Cook / Rex Features","caption":"Not so expendable?

Chief executive Phil Clapp said: “Customers will be requested not to wear these into cinema auditoriums, whether the film is playing or not.” Meanwhile Vue, the UK's third-largest cinema chain, said it would ask filmgoers to remove the eyewear \"as soon as the lights dim\".</p><p>The ban follows similar moves in the US, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/google-glass-banned-cinemas-us-drafthouse\">independent Drafthouse chain said last month that it was banning Google Glass</a> over piracy fears. Industry bodies The National Association of Theaters Owners (Nato) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have also introduced rules outlawing all recording devices, including Google Glass. The devices have been available in the US since last year, but filmgoers opting to wear them in cinemas have faced draconian interventions. In January, a wearer was removed from an AMC site in Columbus, Ohio, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\">taken for questioning by </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\"> homeland security</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/22/google-glass-cinema-amc-homeland-security\">officials</a> partway through a screening of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.<br></p><p>Google Glass is a new piece of hardware from the technology giant that resembles a pair of glasses, and features an inbuilt camera for recording your surroundings. It can also display information via the internet on a small screen next to the eye.<br>Google itself has poured scorn on suggestions the wearable devices could be used to record films for redistribution. A spokesman said in a statement: \"We recommend any cinemas concerned about Glass to treat the device as they treat similar devices like mobile phones: simply ask wearers to turn it off before the film starts. Broadly speaking, we also think it's best to have direct and first-hand experience with Glass before creating policies around it. The fact that Glass is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up whenever it's activated makes it a fairly lousy device for recording things secretly.\"</p><p>A Nato spokesman <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/google-glass-banned-at-uk-movie-theaters/\">told the Wrap</a>: “As part of our continued efforts to ensure movies are not recorded in theatres, we maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward using any recording device while movies are being shown. As has been our long-standing policy, all phones must be silenced and other recording devices, including wearable devices, must be turned off and put away at show time. Individuals who fail or refuse to put the recording devices away, may be asked to leave. If theatre managers have indications that illegal recording activity is taking place, they will alert law enforcement authorities when appropriate, who will determine what further action should be taken.\"<br><br></p>","headline":"Google Glass banned in UK cinemas","trailText":"Wearable devices forbidden over piracy fears as users may record films direct from screen<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199589055/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"446","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-04T07:35:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/01/google-glass-banned-in-uk-cinemas","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/01/google-glass-banned-in-uk-cinemas","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google-glass","webTitle":"Google Glass","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-glass","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google-glass","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/google","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-4f850962-7924-484f-af34-1d4f6dd98e7c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199588429/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/1/1404199588429/d7b189e9-b8c6-4510-b44c-3ebf1a760902-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Sean Gallup","altText":"Google Glass","height":"132","credit":"Sean Gallup/Getty Images","caption":"Does this look like a pirate? ...

Again","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<h2>Transformers 4 opens in US on $100m</h2><p>In these uncertain times when studio movies are never guaranteed success, Paramount has done it again. The Transformers franchise is one of the best there is at what it does – and does it when you absolutely, positively gotta eliminate everybody else in the field. There was a relatively late start to the marketing campaign for Transformers: Age of Extinction when Paramount booked a teaser trailer during Super Bowl 48 in February, but then again, when a property is so familiar, why spend lots of cash to raise awareness far in advance? And so the fourth entry in the noisy sci-fi series arrived at the weekend, delivering the kind of landing nobody could compete with. The estimated $100m (£59m) debut was the biggest US opening weekend of 2014 so far, although not quite as good as the $108m scored by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-megan-fox-michael-bay\" title=\"\">Revenge of the Fallen</a> in 2009. Not to matter: the sparkle of those double zeroes is all the fuel the marketing and distribution teams at Paramount need to drive this baby into the sunset. Fourth of July weekend will almost certainly belong to Transformers and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/09/why-we-love-michael-bay-transformers\" title=\"\">Michael Bay</a>'s cacophony – starring Mark Wahlberg, to boot – is on its way to achieving the $402.1m lifetime gross franchise pinnacle set by Revenge of the Fallen. It may not get there, but it won't half be a close-run thing, by which time all the people who prefer VoD or digital viewing will enter the fray. Job done. Ker-ching.<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/28/transformers-age-extinction-review-michael-bay-robots\">• First look review: Transformers: Age of Extinction</a></p><h2>A pause to reflect on China</h2><p>The might of China grows each week and this is relevant to Hollywood because beasts such as Age of Extinction get greenlit precisely because the studios know they'll do so well there. This drives the all-important international box office, which can account for 60-65% of a tentpole's global gross. There was a spot of bother last week when it emerged that Pangu Investments, owner of a hotel featured in the movie, threatened legal action that might delay the Chinese release. But guess what? It all got resolved in time and the movie opened on 27 June as planned, but not before studio executives got scared out of their wits. A fawning statement issued by Paramount vice-chairman Rob Moore on Sunday praising several Chinese partners in the movie's success said it all. Age of Extinction arrived there on around $90m – that's 90% of what it grossed in North America. How long before a Chinese opening weekend takes more than the US equivalent? I'd say we'll see this momentous occasion by the end of summer 2015, the mouth-watering season that promises Avengers 2, Jurassic World and the Terminator reboot, to name a few. One of these will gross more in its first weekend in China than it will in North America. There, I said it. Now it's downhill all the way.</p><h2>Jersey Boys settles into middle age</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440864578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/18/1403106064170/Jersey-Boys---2014-011.jpg' alt='Jersey Boys - 2014' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Clint Eastwood's biopic about the Four Seasons arrived with a whimper last weekend and did not fare much better in its second session, indicating that the director was right when he reportedly questioned a decision by Warner Bros to release it when they did. The second weekend was all about seeing if the older demographic would come out in support and judging by the 43% drop, you'd have to say some did, but this was not an overwhelming vote in favour, and nothing like the game-changing U-turn the movie needed to steer the story to one of slow-burning success. If it can stick around a couple more weeks as a counter-programmer with appeal to older audiences, there's a chance Jersey Boys will cross $45m (£27m). Either way, we can expect a Golden Globe campaign at the end of the year ... but don't let the marketing mavens tell you that this was a box-office success, because the $40m drama would need around $80m in theatrical receipts to start looking in good shape and it's not going to get much help from international markets.</p><h2>The Fault in our Stars rockets past $100m</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439909273\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/19/140620TGFSFault/140620TGFSFault.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>By contrast, Fox Searchlight's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green\" title=\"\">young adult adaptation</a> is a palpable hit in the US and further afield. The movie crossed $100m last week in North America and is about to do the same in the international market place. At a cost of around $12m, this is a bona fide smash. The studio reached out to harness the mighty social footprint of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jun/15/review-the-fault-in-our-stars-john-green\" title=\"\">book's author John Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/ansel-elgort-the-fault-in-our-stars-interview-im-happy-to-be-a-role-model\" title=\"\">banked on the appeal</a> of rising stars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/04/shailene-woodley-young-adult-badass-divergent\" title=\"\">Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, with whom she starred in Divergent</a>. Definitely one of the hits of the summer, whatever happens, and a potential awards contender on the indie circuit.</p><h2>Toronto premiere Begin Again starts well</h2><p>As anybody who has seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/17/once-the-musical-enda-walsh\" title=\"\">Once will attest, John Carney knows how to charm an audience</a>. Last autumn his Toronto 2013 world premiere Can a Song Save Your Life? was well enough received for Harvey Weinstein to shell out $7m and commit around $20m to market the movie, which means this weekend's limited release in five theatres is merely appetisers. Weinstein is the master at creating a narrow debut to sell out the theatres and get audiences clamouring for more. So $148,000 from five bodes well for the wider expansion that will come in the weeks ahead. Weinstein also changed the name of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/09/can-a-song-save-your-life-toronto-2013-review\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo drama with music to Begin Again</a>, which is slightly snappier and one letter closer to A, making it quicker to access on VoD.</p><h2>North American top 10, 27-29 June 2014</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/transformers-age-of-extinction\" title=\"\">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>, $100m</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/22-jump-street\" title=\"\">22 Jump Street</a>, $15.4m.
