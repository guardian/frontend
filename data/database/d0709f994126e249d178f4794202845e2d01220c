        "headline":"Dario Franchitti hospitalised after IndyCar crash",
        "body":"<p>Dario Franchitti has been hospitalised after a huge accident at the IndyCar Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. The accident, which also injured 14 spectators, comes nearly two years after fellow British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In both accidents the cars went airborne and into the catch fencing.</p><p>Franchitti's Ganassi car caught the back end of Takuma Sato at turn five on the final lap of the race and was sent upwards and slid along the fence before returning to the ground. Both cars scattered debris across the track, and the remaining competitors were forced to weave through the broken equipment under caution, as had been the case two years ago.</p><p>The driver, a three times winner of the Indianapolis 500, was removed from the car and taken to hospital where he has been examined and diagnosed as suffering from concussion, a fractured right ankle and a fractured vertebra. Franchitti will not require surgery, although he will be kept in hospital overnight.</p><p>With positions fixed at the moment of the accident, the race was won by Will Power, who had suffered a broken back in the crash at Las Vegas and admitted it was similar to that incident. \"I just saw Dario's car and him sitting in it with a lot of damage, and yes, that's what it reminded me of,\" Power said. \"I hate seeing that. We try to keep these cars on the ground.\"</p><p>Fellow driver Scott Dixon agreed. \"The smells and the visuals, for me, and even talking to Will, you have the remnants of Vegas popping into your head with you coming around the corner and you can't drive through it because there's a field of debris,\" he said.</p><p>IndyCar is likely to investigate the crash thoroughly since, in the wake of Wheldon's death, extensive efforts were made to reduce the chances of the cars leaving the track and hitting the catch fencing. Wheldon, a two-times Indianapolis 500 winner, had been testing safety features on the designs for the 2012 season before he was killed and when the new chassis was launched it was given the prefix DW in his honour.</p><p>The spectators were believed to have been injured by a piece of the catch fencing that was knocked loose into the nearby grandstand, rather than parts of the car itself.</p><p>A statement from the race promoters read: \"An IndyCar official and IndyCar driver, Dario Franchitti, along with two fans were transferred to an area hospital for evaluation. Eleven fans were additionally evaluated on site.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213562|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7a9d0d37bfb4e5dfd6d77e39fb80b0ddf53e0e1d -->",

        "body":"<p>Peyton Manning spent all afternoon putting the Broncos in the end zone during a wild shootout with Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>The last time he got the ball, though, Manning kept Denver out of the end zone and that was the best way to win the game.</p><p>The four-time MVP kept up his record pace for touchdown passes, Matt Prater kicked a 28-yard field goal as time expired after an interception by Romo spoiled the first 500-yard game in Dallas history, and the Broncos remained unbeaten with a 51-48 victory Sunday.</p><p>\"It was pretty amazing that it came down to the defense making a big play at the end,\" Denver coach John Fox said. \"Thank God our offense kept us in the game all day long.\"</p><p>In the waning seconds of one of the highest-scoring thrillers in NFL history, Manning ensured that his kicker not Romo had the last chance to score.</p><p>And with that, the Broncos ran their total to 230 points this season the most by an NFL team through the first five games.</p><p>The Broncos (5-0) had moved the ball to the Dallas 2 after Danny Trevathan's diving interception at the 24 in the final 2 minutes. Needing a first down but not a touchdown so they could run out the clock, Manning and Knowshon Moreno shouted at each other in the backfield just before the snap.</p><p>\"He basically was asking me, 'How am I supposed to do that? How can I get a half a yard but not get a yard and a half?'\" said Manning, who threw for 414 yards and four touchdowns to give him a record-setting 20 in the first five games. \"I just said, 'You can't! You can't score! You can't do it!'\"</p><p>Moreno managed to pull off the first down without scoring, and Manning took three snaps to drain the clock to 2 seconds for Prater, who also had a 50-yarder among his three field goals.</p><p>It was quite a debate over a measly yard in a game with 1,039 yards of total offense combined in the fourth-highest scoring game in NFL history and tied for the second-highest in regulation since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.</p><p>Romo was 25 of 36 for 506 yards and five touchdowns, breaking Don Meredith's club record of 460 yards. He is the fifth quarterback in NFL history to pass for at least 500 yards and five touchdowns in a game.</p><p>Manning, who threw for 414 yards and moved past Dan Marino for second on the career passing list with 61,371 yards, answered by leading a nine-play, 73-yard drive to Moreno's tying 1-yard score with 2:44 remaining.</p><p>Romo's interception came two plays later, when Trevathan dived in front of tight end Gavin Escobar.</p><p>The Cowboys (2-3) were on the verge of getting blown out early in the second half when they finally stopped Manning and forced a field goal. They later ended his streak of 227 passes without an interception when Morris Claiborne picked him off late in the third quarter.</p><p>In other games, Andrew Luck threw two touchdown passes and Donald Brown scored the go-ahead TD with 8:55 to go in the Colts 34-28 win over the Seahawks, and the New Orleans Saints remained unbeaten with a 26-18 victory at Chicago with Drew Brees throwing two touchdown passes to Pierre Thomas and Jimmy Graham equaling an NFL record with another 100-yard game.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Bengals beat the Patriots 13-6 with BenJarvus Green-Ellis running 1 yard in the fourth quarter for the game's only touchdown, the Chiefs had a 26-17 win over the Titans to maintain their best start to a season since 2003, the Ravens edged the Dolphins 26-23, the Packers had a 22-9 win over the Lions and Philadelphia kept the Giants winless with a 36-21 result at East Rutherford.</p><p>At Glendale, Arizona the Cardinals had a 22-6 win over the Panthers and, at St. Louis, the Rams beat the winless Jaguars 34-20 with Sam Bradford throwing three touchdown passes.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/nfl-clockwatch-week-five-live\">NFL Clockwatch: Week Five - as it happened</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211854|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7276eaedb2ee34e05246c1cfabfa52068a78b10c -->",

On a night where neither starter was effective, the Dodgers bats crushed the Braves bullpen and now Atlanta might have to turn to Freddy Garcia, on the the road, tomorrow night to keep their season alive just one more day. Plus, with Miguel Cabrera clearly limited by injuries, L.A. might have the best hitter in the playoffs with Hanley Ramirez and they still have the best starting pitcher in the league in their back pocket. So yeah, this could be a scary team this October.<br />That will wrap up tonight's coverage of the MLB playoffs, but we'll be back tomorrow as the Divisonal Series continue. Thanks to everyone who followed along with us tonight, especially those who contributed emails and tweets (sorry I couldn't fit them all in).

While the Atlanta Braves have been busy trying to enforce violations of unwritten rules. The Dodgers have taken on the personality of their two best hitters, controversial Cuban phenom Yasiel Puig and rejuvenated former Marlins infielder Hanley Ramirez. When the Dodgers celebrated clinching their playoff spot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/dodgers-diamondbacks-pool-texas-rangers-slide\">by sneaking into the Arizona Diamondbacks' pool</a> it was as if a season that started off like the &quot;Bad News Bears&quot; in a bad way, when the Dodgers had an atrocious beginning of the season that almost got manager Don Mattingly fired, entered into the zany winning montage portion of the movie.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Atlanta Braves have been acting like their duty is is to police the many, many unwritten rules around baseball, possibly ones that only exist in their heads. The absolute nadir of this tendency happened during a few weeks span late last month when Braves catcher Brian McCann helped incite two separate fights: first after getting upset at <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-jose-fernandez-hits-first-career-home-022103628--mlb.html\">Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez after he was a bit too excited for hitting his first career home run</a>, when <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-atlanta-carlos-gomez-homers-argues-braves-235815900--mlb.html\">he attempted to block the Milwaukee Brewers' Carlos Gomez from reaching home plate on a home run. </a>Some are starting to suspect that in his version of baseball, hitting home runs against his team is a violation of the unwritten rules of the MLB.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-divisional-series-previews\">So these two teams are designed to be perfect contrasts to one another,</a> so it's no big shock that the NLDS is coming to Dodgers Stadium tied up at 1-1 after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/05/pirates-braves-cardinals-angels-playoffs\"> dramatic game two on Friday</a>. Tonight it's a battle of rookie pitchers with similar regular season records as the Braves put 22 year old Julio Teheran (14-8, 3.20) on the mound against 26 year old South Korean import Hyun-Jin Ryu (14-8, 3.00). Okay, it's a bit of a cheat to call Ryu a rookie since he's been playing professional baseball for a while but, hey, Ichiro Suzuki won a Rookie of the Year when he arrived in the MLB.</p> <p>So today's the tiebreaker game, it should be good.

I wouldn’t worry too much for the Seahawks, who were playing on the road for the second time in as many weeks, and held their own for most of the game in Indy. It took a blocked field goal, returned for a touchdown, to spark the Colts to life, and they still only won by six. The Patriots, on the other hand, continued to struggle in the passing game even with Danny Amendola back – so much so, in fact, that Brady’s string of 52 consecutive games with a passing TD came to an end. They’ll have Rob Gronkowski back soon, which should be a huge help, but could the problems run deeper? Perhaps not – after all, this Bengals defense happens to be very good.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Something is not right with Eli Manning. Three interceptions for the day brings his total for the season to 12. It doesn’t help that the running game is failing so catastrophically, of course, but the Giants twice had a lead in this game and need to make better decisions. It’s not like the Eagles defense was playing all that well through the first four games, either.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Kansas City are 5-0. I feel like we say this every week but really, who saw this coming?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251cacde4b04e5d3aefa94c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:41:07.782+01:00\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy Football update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who were the stars of those early games?

The Eagles might only be 2-3, but in a miserable NFC East, that is enough for them to maintain hopes yet of a division title.

It was quite the shoot-out in the end between the two second-year quarterbacks, and if you leave aside that pick, there was not a lot to choose between them. Wilson finished with 15 completions from 31 attempts for 210 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. Luck had 16 completions on 29 attempts for 229 yards and 2 TDs with no picks. But Wilson also rushed for 102 yards on 13 carries.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c6bee4b04e5d3aefa948\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:23:36.155+01:00\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

The next play was effectively wiped out by offsetting penalties, but then Gabbert was intercepted in the end zone. In fairness, it was the right call. Three points did little for the Jaguars, whereas a touchdown might just have given them hope in this game. As it is, they continue to trail, 24-10.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251b129e4b0a0aedf83d92f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T19:51:26.008+01:00\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Injury update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Michael Vick wasn’t the only key starter to limp out of that Eagles-Giants game before the break.

Not good news for a Lions team that has not won at Lambeau Field since 1991.</p> <p>- <strong>Rob Gronkowski </strong>will not make his season debut for the Patriots against Cincinnati, having been kept on the inactive list for another week. But <strong>Danny Amendola</strong> will start - providing a major boost to a passing offense that has stuttered despite finding ways to get the job done over the last few weeks. </p> <p>- <strong>Cameron Wake</strong> is listed as active for Miami, meaning good things for the Dolphins' pass rush and bad things for Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco - who is without receivers <strong>Jacoby Jones</strong> and <strong>Marlon Brown</strong>, as well as the recently acquired offensive tackle <strong>Eugene Moore</strong> - all of whom have been ruled out. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518eafe4b0a0aedf83d91c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:26:29.932+01:00\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six predictions game</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A quick reminder to those of you taking part in our Pick Six competition to make sure you get your predictions in for this week's games. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/nfl-talkboard-week-five-russell-wilson-andrew-luck?CMP=twt_gu\">Post them in the comments section of the NFL Talkboard</a> - we will not count any picks made on this blog.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518c6be4b01e4020f8d8e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:16:26.732+01:00\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Perfection</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The 1972 Miami Dolphins won’t be losing any sleep just yet, but one month into the NFL season a good five teams are still yet to taste defeat. All of them are in action today. According to NFL Network’s GameDay Morning team, this is the first time since 1968 that so many 4-0 teams have been in action on the same afternoon.</p> <p>Four of them – the Saints, Patriots, Chiefs and Seahawks – will be kicking off within the next 45 minutes. And I’ll be here to keep you posted on how they, and everybody else, get on. Here’s the full list of today’s 1pm ET/6pm BST games:</p> <p><strong>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears</strong></p> <p><strong>New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p> <p><strong>Detroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers </strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans</strong></p> <p><strong>Seattle Seahawks @ Indianapolis Colts</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars @ St Louis Rams</strong></p> <p><strong>Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</strong></p> <p>So, will our perfect foursome emerge from their respective games unscathed? Who will come out on top in the duel between second-year quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson in Indianapolis? And exactly how many points will the Jacksonville Jaguars lose by this week?

        "headline":"Vogt and Ortiz star as A's and Red Sox take divisional playoff wins",
        "body":"<p>Stephen Vogt hit an RBI single in the ninth inning to lift the <strong>Oakland Athletics</strong> to a 1-0 win over the <strong>Detroit Tigers</strong> and level their American League division series at a game apiece. The <strong>Boston Red Sox</strong>, meanwhile, got two homers from David Ortiz to beat the <strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong> 7-4 and take a 2-0 lead in their AL division series.</p><p>The AL West division champion A's had eight walk-off wins during the regular season, then did it again at the perfect time in the playoffs. It was also Vogt's first career game-winning hit and came after Justin Verlander struck him out in the seventh for the third time in the game.</p><p>Yoenis Cespedes and Seth Smith hit back-to-back singles against loser Al Alburquerque to start the winning rally, then Josh Reddick was intentionally walked before Rick Porcello entered to face Vogt. He lined a clean single past drawn-in shortstop Jose Iglesias to win it. Sonny Gray hung tough with a masterful Verlander in a thrilling pitchers' duel between the rookie making his 11th career start and the 2011 AL Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner.</p><p>Gray struck out nine in eight scoreless innings, allowing four hits in a sensational playoff debut. Verlander, who beat the A's in Games 1 and 5 of last fall's AL division series, struck out 11 more batters to give him 33 strikeouts in his past three postseason outings against Oakland.</p><p>\"I knew there was going to be a lot of adrenaline and how I was able to harness that adrenaline was going to be a big factor in the game,\" Gray said. \"It was awesome because I was still able to locate my pitches without being too shaky.\"</p><p>Game three is Monday in Detroit. Right-hander Jarrod Parker will start for the A's against 14-game winner Anibal Sanchez.</p><p>In Boston, Ortiz had the first two-homer playoff game of his long career. He was a star for the 2004 Boston team that won the club's first world series title in 86 years and is the only player remaining from that team.</p><p>\"When he hits two home runs, things are going to revolve around him,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said. \"He's the main cog in our lineup.\"</p><p>Jacoby Ellsbury had three hits and scored three runs, and Dustin Pedroia drove in three runs for the Red Sox. Tampa Bay's David Price allowed seven runs on nine hits and two walks, striking out five. He took the mound for the eighth inning but was chased after Ortiz hit his second homer. John Lackey lasted just 5 1-3 innings for Boston, allowing four runs on seven hits and three walks. He struck out six to pick up the win.</p><p>Boston won 12-2 in the opener when every starter got a hit and scored a run. In game two, every Red Sox starter got a hit except Mike Napoli, who drew two walks. The Rays will need a victory in game three on Monday in St Petersburg to avoid a sweep in the best-of-five series.</p><p><strong>• MLB playoff liveblog at theguardian.com: Dodgers v Braves, Sunday</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179248|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2eaf3bceddf046059ca36c6ac50df7de731bd2f9 -->",

The Boston Red Sox came into this series with the reputation as the best team in the AL, that reputation remains intact. The good news is that if Tampa Bay can hand the ball back to David Price he's unlikely to lose against to Boston. The bad news is that it's going to take some doing just to reach that point.</p> <p>In any case, that will wrap things up for the night here. We'll be back tomorrow with more MLB playoffs coverage here at the Guardian. Thanks for sticking with us today, especially those of you who sent out emails and tweets.

To say the pressure is all on the Rays this afternoon is beyond an understatement. In yesterday's game one, Tampa made a lot of mistakes, i<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1aog5ywXFw\">ncluding an all-time blooper by rookie outfielder Wil Myers</a>, and Boston capitalized on almost every single one on route to a 12-2 blowout victory. Don't expect a similar crooked number this afternoon, as the Rays will give the ball to David Price (10-8, 3.33 ERA, regular season), one of the game's most dangerous starting pitchers in baseball, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/30/tampa-bay-rays-vs-texas-rangers-live\">who was basically single-handedly eliminating the Texas Rangers the last time we saw him.</a></p> <p>The Red Sox will counter with John Lackey (10-13, 3.52 ERA, ditto), the former Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ace who was, thanks to his hefty contract and ineffective pitching, has mostly been a symbol for all that's gone wrong for the Red Sox in the last few years. This season, however, Lackey has been the sharpest as he's been in since his All-Star days in California. He's been particularly difficult to hit at home at Fenway Park, a big reason why manager John Farrell has tapped him for game two over Clay Buchholz and Jake Peavy. The losing record doesn't do his year justice, as Lackey has been the victim of ridiculously poor run support, something unlikely to change today considering that whole &quot;David Price is really good at baseball&quot; thing.</p> <p>At the risk of repeating myself, well at the certainty of repeating myself really, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/04/mlb-playoffs-tampa-bay-rays-vs-boston-red-sox-live\">the preamble I wrote for yesterday's game still applies for this series:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Believe it or not, the Boston Red Sox haven't been to the postseason since 2009, although you're forgiven for thinking otherwise given the sheer amount of media attention they've received during the interim. In fact they haven't won a postseason game since Game 6 of the 2008 American League Championship Series against, that's right, these very same Tampa Bay Rays. Well, okay maybe it wasn't the exact same Tampa Bay Rays team, this was back when the team was a likable group of surprising underdogs (like the Pittsburgh Pirates this postseason). Since then, the Red Sox have gone through a lot of turmoil (the injury-plagued 2010 season, the disastrous September swoon in 2011, everything that Bobby Valentine did in 2012). Meanwhile, the Tampa Bay Rays have become a major player in the American League East by making inspired trades (swapping James Shields for the Kansas City Royals' uber-prospect Wil Myers being the latest example) and taking a page from <a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Suicide_Squad\">Amanda Waller and the Suicide Squad</a> by picking up, <a href=\"http://www.twinkietown.com/2013/8/23/4648060/rays-sign-delmon-young-look-to-field-first-all-rat-bastard-starting\">um, less than desirable personalities around the game </a>(<a href=\"http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2011/04/23/orioles-luke-scott-throws-banana-chips-at-dominican-teammate-to-remind-him-to-not-be-a-savage/\">banana chip tossing birther Luke Scott</a>, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/yunel-escobar-apologizes-gay-slur-eye-black-says-203605396--mlb.html\">homophobic clubhouse problem Yunel Escobar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/delmon-young-pleads-guilty-violation-anti-semitic-bashing-article-1.1378013\">lovable anti-Semitic slur fan Delmon Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mrdestructo.com/2011/11/five-stupid-arguments-about-josh-lueke.html\">thankfully-off-the-playoff roster Josh Lueke</a>).</p> <p>Bizarrely enough, this year the Red Sox have been the underdog team in this matchup. After surviving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/04/boston-red-sox-bobby-valentine-fired\">the reign of Bobby Valentine</a> and a reset-button hitting trade that sent an entire offseason's worth of high-priced acquisitions to the Los Angeles Dodgers (where they're doing just fine it seems), new manager (and former Sox pitching coach) John Farrell guided the team, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/22/boston-red-sox-al-east-playoffs\">who ended up dead last in the AL East standings last season, to the best record in the AL, providing them with home field advantage for the rest of the playoffs</a>. While a lot of credit has been given to Farrell, and the improved locker room chemistry thanks to Farrell and free agents like Jonny Gomes and Shane Victorino, the Red Sox revival has primarily happened because their pitching has gotten better in the last few years. Funny how that always seems to happen to teams that &quot;have good locker room chemistry&quot;. Chief example? This afternoon's starter Jon Lester, who has returned to form as one of the game's best left-handed pitchers after a few years where he struggled. His improvement (along with that of 2011 goat John Lackey) is a huge reason why Boston is back in the playoffs (or, I guess, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/sports/baseball/bonding-with-beards-the-red-sox-repair-their-clubhouse-chemistry.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">you can credit it all to beards if you're absolutely psychotic and/or part of the national media</a>).</p> <p>The Red Sox have had the luxury of waiting around since Sunday while the Tampa Bay Rays have had to fight for their playoff lives. They had to survive a play-in game on Monday just to make it to the Wild Card game against the Cleveland Indians. You'll never believe this but the key to the Rays' survival has been, gasp, superior starting pitching. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/30/tampa-bay-rays-vs-texas-rangers-live\">David Price threw a complete game against the Texas Rangers</a>, getting the annual Rangers disappointing exit out of the way early this season and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/mlb-playoffs-tampa-bay-rays-vs-cleveland-indians-live\">Alex Cobb and the bullpen stymied the Cleveland Indians</a>, dashing dreams that former Red Sox manager and current Indians manager Terry Francona (whose completely fake Twitter clone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NotCoachTito\">NotCoachTito</a> will join me here for this liveblog) would face off against his former team. Instead, Rays manager Joe Maddon will send Matt Moore, not a bad third starter to have, to the mound for Game 1 of the ALDS.</p> <p>It should be a good series, at least I hope so after<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-pittsburgh-pirates-vs-st-louis-cardinals-live\"> yesterday's playoff game duds</a>. The Rays and the Sox are evenly matched despite the gap in the standings, it feels like every game they played during the regular season had either a ninth inning comeback/rally or spilled into extra innings. The Rays have had the disadvantage of playing two elimination games this week just to punch their ticket to Fenway Park this afternoon, but the Red Sox have had such a long layoff that they've had to play split-squad games during the week in an attempt to avoid any Game 1 rustiness.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think that's enough from me at this very moment, we want to hear from you! If you have something to say about today's game, the other playoff matches or really anything related to the MLB, shoot out an email <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com</a> or tweet <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>. and we'll use them here throughout the afternoon. It's <a href=\"http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/preview?gameId=331005102\">the Tampa Bay Rays vs the Boston Red Sox</a> at Fenway Park for ALDS Game Two. First pitch is scheduled at 5:37pm EST/10:37pm BST, but we'll be back a bit before that, which makes this the perfect time to catch up on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-divisional-series-previews\">David Lengel's MLB Playoffs Preview</a>.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-05T21:48:00.151+01:00\">at 4.48pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419135817|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|efb7fb79373e1917c6cd6f43029f548e463fb597 -->",

        "headline":"How an NFL money-spinner could turn into a white elephant",
        "body":"<p>A few years ago, I went to a New York Yankees baseball game with the author and pop-culture guru Malcolm Gladwell. It was a hot ticket&nbsp;– a grudge match against the Boston Red Sox – but we arrived late, left before the end and spent most of the evening eating snacks. This, Gladwell explained, was how most Americans watched the sport.</p><p>\"Baseball's a great idea, a great story, but it's pretty terrible to watch it live,\" he said, as we sat on the bleachers behind third base. \"Frankly, I prefer to read about it, the way the game is played in my imagination.\" Warming to the subject, he digressed on to other sports: \"Take NFL, I would say that is A-plus televised, B-minus live. Basketball is B-plus televised, A live. Ice hockey: C-minus televised, A-plus live. And golf, that's A televised, but something like D live.\"</p><p>I was reminded of this sliding scale when I attended my first NFL game, at Wembley last October. The match was between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/28/st-louis-rams-new-england-patriots-london-live\" title=\"\">St Louis Rams and New England Patriots</a> and it was a washout both figuratively and literally: the underdog Rams scored in the opening exchanges but were then pounded by 45 unanswered points. The rain was relentless, dampening everyone's spirits except the irrepressible cheerleaders, who may have required treatment for hypothermia at the game's end. There were 84,005 spectators, but it's always a dire sign when the organisers have to instruct an audience to \"make some noise\". (Tip: sports crowds, typically, are pretty experienced at making that judgment for themselves.)</p><p>Of course, this was just one game – though, curiously, it does always seem to bucket down when the NFL comes to London, which is either pathetic fallacy or just proof that it tends to rain quite a lot in England at this time of year. But the experience did make me think about what I <em>do</em> like about American football, a sport that I have followed with growing and personally unfathomable interest for the past four or so years.</p><p>The weekend for British NFL fans starts on Sunday late afternoon, just as Super Sunday football winds down on Sky Sports. You switch channels, hunker a little deeper in the sofa and you are greeted by two old, dear friends Kev and Neil – Cadle and Reynolds, respectively, if you want to be formal. Ideally the lantern-jawed, power-dressing ex-quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt will be sandwiched between them, but really there's no chaff in a rotating lineup of guest summarisers. You can almost smell the coffee on their breath as they prepare for eight hours of witching-hour live broadcasting.</p><p>Not only is it the perfect, brain-neutral wind-down to the weekend, but there is immediately an exoticism that our own homegrown sports struggle to match. From Sky HQ in Isleworth, Hounslow borders, we zip across the pond to Baltimore, Pittsburgh or Green Bay. These are not America's loveliest cities, I'm informed, but the pictures always make them seem so vibrant and glamorous. Even romantic, especially when it's snowing. (Second tip: for the fastest way to work out how cold it is, check where the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, has sawn off the sleeves of his sweatshirt this week.)</p><p>This was an issue for me when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/minnesota-vikings-pittsburgh-steelers-nfl\" title=\"\">NFL came to Wembley</a>: the players were here, the cheerleaders were present; my match even had Belichick and his legendary sweatshirt, though he may have swapped it for a rain jacket. But I didn't want American football in London; I wanted it in America.</p><p>The NFL, naturally, doesn't especially care what I want. Its aim – set out by the commissioner Roger Goodell – is to turn a business that currently generates $10bn into one that brings in $25bn by 2027. The market is pretty well saturated in the States, which means that at least some of the new sources of income will have to come from overseas.</p><p>America has a very efficient strike rate at exporting the things it likes to the rest of the world. We eat its fast food, guzzle its soft drinks, listen to its music, watch its films and series-link its TV shows. And yet, overwhelmingly, we can take or leave its sports. The NFL made its first excursion to Japan in 1976 and has taken 13 trips there since, but has never been fully adopted. It has also played pre- and regular-season games in Mexico City, Sydney and Gothenburg.</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/28/london-nfl-franchise-minnesota-pittsburgh\" title=\"\">it is Britain that is felt to have the greatest commercial promise</a>. The NFL estimates there are two million \"avid\" supporters over here and it seems hell-bent on making London its first overseas franchise. Perhaps Jacksonville Jaguars will make the jump: the Florida-based team – currently winless and on course to record a historically awful season – play the San Francisco 49ers at Wembley on 27 October and will return to London for each of the next three seasons.</p><p></p><p>There are lots of reasons why this might not happen. It would be expensive, logistically complicated and potentially unpopular with players and fans in the States. Not to mention incongruous – isn't it a bit odd to have an NFL franchise in London and not in Los Angeles? Over here, I would worry that the new team could become one of sport's biggest white elephants.</p><p>It is one thing to sell 80,000 tickets once or twice a year, but how many people would, like me, go for the novelty and then never return? After all, with seats costing between £35 and £160, that's a lot of money to drop on a sport that is B-minus live and A-plus at home on television.</p><p></p><p><em>Tim Lewis's book on the Rwandan cycling team, Land of Second Chances, is out now</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096000|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2b5d827a7f7d88cc7fb6957b21120041423f0279 -->",

        "body":"<p>President Barack Obama has weighed into the controversy surrounding the name of Washington's NFL football team. The name has faced a new barrage of criticism for being offensive to Native Americans.</p><p>Speaking to the Associated Press in an interview published on Saturday morning, Obama said: \"If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, that was offending a sizable group of people, I'd think about changing it.\"</p><p>A number of media organisations have recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/sep/09/washington-redskins-us-press-publishing\">stopped using the \"Redskins\" name</a>, in recognition of opposition to its use among Native American groups which has recently been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/13/washington-redskins-protest-green-bay-packers-oneida-indian-nation\">expressed at demonstrations</a> at NFL games and elsewhere.</p><p>Washington's owner, Daniel Snyder, has said repeatedly that he will not change the team's name. In May, he told USA Today: \"We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER – you can use caps.\"</p><p>Last month Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, said: \"If one person's offended, we have to listen. And ultimately, it is Dan [Snyder]'s decision. But it is something that I want all of us to go out and make sure we're listening to our fans, listening to people who have a different view, and making sure that we continue to do what's right.\"</p><p>Obama has addressed controversial issues within football before. In January, discussing the effects of head injuries sustained in the sport, he said that though he was a fan he was not sure that <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8886528/president-barack-obama-not-sure-allow-son-play-football\">if he had a son, he would allow him to play</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419140918|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3f01ea9e1b2a0b5f4bc8d1ab8c3561a329b2ff77 -->",

        "body":"<p>Gerrit Cole gave up two hits in six dominant innings and had an RBI in his playoff debut as the <strong>Pittsburgh Pirates</strong> beat the <strong>St Louis Cardinals</strong> 7-1 Friday to even their National League division series at a game apiece.</p><p>The <strong>Atlanta Braves</strong> also evened their NL division series at a game apiece after beating the <strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong> at home 4-3.</p><p>In the American League, the <strong>Boston Red Sox</strong> took advantage of poor <strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong> defense in a five-run fourth to beat the Rays 12-2 in Game 1 of their division series and the <strong>Detroit Tigers</strong> held on to beat the <strong>Oakland Athletics</strong> 3-2 in their series-opening game.</p><p>The Pirates showed poise in their first playoff win since 1992 and St Louis looking tentative in the field a role reversal from the Cardinals' 9-1 win in the opener against Pittsburgh. Cardinals starter Lance Lynn, who hasn't lasted long enough to qualify for the victory in any of his three career playoff starts, yielded five runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings.</p><p>Cole, meanwhile, struck out five batters and walked one. After allowing Carlos Beltran's double with one out in the first, he retired 11 straight before Yadier Molina led off the fifth with his third career postseason homer.</p><p>\"I just trusted myself and tried to keep it as simple as I could,\" he said. \"You just try and clear you mind after every pitch and just look forward.\"</p><p>Pedro Alvarez homered for the second straight game for the Pirates, who host Game three on Sunday.</p><p>In Atlanta, Mike Minor pitched six strong innings, Jason Heyward had a two-run single and the Braves pulled off some nifty plays in the field to hold off the Dodgers. In a postseason already marked by numerous defensive miscues, including some shaky plays by the Braves in Game one, Atlanta's defense came through by turning three double plays none more crucial than the one Luis Avilan started in the seventh to escape the inning with a 2-1 lead intact.</p><p>Hanley Ramirez drove in all three runs for the Dodgers, including a two-run homer in the eighth. Not taking any chances, the Braves went to closer Craig Kimbrel for a rare four-out save. He ended the eighth by retiring Juan Uribe on a groundout, then pitched around two walks in the ninth. The best-of-five series shifts to Los Angeles on Sunday.</p><p>Jon Lester gave up a pair of solo homers to Tampa Bay, but Boston got the lead back when the Rays fell apart in the fourth. One ball fell between two outfielders, one batter reached safely on a dropped third strike and another reached when pitcher Matt Moore was slow to cover first.</p><p>By the time it was over, the Red Sox were ahead 5-2 and on their way to the early lead in their AL division series. The Red Sox added three more runs to chase Moore in the fifth inning, when they sent nine batters to the plate the first time in franchise history they have batted around in consecutive innings in a postseason game.</p><p>In all, Moore was charged with eight runs seven earned on eight hits, two walks a hit batter and a wild pitch, striking out four in four 1-3 innings. Every Boston starter got a hit and scored a run, the first time a team had done that in the Major League Baseball postseason since Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and the Yankees in the 1936 World Series.</p><p>In Oakland, California, Max Scherzer struck out 11 over seven dominant innings to help give Detroit a 1-0 lead in their AL division series rematch. Scherzer retired 16 of his first 18 batters and was nearly untouchable before Yoenis Cespedes hit a two-run drive in the seventh for his first career playoff home run. The strikeouts were his most in seven postseason starts.</p><p>Major League Baseball's lone 20-game winner, Scherzer (21-3) allowed three hits and walked two. Miguel Cabrera and Alex Avila each hit first-inning RBI singles against 40-year-old MLB All-Star Bartolo Colon, whose winless streak against the Tigers extended to 10½ years.</p><p><strong>• MLB playoff liveblogs at theguardian.com: Red Sox v Rays, Saturday; Dodgers v Braves, Sunday</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419134400|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e95c02e79479ac2d4bbdf8cc770e6184c2277dfa -->",

The main part of this blog is now over, but we will continue to post the final scores from the later games as the day goes on. For now I can tell you that the latest from the two games in action is:</p> <p><strong>Denver Broncos 0-7 Dallas Cowboys</strong></p> <p><strong>Carolina Panthers 3-0 Arizona Cardinals.</strong></p> <p>Don’t forget to check back in again on Tuesday for our Five Things We Learned look back over all the weekend’s action. In the meantime the comments section of this blog will remain open for you to discuss the games as they unfold.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251cd44e4b04e5d3aefa94d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:51:35.368+01:00\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Quick takes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A few immediate thoughts on those early games:</p> <p>&nbsp;- We started the day with five unbeaten teams, and already we are down to three – pending the result of the Denver Broncos’ game against Dallas. I wouldn’t worry too much for the Seahawks, who were playing on the road for the second time in as many weeks, and held their own for most of the game in Indy. It took a blocked field goal, returned for a touchdown, to spark the Colts to life, and they still only won by six. The Patriots, on the other hand, continued to struggle in the passing game even with Danny Amendola back – so much so, in fact, that Brady’s string of 52 consecutive games with a passing TD came to an end. They’ll have Rob Gronkowski back soon, which should be a huge help, but could the problems run deeper? Perhaps not – after all, this Bengals defense happens to be very good.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Something is not right with Eli Manning. Three interceptions for the day brings his total for the season to 12. It doesn’t help that the running game is failing so catastrophically, of course, but the Giants twice had a lead in this game and need to make better decisions. It’s not like the Eagles defense was playing all that well through the first four games, either.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Kansas City are 5-0. I feel like we say this every week but really, who saw this coming?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251cacde4b04e5d3aefa94c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:41:07.782+01:00\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy Football update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who were the stars of those early games? Here are a few of the stand-out performances:</p> <p>&nbsp;- Alishon Jeffery: 10 receptions for 218 yards, 1 TD</p> <p>- TY Hilton: 5 receptions for 140 yards, 2 TDs</p> <p>- Russell Wilson: 15/31 passes completed for 210 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT; 13 carries for 102 yards.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c9d0e4b0a0aedf83d94a\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:37:01.238+01:00\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Around the league: final scores</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OK, all the 1pm ET kickoffs are now finished. Here’s a full round-up of the scores:</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Saints 26-18 Bears</strong></p> <p><strong>Patriots 6-13 Bengals</strong></p> <p><strong>Lions 9-22 Packers</strong></p> <p><strong>Seahawks 28-34 Colts</strong></p> <p><strong>Ravens 26-23 Dolphins</strong></p> <p><strong>Eagles 36-21 Giants</strong></p> <p><strong>Jaguars 20-34 Rams</strong></p> <p><strong>Chiefs 26-17 Titans</strong></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:41:25.887+01:00\">at 4.41pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c90de4b0a0aedf83d949\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:33:26.319+01:00\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Eagles 36-21 Giants</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Nick Foles kneels to close out an important division win for Philadelphia. The Eagles might only be 2-3, but in a miserable NFC East, that is enough for them to maintain hopes yet of a division title. The Giants, at 0-5, look done.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c87ee4b04e5d3aefa94b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:30:59.354+01:00\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Chiefs 26-17 Titans</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Seahawks’ perfect start might be over, but the Chiefs stay undefeated with a hard-earned win in Tennessee. They had fallen behind early in the fourth quarter, but responded with 13 unanswered points to close out the game. Not only are Andy Reid’s team good, they appear to be pretty resilient, too.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c7dbe4b04e5d3aefa94a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:28:21.731+01:00\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Seattle Seahawks 28-34 Indianapolis Colts</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And it’s all over in Indianapolis, where Russell Wilson is intercepted by Darius Butler on fourth-and-15 at the Seattle 37, before the Andrew Luck kneels to close out the game. It was quite the shoot-out in the end between the two second-year quarterbacks, and if you leave aside that pick, there was not a lot to choose between them. Wilson finished with 15 completions from 31 attempts for 210 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. Luck had 16 completions on 29 attempts for 229 yards and 2 TDs with no picks.

Not good news for a Lions team that has not won at Lambeau Field since 1991.</p> <p>- <strong>Rob Gronkowski </strong>will not make his season debut for the Patriots against Cincinnati, having been kept on the inactive list for another week. But <strong>Danny Amendola</strong> will start - providing a major boost to a passing offense that has stuttered despite finding ways to get the job done over the last few weeks. </p> <p>- <strong>Cameron Wake</strong> is listed as active for Miami, meaning good things for the Dolphins' pass rush and bad things for Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco - who is without receivers <strong>Jacoby Jones</strong> and <strong>Marlon Brown</strong>, as well as the recently acquired offensive tackle <strong>Eugene Moore</strong> - all of whom have been ruled out. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518eafe4b0a0aedf83d91c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:26:29.932+01:00\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six predictions game</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A quick reminder to those of you taking part in our Pick Six competition to make sure you get your predictions in for this week's games. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/nfl-talkboard-week-five-russell-wilson-andrew-luck?CMP=twt_gu\">Post them in the comments section of the NFL Talkboard</a> - we will not count any picks made on this blog.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518c6be4b01e4020f8d8e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:16:26.732+01:00\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Perfection</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The 1972 Miami Dolphins won’t be losing any sleep just yet, but one month into the NFL season a good five teams are still yet to taste defeat. All of them are in action today. According to NFL Network’s GameDay Morning team, this is the first time since 1968 that so many 4-0 teams have been in action on the same afternoon.</p> <p>Four of them – the Saints, Patriots, Chiefs and Seahawks – will be kicking off within the next 45 minutes. And I’ll be here to keep you posted on how they, and everybody else, get on. Here’s the full list of today’s 1pm ET/6pm BST games:</p> <p><strong>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears</strong></p> <p><strong>New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p> <p><strong>Detroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers </strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans</strong></p> <p><strong>Seattle Seahawks @ Indianapolis Colts</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars @ St Louis Rams</strong></p> <p><strong>Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</strong></p> <p>So, will our perfect foursome emerge from their respective games unscathed? Who will come out on top in the duel between second-year quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson in Indianapolis? And exactly how many points will the Jacksonville Jaguars lose by this week?

It started out tense and ended as a laugher. On a night where neither starter was effective, the Dodgers bats crushed the Braves bullpen and now Atlanta might have to turn to Freddy Garcia, on the the road, tomorrow night to keep their season alive just one more day. Plus, with Miguel Cabrera clearly limited by injuries, L.A. might have the best hitter in the playoffs with Hanley Ramirez and they still have the best starting pitcher in the league in their back pocket. So yeah, this could be a scary team this October.<br />That will wrap up tonight's coverage of the MLB playoffs, but we'll be back tomorrow as the Divisonal Series continue. Thanks to everyone who followed along with us tonight, especially those who contributed emails and tweets (sorry I couldn't fit them all in).

So, yeah, the Pirates have a 2-1 series lead in the Playoffs. No I don't understand anything anymore either.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251e87fe4b04e5d3aefa950\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T00:00:58.476+01:00\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The National League Divisional Series between the Atlanta Braves and the Los Angeles Dodgers is basically an '80s slobs vs. snobs movie where the rich kids are the slobs. While the Atlanta Braves have been busy trying to enforce violations of unwritten rules. The Dodgers have taken on the personality of their two best hitters, controversial Cuban phenom Yasiel Puig and rejuvenated former Marlins infielder Hanley Ramirez. When the Dodgers celebrated clinching their playoff spot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/dodgers-diamondbacks-pool-texas-rangers-slide\">by sneaking into the Arizona Diamondbacks' pool</a> it was as if a season that started off like the &quot;Bad News Bears&quot; in a bad way, when the Dodgers had an atrocious beginning of the season that almost got manager Don Mattingly fired, entered into the zany winning montage portion of the movie.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Atlanta Braves have been acting like their duty is is to police the many, many unwritten rules around baseball, possibly ones that only exist in their heads. The absolute nadir of this tendency happened during a few weeks span late last month when Braves catcher Brian McCann helped incite two separate fights: first after getting upset at <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-jose-fernandez-hits-first-career-home-022103628--mlb.html\">Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez after he was a bit too excited for hitting his first career home run</a>, when <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-atlanta-carlos-gomez-homers-argues-braves-235815900--mlb.html\">he attempted to block the Milwaukee Brewers' Carlos Gomez from reaching home plate on a home run. </a>Some are starting to suspect that in his version of baseball, hitting home runs against his team is a violation of the unwritten rules of the MLB.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-divisional-series-previews\">So these two teams are designed to be perfect contrasts to one another,</a> so it's no big shock that the NLDS is coming to Dodgers Stadium tied up at 1-1 after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/05/pirates-braves-cardinals-angels-playoffs\"> dramatic game two on Friday</a>. Tonight it's a battle of rookie pitchers with similar regular season records as the Braves put 22 year old Julio Teheran (14-8, 3.20) on the mound against 26 year old South Korean import Hyun-Jin Ryu (14-8, 3.00). Okay, it's a bit of a cheat to call Ryu a rookie since he's been playing professional baseball for a while but, hey, Ichiro Suzuki won a Rookie of the Year when he arrived in the MLB.</p> <p>So today's the tiebreaker game, it should be good.

        "headline":"Alex Rodriguez sues MLB claiming he is victim of 'witch hunt'",
        "body":"<p>Alex Rodriguez – locked in a secret hearing with Major League Baseball over his 211-game suspension over a doping scandal – is taking his fight to the courts.</p><p>Rodriguez launched a legal action on Thursday accusing MLB of buying the cooperation of Anthony Bosch, the head of the Biogenesis anti-aging clinic at the heart of the PEDs scandal, as part of a \"witch hunt\" to force him out of the game, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/sports/baseball/rodriguez-sues-mlb-claiming-a-witch-hunt.html?_r=0\">the New York Times reported</a>.</p><p>A-Rod, as the New York Yankees star is known, has been in a behind-closed-doors arbitration hearing at MLB HQ all week fighting his suspension - by far the biggest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/05/alex-rodriguez-suspended-mlb-peds-drugs\">a series of bans handed out to a dozen players in August.</a></p><p>Now Rodriguez has decided to sue MLB, possibly indicating that the arbitration hearing may not reduce the length of the player's suspension, which threatens to end his career. Other players implicated in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/02/biogenesis-peds-scandal-explained\">the Biogenesis scandal</a> were suspended for less than 100 games, and mostly for 50 games.</p><p>The lawsuit, lodged at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims: \"MLB commissioner Allan H \"Bud\" Selig and other officials have - throughout at least all of 2013 - been engaged in tortiuous and egregious conduct with one, and only one, goal: to improperly marshall evidence that they hope to use to destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez, one of the most accomplished Major League Baseball players of all time.\"</p><p>Rodriguez's lawyers claim an investigator paid $150,000 in cash for records related to Rodriguez, which were allegedly stolen. Some of the cash was handed over in a bag in a Florida restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/04/sports/baseball/05rodriguez-document.html?ref=baseball\">the lawsuit says</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit does not address whether Rodriguez used banned substances. MLB did not comment. The hearing and lawsuit come at a particularly inopportune time for baseball, threatening to overshadow the playoffs which also started this week.</p><p>Rodriguez said in a statement: \"The entire legal dynamic is very complex, and my legal team is doing what they need to in order to vindicate me and pursue all of my rights. This matter is entirely separate from the ongoing arbitration.  I look forward to the arbitration proceedings continuing, and for the day to come when I can share my story with the public and my supporters.\"</p><p>Rodriguez was sidelined with injuries for most of the season and, ironically, made his season debut on the day his drugs ban was handed down - against which he immediately appealed. Throughout the season Rodriguez has been involved in battles with both MLB and his team. Rodriguez is in the final years of a $275 million contract with the Yankees. The club and the league have both repeatedly denied allegations that they are aiming to end the slugger's career.</p><p>Rodriguez's lawyers claim that MLB paid Bosch, the head of the now-closed Biogenesis clinic, a total of $5 million in monthly installments \"to buy his cooperation\". The lawyers said that baseball also promised to provide security for Bosch, cover his legal bills and indemnify him from civil liability over the case.</p><p>Commissioner Bud Selig was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but the Yankees, who still owe Rodriguez $86 million, are not named.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/02/biogenesis-peds-scandal-explained\">The Biogenesis Scandal explained</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419094427|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9b58490357ea9336ab7779f0023e754376bca9f9 -->",

        "headline":"NHL: 10 things to watch out for in the 2013-14 season",
        "body":"<h2>The divisions</h2><p>Let's start with the most obvious change. At a glance, the 2013-14 NHL looks a bit different now. The league has now been divided into four big divisions – two in each conference. They break down like this: </p><p><strong>The West</strong></p><p><strong>The Pacific Division:</strong> Anaheim Ducks; LA Kings; San Jose Sharks; Vancouver Canucks, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers; Phoenix Coyotes</p><p><strong>Central Division:</strong> Minnesota Wild; Colorado Avalanche; Dallas Stars; Chicago Blackhawks; Nashville Predators; St Louis Blues; Winnipeg Jets</p><p><strong>The East</strong></p><p><strong>Atlantic Division:</strong> Toronto Maple Leafs; Ottawa Senators; Montreal Canadiens; Boston Bruins; Buffalo Sabres; Detroit Red Wings; Florida Panthers; Tampa Bay Lightning</p><p><strong>Metropolitan Division:</strong> New York Islanders; New York Rangers; New Jersey Devils, Washington Capitals; Philadelphia Flyers; Pittsburgh Penguins, Carolina Hurricanes; Columbus Blue Jackets</p><p>What can we expect from each of these? Apart from my own expectation for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100142/\">post-graduate existentialism in the Metropolitan division</a>, the big takeaway is that the league is encouraging rivalries – either by rekindling old ones (Detroit-Toronto, for example) or arranging things for some new ones to form (perhaps most markedly in the Central division). It also means that every team will make a stop at every other at least once this year, thus marking the end of the tradition held since 1997 that meant fans in, say, Ontario, would rarely see a team like Calgary come visit (just to pick a random, non-personal example).</p><h2>The playoffs</h2><p>The changes to the conferences and divisons also means the road to the playoffs is new, too. <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=660138&amp;navid=nhl:topheads\">Here's how it was explained at NHL.com – as concise as I've seen it put</a>.</p><p>As everyone noticed immediately after the league announced the changes to the divisions, the Eastern teams each have eight teams, while those in the west each only have seven. That means inter-divisional and inter-conference schedules will break down differently, depending on if a team is in the east or west. NHL.com has a more detailed explanation of exactly how many games each team will play against the others in their division and conference, but put simply, what it means is that teams in the east will each play one more game against their own division and three more games within their own conference than those in the west will. But it also means the eastern teams will play four fewer games against western teams than western teams play eastern ones (confusing, I know). </p><h2>The hits</h2><p>Ah, the hits. The pre-season is always a difficult thing on which to draw too many huge conclusions on the year to come – particularly when players are looking to make a mark in some (perhaps violent) way – but even before the official start to the 2013-14 campaign, borderline hits are a prominent storyline. </p><p>Like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/N4F9ns4JXl4\">this one</a>, for instance. No call for the hit, but Coyotes/Twitter forward <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/coyotes-paul-bissonnette-suspended-10-games-1.1856115\">Paul Bissonnette was given a game misconduct for jumping the boards afterward as he quite literally leapt to his teammate's defence</a>. With that came an automatic 10-game suspension, which he has now appealed. Coincidentally, if the ban holds, Bissonnette would return to the ice against the Kings. Anyway, Klesla was carried off the ice in a stretcher (but conscious).</p><p>Down in Florida a few days later, it was a similar story. In his first game, Tampa Bay's Adam Erne clipped Vladimir Sobotka of the St Louis Blues in the head as he skated up-ice. Here's the Shanaview on that one:</p><p><em></em><br />The same day, <a href=\"http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/embed?playlist=445664\">Detroit's Teemu Pulkkinen managed a fairly flagrant boarding on Chicago's Mike Kostka, flattening him against the end boards</a>. The refs handed Pulkkinen a five-minute major and a game misconduct. The NHL decided to go a bit further later on, tacking on another four games to his suspension.</p><p>Extrapolating anything about how the 2013-14 season from these pre-season instances would probably be rather careless, but nevertheless, we're not off to a great start. Speaking of which ...</p><h2>The fights</h2><p>Oh guys. Already with all the fighting. Here's how bad things are: We're not even at the first game of the season and <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/no-nhl-preseason-fighting-trending-topics-144903216--nhl.html\">someone is already writing a think piece with reference to the moral struggles in Blood Meridian in order to explain how bad things are</a>. And that was before the Maple Leafs and Sabres beat each other silly for … seemingly no reason at all. We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>The usual excuse you hear after a pre-season fight is that the players involved were only looking to bolster their standing/importance within the team and get the attention of the coaching and management staff. That was certainly the excuse dredged up when the Flames and Senators met in mid-September, there were four fights, one of which featured MATT STAJAN, who had this to say afterward: \"Obviously everybody is trying to make a name for themselves and trying to get a job in the best league in the world,\" which is logical, though also amounts to fairly damning praise of the NHL as a whole. But <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/09/17/calgary-flames-vs-ottawa-senators-pre-season-game-features-four-fights-as-players-try-to-make-a-name-for-themselves/\">as Stajan reportedly explained it</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>That's hockey.</p></blockquote><p>Most fans accept that explanation. In fact, in a weird way, when you put it like Stajan did, fighting in the pre-season makes way more sense than it does during the regular season. It's arguably more appropriate to punch another person in the face when there's potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars, a permanent job, health insurance, and a bit of fame on the line.</p><p>And perhaps that's what was going on in Toronto, but one suspects it was not, certainly because at least three of the men involved in the brouhaha when the teams met the last week of September have signed long-term deals and, conceivably, if we accept Stajan's logic, have less immediate things to fight about. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/frrFsXdhKZ8\">Here's what happened</a>, in case you missed it:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Yep, that's Phil Kessel slashing away at John Scott and then making with the punchy-punchy. And yes, that's David Clarkson jumping the boards to join the fray for some inexplicably dumb reason. And yeah, that's Jonathan Bernier getting into it with Ryan Miller. Kessel is a $5.5m man, an unrestricted free agent next year, and the man Leafs fans are forever hopeful will be that superstar they've been waiting for. Bernier is worth $2.9m a year on paper, but arguably a lot more than that to the Leafs in non-dollar terms. And Clarkson? He just signed for $5.25m a year through, theoretically, 2020. The Leafs will now tack on another $75,000 to his price tag to make up for the hole he will leave during the 10 regular season games for which he's now been suspended. And for what? So John Scott could prove his worth to the Sabres? Consider it done.</p><p>And this is the pre-season. Get it together, everyone. </p><p>Or don't, and we'll simply have to come up with new ways to have this same conversation for the next eight months.</p><h2>The fashion</h2><p>So far, we know of at least eight teams in the NHL that plan on featuring either a completely new uniform or at least a new third jersey this year, because a year in hockey wouldn't be complete without it. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/pass-fail-detroit-red-wings-toronto-maple-leafs-152354340--nhl.html\">The Maple Leafs and Red Wings will, of course, get their Winter Classic uniforms</a>, both respectable. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2013/8/20/4640202/san-jose-sharks-new-jersey\">The San Jose Sharks are removing a black stripe from their uniforms</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=672909\">the Carolina Hurricanes are making a few tweaks</a>, too. And both the Florida Panthers and Anaheim Ducks are planning to showcase throwback jerseys this year, as they've both been in the league for 20 years (!). The Flames are also apparently going to unveil a new third jersey, which hasn't been seen yet, but presumably can't possibly be any worse than <a href=\"http://pics.classicauctions.net/classicauctions/auctions/62/597/source_597_77874.jpg\">their last one</a>. </p><p>If the Flames don't completely mess things up, all of the above options will be, while mostly unnecessary, at least not a complete insult to the fans. People will no doubt still want to wear all the new jerseys we've just talked about. Well done, everyone in the above paragraph.</p><p>Which brings us to Dallas and Buffalo. The Sabres, no strangers to new uniforms (by my count, they will have now introduced eight different uniforms since 1996) are only changing their third jersey this time around. But it's completely hideous. Steve Ott \"scooped\" the team this summer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/otterN9NE/statuses/375290351465951232\">releasing a shot of the new jersey on Twitter</a>. Here it is:</p><p><em></em></p><p>My favourite part of it is that he tagged it #MiseryIsOver. No no, my friend. It has just begun.</p><p>The piece de resistance this year, though, has to go to the Dallas Stars, who are now going to dress in a shade of emerald that would leave them well camouflaged on a golf green, and sporting a stylized \"D\" that's been smashed awkwardly into the more classic five-pointed star. That the logo now sort of looks like someone shot a bullet through the old one may or may not be intentional, but either way it's a disaster. But perhaps that's no serious surprise. Stars VP of production and entertainment, <a href=\"http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=672977&amp;navid=DL|DAL|home\">Jason Walsh explained the logo this way</a>: \"This is who we are. It's a D and a star. We're the Dallas Stars, in Big D.\" Keep in mind, this was the explanation of the finished product, and not the first, totally base, sentence on which to build a concept. Might explain a lot.</p><h2>The new rules</h2><p>It should be mentioned that everyone's jersey – new or otherwise – cannot be partially obscured from now on. Thanks to a new rule for this season, players are no longer allowed to have their jerseys tucked in. The rule stipulates that all protective equipment must be worn underneath the uniform. Call it the Alexander Ovechkin rule. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/wp/2013/09/15/alex-ovechkin-on-nhls-jersey-tuck-rule-we-individuals-its-stupid/\">He, for the record, calls it \"stupid\".</a> Alex Semin probably feels the same way by now: <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/alex-semin-becomes-first-victim-nhl-no-tuck-153835896--nhl.html\">He was the first to be called on the infraction this pre-season, receiving a delay-of-game penalty</a>.</p><p>This is one of those rules that seems to likely make no serious difference to the game itself on the face of things, but seems destined to be the new puck-over-the-glass call that will, at least a handful of times, really screw everything up for someone in an important game. Which is what makes the decision to introduce it strike me as slightly odd. What's the real cost-benefit here? Strange.</p><p>It's not the only change, though. Goalies are being asked to make a change to their equipment, too, in that it will now have to be smaller. <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9538380/how-fix-nhl\">Over at Grantland, the often brilliant Sean McIndoe (Down Goes Brown) figures</a> we ought to make the nets bigger, not just to accommodate for the goalie padding, but for the goalies. You might have noticed they're also getting bigger lately.</p><p>But that's the simple stuff. Depending on how things go in the pre-season, the league may decide to introduce the hybrid icing system in an attempt to curb injuries at the end boards, like the one <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=682082\">Joni Pitkanen suffered last year</a>, and that will now keep him on the sidelines for this entire year. If you don't remember, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/rycZkVG0Tf4\">here it is</a>. When you read this, that decision may have been made (we'll update you in the comments), but midway through the pre-season, it seemed there were still mixed feelings on the system, which<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/hockey/opinion/2013/09/brophy-jury-still-out-on-hybrid-icing-in-nhl.html\"> allows the ref to whistle dead any play where the defender going back for the puck is clearly going to get to it first</a>. </p><p>One more you'll notice: Players are now to be assessed a two-minute penalty if they take their helmet off before a fight. Their own helmet, mind you. Apparently there's nothing against them taking each other's helmet off, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CONJgZjVOh8\">as Krys Barch and Brett Gallant found out earlier this month</a>:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Normally, I'd think I'd be against a stunt like this, but I enjoy something about its fraternal cheekiness. </p><h2>Fresh starts</h2><p>Keep your eyes on November 30, when the New York Rangers meet the Vancouver Canucks for the first time since the two teams swapped coaches. It'll be the first time John Tortorella is back at Madison Square Garden since he departed for BC to take over from Alain Vigneault, who went the opposite direction only a short time before. </p><p>Over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/sports/hockey/with-stepan-signed-rangers-prepare-to-face-tortorella.html?ref=hockey&amp;_r=0\">at the New York Times, Lucas Akroyd previewed the matchup</a>, and everyone seems very congenial and blasé about the whole situation, interesting though they recognize it to be. It's all behind them, everyone's moved on, right? Doubtful. This is where we thank the schedulers for allowing us all to see every team play each other again: it allows for some transcontinental rivalries to brew between all the divisional ones. Canucks fans already hate the Bruins. What's another Metropolitan enemy?</p><p>Meanwhile in Calgary, we await to see whether the Brian Burke Show is just a repeat or if he has some new material – and what does it mean either way? Burke is like the NHL's Ricky Gervais. When he sticks to what he's good at, usually things turn out more or less all right in the end. But as soon as he deviates from that, you can almost be assured it will all go to hell before too long. Can <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/sports/hockey/with-stepan-signed-rangers-prepare-to-face-tortorella.html?ref=hockey&amp;_r=0\">he operate in Jay Feaster's shadow as the president of hockey operations</a>, or will the Flames quickly become a Burke Team? At this point, the latter is likely the preferable option in Calgary, but all Burke really has to do is <a href=\"http://blogs.thescore.com/nhl/2013/03/01/jay-feaster-very-nearly-made-an-epic-gaffe-with-ryan-oreilly-offer-sheet/\">prevent another Feaster-ian near-apocalypse</a>, and he'll be worth whatever else comes.</p><h2>The outdoor games</h2><p>There are like, a million of them (read: five). And one is in California. I don't even know what this is anymore. </p><p>The main event really will be between the Leafs and Red Wings at Michigan Stadium. All the others appear in its shadow, more as pure marketing of nostalgia, rather than actually reconnecting fans to a point in their personal past. Perhaps the Pittsburgh Penguins-Chicago Blackhawks matchup at Soldier Field might come close. In any case, I look forward to both of those – particularly the first – and that sense that yes, despite it all, this is a lovely sport with great fans and there might be some kind of tradition here onto which we can all graft some collective experience and memory. </p><p>The rest, though? It begins to feel like overkill.</p><p>The New York Rangers will play two outdoor games, both at Yankee Stadium – one against the Devils and the other against the New York/Brooklyn Islanders. And the Vancouver Canucks will face off against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place in … March, which ought to prove to be very warm and wet. Speaking of which: Southern California. The LA Kings will meet the Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium March 1, when the average daytime high in that part of the world is around 70F (21.2C) and the average low is still 50F (10C). I mean, this is a joke, right? How is that even going to work? </p><p>I feel the same way about most of these games as I do of Captain Crunch. A little bit is really fun and great. But beyond one or two bites, and you start to realize what you're consuming is not real food, it's just an increasingly dull tasting pile of glossy nothingness in kind of a cool package. And, though you like the traditional morning meal as a concept, it makes you think that perhaps this thing you love hides a fractured underbelly of unbridled, unholy consumerism and high-fructose corn syrup that will eventually kill both you and the idea of breakfast itself. </p><p>One, maybe two outdoor games is enough, I think. </p><h2>The Olympics</h2><p>First thing's first: the politics. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/24/nhl-lgbt-gay-rights-russia-sochi-olympics\">My position on the NHL and NHLPA's involvement in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics hasn't changed since this summer</a>. In essence, I think the league and players' association should have refused to go, due to its twinned, formal support of the You Can Play initiative earlier this year.</p><p>The counter argument arguments made by Patrick Burke against a boycott of any kind are compelling and valid, and I suggest you check them out if you haven't already. As for me, at the risk of repeating myself too much, I still think that when it comes to hockey specifically, a principled stand is only a principled stand when you actually take a principled stand, and not when you make major allowances. But we'll leave that for now.</p><p>As for the hockey itself, the show on the ice promises to be as good as ever. A quick scan of the potential lineups for <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/feature/?id=1131\">Canada</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/52916-Team-USA-releases-preliminary-camp-roster-for-2014-Olympics.html\">USA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=428183\">Russia</a>, for instance, shows the competition ought to be pretty stiff (on paper, anyway). Those three teams appear at the moment to be the most likely to have something to prove. Canada will hope to repeat its gold, the US will want redemption from their silver, and Russia will be desperate to improve on a limp performance in Vancouver in front of a home crowd. </p><p>In keeping with another theme this year, the Team Canada and Team USA jerseys could be a problem, with the initial (leaked) looks <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/jonathan-toews-not-impressed-team-canada-jerseys-puck-144333268--nhl.html\">failing to bring much excitement, even to the players</a>. And the Americans had better hope their official Olympic photographer is better than the one who snapped them in their new on-ice duds this summer. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/10-most-spectacularly-awkward-u-olympic-glamour-shots-190110715.html\">The gallery, collected over at Puck Daddy</a>, is spectacular. Particularly Phil Kessel, who appears to be channeling his inner angry five-year-old. </p><h2>The rise of the KHL?</h2><p>Then there's the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), now with one more Ilya Kovalchuk than the NHL. Kovalchuk is probably the biggest name to move on to Russia recently, but he didn't leave for nothing. He turned his back on his $77m contract in New Jersey, but it's speculated he might not lose much out of the move. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/ilya-kovalchuk-join-ska-could-earn-20-million-210237775.html\">When the deal was first reported</a>, the thinking was that he would stand to earn in the range of $15-$20m in Russia – and at only a 13% tax rate. </p><p>That's not to suggest there are a thousand of those contracts sitting around, waiting for any old NHL-er to grab at their convenience. The NHL remains the premiere league in the world – <a href=\"http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/Belov+passes+riches+shot/8940791/story.html\">there are a lot more Anton Belovs out there</a>, looking to come this way, than there are Kovalchuks looking to go the other. Still, with the focus this winter on the Olympics, the KHL has an opportunity to showcase itself as a more serious competitor to the NHL. It's not as if the concept is strange, thanks to last year's lockout. <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/alex-ovechkin-nhl-lockout-khl/\">Remember Ovechkin's 'threat' to stay in Russia</a> should the league force too drastic a decrease in his salary? You can bet the KHL does. Who will be the next Kovalchuk?</p><p>By the way, for a more formidable read on the KHL and its potential future, I'd recommend <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nhl/news/20130906/khl-threat-ovechkin/#all\">this Sports Illustrated piece</a>.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebyseason.htm\">NHL 2013-2014 schedule</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418685332|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3c69f934d42e3ae03222faa78afb11970e6514e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>With the Wild Card games settled, we look at the match-ups in the best-of-five American and National League Divisional Series. The winners will head to the Championship series and from there hope to go to the World Series.</p><h2>NLDS: Los Angeles Dodgers vs Atlanta Braves</h2><p><strong>LA Dodgers </strong></p><p>For two hours last Friday the Dodgers were National League Champions, that is until whoever runs their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Dodgers\">Facebook page dialed back that honor</a> to NL West champs. So the expectations in Los Angeles are clear, at least in their social media department. Of course, that little miscue preceded the news that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-0930-dodgers-matt-kemp-20130930,0,2853477.story\">Matt Kemp would miss the playoffs</a> with lingering ankle issues, and that Andre Ethier, who also has a bad ankle, could be relegated to pinch-hitting duty, if he even makes the roster at all. <a href=\"http://www.lawas.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-1001-dodgers-mattingly-20131001,0,5845181.story\">Manager Don Mattingly</a> seems confident with the likes of Yasiel Puig, Adrian Gonzalez, Hanley Ramirez and Carl Crawford still at his disposal, but fact is, removing those bats from the lineup changes the way Braves pitchers will approach Dodger hitters, which is much more aggressively. Even if Kemp was on the sidelines when <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9749807/five-nlds-questions-los-angeles-dodgers-atlanta-braves\">LA ran up a 42-8 mid-season run</a>, now the stuff of legend, the Dodgers now have to face an extremely tough Braves pitching staff with a thinner roster offensively. Now, you never apologise for wins in MLB or in any league, but during that torrid stretch of 50 games, just 16 were against winning teams. Yes, they were 13-3 in those contests, but naturally, the team has slowed down somewhat since then, and now they have to face a team that beat them in five out of seven this season. Is that a problem with these injury issues? Well, thanks to <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/9760838/atlanta-braves-ace-kris-medlen-says-clayton-kershaw-missed-us\">Clayton Kershaw</a> and his ridiculously low 1.83 ERA, along with his sidekick Zack Grienke, not to mention Hyun-jin Ryu, Ricky Nolasco and closer-with-cutter Kenley Jansen, no, not really - even if the offense is making headlines now, LA are still very much about the pitching, which is likely enough to get them to the NLCS.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></p><p>There is a reason that the Braves have gotten <a href=\"http://www.guampdn.com/usatoday/article/2913015&amp;usatref=sportsmod\">little respect</a> around baseball despite winning 96 games and cruising to a National League East title by 10 games. Over the years, the Braves have made a habit of not fulfilling postseason expectations. So now that there really aren't any, one can imagine Atlanta finding their way back to the World Series for the first time since 1999. That would be really something, because in the run up to the NLDS, much the focus was on where their all-star soon-to-be-free-agent catcher Brian McCann will land after the season, and whether or not manager Fredi Gonzalez would bench his two $13m players - B.J. Upton and Dan Uggla <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/jeff-schultz/2013/oct/01/report-braves-may-bench-uggla-dodgers-series/\">(Uggla was left off the roster)</a>, that finished the season with batting averages under .200. Still, this has been the case all season long, and that didn't keep the Braves bats from thriving thanks to their home run power. No NL team has hit more long balls than Atlanta - four players have over 20, including Justin Upton, B.J.'s brother who has 27. If you're a Braves fan concerned about Dodger pitching, it's because your team isn't great at getting on base, and that could be a problem against a stingy LA staff. The Braves have a few arms of their own, even without Tim Hudson who is out for the season with ankle surgery. Mike Minor, Julio Teheran and <a href=\"http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130930&amp;content_id=62249302&amp;vkey=pr_atl&amp;c_id=atl\">Kris Medlen, the NL pitcher of September</a> who will face Kershaw in Game One, are a trio of above average starters, and the bullpen, anchored by Craig Kimbrel is absolutely air tight. Overall, it adds up to the lowest staff ERA in baseball, and you would never know it with all the talk of Clayton Kershaw and Zack Grienke. If the Dodgers are to sneak by Atlanta, it won't come easy.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Dodgers in five</p><h2>NLDS: Pittsburgh Pirates vs St Louis Cardinals</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419079500'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380739661903/7841b8a9-d840-4ce9-875c-136c15c714fc-460x276.jpeg' alt='Can the Pittsburgh Pirates win their first World Series title since 1979?' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Can the Pittsburgh Pirates win their first World Series title since 1979? Photograph: Justin K. Aller/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br /><strong>Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></p><p>There's no need to question whether or not these Pirates can perform in the playoffs - we've already seen what they can do, which judging by their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/mlb-playoffs-cincinnati-reds-vs-pittsburgh-pirates-live\">trouncing of Cincinnati in the Wild Card game</a>, is an awful lot. Pittsburgh seem intent on making the most of their first postseason appearance since 1992, and already have the look of a team ripe for a run. Can they beat St Louis? Well, there's no doubt that's a tougher order than ousting the Reds, but many in Pittsburgh point to their beating the Redbirds in four of five games at PNC Park back in July as a point when Bucs fans started to believe this season was more about October and less about finishing .500. However, if we're going down that road, it must be mentioned that the Cards laid down the law in early September, outscoring Pittsburgh <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PIT/2013-schedule-scores.shtml\">26-10 in a series sweep</a> that put St Louis ahead in the NL Central standings for good. </p><p>Overall, the Bucs won the season series 10-9 despite scoring two fewer runs. In 2013, Pittsburgh pitchers allowed 4.57 runs per game to the Cards, and 3.42 runs a game to everyone else - certainly cause for concern. However, their questionable offense actually scored more against St Louis' arms, scoring 4.47 runs per game compared with what they did against everyone else - 3.83 runs per game. In short, this series will be a war, and if you're in the great pitching beats great hitting camp, then the Pirates, with Gerrit Cole, Francisco Liriano, Jeff Locke, A.J. Burnett, who faces Adam Wainwright in Game One, and that shark tank of a bullpen, are your team here, especially when you consider the Redbirds bats were <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/split.cgi?t=b&amp;team=STL&amp;year=2013\">somewhat cooler in the second half.</a></p><p><strong>St Louis Cardinals</strong></p><p>Considering the success the Cardinals have had recently, two World Series titles, three National League pennants and seven playoff appearances in ten seasons, you may be surprised to learn that their 97 victories represents their highest win total since 2005. And while their bats get most of the publicity, St Louis pitchers have allowed the<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/\"> fewest amount of runs since, wait for it...1985!</a> So, losing starting pitcher <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/chris-carpenter-not-eyeing/article_65facfb9-d426-52c1-b260-254e919568b5.html\">Chris Carpenter, again</a>, another starter in Jaime Garcia and closer Jason Motte to major injuries doesn't seem to make any difference, and that's just the way it works in St Louis. Nearly everything this franchise does turns to gold, and that includes rookie pitchers such as Shelby Miller and Michael Wacha making major contributions, not to mention what lefty Kevin Siegrist has done out of the pen - a 0.45 ERA - the lowest by a lefty reliever with at least 35 innings pitched in the majors since 1876, according to STATS LLC. And don't forget about the reclamation of former Brewers closer John Axford who has bounced back in 13 appearances since landing in St Louis. Ace Adam Wainwright continues to lead the way and will make the first start against Pittsburgh. If there is an Achilles heel it's the closer position -<a href=\"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/02/demoted-closer-edward-mujica-makes-cardinals-playoff-roster/\"> Edward Mujica fell off the table in September</a> and Trevor Rosenthal has been working the ninth inning as of late - I'm sure this will work out just fine, as usual. Their bats led the league in runs despite finishing third to last in the NL in home runs - instead, they double you to death, racking up over 300 two-baggers this season, Yadier Molina and Matt Carpenter in particular. The downside? <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/cardinals/2013/09/27/allen-craig-cardinals-out-playoffs-lisfranc-fracture/2886079/\">First baseman Allen Craig,</a> amongst the most productive Cards is out for at least the NLDS with a sprained foot. Not to worry, Matt Adams of the <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/adamsma01.shtml\">baseball factory that is Western Pennsylvania</a> is there to save the day, and he's hit the third most homers for St Louis this season...off the bench. So speaking of bench play, that will no doubt be affected now that Adams is playing at first - score that as a negative for their offense, that and how poorly they hit left handed pitching. Can they handle the Pirates? Definitely, but this one is way too close to call, but I guess I have no choice....</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Pirates in five</p><h2>ALDS: Oakland Athletics vs Detroit Tigers</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419079501'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380782722935/6ff201f0-8cca-4d52-ad46-e2fb4d6e8e27-460x276.jpeg' alt='The Oakland A's won the American League West for the second consecutive season.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Oakland A's won the American League West for the second consecutive season.

We know that few fans go to the games, but that the ones that do provide as colorful atmosphere as you'll ever see. We've <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/\">seen the film</a>, read the book and lauded the General Manager, Billy Beane, for years. It's time to win something.</p><p>This will be the seventh time a Beane club has made it to the postseason, and they've made it to the American League Championship Series exactly once. If their GM Beane says the postseason \"is a crapshoot\" perhaps this is lucky seven for a team with exactly one household name in their lineup, and that's only because he <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MacYHpAoDks/TlYsMeDagNI/AAAAAAAADlw/gewir0wzBFQ/s400/CocoCrispPuffs.jpg\">shares it with a breakfast cereal</a> (that's probably not fair to Yoenis Cespedes). If you don't know MVP candidate Josh Donaldson, Brandon Moss, Jed Lowrie and the Oakland A's bats then <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2013-batting.shtml\">I'd advise you to look here and check out one of the most dynamic groups in the game</a> - what they lack in recognizable names they more than make up for in production. Their pitching is the best in the American League, somewhat hilariously led by a <a href=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.mandatory.com/media/2013/08/bartolo-colon-steroids.jpg\">40-year-old 18 game winner, Bartolo Colon</a> and their Aussie closer, Grant Balfour, who has blown three saves all season. The A's won 94 games last season and 96 games this year. They are not a cute little overachieving joke, rather, they're serious contenders for a World Series title - if they beat Detroit, which is completely possible, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2013/10/detroit_tigers_jim_leyland_on_46.html\">even if they don't steal signs</a>, no one should act surprised.</p><p><strong>Detroit Tigers</strong></p><p>Despite having their best team since winning their last World Series title in 1984, the Detroit Tigers <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_24227032/detroit-tigers-have-lost-their-bite-since-playing\">will begin the playoffs on the road</a> for the third consecutive year, heading out to Oakland where they fell to an 0-2 ALDS deficit a season ago before ousting the A's. Jim Leyland convinced Justin Verlander to be the second starter but he probably needed to drop one more slot - <a href=\"http://motorcitybengals.com/2013/10/01/case-anibal-sanchez-detroit-tigers-number-1-playoff-starter/\">Anibal Sanchez</a> has been the 1b to 1a, 21-game winner Max Scherzer this season, but Verlander is Verlander, and if he pitches like Verlander it won't matter. </p><p>But don't worry about their starters, or their offense, which with the best hitter on the planet in Miguel Cabrera (<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9760412/2013-mlb-playoffs-miguel-cabrera-detroit-tigers-playing-lot-pain-jim-leyland-says\">look what he does when he is hurt</a>) making life cushy for Prince Fielder and everyone else is just fine. No, it's the bullpen that needs to get their act together, fast, after posting a 4.98 ERA in September. That won't work in October, and Drew Smyly and closer Joaquin Benoit need help. Bruce Rondon could fill that need - he's lowered his ERA more than two runs since late July.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting Tigers storyline coming into the postseason is the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2013/10/01/jhonny-peralta-detroit-tigers-playoff-roster-oakland-as-alds/2905781/\">Jhonny Peralta experiment </a>- back from a 50-game PED suspension, the shortstop, who has been unseated by Jose Iglesias, has been playing in left field - October isn't usually the best time for experiments, just one reason for the forecasting below. </p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Athletics in five</p><h2>ALDS: Tampa Bay Rays vs Boston Red Sox</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419079502'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380782992064/a786ab7d-0279-48bd-be72-e5cfcd5e9af8-460x276.jpeg' alt='The Boston Red Sox are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2009 season.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Boston Red Sox are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2009 season.

Who besides Rays and Red Sox fans didn't want to see Terry Francona in the visitors dugout at Fenway Park, primed to stick it to his old bosses, ready to <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rcnu6cz-VMo/Ubx_tLtjO4I/AAAAAAAABaY/O8TGhvHzeik/s1600/Natural+(1984)+18.jpg\">crush the dreams of ungrateful souls in dark offices</a>.

I wanted Tito In Boston.</p><p>That's negative though right? Look at the bright side you say? Fine. Cleveland are out, and that means that some of us baseball fans out there can finally breathe a bit easier. Remember - the Tribe weren't just a team, they were a formula. \"See what you can do with a few middle of the road free agents,\" said GM's around the league. \"We don't need the big star, we can just load up on Michael Bourns and Nick Swishers, kick the crap out of the bottom feeders, catch a few breaks and make the playoffs - I love it.\" You could hear the murmurs of a new \"Indians\" way, in places like Queens, New York. A filthy, dangerous ideology, ready to set some sheepish organizations back years, maybe even decades. We can only hope Cleveland's loss represents a setback to such thinking.</p><p>And so the Rays, a band of barnstormers who have bounced around the country cheating death reach their latest stop - Boston, where Tampa will finally be able to lose a game and not go home (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/mlb-playoffs-tampa-bay-rays-vs-cleveland-indians-live\">having won two consecutive one-off playoffs</a>). The champagne infused Rays are on a roll, and they are in their sixth city in nine days, basically because of four players - David Price, Alex Cobb, Evan Longoria and Delmon Young, who hit his ninth postseason home run on Wednesday in Cleveland. That's nice and all, but that's not nearly enough, and so there is absolutely no way this Tampa team can begin to compete with a Boston powerhouse that beat them in seven out of 12 contests this season. I mean, they had four hits against Cleveland's Danny Salazar - what are they going to get off Clay Buchholz? </p><p><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong></p><p>How much damage was done to the relationship between the Red Sox organization and their fans during the September of 2011 nightmare and the horror show 93 loss season of 2012? Enough that the Nation have been slow to embrace a team of scrappy rough and tumble hard working bearded ballplayers that won 97 games and crushed opponents with their relentless offense. Attendance dropped for the first time in several seasons, businesses with tickets had trouble giving them away and perhaps most incredibly, on September 18th, the Sox sold tickets for $1 to fans wearing a beard - real or painted. It wasn't long ago that the team was boasting of a <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9158007/boston-red-sox-820-game-sellout-streak-ends\">controversial sell-out streak,</a> one that continued despite empty seats last season, one of many controversies that dogged an ownership that brought them Bobby Valentine and mega doses of ill will. No wonder their brass has spent most of the season out of sight as they worked behind the scenes to repair their bond with Red Sox Nation.</p><p>Expect the bus to fill up fast now that the playoffs are here, now that the best team in the American League look set to take center stage in their bid for a third World Series title in nine seasons. Yes, a season after nearly everything went wrong in Boston, nearly everything has gone right. John Farrell was the manager everybody wanted, <a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/2/4793158/red-sox-mvp-debate-david-ortiz\">David Ortiz was an elite power threat at age 37</a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9757214/jacoby-ellsbury-quick-learner-craft-stealing-bases\">Jacoby Ellsbury played over 130 games</a>, Jarrod Saltalamacchia enjoyed a breakout season, new acquisitions, Mike Napoli, Johnny Gomes, Stephen Drew and Shane Victorino were productive inside a revamped lineup. The pitching staff trimmed their ERA by just under a run from the 2012 team, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9760876/2013-mlb-playoffs-jon-lester-boston-red-sox-start-game-1-alds\">Game One starter</a> Jon Lester turned that trick by over a run. John Lackey revamped his game and his reputation, Clay Buchholz pitched like an ace and is back from injury in time for the playoffs, while the bullpen recovered from losing three stalwarts as <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/boston_red_sox/2013/10/wit_makes_closer_koji_uehara_a_clubhouse_hit\">Koji Uehara became an elite closer</a> with a WHIP of 0.56 - that is not a misprint.</p><p>That's a whole lot of good right there, and throw in the fact that they're as tight-knit group with tremendous team chemistry and you've got quite a ballclub. Weaknesses? Well, after Buchholz, they don't really have a shutdown starter like a Zack Greinke for example (few in the AL do this season), but they are deep, and with their offense, I'm not sure it really matters. They should handle any of those pesky wild card teams, and match-up well against Detroit or Oakland.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Red Sox in four</p><h2><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/ps.jsp\">MLB playoffs schedule</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418927187|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2500560920bbfac1f4644d4eb26865e470fa1e63 -->",

        "headline":"Ben Ainslie aiming for first America's Cup win for Britain after US victory",
        "body":"<p>Sir Ben Ainslie, the greatest Olympic sailor and now surely the undisputed king of the comeback following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/sep/26/america-cup-ben-ainslie-oracle-dramatic-victory-video\" title=\"\">his team's stunning victory in the America's Cup</a>, is vowing to win the oldest competition in world sport again, this time in a British boat.</p><p>Ainslie was celebrating an extraordinary win but, as is his wont, was already turning his thoughts to his new challenge. \"It would be great to get out a British boat next time,\" said Ainslie on Thursday. \"We have the sailors; it's just about getting the money together.\"</p><p>Ainslie, 36, was drafted in as tactician on Oracle Team USA to help reverse a losing streak that looked terminal. His skill – and his legendary steel – helped Oracle claim an amazing last-gasp 9-8 victory over Emirates Team New Zealand, having trailed 8-1.</p><p>Ainslie said he hoped the excitement would generate interest in his next goal. \"We've got a very proud maritime heritage in the UK. In terms of the sailors and the designers, we have the talent in the UK, that's for sure.\"</p><p>It has been an incredible 12 months for Ainslie, who won his fourth Olympic gold medal at London 2012. His comeback then was remarkable enough – he had trailed the genial Danish sailor Jonas Høgh-Christensen throughout the regatta and a lesser man would have pulled out with the awful back pain he was suffering.</p><p>Somehow Ainslie hung in and engineered the result he needed in the final race of the series, unfurling a union flag and letting off a red flare after crossing the finishing line off the Dorset coast – creating one of the most memorable images of the Games.</p><p>Again a lesser man would have spent days celebrating in the bars of Weymouth. But by then he already had the America's Cup in his sights. He made one last appearance in his beloved Finn class dinghy, Rita, sailing in front of Big Ben on the Thames. And then it was off to try to fulfil his boyhood ambition of winning the America's Cup.</p><p>The cup is a complicated competition. Ainslie spent the winter in California and Italy taking part in an event called the <a href=\"http://bar.americascup.com\" title=\"\">America's Cup World Series</a>, a sort of testing ground for sailors with ambitions of competing in the America's Cup proper, with his own Ben Ainslie Racing team.</p><p>The team did well, finishing on the podium in third place.</p><p>Then came possibly the biggest test of his career, the call-up to try to turn around Oracle Team USA's fortunes in the series with its New Zealand rival. Even the biggest of Ainslie's supporters could be forgiven for thinking that not even he could pull that one off.</p><p>But race by race Oracle got better and better. The New Zealand team stuttered and in the final contest, the Oracle team won on San Francisco Bay by a reasonably comfortable 44 seconds.</p><p>Ainslie, who has made his name competing in single-handed boats, clearly relished the team effort that went into this most dramatic of comebacks. \"We just grew and grew and in the end we were too strong for the Kiwis,\" he said. \"Everyone had written us off. \"The opposition had written us off. The experts had written us off.</p><p>\"I never gave up hope but I knew it would be hard. When I came in everyone was a bit down but I was a new face and that gave everyone a lift. I tried to be Mr Positive and we gelled well.\"</p><p>The stunning finish could not have been better for the sport. Even before the turnaround the series had won handsome audiences around the world, drawn by the sight of huge, powerful catamarans locked in combat with impressive Californian backdrops. Coverage on BBC2 has helped bring a new British audience to sailing.</p><p>There was sadness, too, in Ainslie's win, after the death in May of the British sailor Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson, who was killed in an accident during America's Cup training. Ainslie dedicated his part in the win to his friend. \"I looked up to the stars after it all settled down at the end and thought of Bart. In some ways this was for him. He loved sailing and he loved the America's Cup. He would have been so excited about this series.\"</p><p>After his Olympic win last year Ainslie recalled how he started sailing, on the creeks around Falmouth in Cornwall as an eight-year-old in a duffel coat and wellies. His America's Cup win prompted him to recall watching an America's Cup team off Falmouth in 1987. \"I remember as a kid watching them training and preparing and thinking about maybe one day being involved with the America's Cup. To be part of a winning America's Cup team is for me personally part of a lifelong dream.\"</p><p>But he is also a patriot. The America's Cup was first staged off the Isle of Wight in 1851 – but Britain has never won it. \"It's about time we changed that,\" he said.</p><p>Of course, Ainslie is realistic. Funding an America's Cup challenge costs millions. \"It takes a lot to bring us together in terms of the commercial support, financial support, to run one of these teams,\" he said.</p><p>Still his website puts it simply: \"Ben Ainslie Racing has a long-term aim to be a competitive challenger for the 35th America's Cup as Ben aims to win the oldest trophy in sport and bring the cup back to Britain where it all began over 160 years ago.\"</p><p>The course will be long and hard, but it would foolish to write Ainslie off.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418386095|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fb023a7f3356565fe63183e38c5ea53af55a13fa -->",

Just a week ago the America's Cup, a plutocratic sailing tournament that everyone loves to hate, was sinking into pre-ordained ignominy.</p><p>Accidents, boycotts and bickering marred the build-up, then the defending champion, Oracle Team USA lost eight of the first nine races in a desultory surrender to the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand. Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who sponsored the team and brought the tournament to San Francisco bay, was gleefully trashed for his hubris. This cup would be remembered, if at all, as a damp squib.</p><p>Then the script changed. Oracle, a zephyr from defeat, rejigged its crew and mounted a spectacular comeback which electrified the contest and set the scene for a climactic, winner-take-all duel on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We're not going to stop – we're going to keep going all the way to the end,\" said skipper Jimmy Spithill after winning two races, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/25/oracle-team-new-zealand-americas-cup\">evening the score</a> at 8-8 on Tuesday. \"We really want this. You can sense it on board.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112338698/fb89d760-a668-44c5-9bac-71341ec0b673-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup. Photograph: Steve Rhodes/Demotix/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>A jubilant crowd cheered and waved the stars and stripes as Oracle's crew, fists pumping, crossed the finish line. Downcast Kiwis bemoaned another lost chance to take the cup to Auckland.</p><p>The drama of the greatest comeback in the cup's 162-year history has saved it, regardless who prevails. Gripes have turned into wonder at the spectacle of two huge catamarans, specially built for this event and crewed with elite sailors, duelling at more than 50mph.</p><p>\"Just when you thought it was safe to leave the water, the America's Cup has blossomed into a fantastic affair,\" marvelled <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/americascup/2013/09/23/americas-cup-oracle-team-usas-amazing-comeback/\">the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. Oracle, it said, was on the cusp of the most improbable nautical victory since Nelson at Trafalgar.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the paper had floated a rather different comparison during the preliminary Louis Vuitton Cup: \"Perhaps the worst nautical launch since the Titanic set off across the North Atlantic.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278453'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112452376/58f6e12b-e820-4963-87f8-16ba3b45f02f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand. Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The about-turn came after Oracle's superstar sailors lost eight of the first 11 races. Ellison, who famously hates to lose, was going to lose. In a bold move the team replaced personnel, notably the tactician John Kostecki, a Bay Area native, with <a href=\"http://benainslie.com/\">Ben Ainslie, a Briton who has won four Olympic gold</a>. To widespread astonishment, Oracle then won nine of 13 races, including the two wins on Tuesday which tied the contest. Even when the Kiwis started with an advantage, the Oracle crew found a way to overtake.</p><p>\"The boat is just getting faster and faster,\" said Spithill. \"The boys are really starting to believe now. There's a lot of good energy on board.\" Wednesday's final, which is due to start at 1.15pm Pacific time, will be the most exciting day in their lives, he said.</p><p>The Team New Zealand skipper, Dean Barker, who may be about to enter the record books for the wrong reasons, called Tuesday's latest losses \"an absolute shocker\" and faulted himself for making a premature approach to the line, incurring a penalty.</p><p>The American side has actually won 10 of 18 races, having begun two races down because of a penalty for cheating in the America's Cup world series.</p><p>Ellison missed a keynote speech he was due to deliver at the Oracle OpenWorld conference to watch Tuesday's race, a scene Hollywood will surely mine should it make a movie.</p><p>A few months ago the America's Cup <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/11/americas-cup-disaster-san-francisco\">was in deep trouble</a>. What was billed as a glory of California's summer – 15 teams competing for sailing's most prestigious prize, generating $1.4bn in the process – had shrivelled into a bickering rump of just four teams. Accidents destroyed or damaged two catamarans and killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/10/andrew-simpson\">Andrew Simpson, a British Olympic gold medallist with Sweden's Artemis Racing team</a>, prompting rule changes.</p><p>Italy's Luna Rossa Challenge team sat out some Louis Vuitton races – the warm-up contest to select the challenger – in protest. A major sponsor demanded a refund and San Francisco braced for a financial loss instead of a promised bonanza.</p><p>Oracle's initial rout deepened the sense of debacle as the main event got underway. Then began the comeback, and a cup dismissed as a tycoons' bauble became nail-biting drama.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418239774|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0308d9118bd795ebe790c3783a23997826f16989 -->",

        "body":"<p>The head of NBC Sports has responded to calls for the TV network to put a spotlight on Russia's draconian new anti-gay laws in its coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics, saying there would be reporting of the issue but only if it should emerge as a problem during the games.</p><p>Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports division, told an audience at the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills that the issue of Russia's clampdown on gay men and lesbians had already been dealt with by the International Olympic Committee. \"The IOC has addressed it with the Russian government and has assured athletes, fans and media that there won't be any issues,\" he said, adding that should the new laws impacted any part of the Winter Olympics \"we will make sure we are acknowledging it and recognising it\".</p><p>The comments from Lazarus are unlikely to tamp down calls from the LGBT community for NBC to highlight Russia's aggressively anti-gay laws in its coverage of the Winter Olympics that is begin in Sochi on 6 February and run for 18 days. There have been widespread calls for protests and a boycott of the games.</p><p>Last week the Washington-based LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/ChadGriffin_NBCUniversal_07242013.pdf\">wrote to the NBC parent company</a> urging the network to use its broadcasting reach to expose \"this inhumane and unjust law to the millions of American viewers who will tune in to watch the games\". Specifically, HRC called on the network to refuse to air the opening ceremony of the games.</p><p>The new law, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/30/russia-passes-anti-gay-law\">signed by President Vladimir Putin last month</a>, imposes fines on those who spread propaganda \"directed at forming nontraditional sexual setups\" or that gives the \"distorted understanding\" that homosexuals are \"socially equivalent\" to heterosexuals. The \"homosexual propaganda\" penalised under the legislation includes wearing a rainbow flag or tweeting positive messages about gays or lesbians.</p><p>The law also provides for the arrest of foreigners engaging in such activities for up to 15 days followed by deportation. The IOC said last week that it had been given assurances from the Russian government that the sanctions for foreign nationals would not be applied to those participating in the games.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413821717|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d89bcbd5ba86778c0303fe2cad03f968cdaf7ff5 -->",

        "headline":"USA v Honduras: five things we learned",
        "body":"<h2>Right now, the US is edging Mexico</h2><p>The balance of power in Concacaf has tended to edge back and forward between the US and Mexico over the last 20 years, with Mexico generally held to be in the ascendancy – owing primarily to the superiority of their domestic league and the emphasis on youth development, which bore fruit with last year's stunning Olympic win.</p><p>This year, though, has been an ugly one for El Tri. They've struggled through the Hex phase of qualifying, and since the USA's symbolic win in the Azteca last summer, that stadium has hardly been the fortress of yore. The only surprise about their opening loss to Panama in the Gold Cup group stages was that it wasn't that big a surprise. Even after steadying and going through to the knockout stages, they were pushed all the way by Trinidad and Tobago, before being found wanting yet again by Panama in the semi-finals, as the Panamanians reached their first final since 2005 and ended any hope of a Mexican threepeat over the US.</p><p>And while Fifa rankings that regularly assert England as world-beaters need always be taken with a pinch of salt, the fact that the US overtook Mexico in the rankings felt about right as an assessment of where both squads are – regardless of the skewing of the stats caused by largely B teams playing in the Gold Cup. Whether they stay there through next year is perhaps not down so much to the US, who are playing as well as could be expected, but how much ground a floundering Mexico can make up with the talent at their disposal.</p><p>Certainly expect a very awkward inquest for José Manuel 'Chepo' de la Torre on his return to Mexico. Being pelted with cups, as he was after the first Panama loss, may be the least of his worries. There was doubt about him keeping his job even had Mexico retained the Gold Cup. The chances of him being on the sidelines in Brazil look very slim indeed.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Can we now regard Honduras part I as a blip?</h2><p>It all seems so long ago now — the opening game of the Hex in Honduras, where the US went down to a defeat that prompted a spiral of soul-searching that reached its nadir just before the infamous Costa Rica snow game. At that point the prospect of a 10-game winning streak for this side looked remote indeed, and the Klinsmann project was being subjected to critical scrutiny and off-the-record briefings to journalists that suggested all was far from well.</p><p>Not so, insisted Klinsmann this week, calling the first game against Honduras \"a blip\" on what had otherwise been a steadily upward trajectory over the past two years. The US won the return in a tight game in Utah last month, and on Wednesday night they blew past the Hondurans in imperious style, suggesting there was substance to Klinsmann's claims.</p><p>The latter game of course was a game largely between players who may be on the fringes of their national teams' first XI (though the incumbent Graham Zusi may have been exhaling particularly hard while watching Landon Donovan's displays in this Gold Cup). And while it seems prudent to take some of the best and worst performances of the national team as outliers when considering where they truly stand, the improvement of those depth players since the particularly awful game against Canada in MLS pre-season is a definite marker for progress.</p><p>The passing is crisper, the understanding greater, and perhaps most impressively the midfield personnel are able to be rotated without a noticeable loss of fluidity. Beckerman, Holden and Diskerud have all played their part at the base of the midfield, while Bedoya came in for Corona against Honduras and had one of his best games for the US. The ability to change pace and spring defenses is night and day, as both the first two goals against Honduras perfectly illustrated.</p><p>That idea of players not just as stopgaps, but as active and serviceable depth with an individual understanding of their role and responsibility in the system, is where we can fairly talk about real progress in the US team. It doesn't make the USA world-beaters, but it does mean that compared to just six months ago, or even some of their turgid midfield slogs of 2012, they are certainly a team.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Goodson makes a case for himself</h2><p>The consensus at the end of the most recent round of World Cup qualifiers was that the first choice center-back pairing was now Gonzalez and Besler, after the latter had played his way into contention at the start of the year and apparently solved one of the longstanding questions over Klinsmann's selection choices. And when Klinsmann exercised his right to exchange four squad players after the group stages, it was perhaps no surprise to see those two brought in to the squad, presumably to slot straight into the side.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly though, only one of those players went into the team – and it wasn't the (barely) more experienced Gonzalez, but the more thoughtful Besler who has stepped in. The other center-back role has been filled by Clarence Goodson, who followed up his first international goal in two years against Guatemala in the tune-up game for the tournament, with the opener against El Salvador in the quarter final – in both cases showing an unlikely predator's instincts in the box.</p><p>He kept his place against Honduras and continued another trait of recent performances – looking up and trying to get the ball forward quickly.</p><p>It's precisely what Klinsmann wants from his team, and precisely what they've lacked during the formative part of his reign – players willing to play the percentages and trust that possession per se means less than the number of chances created by forward movement. Goodson has been doing his chances of being one of the four central defenders for Brazil no harm at all.</p><h2>Eddie Johnson has put down a marker </h2><p>It's not exactly \"watch the throne\" – maybe more \"watch the third or fourth in line for the throne\", but Klinsmann must be delighted at the heating up of competition for striker spots in his squad. First of all it was Chris Wondolowski who responded to his heels being held to the fire by Jack McInerney's MLS form and inclusion in the Gold Cup squad, by opening his international account with a flurry of goals at the start of this tournament, to keep the young pretender in his place.</p><p>And then when Eddie Johnson was called into the squad after the group stage, he too wasted no time in sending a message to Wondolowski in turn. Jogging onto the field and heading a goal within seconds to better the efforts of the man he'd replaced was one thing, but having duly claimed the starting spot for the semi-final, Johnson quickly sent another finish with his burst through on goal and emphatic finish to open the scoring.</p><p>The goal was more than just one that gave the US an early lead – it was a sickener for Honduras. They'd already come out playing with their instinctive conservatism – dropping deep to counter US balls over the top and hoping to spring on the counter to snatch a goal to defend.</p><p>Johnson's goal confirmed their worst fears about what the game might bring and saw them sink deeper and deeper in the wake of the goal, to the extent that the US defensive midfielders were able to have potshots from near the edge of the box, and the Honduran attack looked negligible.</p><p>It's possible that Wondolowski would have taken that goal, though when he did eventually come on to the field with a two goal cushion in place, it was hard to escape the feeling that that was about the right order of things – a now proven poacher, with the ability to constantly move and occupy defenses so that they can't commit to helping chase the game, replacing a man more likely to get goals for this team against stronger opposition.</p><h2>'Overboiling'</h2><p>Jurgen Klinsmann's English is a million times better than my German, and he speaks as he asks his teams to play – without fear. </p><p>And as Clint Dempsey can testify, occasionally he has harsh words for his own players, though usually within the frame of expecting the absolute best from them. Even after Donovan's standout performances in this tournament Klinsmann was keen to emphasize that he expected more, and had told the player as much:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Your benchmark is the best Landon Donovan ever. I'm not taking anything less than that — and he's trying to catch up with that.</p></blockquote><p>It's the kind of statement that looks harsher in transcript than it does when delivered in Klinsmann's usual affable manner, where even the most critical comments are delivered with indulgent chuckles. </p><p>With his self-deprecating interview persona it's easy to forget sometimes that Klinsmann is a fierce competitor, though we got a glimpse of it against Honduras when a furious Klinsmann was ejected after vehemently protesting a foul on Beasley just in front of his technical area. The coach should have known better given the whimsical nature of concacaf refereeing — indeed his outburst had been prompted by it — but after the game he was back to his even self in apologizing (\"I just kind of overboiled it\"). </p><p>Under Concacaf Gold Cup rules there isn't an automatic suspension for Klinsmann for the final, and it's possible he will be allowed to take his seat on the bench, depending on the results of a disciplinary enquiry. If he isn't on hand however, this will be an interesting test for the cohesion of the team and possibly an unwelcome distraction from what's been an absolute procession of a tournament so far.</p><p>But if Klinsmann's claims about the steady upward trajectory of the team are correct, and if the level of understanding is truly what the Gold Cup performances have suggested it is at, then it might perhaps be intriguing to watch this side on autopilot for one game.</p><p><em></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413634557|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b9362cee48d6aeb33813f757b7692e1b1ea0e416 -->",

        "headline":"Wichita State's Cinderella run takes them to the Final Four over Ohio State",
        "body":"<p>For a while on Saturday, March Madness had subsided into, at best, mere March Irrationality. Halfway through the second game of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament doubleheader, it felt the first day of Elite Eight action was a complete bust. The opening game, Syracuse's low-scoring win over Marquette, had been something of a dud, and it looked as though ninth-seeded Wichita State was headed towards a surprisingly easy victory over second-seeded Ohio State. In the end, the Wichita State Shockers would pull out the victory, securing a Final Four appearance that few saw coming, but nothing about it would be easy.</p><p>At times during the West Regional finals, not even a struggling Ohio State looked like it believed that Ohio State were capable of a final push against Wichita State. At halftime the score was 35-22 in favor of Wichita State, who would push the lead up to as many 20 points for stretches during the second half. At times at the Staples Center, it looked all the world like Ohio State were the inexperienced lower-seeded Cinderella team and Wichita State were the favorites. </p><p>Coming out of the half, however, officials did start calling the game significantly tighter, and this changed the match's entire flow. Ohio State were able to adjust while Wichita State weren't. While the Buckeyes were having trouble getting shots to fall, especially three-pointers (5-25),<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/31/ohio-state-lost-wichita-state-ncaa_n_2986751.html\"> they were able to go 19-for-22 on the free throw line in the second half</a>, a big reason they were able to cut into Wichita State's lead. The nonstop whistles for fouls and the cavalcade of timeouts used by both teams, not to mention the network, may have also disrupted Wichita State's offensive rhythm as much as they irritated the television audience. Not even counting fouls and other breaks of action, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaolaBoivin/status/318166024837009408\">including a pause for a player to recover his contact lens</a>, there were nine official timeouts in the last 6:30 of game time. It felt like hundreds.</p><p>So Ohio State, coming off back-to-back games won on last second shots thanks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/25/florida-gulf-coast-sweet-sixteen-upset\">Aaron Craft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/29/march-madness-indiana-eliminatied-by-syracuse\">LaQuinton Ross</a>, looked as if they were making a comeback and Wichita State apparently knew it. Late in the game, an obviously rattled Wichita State began making bad fouls and unforced errors. With less than three minutes left on the clock, Ohio State cut the once insurmountable 20 point lead down to 3, it looked like Wichita State were re-enacting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/30/march-madness-michigan-defeats-kansas-fgcu-eliminated\">Kansas's collapse against Michigan the day before</a>. Then Wichita State's Tekele Cotton responded with this key three:</p><p>With the Wichita State lead now doubled, the Buckeyes responded with a Deshaun Thomas layup to cut it closer, but then Fred Van Vleet essentially the iced the game with a jumper, making it 67-61 Shockers with exactly one minute to spare. The Ohio State Buckeyes were not going to get a chance to make a last second game-winner this night. When the game ended, the Permanent Timeout so to speak, Wichita State had beaten Ohio State 70-66. Wichita State was heading to its first Final Four since 1965. As Fox Sports Radio's Ben Maller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmaller/status/318139571655307264\">pointed out on Twitter</a>: \"Last time Wichita State was in Final Four, gas cost 31 cents, St. Louis Gateway Arch was completed, Lyndon B. Johnson was President\".</p><p>Wichita State's run through the tournament makes them a spiritual successor, in a way, of 2006's George Mason whose Final Four appearance <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/-college-basketball-mens-tournament/news/20130330/wichita-state-ncaa-tournament/\">redefined what so called mid-majors could accomplish</a>. Much like George Mason, Wichita State might be a Cinderella team, but that doesn't mean that they were relying on any magic tricks to get there. To make it to the Final Four, the Shockers had to win four straight games, along the way eliminating both a one-seed in Gonzaga and a second-seed in Ohio State. Nothing they accomplish from here on out, no matter their initial seeding, will truly count as an upset because they've proven themselves to be a flat-out good basketball team. Which is a good thing, because Saturday's hard won victory means that head coach Gregg Marshall gets to prepare his team to face the winner of Sunday's game between overall top-seeded Louisville and dangerous second-seeded Duke. </p><p>So the West Regional final ended up being thrilling, way more thrilling than Wichita State fans probably wanted, especially compared to the East Regional final that came before it. The Elite Eight opened on Saturday afternoon with third-seeded Marquette facing fourth-seeded Syracuse, and the game continued with this year's tradition of starting every new round of the NCAA tournament with an absolute snoozer. The Syracuse Orange defeated the Marquette Golden Eagles in a 55-39 game that was even less enthralling than the score indicates.</p><p>After their blow-out win against Miami Hurricanes, Marquette reverted back to the inconsistent team that probably should have lost to either Davidson or Butler in its first two games. Meanwhile Syracuse brought the same smothering defense that the brought during their shocking upset of Indiana. The results? The Marquette Golden Eagles hit 12-53 from the field, a staggeringly ridiculous statistic that questions how much of it was great defense on Syracuse's part and how much was just Marquette incompetence. Syracuse's offense wasn't exactly easy on the eyes either, with, as usual, the very notable exception of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/michael-carter-williams-is-the-point-man-of-syracuses-run.html?_r=0\">star guard Michael Carter-Williams</a> who scored 12 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists. Carter-Williams most likely will declare for the 2013 NBA Draft, and it's absolutely frightening to imagine this Syracuse offense without him.</p><p>The highlight for those watching the game at Washington DC.'s Verizon Center might have been spotting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2013/03/30/president-obama-robert-griffin-iii-are-at-the-syracuse-marquette-game/\">the most influential man in the city</a>. Yes, Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III was there watching the game, along with noted Chicago politician Barack Obama. It was actually rather brave of the president to show considering <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/21/president-obama-march-madness-ncaa-bracket\">that he had predicted this would be an Indiana-Miami matchup</a>. When the score was 18-7 a full six and a half minutes into the game, I'm sure he could even the staunch Republicans in the crowd were wishing Obama's predictions were right.</p><p>Not that the Syracuse Orange and their fans cared at all that they hadn't been involved with the most entertaining 40 minutes of basketball in tournament history. Cheering head coach Jim Boeheim as he was cutting down the nets was all the excitement they needed. Boeheim has now made <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/21978251/boeheim-orange-back-in-final-four\">four Final Four appearances in four different decades</a> and has a change to take Syracuse even further next weekend when he faces the winner of Saturday afternoon's game between No. 4 Michigan and No. 3 Florida.</p><p>Even if this is the end of the road for Wichita State or Syracuse, they have in many respects, already won. As Mike Pesca <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pescami/status/318131772443480065\">put it succinctly</a>: \"Syracuse now in the Final 4 in NCAA B-ball, the only sport where we care more about semi finalists than finalists\". It's a joke, but there's some truth there, making the Final Four isn't just advancing to the next round in the tournament, it's a validation for an entire program. Considering the challenges of advancing in such a crowded field, consisting of either 64 or 68 teams depending on how one classifies the First Four play-in games, being among the last four standing is almost as impressive as winning the championship in another playoff system. </p><p>That \"almost\" qualifier is huge though. Saturday night, Wichita State and Syracuse both cut down their respective nets and celebrated an accomplishment that few had expected from either of them. Sunday, one imagines will be less fun, as they will learn, at the same time as the rest of the college basketball world, which team will be all that's between them and an appearance in a national championship game. Neither of them will be thinking very much about settling for an \"almost\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406480792|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f83de76eeb85de75468fc4eb5c4dcc3c33fbeb24 -->",

        "body":"<p>Spencer Hawes had 18 points and career highs with 16 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 98-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night.</p><p>Jrue Holiday added 27 points and 12 assists to help the Sixers win for only the third time in 15 games. While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home.</p><p>The Sixers led by one at the end of the third quarter, then opened the fourth on a 19-4 run to put away the Pacers. Evan Turner and Thaddeus Young each contributed some lead-stretching buckets in the fourth to put all five starters in double figures.</p><p>Roy Hibbert had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.</p><p>The 76ers had enough this time to finish off one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They had a late lead and the Heat on the ropes until they blew it and lost by four Wednesday night.</p><p>Just like they did against Miami, the Sixers got into an early groove in the quarter to put the upset alert on notice. Dorell Wright hit a 3-pointer and Lavoy Allen came off the bench to score his first two baskets to get a big run going. They forced turnovers on consecutive possessions at one point during the spurt and built a 10-point lead.</p><p>Somehow, Hawes, the much-maligned 7-1 center, outplayed Hibbert. Hawes has settled in nicely as a starter after an erratic first 42 games as a reserve. He had a fantastic one-handed rebound right over Hibbert's head in the third that put the crowd of 18,587 on their feet. Hawes had six blocked shots through the first three quarters and made the Pacers think twice about going inside.</p><p>At San Antonio, Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113.</p><p>Manu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio, which is 1½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.</p><p>Wayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland. Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.</p><p>Neither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon, LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Detroit Pistons their eighth straight loss with a 112-101 victory.</p><p>Rodney Stuckey had a season-high 32 points for the Pistons, who have yet to win a game in March.</p><p>After trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, the Blazers took a 90-81 lead on Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 8:33 remaining in the game. Portland extended the lead to 99-87 on J.J. Hickson's dunk.</p><p>In other games Saturday, Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points in the Washington Wizards 127-105 win over the Phoenix Suns, Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Boston Celtics powered past the Charlotte Bobcats 105-88 and Gordon Hayward scored 17 points in the Utah Jazz's 90-84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405732009|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3a40fce24f3943a674f5f023491958ee37ab55c6 -->",

O'Reilly assisted on another goal in a four-goal onslaught in the second period that turned a 1-1 tie into a no-contest.</p><p>The Blackhawks' previous loss in regulation on the road came more than a year ago. Dating back to last year's regular season, their points streak was 30 games, still five short of the all-time record held by the 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyers.</p><p>Anaheim's Daniel Winnik ended an 18-game goal drought on the first shot of the game, setting up the Ducks' 4-0 win over the Calgary Flames.</p><p>Viktor Fasth posted his second career shutout with 29 saves, while Bobby Ryan and defenseman Sheldon Souray scored less than 2½ minutes apart in the second period for Anaheim, who have won 16 straight at home against Calgary.</p><p>Ryan Getzlaf notched his 500th NHL point on the same day he signed an eight-year, $66m contract extension.</p><p>Ottawa's Jakob Silfverberg broke a tie with 4:41 left to give the Senators a 3-2 win over the New York Rangers.</p><p>Zack Smith and Patrick Wiercioch scored in the first period for the Senators, who improved to a surprising 12-1-1 record in their past 14 visits to Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Rick Nash and Brad Richards scored in the opening period, but the Rangers had a season-best, four-game winning streak broken.</p><p>Nashville's Colin Wilson had a career-high two goals and two assists, as the Predators thrashed the Edmonton Oilers 6-0 to snap a three-game skid.</p><p>Winnipeg's Dustin Byfuglien scored with 40.5 seconds left in overtime to give the Jets a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405310713|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|54ffe3ea01126138c091388e6389b1b2c7a8eb06 -->",
