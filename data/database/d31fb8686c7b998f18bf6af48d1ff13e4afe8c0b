        "body":"<p>A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.vg247.com/2013/10/04/steam-machine-prototype-details-specs-posted-by-valve/\">Steam Machine prototype details, specs posted by Valve | VG247</a></h2><p>Valve has released some tech specs for its proposed Steam Machine living room PC:</p><blockquote><p>GPU: some units with NVidia Titan, some GTX780, some GTX760, and some GTX660<br />CPU: some boxes with Intel : i7-4770, some i5-4570, and some i3<br />RAM: 16GB DDR3-1600 (CPU), 3GB DDR5 (GPU)<br />Storage: 1TB/8GB Hybrid SSHD<br />Power Supply: Internal 450w 80Plus Gold<br />Dimensions: approx. 12 x 12.4 x 2.9 in high</p><p>\"As a hardware platform, the Steam ecosystem will change over time, so any upgrades will be at each user's discretion,\" wrote the firm's Greg Cooomer. \"In the future we'll talk about how Steam will help customers understand the differences between machines, hardware strengths and weaknesses, and upgrade decisions. \"</p></blockquote><p>You can find out more via <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse#announcements/detail/2145128928746175450\">Greg's post on the Steam forum</a>.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/state-of-simcity\">The state of SimCity | SimCity</a></h2><p>Yes, EA and Maxis are still dealing with the fallout from the disastrous SimCity launch – and may be ready to provide what many fans of the series have been waiting for:</p><blockquote><p>Maxis Emeryville studio MD Patrick Buechner confirmed in a blog post that the developer is actively exploring the possibility, which has been called for by fans ever since the game made its troubled arrival earlier this year.</p><p>\"Right now we have a team specifically focused on exploring the possibility of an offline mode,\" Buechner stated. \"I can't make any promises on when we will have more information, but we know this is something that many of our players have been asking for.</p><p>\"While the server connectivity issues are behind us, we would like to give our players the ability to play even if they choose not to connect. An offline mode would have the additional benefit of providing room to the modding community to experiment without interfering or breaking the multiplayer experience.\"</p></blockquote><p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/state-of-simcity\">Patrick's blog post in full</a>.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-03-gaming-risks-a-repeat-of-1983-crash-report\">Gaming risks a repeat of 1983 crash - Report | GamesIndustry International</a></h2><p>In 1983, an over-abundance of competitive hardware and too many awful third-party software titles led to the great video game crash., when the industry really looked as though it call fall apart – at least in the States where they didn't have the wonder of the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro computers. Now one analyst thinks we're heading for another dip:</p><blockquote><p>The marketing push for next month's Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launches is beginning to ramp up, but not everyone is sold on the new consoles just yet. In a new report prepared by Superdata and released by Digital River, the research firm warned that the market for consoles is already crowded, with 79 percent of gamers already owning a console, and that group having an average of 2.6 consoles each. The report was based in part on a March survey of 1,105 respondents.</p><p>\"Industry veterans will remember the crash of 1983, when the games market was saturated with hardware devices,\" the report states. \"Today, the industry runs a similar risk, as [with] a higher-than-ever console installed base, consumers may be resistant to adding more hardware to their living rooms.\"</p></blockquote><p>Apparently, consumers will gravitate to multipurpose hardware, perhaps like Valve's Steam Machine. Although, of course, both Sony and Microsoft are keen to stress the multipurpose capabilities of their platforms. I don't think any of us have to panic just yet (will that be my Michael Fish moment?)</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/431236/features/50-insane-details-you-probably-missed-in-gta-v/\">50 insane details you probably missed in GTA V | CVG UK</a></h2><p>CVG has been digging around behind the Grand Theft Auto V sofa cushions to find little facts and sights you may not have noticed. Some of them are pretty sillY:</p><blockquote><p>If you attack Michael's house with an RPG, he'll text you and tell you to stop firing rockets at it.</p></blockquote><p>Some are nice little extra features:</p><blockquote><p>You can share music tracks you hear on the radio with friends on Rockstar Social Club.</p></blockquote><p>Definitely worth a flick through if you're stuck at work and can't play for a few hours...</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-04-state-of-decay-sells-one-million-copies\">State of Decay sells one million copies | Eurogamer.net</a></h2><p>Good news for indie developer Undead Labs; it's open world zombie adventure has sold one million copies:</p><blockquote><p>This is taking into account both XBLA sales as well as those who've purchased the incomplete Steam version on Early Access. By triple A accounts, one million may not sound like much, but for a smallish Seattle startup, that's a very healthy number.</p><p>The developer noted that its first DLC, Breakdown, will be available shortly, though no date was given. It then said it will give away five copies of it to random users who share a fond State of Decay related memory on the bottom of this blog post. The Breakdown add-on will contain a story-less Sandbox mode, new weapons, and new \"Hero\" NPCs that can carry items and do a better job of protecting players.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.edge-online.com/features/in-the-click-of-it-the-last-generation/\">In The Click Of It: the last generation | Features | Edge Online</a></h2><p>Veteran game designer Clint Hocking explains why he's not excited by the next-gen consoles – they're not sufficiently different from the old ones:</p><blockquote><p>Sure, I can have better graphics, but the graphics on current-generation consoles are amazing enough. Sure, I can potentially buy games more easily through more robust online stores, but I'm not really constrained by an inability to buy a game at a store, so what does an online store offer me? And while I am looking forward to crossplatform compatibility and being able to engage with certain games on the couch or on the bus, this is all possible on current-gen hardware. Why do I need a new console?</p><p>When I lie back and stare at the ceiling and try to imagine the experience that I think will typify the next generation of gaming, I see something completely different to what the next-generation consoles are offering.</p><p>I imagine that some time before the upcoming console generation ends, I will walk into my house and pick up a controller. The controller will detect that it has been moved and it will connect to my television and to the phone in my pocket. I will browse through the games that are on my phone (which is now my console) and I will select one and play it using my controller. Full HD and 7.1 audio will stream from my pocket to my television. And I won't be playing Angry Birds for the iPhone 3G either, I'll be playing GTAV.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting thoughts from the co-creator of ambitious titles like Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Far Cry 2.</p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:gdngames\">Press Start at Pinboard</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198875|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|ddff08b992cb4d9daa2b4550c6cd35285bb5a55d -->",

        "body":"<p>Revisiting the nadir of <em>Star Wars</em> lore for its latest game may seem like a risk for Rovio, but it's no surprise that <a href=\"http://www.rovio.com/en/our-work/games/view/62/angry-birds-star-wars-ii\" title=\"\"><strong>Angry Birds Star Wars II</strong></a> (Windows Phone 8, 79p) is more fun than the prequel trilogy upon which it is based.</p><p>Following a familiar pattern of good guy-based birds v evil empire-infused pigs, there are now new characters to try, such as Jar Jar Binks and his ever-useful tongue. The ability to buy different characters and thrust them into action dilutes the challenge somewhat, but fresh levels and power-ups are always welcome in the enduringly popular series. There's also the introduction of <em>Skylander</em>-type toys that are scanned into the phone to unlock fresh avian friends, an interesting sign of where Rovio is heading.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.10tons.com/Game/trouserheart.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Trouserheart</strong></a> (iOS, £1.99, 10tons) is an altogether more original experience, putting you in control of a king who has had his trousers pilfered by some wicked goblins. What follows is an entertaining hack'n'slash adventure, with randomly generated levels that offer lots of action and treasure to be gathered. Don't let the blocky, cartoon style visuals mislead you – this is a challenging, witty title that deserves success.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418951837|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|74deeb3be2fffe04d44750084201432b4c3f6eb6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Such is the nature of the annually updated sports franchise that any change to a successful formula is likely to promote debate. In <em>Fifa 14</em>, the talking point is Precision Control. A new gameplay system based around player momentum, it makes it much more difficult to perform a major change of direction, resulting in player movement feeling more realistic – yet a little less responsive – and quite different from <em>Fifa 13</em>. Ball retention and dribbling are more challenging, requiring players to use passing and off-the-ball movement to create space. While initially jarring to the <em>Fifa</em> stalwart, it soon promotes a more considered, strategic approach to the game.</p><p>Elsewhere, the new shooting mechanic impresses, adding realistic mid-air movement to shots, making for some spectacular finishes. But while gameplay changes feel largely positive, others do not. The new menu system feels cumbersome and irritatingly slow, and matches can be subject to occasional stuttering and slowdown.</p><p>Those expecting major evolution will be disappointed; <em>Fifa 14</em>'s changes are hardly radical – and sometimes unwelcome – but its range of game options is unrivalled. With Career mode, online (including a new 2v2 co-op Seasons mode) and the wonderful Ultimate Team, it remains the most feature-rich football game on the market.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418946037|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|ab751a5b44b60293df8dc0c71e5d15774de76fd0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Valve, the enigmatic developers of the epoch-making Half-Life series and multiplayer stalwarts Dota 2 and  Team Fortress 2, has made a series of living room-friendly announcements. Firstly, it plans to release a free operating system based on its online games shop Steam, which will run on <strong>Steam Machines</strong>: consoles that run Steam OS and are designed to sit under your TV rather than via a PC or Mac. While Valve itself won't be making them, a number of hardware manufacturers have said their Steam consoles will be available next year. Their other piece of news was the Steam controller, which has two round track pads rather than thumb-sticks, as well as a central, clickable touch pad reminiscent of PlayStation 4's. Although it looks a bit peculiar, Valve's unblemished history of awesomeness suggests that it's likely to work pretty well.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418984440|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|62ce8fc97a5e1e7191fc868a8fc868df3eca0fce -->",

Taking its cues from Silent Hill, your experience is a mix of hallucination and reality that never goes out of its way to explain which is which. This leads to a constant feeling of dread, emphasised by the haunting soundtrack and deliberately lo-fi 2D.

Everything else is in order though, from its likable, kinetic-feeling combat, to the succession of subterranean dungeons, which feel meagre compared with other outings in the series. Regarded at the time as a bit of a rush job (almost unheard of for Nintendo), its resplendent HD makeover leaves the game practically unaltered, just giving it a shiny new exterior. Although not the finest Zelda game, this is still a sweet slice of exploration and puzzle solving.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418981711|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|98c0ee0a456981587a0f240ea816f915943ad553 -->",

        "headline":"F1 2013 – review",
        "body":"<p>For Formula One fans, F1 2013 is an item of rare desirability – but strangely, that is due more to Codemasters' skill at negotiating political minefields, rather than its programming prowess. That's because the latest iteration of its expensively licensed game charting the pinnacle of motorsport contains something that motorsport enthusiasts have wanted for years: retro cars, drivers and tracks.</p><p>The corporate nature of the F1 world dictates that, in any game depicting it, every sponsor's logo, advertising hoarding and so on has to be authentic, which is why it's physically impossible for developers to get their games out before a chunk of each season has passed. So adding cars of yore to the equation adds another level of licensing complexity, but with consummate skill (and, one suspects, infinite patience), Codemasters has somehow managed to pull off that juggling act. Boot up F1 2013, negotiate the Young Driver Test (which dictates the car you will be allowed to pilot in Career mode), and you will find a new menu item entitled F1 Classics.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970774'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806500137/F1-2013-5-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 5' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Pretend you're Nigel Mansell <br /></h2><p>Not since 2006's F1 Championship Edition (a PS3 exclusive, from a time when Sony held the Formula One games licence) has a Formula One game contained any cars from days gone by, and even then, you could only drive them in time-trials. But in F1 2013, you can choose from five cars from the 1980s – ravening beasts with turbocharged engines, some of which even have the swiftly outlawed ground-effect skirts that suck them to the tarmac.</p><p>There are two tracks – Brands Hatch and Jerez, in their 1980s configurations, both of which have long since fallen off the Formula One calendar. And you can take on, or pretend to be, legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Emerson Fittipaldi and many more. You can also buy a Classic Edition of the game, which adds six cars from the 1990s, drivers including Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine and David Coulthard, and the tracks Imola and Estoril (that 1990s pack will also be available as downloadable content).</p><p>The return of retro to a Formula One game is very timely, given the wave of nostalgia currently sweeping the sport in the wake of the film Rush, chronicling the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. And F1 2013 adds to the wistfulness by applying a sepia visual filter to the F1 Classics section (which you can turn off if you want), and drafting in the inimitable Murray Walker for commentary duties.</p><p>But it's the cars that are the stars – they are incredibly powerful and, because they are turbocharged, that power is delivered in sudden, screaming high-rev bursts that can easily catch you out. The non ground-effect cars have laughably low amounts of grip compared to their modern counterparts, and they generally offer a much greater test of your innate driving skills. In F1 Classics, you can race split-screen against a mate, undertake full Grands Prix and get stuck into a selection of scenarios taken from real races from the era.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970775'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806384261/F1-2013-3-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Back to the present day <br /></h2><p>As far as the modern-day component of F1 2013 is concerned, Codemasters has opted for tweaking rather than wholesale alterations. One of the first aspects you notice is that this year's tyre-disintegration controversy looms large: in the Young Driver Test, for example, you have to lap the Yas Marina track on a set of badly worn tyres, setting your tyre strategy before a race is key, and the manner in which the tyres degrade both visually and in terms of feel is striking.</p><p>As in the real races, you can be left as a grip-less sitting duck in the latter stages if you pitted too early. You have to be very careful about how quickly you can get on the throttle after exiting corners, and smoothness is rewarded. The AI-controlled drivers, too, have noticeably upped their game so, if your driving skills are less than God-like, you might want to set the game on its easiest difficulty setting, before turning off some of the more annoying and intrusive driver aids, like the braking assist.</p><p>Structurally, F1 2013 is much the same as last year's model, although the pit view, from which you begin each session of a Grand Prix, has been simplified and cleaned up somewhat, and there's a new (and gratifyingly logical) Hub screen detailing your career.</p><p>The scenarios, in which you're plunged into various race situations with specific goals, have been arranged more logically to reflect the different stages of a driver's career, and there are more of them, constituting a pretty meaty slice of gaming on their own.</p><p>Season Challenge — in which you have 10 races to notch a win, working your way up to a top car by setting a rival driver for each race, whose drive you acquire if you beat him – is back, too. And head-to-head races against your mates can be enacted split-screen or via system link.</p><p>The multiplayer is more or less exactly the same as last year's, with one notable and very welcome difference: this year, it's free, whereas last year, you had to pay for a VIP pass. As before, up to 16 humans can race each other, with the rest of the grid filled with AI-powered bots.</p><p>F1 2013 looks fantastic – it will be fascinating to see what Codemasters can do on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One – and sounds and feels utterly authentic. However, it isn't without flaws. The feedback you get from your pit crew is minimal, to say the least, and sometimes reacts to proceedings much more slowly than you do; it would also be nice if it included more praise (such as when you lead a race despite being at the helm of a Force India) rather than censuring you for marginal corner-cutting escapades. The AI drivers also seem able to get away with transgressions that you would be penalised for, and loading times, although much shorter than in any of Codemasters' F1 games, are still noticeable.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970776'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806458047/F1-2013-4-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 4' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>However, F1 2013 oozes quality, fully living up to the illustrious nature of its official licence, and the presence of the 1980s and 1990s cars, drivers and tracks gives motorsport nuts a real reason to buy it – which is much-needed for such an annual franchise. If the retro Grand Prix action is what appeals, we would recommend the Classic Edition, but either version provides racing enthusiasts with a truly meaty and authentic experience in which they can lose themselves for months.<br />.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418968324|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|39afba184a4f24300a742ed396feec425c50b7d8 -->",

        "headline":"Should gamers be accountable for in-game war crimes?",
        "body":"<p>Don't shoot the civilians. This is something military games have been telling us for many years. I remember my first go on Taito's explosive arcade title Operation Wolf – it was the late-80s and this frenzied blast-'em-up, with its jungle environment and hostage rescue missions, was clearly gunning for a generation of Rambo II fanatics. It even let you control the action with an Uzi-style sub-machine gun bolted to the cabinet. But what it wouldn't let you do was kill passing civilians: collateral damage of this sort took a big chunk off your health bar. </p><p>Of course, this was really more about mechanics than ethics: players were being tested on their reactions and visual awareness, and failure meant a reduction in game time rather than a few moments' reflection on innocent victims. These days, if you accidentally (or otherwise) shoot a civilian or comrade in a military shooter, you'll probably get a 'mission failed' message and a one-way trip back to the last checkpoint. What you won't get is a military tribunal and a dishonorable discharge. </p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24318061\">a BBC news report</a> earlier this week, however, Francois Senechaud from the International Committee of the Red Cross told a reporter that, due to the increasing verisimilitude between first-person shooters and real-life combat, games should start to abide by the international laws of armed conflict. &quot;Video games that represent contemporary battlefields are very close to reality,&quot; he said. &quot;It's difficult to make out the difference between real footage and the footage you get from video games.&quot;</p><p>What the Red Cross wants to see then is the player being penalised for carrying out such actions as willfully killing civilians or torturing enemy combatants, both of which are punishable under international law. <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/film/2013/09-28-ihl-video-games.htm\">A Q&amp;A document posted on the organisation's website</a> explains:</p><blockquote><p>The ICRC is suggesting that as in real life, these games should include virtual consequences for people's actions and decisions. Gamers should be rewarded for respecting the law of armed conflict and there should be virtual penalties for serious violations of the law of armed conflict, in other words war crimes. </p></blockquote><p>And importantly it adds:</p><blockquote><p>Our intention is not to spoil player's enjoyment by for example, interrupting the game with pop-up messages listing legal provisions or lecturing gamers on the law of armed conflict. We would like to see the law of armed conflict integrated into the games so that players have a realistic experience and deal first-hand with the dilemmas facing real combatants on real battlefields. </p></blockquote><p>The ICRC says it is now working directly with the developers of modern military simulations and the BBC report contains an interview with Marek Spanel of Bohemia Interactive, creator of the Arma series, who claims the studio's games will now be implementing the suggestions.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001569\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380798855863/Arma-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Arma 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Arma 2: The Red Cross believes that as video games become ever more realistic, they should also adhere to international rules of warfare.</figcaption></figure><h2>Feasibility studied</h2><p>The question is, how feasible are the ICRC's aims and will players really take on board the lessons about humanitarian law? It is difficult to imagine a Call of Duty or Battlefield title in which shooting a civilian leads to a mission where the player is detained in a military prison for several months before being tried and sentenced. But then if the consequences of illegal operations are subsumed into the gameplay mechanics – i.e. shoot civilian, fail mission – the player will usually read these instances in ludic terms. Within the action, civilians are are not people who deserve humane treatment, they're walking fail states to be avoided in the pursuit of success. </p><p>We do often see the consequences of player actions being threaded into gameplay, but this tends to be in the adventure genre. Titles like Fable, Heavy Rain, Walking Dead and Dishonored all provide different paths for a player depending on their moral decisions during play – and because the action is combined with a confirming narrative element, the meaning and weight of transgression can come through. The idea of an action adventure that put the player into a series of defining humanitarian situations allowing the story to spin-off in the player's moral direction is interesting – but it's hugely unlikely in the action cinema world of the modern shooter.</p><p>Furthermore, the ICRC statement makes clear that it is not interested in other genres – it is concentrating on combat games that depict and concentrate on contemporary battlefields. So how can players be made accountable for their actions beyond simple gameplay devices? How do you move beyond the simple message, &quot;Mission failed, you have broken international law and will spend the next ten years in prison. Re-start mission?&quot; </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001567\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793379957/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfa-008.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: shootouts often occur in areas where civilians are in the line of fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>Moral dilemmas</h2><p>There have been two stand-out examples. In Modern Warfare 2's notorious No Russian mission a US soldier is embedded with a Russian terrorist organisation and must take part in a mass killing at an airport. Success means blending in with the terror squad, and it's up to the player to decide whether that extends as far as shooting civilians. The sequence was brave, but also clumsily handled, exploitative and incongruous; however, it did place the player in a position where many felt they genuinely had to weigh up their moral proclivities with the demands of the gameplay mission.</p><p>Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development's criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals. In a scene reminiscent of the Black Hawk Down incident, they must decide whether to shoot their way out or face death. Although actually, it's more interesting than that, because the first shot fired sends the group fleeing – something the player won't know until they commit to pulling the trigger. And vitally, those who point their gun in the air before firing get the same dispersal effect without casualties. In the heat of the game, facing a furious mob, many players will take the lethal option – but they sure as hell think about it. It is these sorts of split-second decisions that really suggest something about the complexities of combat.</p><p>But then, of course, these examples offer more than a mere punishment mechanic – which is what the ICRC seems to be asking for. If all transgressions automatically lead to failure, it's a zero-sum game that invites only functional thinking. Players need to be able to live with the consequences of actions in more subtle ways. In both Heavy Rain and Walking Dead, players face lethal moral decisions that don't end the game, or even have ludic consequences for the player, but yet play on the mind and colour the experience. The game may be over but the choices remain – and by ending chapter of Waking Dead with a guide to the actions of other players, developer Telltale Games cleverly addresses and confronts the process.</p><p>Often the most affecting moments are those hidden in momentary or supplementary features. The ability to name characters in titles like Cannon Fodder and XCOM, for example, provided a heightened level of emotional attachment for many players. The way we learn little snippets about the lives of the characters passing through our border gates in Papers, Please. The way that mobile phone hacking lets us see into the personal problems of potential targets in Watch Dogs. In games, moral depth is much more about humanisation than it is about punishment. The latter is too intricately tied in with atavistic gameplay systems for us to extrapolate anything deeper than game over.</p><p>We are, though, surely heading into an era where gamers will have to take greater responsibility for their actions – if only because the visual fidelity will be there to splatter our violent failings across the screen in HD detail. In Operation Wolf, accidentally machine gunning a glitching sprite that vaguely resembled a non-military human could be easily divorced from the reality of armed conflict. In Battlefield 5 or Call of Duty 27, it may not be so simple to dismiss the sight of a photo-realistic person lying in the dust, eyes rolling back, limbs spasming. </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001568\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793814696/Battlefield-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Battlefield 4 – the siege of Shanghai level</figcaption></figure><p>I don't even think that's what the ICRC wants – it doesn't want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate. It wants developers to say, in this mission you must fly an armed drone over a school where terrorists are known to be hiding, and you must decide whether to open fire. And it wants players to understand the consequences of such an action, not just in terms of the score or progress, but in terms of the real world of warfare – the one that all military games reflect and fetishise.<br />.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418869488|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|f90a3e7370664e673dd63b6a1390ba717dad1919 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Not a lot has changed in the latest instalment, but even with clumsy new match biometrics, it's still, somehow, better than PES. By <strong>Ben Griffin</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Fifa 14 – review",
        "body":"<p>\"Come quick!\" the PES fan shouts, as if peering from his bedroom window and seeing fresh snow. \"It's back!\" It happens every year – this hoped for resurgence. Later, brash words are rescinded and shoelaces gazed at. PES 2014 earned a deserved four stars in our recent review, but against what a hopeful community tells you, this is not the year PES beats Fifa. That's the curious thing about their great rivalry. PES continually improves and Fifa doesn't – at least to the naked eye. Yet, Fifa is, still, better.</p><p>After a decade of juggling between the two, I've settled on this analogy: PES is chess, Fifa is draughts. Both have their virtues, but draughts works better as a video game, more immediate, easier on beginners, and generally more fun. Fifa 14's new Pure Shot mechanic fits all three criteria in one. Essentially, efforts on goal have a greater tendency to dip, bend and rise, giving them ferocious unpredictability. It's difficult not to feel a flutter in your gut as the ball falls to your long distance specialist on the edge of the box.</p><p>Thunderous volleys, first-time belters and off-balance lashes — they look natural and feel right, thanks to improved ball physics and a slew of new contextual animations.</p><p>Keep in mind, long shots aren't a magic button. They're actually less frequent, and this is thanks to EA's other new back-of-the-box feature – Precision Movement. So-called 'stepbased location' is a technical triumph, players now weightily planting feet when running and pushing off from pivots, but it's an awkward fumble of a feature in practice.</p><p>For one, players take ages to get going. The effectiveness of a simple turn, bread and butter of football, has been neutralised in the maelstrom of 22 men on the pitch, all dizzyingly scrambling for ball possession and losing it just as quickly. In Fifa 14, thanks to clumsy new biomechanics, space is a truly rare commodity.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418447820'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/27/1380274884890/Fifa-14-3-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Attacking is revitalised by Pure Shot, but Precision Movement clogs midfield and defence. Matches aren't ruined by any means – rather, they're simply thrown off in a second. Problem is, in a high-tempo game like Fifa, with its tight margins for error and all-important timing, that second counts. However slight, the complexion is altered.</p><p>Off the pitch, things could have been equally clogged if not for revitalised Windows 8-style menus that cleanly whizz you through skill games (navigate imposing gauntlets of yellow plastic men and knock down evil towers of cardboard boxes), a creation centre (create and share custom players, teams and tournaments) and market (buy vintage kits, virtual pro boosts and cocky celebrations with coins earned online).</p><p>Most substantial is Ultimate Team, which, EA is keen to tell us, hosts 3.5m matches daily. No huge improvements here, but it does streamline the previously arduous organisation of online single matches and seasons, and the ability to change kit numbers and set-piece takers in addition is community wish fulfilment. New chemistry styles are welcome, too. There are a variety of them; you can, for instance, apply a defensive chemistry style to a defender in order to boost their performance. It's contributes fresh complexity towards chasing the rainbow of your dream team.</p><p>Likewise, the career sees only minor changes. It's still split between player and manager – both options let you control the entire team, but the former can use their virtual pro and skip all the management gubbins. It still serves up emails from the board and transfer gossip on the wire to keep you involved (Soldado isn't happy at Spurs. Oh). And it's still meshed together by an agonisingly slow calendar system that ticks through each day like the life cycle of a star. Transfers have at least had a facelift, though.</p><p>Along with more hurdles to jump for a signature, such as promising players match time and checking they're nice and marginalised at their current squad before prowling, there's a new global scouting network. Here you'll employ up to six scouts of varying knowhow, set parameters, and send them off. You can find and nurture an unknown prodigy in the youth team or get beads on established names, learning cost and wage demands so you can make a bid that won't be laughingly dismissed. As a result, wheeling, dealing, and finally securing that hot prospect is much more rewarding.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418447821'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/27/1380274813476/Fifa-14-2-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Online, aside from two v two co-op seasons, Fifa 14 doesn't have any big new mode to show off. But that's OK because they've just about got the entire sport covered anyway, from user-made pro clubs with customisable kits, to 10-game seasons where players fight each other for promotion, to full on 11 v 11 matches. Any one could easily see you through to next season.</p><p>The game's difference-maker is entirely on the pitch – that new movement system. In multiplayer especially, where the absence of an all-knowing AI sees imperfect humans make repeated mistakes, it leads to slightly clumsier, boggier, slower matches. All the same, the change is only incremental, and doesn't ruin the game by any means.</p><p>You know this by now – things in EA Sports land either get slightly better or slightly worse, and whatever side of the dial the year's instalment ticks into, what you're getting remains the same: the most fun and feature-rich sports games on the planet.

        "trailText":"<p>Activision and developer Infinity Ward have revealed a host of key new aspects of the latest instalment of the CoD franchise. By <strong>Steve Boxer</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Call of Duty Ghosts: hands-on and new details",
        "body":"<p>There's a palpable sense of excitement among the gaming community: we're about to enter a near-unprecedented period in the lead-up to Christmas, in which two new consoles will arrive, backed up by a glittering array of blockbusting games.</p><p>Arguably the biggest (at least, now that we've all got our copies of GTA V) is Call of Duty: Ghosts. Appropriately, given its name, but annoyingly for gamers, CoD: Ghosts has remained somewhat elusive and shadowy since it was unveiled at the E3 Show in June (<a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/technology/gamesblog/2013/aug/14/call-of-duty-ghosts-multiplayer-revealed\">although a multiplayer event did map out that side of the game on a macro level</a>). However, publisher Activision and developer Infinity Ward have begun to redress that balance, with an event in the City of London, in which we were treated to a fleshing out of details, as well as hands-on multiplay on the Xbox One. This is what we discovered.</p><h2>Single-player campaign <br /></h2><p>OK, we know that these days CoD games are supposed to be all about the multi-play, but there are still plenty of traditionalists around who like to play it solo, and now that we've seen some of it, we're convinced that, for a CoD game, Ghosts' single-player campaign should be refreshingly original and innovative.</p><p>&quot;At E3, we mentioned that in Ghosts, America has been rocked by an attack – because of this mass event, it is no longer a superpower,&quot; explains Infinity Ward's community manager, Tina Palacios. &quot;Resources are very scarce, America is in disarray, and even the military is crippled at this point. Our characters are growing up in this world and we fast-forward about 10 years; that's where our story really kicks off.</p><p>&quot;You play as Logan, alongside your brother Hesh, throughout the whole campaign. This is a first for us – we've never really given an origin story to our characters before, but we really wanted to go for it. But not only that; we want to focus on a single squad: the Ghosts.</p><p>&quot;You and your brother heard about the Ghosts growing up, but you never really got to meet them, because it's very important to them that they hide their identity – that's why you see the masks and the face-paint. The reason for that is that they pose the biggest threat to the Federation, which is our new superpower enemy. They are very small in numbers, so it's crucial for them to fight behind enemy lines without being seen. You eventually come across them and join up.&quot;</p><p>Alongside you and your brother, you'll also have a dog called Riley who, Palacios asserts, will operate as a proper character in the game. He has the ability to detect enemies, scout with a camera on his back and fight viciously on your behalf. Palacios gives a nice little insight into the development process when she says: &quot;We didn't really know what we would do with Riley until we met Navy SEALs and their dogs. They brought them into the studio, and we saw the gear they wear, and got to see that they are serious members of the squad.&quot;</p><p>As part of the demonstration, we were shown what may well be the opening mission of the campaign – a scene-setter, it prefaces the entrance of Logan, Hesh and Riley, but explains what happened to America. It takes place on a space station, where the American military is about to test-fire a new weapon it has created called ODIN – the Orbital Defence Initiative – which contains giants rods that can be dropped onto Earth, triggering the same sort of blast as a nuclear device, but without the radiation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the space-station is overrun by the Federation, and despite some nifty shooting in zero-gravity conditions, you're unable to prevent them from dropping ODIN's deadly payload on every major American city – all of which are reduced to rubble. Thisnicely sets up the game's premise in which you're cast as a kind of American guerrilla. CoD: Ghosts certainly won't have to fight any allegations of glorifying the Stars and Stripes, and its storyline should be much more interesting as a result. Although we can't say how substantial it will be – Palacios steadfastly refused to provide even a ballpark play-through time.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-418313732\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/26/1380189405636/COD-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"COD 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Squads – somewhere between solo and multiplay<br /></h2><p>Another aspect of Ghosts which is completely new to the Call of Duty franchise is a new gameplay mode called Squads. Previously, Infinity Ward had rather nebulously described it as existing somewhere between single-play and multiplay – essentially playing like multiplay, but with liberal use of AI-controlled bots.</p><p>Palacios fleshed out the concept considerably: &quot;Squads is separate from single-player and multiplayer. You'll create a squad of six of your favourite soldiers, and you can play with them, by yourself, against bots, with your favourite soldiers as team-mates. Or you can play with up to five of your friends as squads online. Or even pit your squad against other squads one-on-one.</p><p>&quot;Squads has various modes. In Squad v Squad, you can compete against other players one-on-one. In Solo, you pick your five favourite soldiers against a squad of bots; that replicated the full multiplayer experience. There's a four-player co-op mode called Safeguard, inspired by Survival in Modern Warfare 3. You face waves of enemies, and get all the toys, like Perks and so on. And in Squad Assault mode, you and your friends play in an epic six-player co-op match against an offline player squad.&quot;</p><p>Palacios was keen to emphasise that Squads is designed to be accessible to those who find CoD's full-blown multiplayer side intimidatingly challenging. Indeed, it sounds like a great means of learning the skills required to survive in multiplay against gentler bots. She confirmed that you will earn XP in Squads, although more slowly than in full-blown multiplay, and that one key aspect of Squads is setting each of your soldiers' load-outs very carefully, as that will effectively determine their fighting personality.</p><h2>Multiplay: coming into focus<br /></h2><p>The multiplayer side of CoD: Ghosts is the game's most crucial element – it will have to not just satisfy but enthuse a massive and unbelievably fanatical tribe of gamers. Infinity Ward has been nailing multiplay since CoD 2, though, so it knows what its audience likes. Clearly, the starting point for Ghosts' multiplay was that of Modern Warfare 3, and Palacios confirmed that feedback from the MW3 community has coloured the developer's approach to CoD: Ghosts.</p><h2>Strikes and Killstreaks<br /></h2><p>Palacios went into the key aspects of Strikes and Killstreaks in some detail: &quot;We've brought back the traditional Strike packages from MW3, but the key thing to remember here is that we really took on a lot of user feedback before creating these.</p><p>&quot;In the Support package in MW3, a lot of people were upset with us for including the stealth bomber, because it gave people a lot of kills and it was a support Killstreak, so you didn't necessarily lose your Killstreaks when you died. So we took that out, and you won't see Killstreaks like that in this package. Essentially, your Killstreaks are about helping your team-mates in a unique way. The support strike package today is Satcom. It's our UAV system. You throw it on the ground, so the first one you get gives you eyes-on for your team-mates. By the fourth one you get, you'll get a directional UAV and really help out your team.</p><p>&quot;We also have the MAWS: it's a laser and a rocket launcher. I know that sounds like something you can use really quickly in front of other opponents, but the key thing to remember is that when you shoot off these rockets, they're going to split off and then come back together, so you have to have really good aim to use them well.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-418313734\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/26/1380188052023/COD-Ghosts-2-008.jpg\" alt=\"COD Ghosts 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>There's no tilting at windmills in Cod: Ghosts. The Federation and online foes give you plenty to get your MAWS around.</figcaption></figure><h2>Perks<br /></h2><p>Palacios also outlined some of Ghosts' Perks, after explaining that the Perks system has been subtly altered so that you're no longer forced to choose Perks from different categories, although they are still categorised so that you can get an idea of what they do. The intention, she says, is to let people play how they want.</p><p>&quot;Dead-eye is one of most expensive: when you get consecutive kills, you do more damage next time you shoot your weapon. There are guys in the studio who love to run around with shotguns, and by the time they get to their third kill, people are dying pretty quickly. Takedown prevents enemies from seeing where I killed their team-mates – if you don't want people rushing you when you've killed someone, this is really useful.&quot;</p><h2>Clan Wars and Blitz<br /></h2><p>Palacios added some crucial detail to something that until now had remained mysterious: Clan Wars, the so-called meta-game that comes as part of the free CoD app for iOS, Windows Phone and Android. Clan Wars games will take place over a period of two weeks; every fortnight, clans will be able to pair up against each other and enact an epic battle over territory. The longer you hold your territory, the more points you get, and the team with the most points at the end of the fortnight will win the war. There will be certain objects in the game that you will only be able to get by winning Clan Wars.</p><p>And she also unveiled a hitherto unmentioned multiplayer mode: &quot;Blitz divides the map into two different territories, with a portal on each side. The object of the game is to get your team through the enemy portal to score a point, then it will send you back to your side.&quot;</p><h2>Hands-on with multiplayer<br /></h2><p>After the presentation, we got some hands-on experience of CoD: Ghosts' multiplayer – thrillingly, on the Xbox One. Our overall impression was that CoD fans are unlikely to be disappointed, to say the least. CoD: Ghosts looks magnificent on the Xbox One, but the only real difference between the current-gen and next-gen versions are the graphics, so the fact that perhaps the most impressive aspect was the new-found fluidity of movement bodes well for those intending to play the game on their existing hardware.</p><p>It wasn't long before players began mastering the knee-slide move, which lets you lurch forward onto your stomach while firing, ending up completely prone and therefore presenting a much smaller target to your opponent. That move requires confidence that you will take out your enemy before they can strafe, though, adding a couple of new techniques to the CoD multiplayer mix.</p><p>We also fell foul of the Maniacs a few times – a Killstreak that turns you into a Juggernaut with a sprint and a knife. They are absolutely deadly but, Palacios explained, have been balanced by having their health regeneration removed.</p><p>The maps we tried out, too, were stunning: one took place in a convincingly snowy environment, combining caves and the interiors of buildings. They seemed both easy to learn and surprisingly spacious.</p><p>Call of Duty is, arguably, the biggest franchise in the games world – Rockstar Games, with Grand Theft Auto, may dispute that, but GTA only appears once every four or five years whereas CoD, with its twin developers is a hardy annual. The bad news for the nay-sayers who feel that a franchise as long-running as CoD must surely start to lose its appeal sometime soon is that, perhaps energised by the advent of the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, Infinity Ward seems to come out with the freshest and most ambitious Call of Duty for years. If anything, the CoD juggernaut is picking up speed, rather than juddering to a halt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418307982|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|a7e4d1d4339649d81b13c803f8b22645e455e1e1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The long-awaited online version of Grand Theft Auto Online was released on Tuesday, replete with the much-anticipated connectivity problems that had long been feared.</p><p>In line with other major online game releases, Grand Theft Auto V's online launch was plagued by server errors and connectivity problems.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-launches-server-issues\">The console version of GTA V was released on 17 September</a> and is required to play the online version, which gives the classic game a multiplayer mode.</p><p>Shortly after its online launch, gamers said they were unable to access the game because of server issues, the game failing to load and disconnection issues. In response, the company created a webpage on its support site dedicated to providing updates on issues.</p><p>\"We apologize for any inconvenience, and thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this,\" GTA maker Rockstar Games <a href=\"http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200426246\">said on its support site</a>. It is also offering a service for users to receive automatic email notifications whenever an update is posted on the site. The company did not respond to requests for comment. </p><p>The console version of GTA made $1bn in its first three days on sale, according to the game's publisher Take-Two. Video game experts said that the problems were to be expected because of the game's popularity.  </p><p>\"It seems they've been trying to scale their hardware quickly to cope with the expected requirements based on their incredible sales,\" Simon Barratt of UK studio Four Door Lemon told the Guardian.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-grand-theft-auto-v-live\">Even if they were using an existing server infrastructure provider</a> such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure – which is unlikely and their wording suggests not – they would probably need to be adding to their cloud server farms to support the numbers they're expecting.\" </p><p>Last week, Rockstar also warned that its servers might not be able to handle GTA's popularity. </p><p>\"One thing we are already aware of, and are trying to alleviate as fast as we can, is the unanticipated additional pressure on the servers due to a significantly higher number of players than we were anticipating at this point.</p><p>\"We are working around the clock to buy and add more servers, but this increased scale is only going to make the first few days even more temperamental than such things usually are.\"</p><p>Rockstar's problems echo those felt by the release of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo 3 and Maxis's Sim City, which were overwhelmed on their launch days.</p><p>Maxis's network collapsed when the newest edition of SimCity launched in March 2013, and the hashtag #error37 started trending in May 2012 when Diablo 3 customers faced that error message and were unable to play the game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418786107|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|2e4f6b390f6e850ec99f415ef7fd0e5d499fd04e -->",

        "body":"<p>Put simply, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is a British creation that says big things about America. While <em>GTA IV</em> was a classic New York immigrant's tale, <em>GTA V</em> crosses coasts to comment on the hectic and the hollow that is Los Angeles, on the city's fascination with surface and its industries of image and light. So long as we're listening, anyway – otherwise it's a familiar, technically astounding playground of male power fantasies and might.</p><p>Mirroring the frantic intersections of LA, <em>GTA V</em> has three heroes with entwined stories that players can leap between at any time. This banishes the occasional complaint of past games – becoming mired in a particular area or mission – and is part of a wider move towards playability. <em>GTA V</em> is confident enough in its pleasures to dissolve the structures that once propped them up. The huge map, for instance, is explorable all at once and not in instalments, while mid-mission checkpoints remove lengthy restarts.</p><p>The result efficiently speeds players into the game's action, and even better, improves the action. Missions are more varied, mechanics more robust and even divergent tasks – trying yoga – feel purposefully embedded into the story. But for all the effort spent on<em> GTA V</em>'s story-led experience, the greatest thrill is breaking away from it. The world captures the texture and sound of California with uncanny precision, providing the tools to race through, fly over or thoroughly destroy it as one sees fit.</p><p>This clash of sophistication and savagery is central to the contradictory heart of <em>GTA</em>. Its radio stations deliver a cruel, precise mimicry of media fear-mongering even as you lightheartedly torture terrorism suspects. In a way, this is a key characteristic – <em>GTA</em> demands to be irreverent on its own terms. But the expertise and brilliance of the best game of the series by far has enough of weight to say without the needless noise of outrage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417770937|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|8794189516195254c55c157481faee66e7f71f66 -->",

        "body":"<p>So it's been a bad week. On Monday, I had to switch off Classic FM when it played Wagner, since he was an antisemite. Then I burned my copy of <em>The Hunger Games</em>, because it's all about children killing one another for entertainment. Finally, I threw my television out of the window because <em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Walter White is a drug-dealing psychopath, and the show's fans love him for it.</p><p>OK, I didn't do any of that, because that would be absurd. If we rejected every creative work that is in some way &quot;problematic&quot;, the canonical cupboard would be bare. So why are so many people I meet so shocked that, as a woman and, whisper it, a feminist, I enjoy playing <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>?</p><p>The GTA series certainly isn't female-friendly. Loved by teenagers, it has become one itself: yet in the 16 years of its existence, it hasn't once offered players the chance to experience its sprawling scenery and high-octane thrills as a female character. In the latest instalment, released last week, women are once again pushed to the margins.</p><p>You can rescue one whose car has broken down, spy on another having sex with her boyfriend while she checks her phone, and, of course, visit the obligatory strip club and &quot;make it rain&quot; bank notes. There aren't any female characters to root for, be impressed by, or even fall in love with. It was the same in the last game: women were there to nag you, or be bribed – whether with fancy dinners or cold, hard cash – into having sex with you. Women are GTA's wallpaper.</p><p>Given all this – and the way the series has allowed you to visit a prostitute, then kill her to get your money back – perhaps the horrified reactions shouldn't be surprising. When I went on<em> Channel 4 News </em>to talk about <em>GTA</em>, Jon Snow asked: &quot;Aren't you worried, as a woman, that the whole thing isn't a bit creepy?&quot;</p><p>Well, yes, it is creepy, but worried isn't the right word. I'm bored, more than anything, as well as irritated that another generation of young players isn't being offered something more exciting than this. &quot;The medium has grown up, and now the GTA franchise is a giant juggernaut that appears to be punching down instead of up,&quot; says female games journalist Leigh Alexander. &quot;I think that's why its problematic elements rankle – not because I'm 'offended', but because it seems lazy, repetitious. I'm not 'offended' that I can't play as a woman; I'm disappointed at the missed opportunity.&quot;</p><p>That feeling isn't unique to video games. Playing the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, I realised I feel about it the way I feel about Martin Amis novels. I admire the cold brilliance, the execution, the imagination: but I will never love that world, and I never feel inclined to return to it once the story is over. In both <em>London Fields</em> and <em>GTA</em>'s Los Santos there's no place for me; I can visit, but I'll never feel welcome.</p><p>What distinguishes games from books, or films, is that the dodgy sexual politics and wanton violence of one is used as a stick to bash them all. Partly, this is down to the old hangover of the idea that games are for children, when the average age of a player is now 30. Then there's the idea that games are a &quot;niche&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; pursuit, even though<em> GTA V </em>took an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/19/grand-theft-auto-5-first-day-record\" title=\"\">&pound;500m worldwide in its first day on sale</a>. Finally, there's the spectre of violence. Games are an easy scapegoat for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/anders-breivik-call-of-duty\" title=\"\">horrific acts committed by those who happen to play them</a>, despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2013/sep/19/neuroscience-psychology\" title=\"\">lack of evidence of any causal link</a>.</p><p>An unpleasant feedback loop has developed: between the sneers and the moral panics, gamers have become hyper-sensitive to criticism. We have a chip on our shoulders the exact shape of a tabloid front page. And that makes it hard to articulate the idea that while the medium is thrilling, exciting and innovative, individual titles can too often be derivative, nasty and riddled with stereotypes.</p><p>The <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series is certainly guilty on the last two counts. The novelist and critic Tom Bissell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/mar/21/tom-bissell-video-game-cocaine-addiction\" title=\"\">has described the protagonist's Jewish lawyer</a> in 2002's <em>Vice City</em> as &quot;an anti-Semitic parody of an anti-Semitic parody&quot;, while in the new game one of the main character's daughters has a tattoo that reads &quot;skank&quot;, and one mission involves you helping a paparazzo capture a starlet's &quot;low-hanging muff&quot;.</p><p>That's enough to make me sigh, but not give up. My own red line in games is the unthinking use of rape, whether as a &quot;character building&quot; incident for female protagonists (but, strangely, not for male ones) or as an &quot;edgy&quot; version of a sex scene. In the run-up to <em>GTA V</em>'s release, a disturbing forum posting went viral. &quot;I want to have the opportunity to kidnap a woman, hostage her, put her in my basement and rape her every day, listen to her crying, watching her tears,&quot; it read.</p><p>Now, I would flat out refuse to play a game where you could do that, regardless of whether it was forced on me by the storyline, or merely an option in sandbox play. So am I being a hypocrite running people over in my virtual car without a pang of remorse? I don't think so. &quot;In games the aim is, usually, to beat your opponent before they beat you,&quot; says Simon Parkin, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/grand-theft-auto-v-how-evil-should-a-video-game-allow-you-to-be.html\" title=\"\">who writes for the <em>New Yorker</em></a>. &quot;It's a game of reactions, speed and quick planning based upon principles of fairness – or of the protagonist overwhelming the odds. This is in no way analogous to rape, which is all about an assertion of power in an unequal equation. If you're threatened with rape, you don't respond in kind.&quot;</p><p>For the same reason, I am uncomfortable about <em>GTA</em>'s torture scene, where you extract information, along with a tooth, with a pair of pliers. Enjoying violence when it's not a &quot;fair fight&quot; feels very different to being quicker on the draw than an armed enemy.</p><p>This is where game fans' defensiveness becomes a problem. It takes a brave critic to slaughter a sacred cow – particularly by pointing out sexism in games – because the backlash can be so fierce. Anita Sarkeesian, who appealed for crowdfunding to make a web series about female characters, became the subject of an internet hate campaign as a result. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter\" title=\"\">On the #1reasonwhy hashtag</a>, hundreds of women vented about why they were such rarities in the game industry: they felt their work was dismissed, their opinions were ignored, and some were subject to sexual harassment at conventions.</p><p>That is not a message that many gamers want to hear, nor do they want to confront the fact that this is a mature enough medium to face proper scrutiny. When Carolyn Petit of GameSpot called <em>GTA V</em> <a href=\"http://uk.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-v/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review-6414475/\" title=\"\">&quot;politically muddled and profoundly misogynistic&quot;, </a>the review attracted more than 20,000 comments, many of them viciously hostile. &quot;GameSpot shouldn't have given GTA V to a woman to review … their input is pointless,&quot; was one of the most printable.</p><p>Yet Petit was incredibly positive overall about the title, giving it 9 out of 10, and she tells me that the <em>GTA</em> series is one of her all-time favourites. &quot;I'm much more engaged by a game that makes meanings I find problematic than by a game that doesn't attempt to mean much of anything at all,&quot; she says. &quot;If creators genuinely want to put out works that celebrate misogyny, they are free to do so, and we are free to talk about their work critically.&quot;</p><p>She's right: the conversation needs to be more sophisticated. Without decrying game violence as a symptom of our moral decline, we need to explore how that violence is presented, and what it means within the game world. The same goes for misogyny.</p><p>So yes, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is offensive – deliberately so, because controversy sells. Yes, it is &quot;problematic&quot; in its treatment of gender, race and sexuality. And yes, it is also an incredible technical and artistic accomplishment. In other words, it is just like any other milestone in any other creative field. Fans and detractors alike need to stop the special treatment.</p><p></p><p><em>Helen Lewis is deputy editor of the New Statesman</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417889369|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|8b2632f3484219f1a871cbe1d4f5259ae17a3ec9 -->",

        "body":"<p>He was known as \"the godfather of the console\", building the Japanese firm Nintendo from a playing cards manufacturer into one of the world's most powerful computer games businesses. Now the gaming industry is paying tribute to the company's former president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who diedon Thursday  at 85.</p><p>For a generation of gamers, Yamauchi's Nintendo represented a golden era of mainstream gaming, dominated by classic titles like Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda and Metroid. In the early 90s, the company's mascot Mario, a moustachioed Italian plumber, became one of the world's most popular animated characters. A 1990 survey found he was more recognisable to American children than Mickey Mouse.</p><p>Yamauchi installed the company's central doctrine – that gameplay is always more important than technology. It is the philosophy that would continue to define the company after his retirement, leading to the hugely successful Nintendo Wii, which introduced a motion control device for gaming but relied on cheap off-the-shelf hardware, unlike its expensive rivals, the PS3 and Xbox 360.</p><p>The company said it was \"in mourning today from the sad loss of the former Nintendo president Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, who sadly passed away this morning.\"</p><p>Yamauchi took over the company after his grandfather, the previous president, suffered a stroke. He transformed Nintendo from a little-known manufacturer of Japanese <em>hanafuda</em> playing cards into the most powerful force in the global video game industry, and stood as president of the company from 1949 to 2002.</p><p>Yamauchi had a reputation for spotting talent and at a Nintendo factory he picked out engineer Gunpei Yokoi, who would eventually go on to develop the Game Boy handheld console. Yokoi had built a robotic arm for his own amusement, but Yamauchi saw the potential to mass-market the device as a product, kickstarting Nintendo's expansion into the toy and gadget market.</p><p>Noting the boom in video games, Yamauchi later asked young artist Shigeru Miyamoto to create an arcade machine that would appeal to the growing global audience. The result was Donkey Kong, a massive success in its own right and the origin of the Mario character.</p><p>The long-standing president would go on to oversee the company's entry into the home console business, which it dominated in the 80s and early 90s with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) consoles. At its height, Nintendo enjoyed a 90% share of the console hardware market.</p><p>Importantly, in the wake of the video game crash in 1983, where a glut of mediocre third-party releases for consoles such as the Atari VCS effectively devalued the whole industry, Yamauchi oversaw the introduction of Nintendo's \"seal of quality\" programme, which restricted the numbers of developers that could release games on its systems.</p><p>He intrinsically understood the importance of good games and talented game designers, rather than engineers and hi-tech hardware. In 2004, he told one Japanese newspaper: \"Cutting-edge technologies and multiple functions do not necessarily lead to more fun. The excessively hardware-oriented way of thinking is totally wrong, but manufacturers are just throwing money at developing higher-performance hardware.\"</p><p></p><p>A shrewd businessman, Yamauchi ensured that Nintendo remained debt-free throughout his long period in charge. Unlike the consoles marketed by most of his competitors, Nintendo machines were always sold at a profit rather than as loss-leaders for software sales; he also ensured that game publishers paid in advance for the manufacturing of game carts, removing the risk for his own company. In this way, he helped to revolutionise the way the games industry functioned.</p><p></p><p>Although Yamauchi stepped down in 2002 to be replaced by current president Satoru Iwata, he remained a major shareholder and retained an advisory role.</p><p>\"Hiroshi Yamauchi transformed a run-of the-mill trading card company into an entertainment empire in video games,\" said Ian Livingstone, co-founder of Games Workshop and life president of games developer Eidos. \"He understood the social value of play, and the economic potential of electronic gaming. Most importantly, he steered Nintendo on its own course and was unconcerned by the actions of his competitors. He was a true visionary.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417792824|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|1fa9d0a7945ac6c5b203c353f49fc154a5a81421 -->",

        "body":"<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 has smashed its way into the record books with the largest ever first-day takings for a video game.</p><p>The latest instalment of the British-produced franchise took more than $800m (£498m) worldwide on Tuesday, underlining the appeal of the medium as Sony and Microsoft prepare to launch a new generation of consoles.</p><p>Billed as one of the most ambitious and expensive games ever created, the California-based crime epic has already more than recouped its $270m development and marketing budget.</p><p>Sales dwarf the previous $500m record set in 2012 by Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and beaten in a single day the $500m in revenue which Grand Theft Auto's fourth instalment generated in its first week nearly five years ago.</p><p>\"The last major Grand Theft Auto title sold just under 13 million [units] in the course of the year. This did that in a day,\" said Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research.</p><p>The success of a game which features mafia bosses, motorcycle gangs, man-eating sharks and cynical movie producers running riot in a fictional town loosely based on Los Angeles, has underlined once again the console's ability to host entertainment franchises more valuable than those produced in Hollywood.</p><p>The biggest ever opening weekend for a feature film was achieved by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011, when it took $480m worldwide at the box office – a fraction of Grand Theft Auto's single day achievement.</p><p>Described by the Guardian's games critic as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\" title=\"\">\"a monstrous parody of modern life\"</a>, the game unleashes the player's inner thug with missions to steal cars and rob banks. It has defied predictions that lavish video game productions will soon be sidelined by a multitude of cheaper and more disposable smartphone apps.</p><p>News that consumers are still prepared to part with £38 for a single title will cheer Sony, which releases Playstation 4 in the United States on 15 November, and its rival Microsoft, whose Xbox One goes on sale a week later.</p><p>\"No one title is an indicator of success of upcoming platforms,\" said David Riley, executive director at market researcher NPD Group. \"You can't say because of GTA the industry would be saved. But it is a boost in the arm of the industry that it has needed for quite a while. We are going to have a great holiday season worldwide.\"</p><p>In August, NPD found US sales of hardware, accessories and software grew year on year for the first time since October 2011, albeit by a modest 1%. But the boost was entirely due to new titles, with sales of consoles down 40%.</p><p>Take-Two chairman and chief executive Strauss Zelnick <a href=\"http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1856046&amp;highlight=\" title=\"\">praised</a> the Edinburgh-based team at Rockstar North which produces the GTA franchise for \"setting the entertainment industry's new standard for creativity, innovation and excellence\". He said in north America alone, 8,300 shops had opened their doors at midnight to make the most of the release.</p><p>Sony said Thursday it expected sales of its new PlayStation 4 console to reach 5 million units this financial year, about 40% more than its third console generated in the same period seven years ago. But smartphones already far outsell consoles, and less complex games like Angry Birds, Candy Crush and Dots are booming.</p><p>\"A lot of kids don't want $40 games any more, they want 40 $1 games,\" Nancy MacIntyre told Bloomberg. A former executive at game studio LucasArts, she now runs a social-gaming network Fingerprint Digital.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417772947|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|8ee670254a5150c141dc4a0a6326743fa7ee8002 -->",

        "headline":"GTA 5 review: a dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life",
        "body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-417432152\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>There has been a particular theory going round for the last year or so, that \"box set\" TV has replaced movies as the preferred form of mass, culturally meaningful entertainment. It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, <em>hints</em> at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.</p><p>Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.</p><p>This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.</p><p>The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychopathic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.</p><h2>On a mission</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558272'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379335926701/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Trevor feels the Heat</figcaption></figure><p>GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.</p><p>To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.</p><h2>Satirical scope</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558273'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336812314/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: sharp-suited Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises \"the realistic art of contemporary killing\".</p><p>This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is dangerous, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.</p><p>Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.</p><h2>Forgivable flaws</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558274'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379334561650/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: there's a lot of driving</figcaption></figure><p>This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a <em>lot</em> of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think \"Ugh, not another car ride\". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call \"the exposition expedition\": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.</p><p>Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.</p><p>Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.</p><h2>Seductive vision</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558275'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336519788/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Los Santos is glitzily superficial</figcaption></figure><p>Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.</p><p>The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout and Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.</p><p>The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your own vehicle spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.</p><h2>Complicity and culpability</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558276'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336675892/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: explosive action</figcaption></figure><p>And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. <strong>[Spoiler]</strong> Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim <strong>[spoiler ends]</strong>. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.</p><p>Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.</p><p>And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, \"you all live in Los Santos now\". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.</p><p><em>Tested on Xbox 360.

The launch of Grand Theft Auto V at midnight on Monday will see long queues snake down high streets at daybreak as the first copies go on sale.</p><p>The video game series is as controversial as it is successful. So far, it has sold more than 100m copies since it was developed in Edinburgh in 1997.</p><p>Players take on the role of a criminal in a fictional US city and rise through the ranks of organised crime with action-adventure and shootouts.</p><p>The latest version – known as GTA V – is the biggest and most ambitious yet, with an imagined world larger than the rest of the series put together, and follows three criminals as they steal, shoot and shop their way through the fictional city of Los Santos.</p><p>It has taken Rockstar – the firm behind it – four years to develop at a cost, according to one analyst, of about $137.5m (£87m) even before you include its marketing budget.</p><p>Rob Crossley, associate editor of gaming news site CVG, predicts that GTA V may sell twice as fast as Call of Duty: Black Ops, which in 2010 became the fastest selling game in the UK with 1.4m copies sold in one day.</p><p>\"Rockstar has reportedly allocated 3m copies for the UK launch,\" he says. \"It's unlikely all will be sold on day one, but it's an astonishing figure nevertheless. Put it this way, that launch allocation accounts for a quarter of all combined Xbox 360 and PS3 owners in the UK.\"</p><p>The central plot revolves around retired bank robber, Michael de Santa, returning to a life of crime with a young protege, Franklin, and his psychotic cohort, Trevor. But the appeal of the game is as much to do with the extracurricular detail. The world of GTA is full of diversions – from shopping malls to strip clubs and sports events, all open to the player.</p><p>\"Fans appreciate the sheer amount of thought that goes into the GTA games,\" says Nick Underdown, founder of fan site Rockstar Resource. \"A lot of the things people are looking forward to don't involve any criminal activity at all – a lot of the fun will come from the racing, parachuting, playing golf or tennis and all the other sports on offer – and it seems like a small thing, but the soundtrack is so important, it plays a massive part in the setting.\"</p><p>GTA V has more than 200 tracks for players to listen to while driving the game's miles of streets and motorways, from country classics to leftfield electronica and chart hits.</p><p>It's a key part of the appeal – the 2002 title GTA: Vice City featured seven CDs of 80s pop, which enhanced the game's narrative homage to that decade's film and TV shows such as Scarface and Miami Vice.</p><p>\"Lots of my customers have told me they've booked the day off to play it,\" says Gareth Rowbotham, owner of the Playtime chain of video game stores in Nottingham, Sheffield and Doncaster. \"I'm not being derogatory, but our customers aren't high-flying ABC1s with two cars and three holidays a year. They're on minimum wage, working 40-50 hours a week. They'll come in, buy GTA and play it for 12 hours straight. It's a way of escaping the banality of normal life.\"</p><p>Jevon Farr, a fan of the series who helps run community site GTAnet.com, explains the game's appeal. \"It's the freedom, the humour, the atmosphere, multiple concurrent protagonists, a gigantic and detailed world map, a dynamic economy, elaborate customisations and a multiplayer mode that becomes self-perpetuating with user-generated content … however, one of our team just said, 'I want to hurl cars down the mountains.'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417384702'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002664335/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg' alt='Grand Theft Auto V' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA V is more than a car game or a shoot-em-up, say industry experts and gamers. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p>For Adam Saltsman, a game designer, it is the sense of a living, dramatic world that gives the game wider cultural significance and appeal. \"The Grand Theft Auto series is the closest thing games have to a prestigious HBO or BBC series – it is like really high-end TV. There is lots of visceral low art – and I do not use that pejoratively, but there's also lots of high art too. The game is very large and very rich, not just geographically, but almost vertically. It has the gangster story and the sandbox stuff, but then it has all these satirical radio stations, and even weirder, deeper jokes and commentary.\"</p><p>Jesper Juul, a video game theorist and author, says the great expectations are down to GTA V being \"better than 99% of the cinema or novels. It is better for giving players a chance to consider what they would do in a fictional world.\"</p><p>The game's co-writer Dan Houser has described it as a satire on Los Angeles, and more specifically a modern Hollywood fading into insignificance in an era of outsourced production. GTA V is filled with failed actors, drug-soaked producers and various hangers-on. Every aspect of the society it creates was researched, mostly through first-hand interviews.</p><p>\"We just wandered around LA,\" said Houser. \"Our researchers did an incredible job of finding us some of the strangest people: retired cops, former FBI agents, entrepreneurs who'd retired on a massive fund of money at 28, people who specialised in knowing the underworld of LA – and everyone in between. We'd just hang out with them for a few days to see what happened.\"</p><p>GTA V is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. There are rumours an enhanced version will be available on the next-generation consoles, which launch in November. But many already see GTA V as a \"next generation\" game. It hints at a future in which games become more like virtual holidays, a form of all-encompassing escapism.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417148362|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|18dff307e1938cf2989396c9bc04a9c1effb16c7 -->",

Bristling with high-energy verbs – spin, roll, streak and ricochet – Sega's video game mascot-in-waiting made his rival Super Mario's clutch of moves seem sedentary by comparison. Leave MegaDrive Sonic unprompted on screen and, after a few seconds, he turns to glare out of the screen, tapping an irritable foot as if you're wasting his time, keeping him from his mission. Spinning at 200 fierce rotations per minute, Sonic was immediately a source of renewed vigour and direction for Sega, a company whose first decade in the video game industry had been characterised by mediocrity.</p><p>Indeed, at the time of Sonic's debut, Sega's rival Nintendo laid claim to 92% of the video game market share.</p><p>At the time Takashi Iizuka was a student at the Tokyo Denki university, studying electrical engineering. Iizuka's peers began to apply for jobs at Sony, Hitachi and the other Japanese electronics giants to where the university's orderly graduates traditionally progressed. \"When I was a kid I wanted to become a manga artist,\" he says. \"At university I learned to put those dreams aside. My parents encouraged me to look at more realistic options. Everyone was expected to go on to work for an electronics maker. It was almost a set path. But in my final year I decided to revisit those dreams and to focus on what I really wanted to do: create something fun and enjoyable.\"</p><p>That summer Iizuka played Sonic the Hedgehog. \"I couldn't believe the game and the technology on which it ran. It was a marvel,\" he says. Iizuka applied to Sega, much to his parents' chagrin (\"Sega wasn't well known at the time. It took a while for my family to come around\") and, in 1992 joined the company and the character, that would come to define his life.</p><p>Until the launch of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's approach to making video games was to develop cheap and quickly. Mark Cerny, the architect of Sony's forthcoming PlayStation 4, worked for Sega in Japan at the time, a company he joined after working for Atari. He recalls: \"Moving from Atari to Sega was like night and day. At Atari it was all about creativity, if the concept wasn't 100% original you weren't allowed to make it. Non-original ideas were thrown out. But Sega was about shovelling the titles out of the door.\"</p><p>Most of Sega's titles at the time were built within a strict three-month deadline, with a single programmer and one artist. \"They made 40 games in this way,\" says Cerny.</p><p>\"But by my judgment only two were really worth playing. Sega didn't get out of that philosophy till Sonic the Hedgehog, where the president decided to put three people on the project for 10 months. They ended up having five people for 13 months. It was Sega's first million seller.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog was designed by one of Sega's artists, Masato Oshima, who worked to a specific brief to come up with an appealing mascot character. \"At the time I had never been outside Japan,\" he says, \"so the experience of moving to America in my first working year was entirely daunting.\" And while the first game was a system-selling success for Sega, it was still unclear whether Sega had, in their restless hedgehog, a mascot of Super Mario's power and appeal. \"We had no concept that the character and series would become what it is today,\" says lizuka. \"For me it was one of those crucial chances we take in life; one of the ones that change everything.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 vastly outsold its predecessor and Iizuka continued to shadow Naka in America, working on two more sequels. But in 1995 the pair returned to Japan to begin work on a new game for Sega's 32-bit system, the Saturn. Iizuka was promoted to lead designer and, while Nights into Dreams shared visual similarities with the Sonic titles, it was a dreamy relative, Sonic through a glass darkly. \"It was the first time I'd worked on a new IP that wasn't Sonic,\" says Iizuka. \"We knew we wanted to create a game that was based on flying, not running, but there were immense challenges doing so within the confines of a so-called 'platform game'. How do you make a platform game without any platforms? We went back and forth for the longest time trying to get the design right.\"</p><p>During these years Yuji Naka led the so-called Sonic Team through a string of inventive hits, from Burning Rangers to Phantasy Star Online. But, contrary to perception, Sonic Team itself doesn't exist. \"There was never a set team as such,\" explains Iizuka. \"Whatever group of people was working on one of Naka's games at the time were referred to as the Sonic Team. But Naka had a keen idea of what Sonic Team's games should stand for.\"</p><p>Naka left Sega in 2006 and stewardship for Sonic Team passed to lizuka. What is the Sonic team essence for Iizuka, the quiddity of Naka's approach to game design and execution? \"One of the most important lessons that Naka taught me was the importance of game feel,\" he says. \"What a video game feels like in the hands is essential. That was there from the very beginning, and still is a core value today. Also, Naka was adamant that we should never be making copies of other games. He would always strive to create new things. That has stuck with me and become my goal.\"</p><p>Iizuka has another chance to prove his adherence to Naka's rules with the launch of Sonic Lost World on Nintendo's Wii U next month. \"For me it's a rethink of all that a platform game is and can be,\" says lizuka. \"One of the main things with Sonic games is speed: we wanted to make this more a controllable game, where that speed can be harnessed in a more effective way than perhaps in the past. It's a case of trying to marry the speed of the earlier Sonic games with the action of the more recent ones.</p><p>It's difficult to keep the classic Sonic feel. But we've kept the way that he moves, and that sense of speed.\"</p><p>One key challenge for the Sonic the Hedgehog series in moving from the 2D graphics of the 16-bit era to contemporary 3D is the increase in costs associated with a character who can fly through scenery quicker than most. \"It's true that, when you feature a speed-based character you require far longer levels,\" says lizuka. That immediately means the production is longer and development is more costly. Crafting background details keeps the costs up. We've tried to keep it to a manageable level while keeping the feel and fidelity of the game world. It's a balancing act, but one that we continue to improve at.\"</p><p>However, lizuka rejects the idea that Sonic has significantly changed over the past 22 years. He says: \"The surroundings have changed. The supporting characters and enemies have changed. But Sonic himself retains the same character as he did in the beginning. I've lived with Sonic ever since then. He's been a part of my life. He keeps me young.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417231376|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|3e8b88bf2166a7aae25a14490c4ef2004924df97 -->",

After a year of pre-publicity and a five-year wait since GTA IV, the latest instalment in Rockstar's gangland opus is almost upon us. Featuring a game world larger than than any other title in the series, hours of cinematic sequences and a truly epic cast of crazed characters, Grand Theft Auto V has a scale and ambition that exceeds most triple A development on the current consoles. Indeed, people are already calling GTA V the first next-generation video game.</p><p>Last October I travelled to New York to get one of the first demos of the game. While there, I met Dan Houser, co-founder of Rockstar and co-writer of the Grand Theft Auto titles. There, I asked him about the process of building a new GTA from scratch, and how the different parts of Rockstar North combine to allow its complicated interplay of story, side-missions and sand box freedom. </p><p>In the first part of that interview, he tells us about the creative process, about how the characters are written and how they are brought to life; and about the complexities of marrying narrative and gameplay in such a large adventure. </p><p>Part two follows on Monday.</p><p><strong>How do you begin a Grand Theft Auto game? Are you always thinking of the next one?</strong></p><p>We don't see it as a production line in that way. We have a lot of guys on the team – it's not like a freelance unit that gets taken down and put back together again, so of course, when it finishes we do need to roll on to something <em>fairly</em> quickly, but there's a certain amount of downtime. Not till the very dying embers of this will we give the next one a moment's thought. And that's if we're going to do another one – we always said that if we couldn't think of something interesting to do then we'd stop – for this or Red Dead, but particularly for GTA. As much as anything they are a response to what we think went well or what we could do better or what could be different from the last one.</p><p><strong>GTA IV felt like a real change in direction – or at least a maturation – for the series…</strong></p><p>After San Andreas, with the move to high definition, we really wanted it to be focused and very tight – apart from anything else, we couldn't do any more than that – because of the complexities of just making an HD game at the time. This time, we wanted to make something very broad in scope because we have a bit more understanding of the tech and we wanted to use that to put a big landscape in there and lots of outdoor aspects to it. That was the first sliver of a concept.</p><p><strong>And how do things usually progress after the first kernel of an idea? How do you decide where to go next?</strong></p><p>I think it's Sam [Houser] and Aaron Garbut who decide… they'll certainly discuss it with Leslie [Benzies, producer], myself and a few other people, but it's between the two of them – Aaron especially because he has to plan it and build it. Sam gets really heavily involved in that early stage of where it's going to go. For GTA V, they were keen on LA for a bunch of reasons but in particular because we hadn't done it properly. We made San Andreas, but LA was only a tiny bit of that – it was a section of three small villages linked together by some cool countryside – so we felt that we could do something that was very different. Having a developer in San Diego and business in LA all the time, we all go over there at different points throughout the year – it's a city we know very well and feel we haven't done justice to. We felt we could do something very fresh and new there. So the very first decision is the place. LA gives us the countryside around Southern California, which is spectacular and good for the kind of game we wanted to make. You get the mountains, the desert – that seemed very appealing.</p><p><strong>And what do you think about next?</strong></p><p>On previous games, the next thing has been the character and the reason why they're in the world and what we're going to do with them in the world. That's the normal process – and alongside that, a feature set of things we want to do differently and things we want to improve. This time, we thought about Niko and John Marston: they're kind of single-player odysseys for want of a better word. They were so epic in scope. We thought, what can we do with one player that's better than that? Who, as Franklin, are you most likely to want to follow or believe or not believe? That process began to set the story in motion and the narrative evolved out of the characters' past and their future. As soon as we had those characters, that side of the game came together fairly organically – as it should do. Every time we get the lead character and what their reasoning in the world is, if we're doing a good job and it's the right thing, the rest of it… I mean, maybe the ending needs some work and some of the things driving it forward – but the overall feel of the story should feel very organic to us. If we get that feeling, we know we've got a story that people are going to find compelling.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-417225384\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002289829/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Theft Auto V\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto V's appeal, and that of the rest of the series, is as much to do with the extracurricular detail that creates a world full of diversions, say fans. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Do you feel receptive to influences during this period? The first few GTA games felt cinematic. It felt like you were channeling movie culture – has that changed?</strong></p><p>I think we tried to move away from that, quite consciously, after San Andreas. That was for a bunch of reasons, but I suppose primarily we felt that we wanted to say something that was not speaking about movies but about the wider media world. And also, when you're making something about the 80s, you want to talk about 80s media as much as anything else, but with something about 2008 or 2013, I believe we're as equipped to say that as much as anyone else. It no longer felt relevant to us to [pastiche movies]. We'd had a good experience doing that but it was time to move on and do our own thing.</p><p><strong>Where do you think games sit in terms of modern culture?</strong></p><p>I don't know, you tell me? Where do you think they sit?</p><p><strong>Well, it seems to me that because they are interactive and the way we live now is very fast and hyper social, they better reflect our lives than linear media. I think they're the natural story-telling medium of this century. How about you?</strong></p><p>I think that's a very interesting idea and I hadn't really thought about it in those terms. I wouldn't necessarily have the confidence to think in those terms – but <em>you</em> should as a games journalist because it's up to people like you to push those theories… It's up to <em>us</em> to make the best stuff we can make – it's not necessarily up to us to shout from the rooftops about how clever we are, how progressive we are, or how sophisticated we are. It's our place to make stuff that's as good as it can be.</p><p>And I suppose we're not really seeing the limitations in games… movies have limitations as a storytelling medium and so do games, but the limitations are different. Our job is to be aware of the limitations, find the strengths, and work toward those strengths. And I think as we get more experiences and the medium gets more mature, we do a better job of achieving that. That's not to say that games are perfect or flawless, it's still a very, very young medium.</p><p>Look at the evolution of our games from GTA 2 to GTA 3, through Red Dead. I'm not saying we do a good, bad or indifferent job, I'm just saying there's a clear evolution in technique, if not in talent – the technique at least has clearly moved on. In terms of what we're doing, our understanding, and the technology needed to support that understanding, the way that story and missions and off-mission stuff in the open world games all interplay – it's getting more sophisticated, that's definitely the case. We are hopefully treading ground that hasn't been trodden before and finding a better way of treading it each time. And I don't just necessarily mean as writers, but as technicians in terms of things like how we use the cameras to get you in and out of cut-scenes, the seamless interrelation of cut-scenes and the game, things like that. We've made so much progression – we've got better tech and better technicians working on it.</p><p><strong>One thing that really stands out is the quality of the cut-scenes, the acting, the interplay of the characters on screen – it feels a lot more naturalistic now...</strong></p><p>It used to be like watching youth theatre! The most you could possibly get in the world at one time was three people. It felt so amateurish, but we used to have to push it into the game and hope we could make it just about okay. Now, it's not <em>like</em> they're shooting a big budget Hollywood movie, they are. It's just that there's more of it and they're chopping it into smaller pieces. It's incredible to watch it going on, I feel like a complete spare part. I watch our incredibly talented director, Rod Edge, who's been with us since GTA IV, and occasionally give him a note. But fundamentally, it's their territory, I stay in the background. It's phenomenal what they're doing there – we have a mo-cap set-up that only Weta and James Cameron can match.</p><p><strong>And this is about full performance capture these days?</strong></p><p>We gave up the phrase voice actor in 2008 and we haven't used it since. We don't have voice actors anymore, because they're the same as the mo-cap actors. This is something we discovered by chance. We used to use famous actors, partly because the mo-cap process was so cumbersome and we could only have three people anyway. But on San Andreas, a guy, a sort of second-rate comedian, got offended by the script and stormed out of the recording studio, shouting, &quot;I'm not doing this, it's offensive.&quot; We just thought, well your agent did some great research there.</p><p>We were wondering who we'd get to do it and I was watching the videos of the mo-cap sessions and I was like, 'the guy who's doing it on set is really good, why don't we just use him?' And we did, and the proximity of the performance to the animation was much fresher than we were getting anywhere else. We did Bully straightaway afterwards and that was using kids - there weren't enough famous kids to do it anyway, so we used the same actors and it really brought it to life.</p><p>It's all based on a sound stage now. It's the same performance for voice and body. You do it all in one capture. Any one character might have a range of actors, you might have a stunt man doing some moves or a weapons specialist doing others, but for us, we're forgetting about the concept of an actor and just capturing the person who feels alive in this world. When we get it all feeling seamless, like we did with John Marston, we've done a good job.</p><p><strong>How do you build your characters for GTA? Do you take inspiration from people you know?</strong></p><p>I hope not! It's a sort of collaborative effort, there's not really a formula. Sometimes you see someone, someone on TV or walking down the street, or you meet someone and you think, 'There's an aspect of this person that's so ridiculous, I just want to capture that'. Or one of the other guys will go, 'I just met this maniac who walks like <em>this</em>!' – and the character will evolve from there. The first thing we speak about might actually get dropped, but it will be the atmosphere, some veneer of over-confidence or some rabid insecurity beneath it – that's what we'll wrap a character around. Or sometimes it will be one of us watching a terrifying documentary about a serial killer, and there will be one thing about him…</p><p><strong>So they're not people you know?</strong></p><p>The only one that I would confess to being fully autobiographical to me was this horrible character in Bully who was based on a kid I went to school with. The rest of them, they're all composites from me, from Sam and a bunch of other guys coming up with ideas. Then it's a question of getting the look right. But then once it's written, it's about the combination of animating, game design and acting.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about this collaborative process early in a GTA game?</strong></p><p>So me, Rupert Humphries and Imran Sarwar, one of the main designers, will sit around early in the game, talking about stuff, then Sam, Aaron and Leslie will look at it and sign off on it or offer feedback on it. But it doesn't really matter what we put down on the page, we might imagine certain characters are going to be very strong, and they're not, and others start out okay and turn out fantastic. It's all combined with Mike Kane, who's the chief character designer, and his guys. It's also the actors and Rod and the mo-cap guys bringing these character to life – everyone has input.</p><p>The idea, the page, is one thing, but the end result is often miles away. I think that's a strength rather than a weakness. Sometimes, a character will come back from the first round of mo-cap and you'll go, 'Oh, that's so wrong', and we'll say, 'Get rid of it and do it again'. But usually, they'll come up with something that's different from what we were thinking of – and much better. If we've cast a good actor and they really attack it, they'll help find a direction for it. We have a fairly low attrition rate on that stuff. But getting it to life is definitely a group effort. At all stages. Cameras, different techniques for different characters… there are lots of little tricks to bring it to life and make characters memorable – even though you're only with them a very short amount of time sometimes.</p><p><strong>Do you think about the meaning of the game in the early stages? Do you look to convey specific messages?</strong></p><p>Because of the nature of games, this combination of narrative and freeform experience, they can give you an experience that is very different from what someone else discerns – it can mean different things, which I think is their greatest strength as an immersive medium. We're very hands off in that regard, the authorial presence <em>should</em> be hands off in terms of determining interpretation, otherwise it's not remotely sophisticated. But I'm not saying <em>we </em>are sophisticated!</p><p><strong>You talk about collaboration a lot – it seems very important at Rockstar. Are you constantly having to rewrite narrative based on feedback from the game designers?</strong></p><p>Well… we chop it up. We have an overview that gets turned into a game design and a game flow and the missions. We do bits of it, I'll do some on one mission, the others will do some – it's very easy to fix bits that way. We're not precious about it... well, we're precious at the end – is it any good?</p><p>But it's only occasionally that we'll have real problems We have a couple of game designers with us all the time while we write, so we're not working against game design. It used to be back in the day that there was a bit more of a structural break between game design and story writing and we've really worked hard to get rid of that so we all feel like we're equally invested in it. There shouldn't be this big space: the story needs this and the game designers need that. Hopefully, if we've planned it all together, we should all feel one and the same, we shouldn't feel like separate departments. When it comes to actually writing the exact dialogue for within the body of the mission, the writer and the designer sit together and go through it line by line by line. But even before that, it should feel collaborative all the way along. The conflicts are usually: 'This idea looked great on paper but for whatever reason it aint working,' so we all have to agree on replacing it.</p><p><strong>Do you have creative flashpoints?</strong></p><p>Not really, it doesn't really work like that. The flash points are these: this bit's needed for the story, but it's not working in terms of gameplay – the mission is not fun, it needs to go. We always have missions that get cut out for whatever reason. We either have to rejig bits of the story to make it all tie together or we have to cut that bit of story onto a different mission. This game is very tightly bound because it has three interconnected stories the whole way along, it's complex. But everyone approaches them in the spirit of, 'How do we fix it?' If we all understand what each bit needs, how do we make it all gel together?</p><p>It's a bit like editing a movie in that you need to get it to a certain length. The tech is better now, it makes it slower to work but you can fix things more easily, you can repurpose bits, throw things away, fix them up again. We've always lost bits – 'Oh it's not making any sense!' – then you just redo one scene and it makes perfect sense. That's just a standard part of the process.</p><p>We pride ourselves on not being too pig-headed internally. Our goal as a company isn't for people to say that Rockstar has got good game design but shit stories, or good stories and shit game design; we want them to say Rockstar make good games. Ideally, they can't think about anything except, 'I love the whole experience'. The goal is to have the whole thing feel indivisible.</p><p><strong>Which is something that games criticism has to catch up with…</strong></p><p>You know, game reviewing, when it sort of breaks down into checklists, you feel like you may as well have made a lawnmower. It feels odd to me. I mean, games <em>are</em> sort of like a machine in some ways, but I still think that's a strange way to think about them. Don't think about the graphics or the music or whatever, just think about the whole. Was the experience engaging? That's what we're going for. We tailor our stories and our mission designs to make this total experience that will feel good alongside the graphics, alongside the physics – it should all feel cohesive, it should feel that the whole world exists and you can't really separate the elements. It's all got to gel together – that's when we think we've been successful.</p><p><strong>Part two on Monday covers the making of Los Santos, the emphasis on male characters and the chances of ever seeing another GTA title set in Britain...</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417198952|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|8245c44300b2372f7a426c6fef9d73969a691444 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ave readers – those of you who bought Total War: Rome II, I salute you! My anticipation for this game could not be contained; the latest in developer Creative Assembly's Total War series, Rome II is also the long-awaited sequel to its most beloved entry and bears no small expectation. In a game about conquest and battles, after all, history offers no finer subject than the Roman empire.</p><p>There are a lot of ways to play Rome II, which may be one of its underlying problems, but the meat of the game is in campaign mode. After an extended prologue, during which you control the Roman empire while crushing some feeble Samnite opposition, the campaign lets you choose from nine starting factions and then try to take over the ancient world. Will you take Hannibal's Carthage to victory, expand relentlessly as one of several Roman families, or rewrite history as the Gauls?</p><p>The campaign map is gigantic, encompassing all of Europe and a decent portion of north Africa, and Rome II divides neatly between overarching management of your territory and up-close engagement on the battlefield. The first is turn-based strategic jostling where you manage provinces, muster armies and compete or co-operate with countless other factions. Each province is a loose collection of four cities, one of which is a capital with walls – which means outlying settlements can be attacked relatively easily, but a faction's home base must be besieged and worn down.</p><p>This aspect of Rome II plays out like Civilization-lite. The previous entry in the Total War series, Shogun II, streamlined its map micromanagement beautifully, but in Rome II there are countless new elements to consider, not all of which are welcome additions.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-416665218\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/6/1378460230788/Total-War-Rome-II-009.jpg\" alt=\"Total War: Rome II\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The colour palette for Rome II scales really badly. On the higher settings it looks outstanding, but as soon as you go lower all of the colour bleeds out. Photograph: Creative Assembly/Sega</figcaption></figure><p>Developing provinces is simple: build up a town's military capabilities and advanced troops can be recruited, or develop its farming and fishing infrastructure to increase your growing empire's food and resources. Alongside this you'll be researching new technologies to enhance your civil and military infrastructure, and this side of Rome II makes a lot of sense.</p><p>But there are further layers. Families within your provinces will cause problems, such as attempting to assassinate their rivals. Rebels will attack undefended towns. A dedicated fishing port might become so unpleasant a place to live that the peasants revolt.</p><p>All of these sound like interesting factors, but their implementation is poor. Take the rebel armies, for example. These spawn randomly and will fixate upon a town and attack it every turn, despite the garrison being easily able to hold them off. As your empire expands you'll be auto-resolving at least five or six of these battles every turn, where the opponent simply has no chance of winning. It's unnecessary busywork.</p><p>The real problem is that Rome II has mechanics that offer the illusion of depth, but come undone in practice. Levelling your armies is one of the worst culprits. Both generals and the troops they command will improve over time, becoming more battle-hardened in a manner of your choosing – calloused warriors, for example, or sly strategists. Watching your neophytes grow into a fearsome force is magical, and I grew remarkably attached to the Stantoninus legion. Then I made a mistake. I took on a fight I shouldn't have, deep in enemy territory, and my carefully husbanded army was almost entirely wiped out.</p><p>This should have been a devastating blow. But then the few survivors made it back to my territory and the army built itself up again, losing none of its experience or traits. The game should have punished me for such a foolish move, but instead after a few turns the dead had been replaced with soldiers of equal quality. So what is the point of this mechanic at all?</p><p>Rome II also has enormous issues with time management; specifically, it has no respect for yours. The gap between ending your turn and taking another is exceptionally long, and gets larger as you expose more of the map in each game. Rome II cycles through every single town that isn't under your control, even if you turn off the option to watch enemy moves, and you have no option but to twiddle your thumbs for 2 to 4 minutes every time and wait for things to resolve. This is especially egregious when consolidating positions – you want to take a few quickfire turns to finish some research, for example, or build your armies back up, but this will take 10 to 15 minutes of basically watching the game crunch numbers.</p><p>By far the worst manifestation of this is in the co-op campaign, a feature I'd been incredibly excited to try out with a fellow Total War nut. The gap between turns here is absolutely ruinous and makes this mode pointless – we soldiered through for about an hour in one game before giving up, decided to have another try after the day-one patch, and that time it crashed after a few turns. This was a headline feature of Rome II, but the implementation is a disaster. For every hour I've spent on this, I'd say about half that time was actually playing the thing.</p><p>Far more troublesome is the legion of technical issues. Frame-rate drops are a constant, and glitchy pathing behaviour is just a rule, but the performance was so bad I abandoned the review build supplied by Creative Assembly and downloaded the full game on release. It was just as terrible. My PC runs Shogun II at ultra settings without any issues but Rome II on medium makes it choke like a dog, and judging by the developer's own forum many others are having the same issues.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-416665219\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/6/1378460628633/Total-War-Rome-II-010.jpg\" alt=\"Total War: Rome II\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>A standout feature is the ability to zoom right in from far above the battlefield to an up-close cinematic camera. Photograph: Creative Assembly/Sega</figcaption></figure><p>Which is why it's such a pity that, when you actually get into the battles and it's running smoothly for once, Rome II gives glimpses of a classic. It's easy to forget that the game's called Total War for a reason, and its gigantic throwdowns not only look the part but deliver substance, too. There's nothing like a late-game Roman army filled with mighty legionaries and cavalry, backed up by ballistae and naval support, crashing into a Carthaginian force of equal size and led by war elephants.</p><p>The detail up-close is extraordinary, but it's the ability to zoom far above the battlefield and command as a disembodied god that feels amazing. An especially nice new touch is an overhead tactical map that can toggled mid-battle, and switching between this to give orders and the up-close cinematic camera simply has no equivalent; it's a breathtaking sweep.</p><p>As with all Total War games the AI is questionable; though it feels generally improved from Shogun II, it's still possible to manipulate computer armies into chasing after one cavalry detachment, or flank opposing archers incredibly easily. There's also the odd detail that doesn't quite fit. I played as the Spartans, for example, and watched with incredulity as they were routed with ease in every battle. Minor as this may seem the Spartans, famously, did not back down – and certainly not after losing a few units.</p><p>It is in multiplayer that Rome II unambiguously shines. Playing against another human opponent is easily the most fun this has to offer, which is why it's such a pity the structure around fights is less advanced than that of Shogun II's clan system – the battles themselves are brilliant, but the lack of persistence is instantly noticeable. With that said the matchmaking does its job, and there is an enormous number of other players.</p><p>That can't save Rome II. Everything is contained in this single fact: my longest campaign, by far, was spent trying to take the Spartans to world domination. While checking a detail about the Spartan units, I realised that they're part of a DLC pack – that is, an extra purchase is required to use Greek factions. This game should never have been released in its current state, yet the makers have hived off &quot;extra&quot; content to be sold on the day of release.</p><p>Rome II feels like an unfinished game. It is a cruel fact that if you pick this up in a Steam sale in six months' time you'll get a much better experience, and the people who were foolish enough to put their faith and money upfront get the worst of it.</p><p>The developers behind Total War: Rome II clearly have enormous talent; but this game as a whole is a failure of project management. So many elements are polished to a shine and yet at no point do they even threaten to come together. And so Rome II comes to depend purely on its battles and the fumes of nostalgia from a game more than a decade old – an inspiration that, in all honesty, it is not fit to be compared to.</p><p>Rome: Total War is one of the most brilliant games I've ever played. Total War: Rome II inverts far more than the name. This does not channel the greatest military empire in history so much as the pale shadow of its ending; a bloated, technically corrupt and unfocused mess.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416656960|2013-10-07T10:21:33Z|606c77c58695295773c9c6dbe87bb2a201368e96 -->",
