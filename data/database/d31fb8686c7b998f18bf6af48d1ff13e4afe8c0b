        "body":"<p>A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.videogamer.com/news/microsoft_not_ready_to_respond_to_xbox_one_720p_complaints.html\">Microsoft not ready to respond to Xbox One 720p complaints</a></h2><p>Yesterday, Call of Duty: Ghosts developer Infinity Ward <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-04-xbox-one-resolutiongate-call-of-duty-ghosts-dev-infinity-ward-responds\">explained to Eurogamer </a>why the new title runs in 1080p HD on PS4 but only 720p on Xbox One. The issue has caused a 'gripping' resolution war among enlightened video game commentators online, all of them in full possession of the technical specs, development kits, extensive programming experience and knowledge of modern industry production techniques needed to make simultaneously informed and enraged proclamations.</p><p>Anyway... Microsoft is not yet ready to talk about what's happened:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft has said that it is not yet ready to respond to criticism leveled at Xbox One over the revelation that two of its major launch titles will only output natively at 720p.</p><p>Responding to a NeoGaf user asking about the chances Albert Penello, Xbox director of product planning, \"will presence us with an apology or concession,\" Penello responded: \"Pretty good, I'd say.\"</p><p>\"I'll be back,\" he added moments later. \"You're right, I should talk about it. But right now, still lots of info to come out. Once the dust settles, and all the information is out there, I'll address my comments.\"</p></blockquote><p>This won't go down well with the online graphics war intelligentsia – because it involves waiting a bit and considering the evidence. </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/436690/gran-turismo-6-to-feature-over-1200-cars-and-100-track-layouts/\">Gran Turismo 6 to feature over 1200 cars and 100 track layouts | CVG UK</a></h2><p>That's pretty much the story in the title – Polyphony Digital is putting seemingly every car on the planet into its next real driving simulator. However, here's an intriguing new feature:</p><blockquote><p>A post-launch update will introduce a new GPS Logger feature. This will use the player's phone or tablet GPS functionality in order to recreate tracks based on daily commutes in the game's Course Maker.</p><p>In the words of Sony's press release:</p><p>\"Drivers will be able to record real GPS data from their own car and then recreate the route as a track in the game. The 'GPS Visualizer' also utilises GPS coordinate data from a real car on the real-life versions of the GT6 circuits. The data can then be imported into GT6 to create a 'virtual' replay image of your laps in the game.\"</p></blockquote><p>That's the sound of a thousand Top Gear fans loosening their shirt collars in flustered excitement.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/steam-machine-prototype-unveiled/0123718\">Steam Machine prototype unveiled | MCV</a></h2><p>Ooh, what will the working version of the  new Valve console look like?</p><blockquote><p>Valve has revealed the prototype design of its upcoming Steam Machine hardware.</p><p>In an <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2022180559_briercolumn04xml.html\">article by the Seattle Times</a> showing off images of the official prototype, Valve designer Greg Coomer reiterated the company's intent to take over the living room with its new hardware -- adding that the PC space's transition to the television set should have taken place years ago.</p><p>\"We think the PC space ought to have been doing this for quite some time,\" Coomer said.</p></blockquote><p>Hey look, it's a big black box!</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://kotaku.com/too-many-choices-of-the-past-gaming-era-werent-choice-1458209319\">Too ​Many Choices Of The Past Gaming Era Weren't Choices At All | Kotaku</a></h2><p>Here's a though-provoking piece from Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton, who argues that most of the current-gen games that appeared to offer moral choices were in fact always manipulating us toward certain outcomes, or not providing us with the tools and systems of a functioning moral universe. He cites Mass Effect:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine: At the end of Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader decides to surprise us all. He stands up behind the Emperor, ready to kill him and save his son Luke Skywalker. Oh, but nope, sorry! He actually can't do that. After a lifetime of evil, Mr. Vader doesn't have the paragon points necessary to do such a thing. He's been evil so long that he can only let his son die, then do whiskey shots with Palpatine while kicking the smoldering corpse.</p><p>That's how the ending of Jedi would've played out in the Mass Effect universe. </p></blockquote><p>I wonder if this will all change in the next generation or if are there inherent game design conventions that limit true moral agency? </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.pentadact.com/2013-11-04-to-hell-and-back-in-spelunky/\">To Hell And Back In Spelunky | Tom Francis</a></h2><p>To Satre, hell was other people, to Spelunky players, hell is a near-mythical location at the base of this fiendish procedurally generated cavern complex. And games-journalist-turned-developer Tom Francis has found it:</p><blockquote><p>Last night I accomplished probably the hardest thing I've ever managed in a video game: going to hell and back in Spelunky. It only took 41 minutes, but it took me hundreds of hours of play – and about 3,000 deaths – to learn how to do those 41 minutes.</p></blockquote><p>This is a great little blogpost (and video) about a wonderfully rich game and the obsession it has inspired in devotees.</p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:gdngames\">Press Start at Pinboard</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421678094|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|e16cd12949c1e9c5386142e93fe6633db83c1fb3 -->",

It doesn't matter which.</p><p>However, this time the driver happened to be an old lady. A sweet old lady who pleaded with me not to hurt her as I pulled her frail body from her seat. That car was probably the only thing that still allowed her some degree of independence, I realised. The insurance company would probably dick her around, too. It might take her months to get the car replaced. And that's if she even had the confidence to return to the wheel at all, which she probably wouldn't.</p><p>Robbing the old lady, even though I knew she was just a lump of pixels, made me feel terrible. What sort of monster had I become? Appalled at myself, I gave her the car back and let her drive away in it.</p><p>I am rubbish at GTA 5. I think I'm just a bit too Guardian for it.</p><p>There have been other instances of this. I've only ever robbed one shop, and that was only when the game made me. I won't do it willingly due to a misguided belief that you should support the local businessman. I routinely get shot dead on missions because I don't like the idea of topping up my health meter with sugary snacks made from processed foods. I'm barely even skimming what the game has to offer, and it's all because I'm a woolly, liberal, cartoon joke.</p><p>This sounds like comic exaggeration, but I promise it isn't. If the game controller's R3 button allowed you to leave an apologetic note on the windscreen of the car you've just accidentally bumped into, then that's how I'd spend 95% of my time.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. When the first top-down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/18/dan-houser-grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">GTA game was released in 1997</a>, I was as recklessly immoral as they come. Back then I'd quite happily flamethrower a line of dancing Hare Krishnas for a giggle. But now that I've grown up into a hand-wringing, left-leaning ninny I've found myself trying to play the game as responsibly as I can. Like someone's mum would.</p><p>Playing GTA Online only makes this worse. The story mode makes you do a number of terrible things but that's fine because you're controlling a fictional character. But online, when I'm controlling a character who looks like me – albeit a skinnier, more attractive version of me – everything changes. For want of a better word, playing GTA Online turns me into a yellowbellied nancypants.</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm alone in being crippled by this sense of social responsibility, too. When you play GTA Online, you can hear everyone else, and in my experience all the other players are either rapping six-year-old French arsonists or middle-aged men who only stop trying to murder me as gratuitously as possible in order to shout swearwords at their newborn babies.</p><p>And yet, despite all this, I'll keep playing. Because the beauty of GTA is that it's set in such a perfectly realised world that nobody ever has to compromise their ideals if they don't want to. There are plenty of other things to do within the game. So let's hear it for GTA 5: the most expensive biking around a mountaintop while listening to Eddie Murphy simulator that there has ever been.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629670|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|cd566d15bfd581e56780acf071ee9e6a0e13ea86 -->",

        "headline":"GTA Online 'stimulus package' to drop this week",
        "body":"<p>Rockstar is finally preparing to gift $500,000 of virtual cash to every player of its GTA Online mode – a promise the company made on 14 October, but has so far been unable to deliver. <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51636/grand-theft-auto-online-update.html\" title=\"\">An online update issued on Friday</a> informed gamers that another update to the online multiplayer servicer, which is free to owners of Grand Theft Auto 5, will be made available for download early this week. The money will then be dropped into the accounts of players, in two equal payments of $250,000, a few days later.</p><p></p><p>There's a condition, however: the package will only be provided to veterans who played GTA Online during its shaky debut month. Launched on 2 October, the ambitious online option, which allows players to compete for cash and experience points on the streets of Los Santos, has been beset by server breakdowns as well as data loss problems. Thousands complained of losing characters and money as Rockstar engineers fought to cope with the demand of several million players hitting its online infrastructure simultaneously. Several downloadable updates have followed, some to solve technical issues, other to prevent wily players from exploiting glitches in the game to make easy money.</p><p></p><p>The continuing problems with data loss, as well as ongoing attempts to balance the in-game economy, are almost certainly behind the delay in issuing the $500,000 payout. Players have seen several major changes to the financial system over the past few weeks including a large reduction in the cost of being killed in the game's open-world \"free\" mode, but also a reduction in the amount that can be made from repeatedly beating the same money-making missions.</p><p></p><p>Away from money woes, the publisher is promising a range of new content for the GTA Online game mode in order to maintain interest. The free \"Beach Bum\" downloadable content pack, due in \"early November\", adds new beach-themed vehicles and clothes as well as extra races and Gang Attack, Survival and Last Team Standing jobs. A content creator mode is also due, allowing players to create their own customised races and death matches, with the best featured on the Rockstar site. The company has also announced a series of Grand Theft Auto Online Social Club Event weekends, with special bonuses, rewards and limited edition crate drops into the online city.</p><p></p><p>More intriguingly, Rockstar assures us this will be the week we find out about the new Heists, which are set to bring more in-depth cooperative missions to the online offering. A Capture The Flag mode is also imminent. The publisher's mailout ends with yet another seductive promise: \"We will also have initial details on more additional content coming for both Story Mode and GTA Online in the next few weeks.\"</p><p></p><p>For now, though, many GTA Online players have just one demand for Rockstar: show me the money.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421606575|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8b7ba8613a24ab4d5e1836532e208a1ca91b6df1 -->",

(Perhaps including Journey.) You can stream it, so if you're waiting in line for your this could help you amp yourself up to dangerous levels.</p></blockquote><p>For heaven's sake Sony, Keighley gets all of these things. Did you not see Cara and Keith's Powerlunch? We could have done this one for you!</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/436393/project-gotham-racing-might-have-a-future-on-xbox/\">Project Gotham Racing 'might have a future on Xbox' | CVG UK</a></h2><p>IGN has been talking to Xbox exec Phil Spencer about lots of stuff – including the possibility of a new Project Gotham title!</p><blockquote><p>Asked if the franchise has a future on Xbox, Spencer told IGN: \"Maybe. I think the Kudos system that we had in PGR was the real secret sauce. I thought that was the thing that people really loved. It had a great feel, it was there at launch, which I think was important.\"</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so he <em>did</em> go on to say that the slate is rather full of racing titles at the moment, but let's just dream while we can.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-talks-destiny-competitive-multiplayer/1100-6415916/\">Bungie talks Destiny competitive multiplayer | GameSpot</a></h2><p>Bungie community manager Eric Osborne has been chatting about how important competitive multiplayer is for the studio and forthcoming opus, Destiny:</p><blockquote><p>\"Competitive multiplayer is a huge focus for the team. We love it. We play it at lunch weekly. We fight about it. We constantly go back and forth. The perspectives vary wildly inside the studio,\" Osborne said.</p><p>\"But it's already got to the point where it's really fun and it's really about tweaking and iterating and playing it every day and finding that spot we think is unique but also feels familiar for those who are into competitive multiplayer that's skill-based, 'I'm better than you not necessarily because of the gear I have but because I'm better than you.'\"</p></blockquote><p>No more word, though, on exactly how PvsP gameplay will be fed into the pervasive Destiny universe.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-31-ps4-pre-orders-much-much-much-higher-than-past-consoles\">PS4 pre-orders \"much, much, much higher\" than past consoles | GamesIndustry International</a></h2><p>Just in case you were concerned that Sony hadn't received enough interest in its new machine:</p><blockquote><p>Sony's games business may have lost $8 million in its recent quarter, but the good news is that early indicators for the PlayStation 4 are very positive. In the company's earnings call (as transcribed by Seeking Alpha), CFO Masaru Kato enthused, \"Compared to past platforms, the pre-orders that we have received for this new platform is much, much, much higher.\"</p><p>Sony is expecting to sell 5 million units by the end of its fiscal year on March 31, 2014, and the company is bullish on its projections given the pre-orders it's seen so far. An exact number hasn't been provided, but in August Sony Computer Entertainment boss Andrew House did note that over 1 million units had already been pre-ordered. After the launch of the PS3, the console went on to sell about 3.5 million units by the following March, so if Sony can hit 5 million in that same period with PS4 it would be a significant improvement. </p></blockquote><p>Yes it would, especially as consoles were supposed to be an anachronism in smartphone era...</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/2ds-enjoys-half-term-sales-spike/0123618\">2DS enjoys half-term sales spike | MCV</a></h2><p>Some good news for Nintendo's hardware division, at last:</p><blockquote><p>2DS was launched three weeks ago alongside Pokémon X and Y. The machine was on sale for around £110, but last week major retailers including Argos, Amazon and Tesco cut the machine to under £100 to coincide with the school half-term</p><p>It proved to be the magic price point, as sales of 2DS has shot up 64 per cent week-on-week. 2DS was comfortably the UK's best selling console last week, and that's without combining the sales of 3DS and 3DS XL.</p></blockquote><p>Now, if they could just start shifting Wii Us – company president Satoru Iwata has <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-we-have-failed-to-establish-wii-u-as-a-worthy-wii-successor/1100-6415888/\">just admitted</a> the machine has been a failure so far.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-03-chess-2-the-sequel-how-a-street-fightin-man-fixed-the-worlds-most-famous-game\"><br />Chess 2: The Sequel - How a street fightin' man fixed the world's most famous game | Eurogamer.net</a></strong></h2><p>This is another really fascinating feature from Eurogamer, looking at how chess has often evolved in the past to meet the demands of different ages – and how it may need to evolve again, according to one Zachary Burns:</p><blockquote><p>\"The reason for that?\" asks Burns. \"Yes, we've explored the game very deeply, but even beyond that, it's just kind of a draw-y game. Even if one player has clearly demonstrated superior play - let's say one player only has a king remaining at the end and the other player has a king and two knights - even though they're at a significant material advantage, that game might still be a draw because draws are built so heavily into the game mechanics.\" Even worse, games often end in resignation when an actual victory starts to loom on the distant horizon. Chess really is in an odd place, then. In fact, modern chess is at risk of being a game that only amateurs and intermediates can have much fun with.</p></blockquote><p>From here we meet David Sirlin – chess fan and Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix re-balancer – and the concept of Chess 2. </p><p>In short, Eurogamer senior writer Christian Donlan does it again. </p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:gdngames\">Press Start at Pinboard</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421575315|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|fed4390c13962f85137d706e1f36934d22102d7f -->",

A recent highlight from this furiously productive scene is <a href=\"http://olavandthelute.com/play/play.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Olav &amp; the Lute</strong></a>, which takes its cues from the point-and-click classic <em>Loom</em>, tasking players with overcoming puzzles in a rather sombre netherworld. It's brief and basic, but that's its charm, and in a lunch break it can whisk you away to a ravaged world that is utterly engrossing.</p><p>For something more upbeat <a href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/626497\" title=\"\">Wreck</a><strong> </strong>is an irreverent 2D platformer focused on Miley Cyrus, who is out to assassinate her alter ego, Hannah Montana, with a giant laser cannon-cum-jetpack. Behind the daftness lurks a distinctive distraction that balances absurdity and style adeptly.</p><p>Equally slick is <a href=\"http://armorgames.com/play/15684/experimental-shooter-2\" title=\"\"><strong>Experimental Shooter 2</strong></a>, a bare-bones 2D action game centred on controlling a unicycle cannon in one-screen levels. A hybrid of traditional shoot-'em-up and platformer, it proves that there is plenty of room for deft game design in a strikingly simple world.</p><p>Star ratings (out of 5):<br />Olav &amp; the Lute ★★★★<br />Wreck ★★★★<br />Experimental Shooter 2 ★★★★</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421307865|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|34ec344178e0e07eda81239d31cfac23ce310ce2 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Prequel\" is rarely a word that makes the heart soar nowadays, whether it attends three hours of tedious furry-toed adventuring or a trio of bloated George Lucas money-makers – but there had been some anticipation that <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em> would be different. The past two Dark Knight outings have been rapturously received and garlanded with honours; the only hitch here is that development duties were hived out from Rocksteady to unproved developers WB: Montreal. And so, inevitably,<em> Origins</em> proves something of a disappointment.</p><p>The plot follows Batman in the early days of his crime-fighting career, meeting for the first time many of his friends and foes across Gotham City on a snowy Christmas Eve as he's hunted by a gaggle of assassins. It's entertaining stuff and handles the introduction of everyone's favourite clown prince of crime, The Joker, particularly well.</p><p>However, there's something missing. The game mechanics – fighting, countering, gadgets, stealth – are all much the same, with a couple of new gizmos and bad guys thrown in for good measure, but it lacks the spectacle of the previous entries in the series. Where <em>Arkham City</em> had a bravura opening with Bruce Wayne besieged and unmasked, <em>Origins</em> has a lacklustre prison break – and swiftly follows this with an agonisingly frustrating boss battle. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why this fails to match what has gone before, but some of the magic has gone and what is Batman without that? Just another man wearing a rubber suit.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421303124|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5c36ca913376f54c9e50c89c74031906a30e1765 -->",

        "headline":"GTA Online 'stimulus package' to drop this week",
        "body":"<p>Rockstar is finally preparing to gift $500,000 of virtual cash to every player of its GTA Online mode – a promise the company made on 14 October, but has so far been unable to deliver. <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51636/grand-theft-auto-online-update.html\" title=\"\">An online update issued on Friday</a> informed gamers that another update to the online multiplayer servicer, which is free to owners of Grand Theft Auto 5, will be made available for download early this week. The money will then be dropped into the accounts of players, in two equal payments of $250,000, a few days later.</p><p></p><p>There's a condition, however: the package will only be provided to veterans who played GTA Online during its shaky debut month. Launched on 2 October, the ambitious online option, which allows players to compete for cash and experience points on the streets of Los Santos, has been beset by server breakdowns as well as data loss problems. Thousands complained of losing characters and money as Rockstar engineers fought to cope with the demand of several million players hitting its online infrastructure simultaneously. Several downloadable updates have followed, some to solve technical issues, other to prevent wily players from exploiting glitches in the game to make easy money.</p><p></p><p>The continuing problems with data loss, as well as ongoing attempts to balance the in-game economy, are almost certainly behind the delay in issuing the $500,000 payout. Players have seen several major changes to the financial system over the past few weeks including a large reduction in the cost of being killed in the game's open-world \"free\" mode, but also a reduction in the amount that can be made from repeatedly beating the same money-making missions.</p><p></p><p>Away from money woes, the publisher is promising a range of new content for the GTA Online game mode in order to maintain interest. The free \"Beach Bum\" downloadable content pack, due in \"early November\", adds new beach-themed vehicles and clothes as well as extra races and Gang Attack, Survival and Last Team Standing jobs. A content creator mode is also due, allowing players to create their own customised races and death matches, with the best featured on the Rockstar site. The company has also announced a series of Grand Theft Auto Online Social Club Event weekends, with special bonuses, rewards and limited edition crate drops into the online city.</p><p></p><p>More intriguingly, Rockstar assures us this will be the week we find out about the new Heists, which are set to bring more in-depth cooperative missions to the online offering. A Capture The Flag mode is also imminent. The publisher's mailout ends with yet another seductive promise: \"We will also have initial details on more additional content coming for both Story Mode and GTA Online in the next few weeks.\"</p><p></p><p>For now, though, many GTA Online players have just one demand for Rockstar: show me the money.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421606575|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8b7ba8613a24ab4d5e1836532e208a1ca91b6df1 -->",

        "headline":"Call of Duty: Ghosts – the billion-dollar new beginning",
        "body":"<p>Infinity Ward knows a thing or two about change – even if it has worked on the same multimillion-dollar franchise since its origins as a splinter group from the Medal of Honor series 11 years ago.</p> <p>In that time it has seen the Call of Duty brand catapulted from a modestly successful cinematic shooter to the biggest entertainment property in the world. It has also seen its founders Jason West and Vince Zampella, leaving under a vast mushroom cloud of controversy and recrimination, taking many veteran staff with them, to the new horizons of Respawn Entertainment.</p> <p>It has seen FPS contenders come and go; it is now staring down the barrel of a new console generation that may have fresh ideas about the shooter genre.</p> <p>I visited this studio two years ago, its battered old office in Encino looking tired and dark. Since then the company has moved to Woodland Hills, and into a cavernous bespoke building, designed to accommodate the huge development teams that a game of this size requires.</p> <p>Now, that team is putting the finishing touches to Call of Duty: Ghosts, a very recognisable CoD game, but with a brand new setting and story, and a few little twists to the formula. With its release sandwiched between the gargantuan success of GTA V and the promise of Destiny and Titanfall, the pressure is on. And the pressure never lets up for these guys.</p> <p>Executive producer Mark&nbsp;Rubin is his usual relaxed yet resolute self when I meet up with him, first in LA for the Ghosts multiplayer announcement, and then weeks later at Gamescom. &quot;It's been refreshing,&quot; he tells me about the move to a new narrative universe.</p> <p>&quot;On many levels, the game has been such a new experience for us – and moving into a new studio was part of that. It feels like a fresh start. And this is a console transition year so we knew we were going to be on new hardware; because of that we knew we'd need a new engine. That made it feel different, too. We felt that Modern Warfare had completed its story arc and we wanted to start a new one that would be in a completely refreshed universe. We just carried that theme throughout the entire project. Everything felt different. I mean, in terms of formula there are pieces that are very obviously Call of Duty, but with multiplayer, we just felt that we were going to take some bigger risks – we changed some systems that have been pretty sacred since Modern Warfare.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2f75d8f1-bc56-48d4-8092-63949a0e8686\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134314126/e3180b65-5995-4008-9bed-9b50548f1497-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'Dynamic maps won't always mean destruction'</h2> <p>It's the multiplayer that I've seen most of so far. The new character system, which does away with anonymous custom load-out mannequins in favour of actual customisable soldiers all with their own kit. The emphasis on ground warfare rather than aerial killstreak blitzkriegs. There are 30 new weapons, including a new class of marksman rifles; Perks now have a points system, allowing you to buy several weaker options or opt for one or two really meaty specials.</p> <p>None of this represents the big risk that Rubin alluded to. &quot;It's the whole dynamic map system,&quot; he says, alluding to the feature which sees buildings collapse and train carriages fall into chasms. &quot;People who've played Call of Duty over the years are used to a a certain style of map, a certain design. We really branched away from that. Dynamic maps won't always mean destruction. You can blow up a gas station or parts of the wall in some environments, but in others you can move objects or open and close doors to change paths.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;Controlling those points becomes part of the strategy of defending those maps. And there are other maps where it's about full-on massive change. So in Strikezone, when someone earns the relevant care package from completing a Field Order challenge, they can destroy the entire map. Then there are the more environmental non-player controlled versions of that. So we have a map where the environment is falling and as it falls things change, like walls collapse or paths alter – you're fighting in a crumbling world. The whole idea started with the concept of bringing campaign cinema beats to multiplayer.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;We chat about the maps I've seen so far; the abandoned sports stadium in StrikeZone, the wrecked cityscape in Chasm … How do these designs start? &quot;It either comes up at a brainstorming session, or someone – it does't matter who – pitches an idea to someone else,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;From here, it begins to gather momentum. Usually when we pitch things to each other, the person being pitched to attacks the idea – it's how we're used to doing it, playing the devil's advocate. You have to defend your ideas. If you can't do that straight up then it's not good enough to continue with. Later someone will make a prototype and we'll try it out, get lots of feedback, make lots of changes and continue the iteration. Blitz didn't start out the way it is now, it has shaped itself over many playtests.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;So what's the hit to waste ratio during this process? &quot;You'd be surprised at how many levels get thrown out,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;There are six to eight maps that aren't going to ship that I've seen multiple iterations of. Early on, we had a group of maps that were really fun and I thought they'd ship, but we keep going, keep going and they don't work out. There's a lot of that stuff on the cutting room floor. That's a general philosophy for us – we're really good at cutting. If it doesn't make the game better, it doesn't belong.&quot;</p> <h2>'We're trying a more organic new style of design'</h2> <p>I'm interested in this process – after-all there must be a financial impetus to just keep everything. In these days of downloadable content, each map represents potential revenue. So if creativity and gameplay rule, I want to know what makes a classic map, and how easy one is to spot.&nbsp;There have been some fantastic ones in the CoD lifeline – Crash, Terminal, Crossfire – but also some stinkers that somehow made it though; maps with horrible camping spots and site lines that strafe the whole arena.</p> <p>What's clear is that there is a formula: most maps have three parallel paths allowing flanking play, or they generate out from a central hub in concentric circles. You learn the layout and you exploit it. The same tricks always work the same way. Ghosts is in on that of course, but Rubin insists that his team is playing with some of the conventions this time round. Chasm, for example.</p> <p>&quot;Chasm is a medium to large map – it plays a little larger than it is. From one end to another isn't that long, but there are a lot of twisting routes. We're trying a more organic new style of design; we wanted to come up with some maps that don't feel like gameplay arenas, that feel like real places, but still have the necessary routing to make them play like Call of Duty,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;It's a real challenge and there were some maps that we really struggled with. Chasm fits into the organic style. It's a broken down building on the edge of a giant crater from one of the Odin strikes [the massively destructive super-weapon that forms the basis of the single-player campaign] – the paths all flow in and out, they're like spaghetti going over and under each other.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;So there are no choke or skirmish points? &quot;There are still fun engagement areas,&quot; he continues. &quot;But we want it to feel like something you've never played before. There's a section where you're in a broken building with an elevator where the shaft around it is damaged and it's just hanging by a few wires. You can run and jump onto the elevator and then on to the floor on the other side. But I've watched players take a C4, throw it on the elevator roofs as they pass, then fire it off to cause the elevator to fall, taking anyone following into the shaft.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe7d7b0c-5b7e-4e7f-b156-bac69526d36d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134390729/b61cd97c-f1a3-433a-ae26-5ddbd2ac0660-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'No one starts with a blank piece of paper'</h2> <p>I wanted to talk about the stuff people don't like – at least people not entirely embedded in the CoD community. The over-riding power of certain killstreaks for example. &quot;We've altered every system someway to make it interesting,&quot; insists Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;For killstreaks, one of the things we noticed when we've watched players is that they'll spend a lot of time just running and then being killed by something from the sky, or running around looking up, trying to fire their stinger missile at something above and not paying attention to what's in the game around them. We felt … let's get people's heads back down to ground level. We still have some air stuff – it's important to have that balance. But there are less air-based killstreaks now.&quot;</p> <p>The other thing people always pick up on is the Infinity Ward engine – the rusting battery that's been powering the series for many years, with seemingly only the occasionally half-hearted re-charge. Ghosts has a 'new' engine apparently, but what does that mean? How new is new? Rubin takes it in his stride. &quot;No one starts with a blank piece of paper – you have to start with something,&quot; he says.</p> <p>&quot;But then you go through and you pick apart systems. Some of them are much broader: if it's a tool-based change or a massive change to the way memory is handled – which we had to do this time around in order to provide customisation – we have to add in a whole new system of transient files. That's a new tech that effected everything in the game. It all had to be rewritten to work with that system. Sometimes it's a few lines of code, but it can require massive changes. So the engine starts with what we had before, but it changed dramatically over time.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Actually, you know, I don't really care about the engine – and for all the faults of CoD, one of the things I like about this game is, it doesn't much care either. Obviously, it cares that things work, but the engine is there to service the flow of the action, the 60-frames-per-second hyper-pace of spawning, shooting and sprinting.</p> <p>Whatever this game is, whatever it says about us that it's the biggest entertainment leviathan on the planet, it just wants to get its bloody job done. And some of the biggest changes are to the flow state of the game – the fact that players can now knee slide across the ground into cover, or vault seamlessly over obstacles. These are little additions we know well from other games, but here they will make more of an impact than, I don't know, super advanced particle effects.</p> <h2>'Separate multi- and single player modes has a very long future'</h2> <p>Anyway, I want to get away from all this. I want to talk about the future. Infinity Ward must have looked across at Respawn and wondered what those guys, those ex-colleagues, were up to. And now we know. It's Titanfall, the undisputed winner at Gamescom.</p> <p>There's this new game design concept – mingle player – that seeks to merge single- and multiplayer components together into seamless experiences. There's Destiny lurking out there, too. Does the rigid structure of CoD have a place in this nascent universe? Can the centre hold? What about this brave new era of campaign multiplayer and online narratives?</p> <p>&quot;I've thought about this a lot myself,&quot; says Rubin. &quot;I think it would be really fun to try something like that with Call of Duty, but I don't think it's the required future. I think there will always be a mass audience that wants one aspect of the game, and not the others. That's the problem when you blend the two. If you look at PvE and PvP servers on MMORPGs – the PvP guys hate the PvE guys and vice versa. Blending the two isn't necessarily always the right idea. So I think separate multi- and single player modes has a very long future … but again, from an artistic standpoint, it would be an interesting thing to do.&quot;</p> <p>This might be a polite brush-off, the typically open-ended, non-committal answer of the media-trained exec. But Rubin continues. &quot;It could be handled in a very game-like way,&quot; he says. &quot;You could be in an open-world single-player environment where you can go up to a gate and when you enter that base, you're walking into a multiplayer map. That would be fun.&quot; This is, of course, how Destiny is handling things, and how GTA Online works, too. CoD rarely breaks new ground, but it has always quietly adapted. How much more can this behemoth adapt to the vagaries of cloud-based persistent worlds?</p> <p>How about, say, more players in these new next-gen modes? &quot;It's possible, but ground war in general has always been a difficult mode for CoD,&quot; says Rubin. &quot;It's fun, but spawning is horrible … and with that many people you can cover the whole map. There's nowhere you can spawn that someone from the other team doesn't see you. The easy thing is, we can always do that – tomorrow we can set up a new playlist and say now it's 24 players . The question is, should we?&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-70479113-d51e-4615-a2e7-9c23bd8f60e2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134528599/b8dea688-71cf-414e-a7eb-6103e1ba1da8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'The interactivity of it is the thing that's most compelling'</h2> <p>And that's always the question with this series. CoD is a billion-a-year business, with 30 million customers – all of that starts in Rubin's office. When I talk about how the next ten consoles are seeking to revolutionaries the concept of matchmaking and lobbies, he bats the issue away – the CoD system works just fine, thank you.</p> <p>When I put a similar question to Eric Hirshberg, the CEO of Activision, the response is slightly different. &quot;I agree that games need to be more social,&quot; he says as we talk in Gamescom meeting room. &quot;That's why we developed Call of Duty Elite – the design conceit was, wouldn't it be great if we could unlock the game as a more social experience. At the time, with the current gen consoles as our platforms, we had to do a lot of technological gymnastics just to do simple things like creating your character's load out on your smartphone on the train then have it waiting for you on the console when you got home. Now that wall has been lowered - the idea of the second screen is baked right into the hardware design.&quot;</p> <p>Hirschberg, an advertising industry veteran, sees the value in engaging with and encouraging social activity away from the raw game – or the brand – itself. &quot;We put a lot of capabilities into Black Ops II that were designed for e-sports competition and again, the creative process has a way of repurposing things that aren't always expected,&quot; he says. &quot;The theatre mode for example, was designed to capture highlights, but it has turned into a cottage industry of blooper films and other user-generated content that our fans have had a blast with. There are thousands of videos getting millions of views from that mode because we handed creative tools over to players and they used them in ways we never anticipated.&quot;</p> <p>But I don't want to get bogged down in the issue of audiences and social content systems. I want to question how games like Call of Duty can continue to function in a changing industry. After The Last of Us, we're seemingly moving toward an era of emotional realism. What does it mean for CoD? Can it just go along as it always has?</p> <p>Fans will say yes, that it fulfils a particular need. But let's look at cinema – in America, the Western was the predominant action genre for decades, and it spoke to its audience in the same way as military first-person shooters talk to gamers: tough men, following arcane codes of honour, brawling in the streets, bringing order to anarchy. But socio-political changes and the rise of auteur cinema in the seventies effectively killed the western. People change. Do people want meaning now?</p> <p>Hirshberg is fascinatingly mechanistic in his response. &quot;With the enhanced graphics and facial animations in Ghosts, we've made the decision to have it be about one platoon of characters that you're with from the beginning to the end of the campaign - it's the first time we've done that. We've brought in Steve&nbsp;Gaghan to hopefully provide a more rich and compelling story. But at the end of the day it's a Call of Duty game and there will be a percentage of people who press the X button to skip past all that wonderful rich story to get to the action faster. That's because it's a game and the interactivity of it is the thing that's most compelling, and that's what it is designed to driver first and foremost.&quot;</p> <h2>'The content level keeps climbing… it's… it's scary'</h2> <p>Rubin is more circumspect. He considers the question very carefully. &quot;There's a simple side to this. The tech will make characters look more realistic and more believable. That's the obvious part. We can do amazing CG-style moments, like big character interaction moments, which could be really cool,&quot; he says.</p> <p>&quot;I'll use Quantic Dream as an example: that Kara demo is the perfect example of where you <em>could</em> go in terms of storytelling. I think Kara is stunning, amazing quality in terms of tech and interesting emotional story-telling. I get teary in the part where she says she wants to live. It's so impactful. Putting that into games is something I think will make games better.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;But there's a downside – we've seen it happen with a lot of developers and it's hurting. We're having to put in so much more content and that content is getting harder and harder to make, and taking longer and longer, and more and more resources and money … I mean, it's something we all want to do but there's an obvious challenge there that I don't think enough people are really thinking about. Do we understand where we may be going if we start down this route? I still want us to do it, it's awesome, but as a producer, it scares me! If we have to do a whole game with masses of emotional intensity, the content level keeps climbing … it's … it's scary.&quot;</p> <p>This is where I wanted to go. Toward the future of game design and what that can mean for a studio of creative people working on a 'franchise' that makes money on a vast industrial scale. We're talking fresh starts now, so how about it? Can Call of Duty be an emotional journey? Ghosts is marketed as a human story, but death will be the one writing the script, we all know that. Does Infinity Ward care at all about fear and loss and humanity? Does it need to?</p> <p>&quot;We do try to have those moments, and we tie them together. There's a moment early in CoD 4 when you're sitting in a helicopter flying in at night to a cargo ship. And Price is there, smoking a cigarette, expressionless … then he throws the cigarette away, pulls the mask down and he's ready for action. That told a story about a character who can just get into combat mode, this intensity, without worrying about dying,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;In Modern Warfare 2, we have Soap on the side of a cliff about to engage an enemy base; and he's just sitting smoking a cigar, then he tosses it and the level begins. It was a purposeful tie in between the two characters. Doing things like that, is something we always want to try. The moment when you jump across the ice chasm and slip, and someone catches you – there's a little bit of emotion in his face that says 'I've got your back'.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That's always something we're trying to do,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem with Call of Duty is, most of the time, you're shooting guys.&quot;</p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;• Call of Duty: Ghosts is due out on PC, PS3, Wii U and Xbox 360 on November 5 and on next-gen consoles later in the month</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421275999|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0e7e7cc601366345f943bbbb5d8296bf2a7cc097 -->",

        "body":"<p>You are dead. The words ring out through the dank low corridors of Nottingham's galleries of justice, a historic courthouse, considered to be one of the most haunted buildings in Britain. We're here at midnight, a small huddled group of us, to try the <a href=\"http://www.papasangre.com/\" title=\"\">iOS app Papa Sangre II</a>, sequel to the spooky, sound-only iPhone game released in 2010. But at this fascinating little event, held as part of the GameCity festival, developer Somethin' Else wants to shake us up a bit first.</p><p>In groups of two and three we're led through the 15th century basements of the old gaol, past the tiny cells where condemned prisoners were locked before execution. The light, such as it is, comes from small candles placed along the route and while we're creeping through doorways and up stairwells, hidden speakers are playing sounds and dialogue from the game. The voice we hear is Sean Bean, the narrator. You are dead, he repeats in his gruff Yorkshire tones.</p><p>That is the starting point of this unsettling and interesting game. While the original Papa Sangre was a mission of mercy into the Mexican world of the dead, in the follow-up, it's you who has passed over. Suddenly you awake, confused and alone in a sort of halfway house between life and afterlife, and the themes of this new limbo world are much more British. \"We think of Papa as someone otherworldly,\" says senior producer, Tom Green. \"Is it a man, a woman or even human? We don't know and that allowed us to present a completely different setting. We wanted to give ourselves the freedom to try new sounds. Obviously our palette is limited to audio. If we stuck with the Mexican theme we'd be hamstrung. This one is a very English game.\"</p><p>Bean is your guide. He says he can get you out, back to the living, but in order to escape you have to listen to him and do what he says. \"Close your eyes\" he intones, slowly. \"And don't open them, no matter what.\" This is a game of sound. So you close your eyes and you do what Bean says. It turns out that you have to locate and steal the memories of the dead. You do this by listening for the music these memories make and then heading toward it. In the first game, navigation involved stroking the iPad screen to move and change direction, but this time, Somethin' Else has been able to make use of the iPad's gyroscope, as well as a proprietary 3D binaural audio engine. You can point the iPad toward a sound to locate it in 3D space, then tap two feet icons on the screen to \"walk\" toward it.</p><p>The technology is impressive and accurate, but the artistic implementation really matters too, the choice of sounds and where they're placed in the audio environment. For this Somethin' Else worked with the sound designers Ben and Max Ringham. \"It's been really useful,\" says Green. \"They understand the relationship between the theatrical nature of games and how to bring sound design into narrative. One of the challenges with audio games is how to give the right feedback to players. Every action has to have very palpable feedback. They're really aware of that, because their work in theatre is about expressing things that happen off stage in a very easy to understand way.\"</p><p>The effect is incredibly immersive. This world is full of crackly, weird, unsettling noises, and all of them seem to be within reach. They're spooky, but you navigate by them. Bean tells us that we're in a sort of gaol of souls, and that these souls come from different eras. We stumble across the memories of people who died in 1920s disasters, and 1970s drownings. The music drags us back in time. \"Writer Neil Bennun is obsessed with 1920s sound,\" says Green. \"There are a lot of gramophones and other early sound technologies in the game.\"</p><p>So it's a game about navigation and memory, all within a sort of faux Victorian ghost story. Later, the souls are guarded by what sound like giant insects that can steal your own. You have to creep around them, walking slowly and quietly, keeping their horrible scuttling noises far to your left or right. Or you can clap, using the hand icons on screen, to distract them, before making off with yet another memory. You need a good pair of headphones to get the proper feedback, but once tuned into this dark world, you really do begin to \"see\" the noises, see the rooms. And Bean's voice is perfect, filled with menace and gravelly import.</p><p>Papa Sangre was a critical success three years ago, hinting at the expansive possibilities of smartphone and tablet gaming. It attracted a large audience of blind and visually-impaired players, who have largely been ignored or seriously sidelined by the video game industry. This game, with its mix of spatial audio and motion controls creates or simulates an understanding of the world that may well be familiar. For the rest of us, it is unsettling and testing, attempting to form a picture of a trap-filled dungeon in which bubbling pools of soul-sucking lava await if one careless foot is placed too close. If you do get caught by an enemy or a hazard, your character is brought back to \"afterlife\", but the game tells you this has cost you a memory. \"You no longer remember your first school sports day,\" Bean dolefully states.</p><p>Ultimately, the effect is a sinister fairground haunted house ride, mixed with a well-narrated ghost story. With my useless in-ear headphones I sometimes found it difficult to locate whether a noise was in front or behind me, the subtleties got lost over my head somewhere, and in the more panicky moments this could get frustrating. But this is a game like all games. It rewards perseverence, it has a system and a set of skills to learn. It's just that here, you're using your ears and not a controller or a sequence of buttons.</p><p>Eventually, during the GameCity event, we were led into the Victorian courtroom and allowed to play the game for a couple of hours. The lights were off, and all that could be seen in the pitch darkness was the glow from a dozen iPad screens and the odd shuffling body. Whatever ghosts were in that room, they were receiving short shrift from its living occupants. The supernatural presence we cared about was in our hands, and in our heads.</p><p>• <em>Papa Sangre II is available for iPad and iPhone on the Apple app store from today</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421360909|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|2cba9e4b17a8829a266e212ae08d5d2dff6c41da -->",

        "headline":"Sonic Lost World – Wii-U review",
        "body":"<p>Shigeru Miyamoto's career and that of his most famous creation, Super Mario, have remained entwined for 30 years. Every Mario game is checked and tweaked by Nintendo's prize designer, whose fingerprints and aromatic genius can be sensed in even the most throwaway spin-off.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog, by contrast, has an absent father. Sega's mascot – designed by the artist Naoto Oshima at the behest of Sega's CEO (who recognised the company's need for a digital poster-boy) – was trained and defined by Yuji Naka, who left the company nearly a decade ago. He was the last of the original Sonic team to depart (Oshima left in 1999, while Mark Cerny, one of the original game's programmers is currently the architect of Sony's PlayStation 4). Perhaps for this reason, in recent years, Sonic the Hedgehog has tripped and floundered, where once he streaked and tore. His appeal has skewed towards an ever-younger audience, as his games have come to rely more on character and attitude than on ingenuity and creativity of design.</p><p>Sonic Lost World is an expensive, bolshie attempt by Sega to redefine the character as more than a mere mascot, to reinstate him as the lead of an artistically rich, fidgety and important game series again. Drawing together the cream of Sega's remaining talent, the team has chosen its benchmark wisely: Sonic Lost World is perhaps best described as a cover version of Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy titles, a pair of games that remain the finest expression of their type yet made.</p><p>Sonic Lost World turns 3D into 2D and switches back again; it sends its character screeching through the air between floating landmasses, some of which are laid out like long, verdant cylinders, others much closer to Galaxy's globes, which can be circumvented in seconds. Finally, it launches Sonic off some powerful spring or squinting cannon to the next land mass in sequence.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420342850\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/18/1382084717051/Sonic-Lost-World-2-006.jpg\" alt=\"Sonic Lost World 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Gambling on ambling?<br /></h2><p>Sonic's approach to navigating his world has always been blunt: a sprint or a blurry tumble, down and around pre-laid loop-de-loops at trainer-ruining speeds. For this world, however, which demands much more precise jumps from platform to platform, he's been slowed down and taught some new tricks. Sonic now naturally walks at a sedate pace; you'll need to hold down a trigger to squeeze him into a sprint. Another button press tucks him into his buzz-saw roll, which can be revved up and finally used to launch him off in a straight direction.</p><p>Sonic can now run along walls, bounce on the ground three times in succession, gaining height with each bump (a move directly lifted from Mario's repertoire) and, crucially, he can quickly attack any nearby enemy that's highlighted by a targeting cursor. This allows you to automatically streak between enemies with deadly ease.</p><p>Finally, Sonic's 'Wisp Powers', introduced in Sonic Colors, can be triggered when you find the appropriate item, shifting play to the Wii-U's touchscreen as you, for example, burrow down into the earth for a subterranean excursion, or aim a cannon's trajectory to launch Sonic towards a specific location. The combined effect of these additions is to increase the speed, style and exactness with which you can move through the world. It's fussier than Mario's easy-going moves, but nevertheless, for Sonic, it's remains a novel triumph.</p><p>The Lost World itself (known as Lost Hex) is an orb composed of hexagonal tiles that represent new stages and minigames. Divided into a series of themed areas, you work your way across these tiles, unlocking new ones as you go.</p><p>Your task is to free small fluffy animals that antagonist Dr Robotnik has imprisoned. The game keeps a tally of the number of animals you've rescued and you must pass certain thresholds before some new stages open up. This core objective is supplemented by all manner of bolt-on tasks, from collecting coins, to finding five secret tokens in each stage to completing random feats. Each of the game's main stages is intricately designed, with many routes to its conclusion. It will take multiple playthroughs to uncover every secret and, with an online leaderboard for each stage, there's added incentive to perfect your approach.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420342851\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/18/1382084918456/Sonic-Lost-World-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sonic Lost World 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Shakespeare it ain't<br /></h2><p>Sonic's kitschy but irritating Saturday morning kid's cartoon storyline persists, with regular expositional cut-scene interruptions featuring the belligerent Sonic and his tittering sidekick Tails, Dr Robotnik and the so-called Deadly Six, a group of native villains, coerced into fighting on Robotnik's side who also provide the boss battles in each area. These cutscenes will grate for all but the youngest players, the awful dialogue (&quot;Some lessons can only be learned at the end of a boot … It is time to teach you those lessons&quot;) only partially offset by the assured animation.</p><p>Mario's plotlines may be equally tiresome, but at least they have the decency to limit their intrusion to the opening and close of the game.</p><p>With so many elements, shifts in perspective and dynamics, Sonic Lost Worlds can feel, at times, like it's struggling to hold together into a cohesive whole. There is unevenness in the quality of those elements too, something that its primary influence avoided. But this is nevertheless the finest Sonic game in years, a riot of ideas that at times approaches the quality of Nintendo EAD's work. It may not provide much insight into where games are heading, but as a Sonic-themed celebration of the past few years, it's a surprising delight.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/05/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-review\">Sonic The Hedgehog 4 – review</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/nov/04/sonic-generations-game-review-sega\">Sonic Generations – review</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/gallery/2011/jun/24/12-best-sonic-hedgehog-games\">• The 12 best Sonic the Hedgehog games – in pictures</a><br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420332670|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5c32cf750f30531c1cb57993bd53885d971ce9cf -->",

        "headline":"Watch Dogs and The Crew delayed",
        "body":"<p>Ubisoft has announced that two of its key forthcoming releases, Watch Dogs and The Crew, have been delayed. In an investor conference-call on Tuesday, the publisher suggested that both of the ambitious projects needed more development time. </p><p>Cyberpunk surveillance thriller Watch Dogs was due to be a launch title on the forthcoming PlayStation 4 and Xbox One machines. However, all versions of the title, including current gen iterations, have been delayed until spring 2014. </p><p>&quot;Our ambition from the start with Watch Dogs has been to deliver something that embodies what we wanted to see in the next generation of gaming,&quot; Ubisoft announced in a statement. &quot;It is with this in mind that we've made the tough decision to delay the release.&quot;</p><p>The game, which takes place in an open-world alternative version of Chicago and allows players to hack into city computer networks, was considered one of the most intriguing third-party titles in the next-gen launch lineup. Ubisoft has high hopes for the title, expecting it to potentially outsell the respected Assassin's Creed series.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publisher's pan-American open-world racing game, The Crew, which brings massively-multiplayer adventure elements to the driving genre, has been delayed from spring to summer/autumn 2014. &quot;Our long-term goal is to win the next generation,&quot; explained Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot in a statement. </p><p>&quot;The tough decisions we are taking today to fully realise the major potential of our new creations have an impact on our short-term performance. We are convinced that, longer term, they will prove to be the right decisions both in terms of satisfaction for our fans and in terms of value creation for our shareholders. We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance.&quot;</p><p>As a result, the publisher has <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/433948/ubisoft-to-lose-560m-this-fiscal-over-watch-dogs-and-crew-delay/\">revised down</a> its revenue projections for the fiscal year, chopping $560m (&pound;349m) from the original expectations of $1.94bn. Consumers who have pre-ordered special Watch Dogs bundle packages of the next-gen consoles are being reassured that they won't lose their places in the queue. In the states, Amazon and Gamestop <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/article/81598/so-what-happens-to-watch-dogs-ps4-and-xbox-one\">have stated</a> that they will honour pre-orders by swapping out the bundled game for another title. We're waiting to hear similar assurances from UK retailers.</p><p>What the delays show are the pressures of producing original products in the console transition period, when current and forthcoming hardware have to be supported by development teams.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420107601|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5176d440bf71e50d5e8450cbdeb1f2f526ed66e4 -->",

        "headline":"Beyond: Two Souls - review",
        "body":"<p>&quot;Can a video game be art?&quot; asked David Cage, the writer and director of Beyond: Two Souls, at the recent Bafta annual games lecture. I suspect he already knew the answer was yes, or at least he would have done if he'd ever heard the intro music to&nbsp;Streets of Rage 2, which more than comfortably satisfies the most useful definition of art I've come across, formulated by Scottish author Alasdair Gray: anything that stimulates people into &quot;thinking about their feelings, and feeling about their thoughts&quot;. The complication being that, in reaching laudably for emotive, meaningful content, Beyond lurches so forcefully towards cinema that a more pertinent question for us to ask is, &quot;Can this art be considered a video game?&quot;</p><p>Beyond tells the story of a young woman, Jodie Holmes, who for unknown reasons is tied to an entity called Aiden. Her life is presented as a fragmented timeline, jumbled moments from tender infancy to defiant adulthood stacked upon each other non-chronologically. Players – if that is the right term – control both Jodie and Aiden during most of these scenes, hopping to Aiden's hovering perspective with a button press, gradually piecing together a story of laboratory experimentation, CIA induction and subsequent rebellion.</p><p>So why wring hands about whether or not it's a game? Because there's not much gameplay. Beyond is technically extraordinary, and certainly one of the finest looking things that run on PS3, but its points of interaction are building block-simple. Mostly they involve guiding Jodie through conversations with simple choices, or activating pre-determined physical motions with single button presses. Exploring scenes with Jodie or wandering through rooms (and walls) with Aiden grants more obvious freedom, but there is nothing skill-based here. You can only be better than someone else at Beyond if you shift the regular expectation of what &quot;better&quot; means – to experience the story more profoundly, perhaps, or to unobtrusively input button presses to allow the story to continue smoothly (and absolutely not raise and lower Jodie's can of beer repeatedly while saying &quot;Emotion&quot; in a thick French accent).</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611711\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415491207/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: stars Ellen Page as Jodie Holmes</figcaption></figure><p>So, Beyond might open up a troubling, legitimate gap in our use of the term &quot;video game&quot; to describe all interactive electronic media (or, you know, it might just be a starry-eyed evolution of the point-and-click adventure). More urgent is the issue of whether it's worth your time, and on this point it helps that Beyond looks fantastic. This isn't just a result of Quantic Dream's technology, but the artistic eyes behind it, and like the studio's previous game, Heavy Rain, Beyond is a triumph of both visual imagination and image quality. Like discontented Saturday night spouses we often complain that games have the ability to take us anywhere yet we always seem to end up in the same brown, dark corridors. Beyond gives us flair and spectacle – a warm, autumnal park at sunset; a still sheriff's office with dust motes illuminated by moonlight; a long, hazy road stretching through a baked orange desert.</p><p>But the core of Beyond is its story. Beyond is a predominantly narrative experience that has introduced elements of interactivity in order to heighten the emotional involvement of the player/viewer/interactee. One is only as enjoyable as the other, and both are imperfect, clumsy, and occasionally maddening, and yet somehow still compelling.</p><p>It helps that while Cage talks so earnestly about meaning and art he finds himself endearingly, irresistibly drawn to hokey sci-fi plotting. As talk of &quot;the other side&quot; and gateways built in government facilities take centre stage, it's clear that Beyond is exploitation dressed as art house – if not full-on Roger Corman, then at least John Carpenter, genre nous mixed with sporadic intelligence. This is no bad thing, as the juicy hook of this sci-fi pitch – who is Aiden, and where did he come from? – provides the mystery that gives the narrative its driving momentum.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611712\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415853461/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: a young Jodie</figcaption></figure><p>But there are significant problems of choice and agency. This single hook is problematic when compared, say, with the multi-threaded structure of Heavy Rain. There Cage's writing weaves together an ensemble cast whose choices and interactions cumulatively represent a significant set of potential outcomes. There are substantial, plot-changing decisions (and mistakes) to be made, tension borne of consequence, of knowledge that each of those characters can die. Beyond features expensive Hollywood star Ellen Page as Jodie Holmes, a single protagonist essential to the narrative, which consequently must be driven in a largely pre-determined direction. This means choices are limited, or often (even more infuriatingly) illusory, which in turn means that there is no grander interactivity to compensate for the lack of moment-to-moment mechanical control.</p><p>And yet, as flawed and constricting as this format can feel, it still offers some extraordinary experiences. Many of Beyond's most touching moments are non-essential in narrative terms, and only discovered through exploration – like Jodie singing a mournful song on guitar as she busks for dinner money as a freezing down-and-out, or infant Jodie in her bedroom trying to play make-believe with dolls only for her real imaginary friend to disrupt her game.</p><p>Beyond deserves credit for presenting us with ideas and situations few other games (especially of this budget level) would touch, or even think of. The disrupted doll play is just part of a series of scenes in which young Jodie struggles to come to terms with her unique ability – Beyond is strongest here, in these early years, capturing the mannerisms and heartache of childhood with pinprick accuracy, turning a neighbourhood snowball fight into a rush of escape and excitement. When an older Jodie joins the CIA, she becomes a physically commanding action heroine – admittedly, the action moments aren't particularly fun to sort-of-play, but my young daughter, catching a glimpse of this section, fist-pumped at the very idea of a leading lady who can handle herself. Later, in a disorienting change of pace, several minutes are given over to Jodie alone in her apartment, preparing for an imminent dinner date – a rushed tidy, a flick through a cook book, a frantic decision about what to wear.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611713\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415666928/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: Willem Dafoe as Dr Dawkins</figcaption></figure><p>The complicating factor is that, as well as doing things no other game does, Beyond also does some things really badly. There's a teenage party scene which seems like an excruciating parody of what teenage party scenes would be like if they were all written and conceived by middle-aged games designers (rule breaking, sexual frisson, rejection – it's Carrie in five clanging minutes). There's a lengthy portion in which Jodie lives with some Navajo indians (&quot;Because they're a bit mystic too&quot; seems the general reasoning). And the climactic escalation of Beyond's final scenes will be familiar to anyone with a working knowledge of Brian Yuzna's films, the works of HP Lovecraft, or derivative cautionary science fiction in general.</p><p>All of this makes it difficult to plot the quality of Beyond on a regular scale. It's technically extraordinary, but mechanically base. The quality of its drama is wildly inconsistent, with elegant emotional moments followed by clumsy cliche. And it contorts itself in service to a story that's both deeply derivative but also reliably compelling. It's a maddening flux of excellence and overambition that rejects many overplayed conventions of big-budget gaming, but fails to provide a comprehensive alternative. Beyond feels like an unfinished – and often unconvincing – theory of where games can go next. It is not the way forward, but it might help show the way for others, and it's worth exploring for yourself.</p><p><em>• Nathan Ditum has opted not to provide a score for this review</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419608294|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|13c9941246ec595d554c7125ab85217308bea7a8 -->",

        "headline":"Ireland's game scene back on its feet",
        "body":"<p>Sometimes you have to see a place through fresh eyes to appreciate it. This writer, having grown up in Dublin, takes for granted a lot of the best things about the city: its size, its nightlife, its people, instead focusing on its bad weather and worse economy. Beyond these shores, media horror stories paint an even bleaker picture of Ireland, with property crashes, bad banks and game office closures including Big Fish and PopCap.</p><p>But there's a veritable infestation of start-ups in Dublin at the moment. And thankfully, entrepreneurs, investors and high-level employees from outside the country are coming here for reasons beyond tax breaks and location.</p><p>\"Derelict warehouse, plus IKEA, equals the Digit offices,\" says Richard Barnwell, founder and CEO of Digit Games, a new company that employs dozens of people for Kings of the Realm, an ambitious cross-platform online MMO. So far, Digit has received total investment of $3.75m (£2.3m) to date. Their office sits in Dublin City between the prestigious Trinity College and the banks of the river Liffey, and is a stone's throw away from Google's European HQ.</p><p>To say that the past few years have been turbulent for Ireland is an understatement, but some government bodies like Enterprise Ireland are doing real, tangible work in helping start-ups; providing finance (in the form of investment), guidance and even help with contacts across different industries. Enterprise Ireland (or \"EI\") comes up in just about every conversation I have with developers.</p><p>\"The reason we came here was the interest from the likes of Enterprise Ireland,\" says Barnwell. \"When we started talking to people, saying it was a serious start-up, going out the gate with a million [pounds] worth of funding; we had offers from five countries. We had a lot of interest about doing game things here that we didn't get from other countries, nowhere near the level. As soon as we started talking to people like EI, they were incredibly keen to support us. Not really financially, we didn't need investment from them, but actually just opening doors – giving access to their west coast US offices and their German offices, literally they were saying 'let us help you meet people in developing territories' which has been incredibly useful; the kind of support which nobody else was offering. You can't really put a price on that because they've made introductions which could be worth an absolute fortune for us.\"</p><h2>Political power-ups<br /></h2><p>Irish politicians have generally been supportive. I have fond memories of seeing Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the launch of Bioware's call centre in Galway, making a speech about steep learning curves and then being shown how to play the Star Wars MMO. Yes, there have been some embarrassingly old-fashioned comments, including President Michael D Higgins dismissing the pursuit outright and TD [Teachta Dála – member of parliament] Mary Mitchell O'Connor's misbegotten press release condemning Call of Duty and advising parents to buy their kids books instead of games. But more often, the politicians see the games for what they are: a thrilling, creative, and sometimes lucrative young industry and possibly a way to connect with younger constituents.</p><p>Paschal Donohoe, a former senator who's recently been promoted to minister of state for European affairs, has been a long-term advocate for the Irish games industry. \"There's more of an understanding of [gaming among Irish politicians] than you might expect,\" he says. \"An example I'd give, it might be apocryphal, but it does illustrate a point, is around 18 months ago I set up a session in Leinster House to brief people on the digital games industry and what more we could do. And normally, when you organise these kinds of briefings, you get a handful of Oireachtas [parliament] members and a lot of staff. The room was packed. Packed. We had a huge number of TDs and senators, government ministers, and I've never seen a briefing ever as full as that.</p><p>\"I think that was a real illustration of the fact that there's a growing recognition amongst the political groups and classes. The simple reason is the advent of casual gaming. If you have a group of people for whom the use of a mobile phone is an integral part of their day-to-day life or how they communicate with the outside world, how can you avoid the advent and development of casual gaming on those devices? And that's so apparent. Because of that there's been a percolation into politicians, including here in Ireland.\"</p><p>Donohoe believes that interactive storytelling is a natural progression of Irish traditions: \"There is a part of our Irish culture, spirit and soul that is creative. There is an interest in the development of storytelling, whether it's through music, short stories or books. And I think some of our young men and women who might have looked to be the next David Lynch or Neil Gaiman now think of digital gaming as a way to express themselves and create worlds and tell stories.\"</p><p>The carrot for outside investment seems to be financial, and there is an entrepreneurial spirit here. But in an industry as young as gaming, competition is also fierce for high-end employees. Barnwell, a Cambridge native, claims that the size and vibe of Dublin is an attraction. \"Those that worked in London, or any major city, will appreciate the beauty of Dublin being so small,\" he says. \"You just walk everywhere. If someone's got a meeting, I leave half an hour before it and walk there. It's a nicer way to live a life. You can enjoy the city. In London you don't get that.</p><p>\"We had offices all over [London] city. I'd leave the house at 5.30 in the morning just to be in the office for seven, because you had to get the train, the tube. You'd spent the entire time in tubes getting in and out of them to get from place to place. And you still wouldn't get home until eight or nine at night. And it's not like you get anything done, because you don't. You just spend the whole time squeezing in and out of trains.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419341780'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381224272985/Kings-of-the-Realm-008.jpg' alt='Kings of the Realm' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Kings of the Realm</figcaption></figure><h2>Extra lives<br /></h2><p>However, for many Dubliners, jaunty commutes don't quite compensate for fickle employers: The departure of PopCap's European HQ (and with it, nearly 100 jobs) and then Jolt leaving, and taking 50 jobs with them, were major blows for the city. The problem with jobs from foreign investment is that they can – and do – up sticks and leave at a moment's notice.</p><p>The departure of these games companies is reminiscent of the Don Bluth situation: Sullivan Bluth Studios was a Dublin-based animation company best-known for An American Tale (a Disney collaboration) and The Land Before Time. After a few high-profile flops, they closed up shop here in 1995, but left a legacy of a world-class third-level animation course (still running in Ballyfermot, west Dublin) and some of its former employees went on to form multi-Oscar-nominated Brown Bag Films, Jam Media (who make BBC's Roy) and the Emmy-nominated Boulder Media.</p><p>Seadna Long, one of the founders of SixMinute Games, is a former employee of PopCap. He claims that the industry in Dublin is much better than it was this time last year because of the volume of indies and the experience they've acquired. \"It's a fair comparison,\" he says when I mention Sullivan Bluth. \"We know some of the guys who went through that [in animation]. The quality that came from the [big] studios is amazing. We know guys in Boulder who went through that. We still have a lot to prove to say that we could be successful as one of those companies. If we're anywhere near Brown Bag, we'll all be quite happy.\"</p><p>SixMinute is one of many young Irish developers that works in an \"incubation\" centre – cheap and sometimes free space given by patrons of the industry, be they government or corporate. Two of Dublin's most exciting developers work within a few feet of one another in a room in the corner of Digit's building: bitSmith and BatCat. The former made Kú, a Zelda-style mobile game that was critically acclaimed (by the Guardian and Edge among others) and BatCat, which made the nifty twin-stick shooter P-3 Biotic and is working on a promising hack-and-slash called Honour Bound.</p><p>\"On one hand, I feel tremendously supported by the government and everything they've done for us,\" says Owen Harris, studio head for bitSmith. \"This company wouldn't exist without the help of EI and Foras na Gaeilge [an organisation that promotes the Irish language] and all the other bodies that have helped us along the way. That's been huge. On the other hand, sometimes you can't help but look at either games education or the film industry and get slightly jealous of what they have.\"</p><p>But compared to even 12 months ago, Harris is optimistic about the scene: \"I think it's maturing. There are opportunities and dangers. I think it's wonderful that many of us are working on our second game. It takes time to learn this craft and to get better at it. And you can see certainly, what I see across the room, it's tremendous the way Honour Bound is coming together. And in our second game, FranknJohn you can see a real jump in quality, in game design and production.\"</p><p>\"We're only learning this through mistakes and failures and eventually you stumble upon something that works and you try to incorporate that into your routine. It's an ongoing process. Where we are now from a year ago, we have more experience in the country. More experience through making mistakes and making games. So that's the exciting thing. They way we combat the problem of inexperience is by having a very open relationship between different companies and trying to help each other out wherever we can.\"</p><p>Andrea Magnorsky, CTO for BatCat, agrees with Owen: \"From last year, I totally agree on the point about evolution. You see some people still there, some sadly gone, but now there are loads of new [indie developers]. Or some people changing things as well, but I guess that's expected and good. I'm glad we're still here. It's like a surprise: Surprise! We're still here another year!\"</p><p>\"But yeah, we've learned a lot by mistakes. It's evolving and it's also dangerous, because we're in a crucial point where there's a level of support and knowledge that needs to come into place for this to go bigger. Otherwise we could all survive … ish.\"</p><p>Magnorsky concedes there are sceptics in Irish business and government, but one or two high-profile successes will be enough to win people over: \"I think there are a few key companies who need success for people's perceptions to be positive; for them to say 'oh yeah' and stroke their chins.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419339507|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b03d15aedc6945f5cdd15bd23fc7b88a33a7af12 -->",

        "body":"<p>The long-awaited online version of Grand Theft Auto Online was released on Tuesday, replete with the much-anticipated connectivity problems that had long been feared.</p><p>In line with other major online game releases, Grand Theft Auto V's online launch was plagued by server errors and connectivity problems.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-launches-server-issues\">The console version of GTA V was released on 17 September</a> and is required to play the online version, which gives the classic game a multiplayer mode.</p><p>Shortly after its online launch, gamers said they were unable to access the game because of server issues, the game failing to load and disconnection issues. In response, the company created a webpage on its support site dedicated to providing updates on issues.</p><p>\"We apologize for any inconvenience, and thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this,\" GTA maker Rockstar Games <a href=\"http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200426246\">said on its support site</a>. It is also offering a service for users to receive automatic email notifications whenever an update is posted on the site. The company did not respond to requests for comment. </p><p>The console version of GTA made $1bn in its first three days on sale, according to the game's publisher Take-Two. Video game experts said that the problems were to be expected because of the game's popularity.  </p><p>\"It seems they've been trying to scale their hardware quickly to cope with the expected requirements based on their incredible sales,\" Simon Barratt of UK studio Four Door Lemon told the Guardian.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-grand-theft-auto-v-live\">Even if they were using an existing server infrastructure provider</a> such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure – which is unlikely and their wording suggests not – they would probably need to be adding to their cloud server farms to support the numbers they're expecting.\" </p><p>Last week, Rockstar also warned that its servers might not be able to handle GTA's popularity. </p><p>\"One thing we are already aware of, and are trying to alleviate as fast as we can, is the unanticipated additional pressure on the servers due to a significantly higher number of players than we were anticipating at this point.</p><p>\"We are working around the clock to buy and add more servers, but this increased scale is only going to make the first few days even more temperamental than such things usually are.\"</p><p>Rockstar's problems echo those felt by the release of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo 3 and Maxis's Sim City, which were overwhelmed on their launch days.</p><p>Maxis's network collapsed when the newest edition of SimCity launched in March 2013, and the hashtag #error37 started trending in May 2012 when Diablo 3 customers faced that error message and were unable to play the game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418786107|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|64cc194679b592bf11c6464144677564d39d0539 -->",

        "body":"<p>Put simply, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is a British creation that says big things about America. While <em>GTA IV</em> was a classic New York immigrant's tale, <em>GTA V</em> crosses coasts to comment on the hectic and the hollow that is Los Angeles, on the city's fascination with surface and its industries of image and light. So long as we're listening, anyway – otherwise it's a familiar, technically astounding playground of male power fantasies and might.</p><p>Mirroring the frantic intersections of LA, <em>GTA V</em> has three heroes with entwined stories that players can leap between at any time. This banishes the occasional complaint of past games – becoming mired in a particular area or mission – and is part of a wider move towards playability. <em>GTA V</em> is confident enough in its pleasures to dissolve the structures that once propped them up. The huge map, for instance, is explorable all at once and not in instalments, while mid-mission checkpoints remove lengthy restarts.</p><p>The result efficiently speeds players into the game's action, and even better, improves the action. Missions are more varied, mechanics more robust and even divergent tasks – trying yoga – feel purposefully embedded into the story. But for all the effort spent on<em> GTA V</em>'s story-led experience, the greatest thrill is breaking away from it. The world captures the texture and sound of California with uncanny precision, providing the tools to race through, fly over or thoroughly destroy it as one sees fit.</p><p>This clash of sophistication and savagery is central to the contradictory heart of <em>GTA</em>. Its radio stations deliver a cruel, precise mimicry of media fear-mongering even as you lightheartedly torture terrorism suspects. In a way, this is a key characteristic – <em>GTA</em> demands to be irreverent on its own terms. But the expertise and brilliance of the best game of the series by far has enough of weight to say without the needless noise of outrage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417770937|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3e3edb50dcdc35e87a204850091e360d02a7e541 -->",

        "body":"<p>So it's been a bad week. On Monday, I had to switch off Classic FM when it played Wagner, since he was an antisemite. Then I burned my copy of <em>The Hunger Games</em>, because it's all about children killing one another for entertainment. Finally, I threw my television out of the window because <em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Walter White is a drug-dealing psychopath, and the show's fans love him for it.</p><p>OK, I didn't do any of that, because that would be absurd. If we rejected every creative work that is in some way &quot;problematic&quot;, the canonical cupboard would be bare. So why are so many people I meet so shocked that, as a woman and, whisper it, a feminist, I enjoy playing <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>?</p><p>The GTA series certainly isn't female-friendly. Loved by teenagers, it has become one itself: yet in the 16 years of its existence, it hasn't once offered players the chance to experience its sprawling scenery and high-octane thrills as a female character. In the latest instalment, released last week, women are once again pushed to the margins.</p><p>You can rescue one whose car has broken down, spy on another having sex with her boyfriend while she checks her phone, and, of course, visit the obligatory strip club and &quot;make it rain&quot; bank notes. There aren't any female characters to root for, be impressed by, or even fall in love with. It was the same in the last game: women were there to nag you, or be bribed – whether with fancy dinners or cold, hard cash – into having sex with you. Women are GTA's wallpaper.</p><p>Given all this – and the way the series has allowed you to visit a prostitute, then kill her to get your money back – perhaps the horrified reactions shouldn't be surprising. When I went on<em> Channel 4 News </em>to talk about <em>GTA</em>, Jon Snow asked: &quot;Aren't you worried, as a woman, that the whole thing isn't a bit creepy?&quot;</p><p>Well, yes, it is creepy, but worried isn't the right word. I'm bored, more than anything, as well as irritated that another generation of young players isn't being offered something more exciting than this. &quot;The medium has grown up, and now the GTA franchise is a giant juggernaut that appears to be punching down instead of up,&quot; says female games journalist Leigh Alexander. &quot;I think that's why its problematic elements rankle – not because I'm 'offended', but because it seems lazy, repetitious. I'm not 'offended' that I can't play as a woman; I'm disappointed at the missed opportunity.&quot;</p><p>That feeling isn't unique to video games. Playing the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, I realised I feel about it the way I feel about Martin Amis novels. I admire the cold brilliance, the execution, the imagination: but I will never love that world, and I never feel inclined to return to it once the story is over. In both <em>London Fields</em> and <em>GTA</em>'s Los Santos there's no place for me; I can visit, but I'll never feel welcome.</p><p>What distinguishes games from books, or films, is that the dodgy sexual politics and wanton violence of one is used as a stick to bash them all. Partly, this is down to the old hangover of the idea that games are for children, when the average age of a player is now 30. Then there's the idea that games are a &quot;niche&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; pursuit, even though<em> GTA V </em>took an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/19/grand-theft-auto-5-first-day-record\" title=\"\">&pound;500m worldwide in its first day on sale</a>. Finally, there's the spectre of violence. Games are an easy scapegoat for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/anders-breivik-call-of-duty\" title=\"\">horrific acts committed by those who happen to play them</a>, despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2013/sep/19/neuroscience-psychology\" title=\"\">lack of evidence of any causal link</a>.</p><p>An unpleasant feedback loop has developed: between the sneers and the moral panics, gamers have become hyper-sensitive to criticism. We have a chip on our shoulders the exact shape of a tabloid front page. And that makes it hard to articulate the idea that while the medium is thrilling, exciting and innovative, individual titles can too often be derivative, nasty and riddled with stereotypes.</p><p>The <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series is certainly guilty on the last two counts. The novelist and critic Tom Bissell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/mar/21/tom-bissell-video-game-cocaine-addiction\" title=\"\">has described the protagonist's Jewish lawyer</a> in 2002's <em>Vice City</em> as &quot;an anti-Semitic parody of an anti-Semitic parody&quot;, while in the new game one of the main character's daughters has a tattoo that reads &quot;skank&quot;, and one mission involves you helping a paparazzo capture a starlet's &quot;low-hanging muff&quot;.</p><p>That's enough to make me sigh, but not give up. My own red line in games is the unthinking use of rape, whether as a &quot;character building&quot; incident for female protagonists (but, strangely, not for male ones) or as an &quot;edgy&quot; version of a sex scene. In the run-up to <em>GTA V</em>'s release, a disturbing forum posting went viral. &quot;I want to have the opportunity to kidnap a woman, hostage her, put her in my basement and rape her every day, listen to her crying, watching her tears,&quot; it read.</p><p>Now, I would flat out refuse to play a game where you could do that, regardless of whether it was forced on me by the storyline, or merely an option in sandbox play. So am I being a hypocrite running people over in my virtual car without a pang of remorse? I don't think so. &quot;In games the aim is, usually, to beat your opponent before they beat you,&quot; says Simon Parkin, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/grand-theft-auto-v-how-evil-should-a-video-game-allow-you-to-be.html\" title=\"\">who writes for the <em>New Yorker</em></a>. &quot;It's a game of reactions, speed and quick planning based upon principles of fairness – or of the protagonist overwhelming the odds. This is in no way analogous to rape, which is all about an assertion of power in an unequal equation. If you're threatened with rape, you don't respond in kind.&quot;</p><p>For the same reason, I am uncomfortable about <em>GTA</em>'s torture scene, where you extract information, along with a tooth, with a pair of pliers. Enjoying violence when it's not a &quot;fair fight&quot; feels very different to being quicker on the draw than an armed enemy.</p><p>This is where game fans' defensiveness becomes a problem. It takes a brave critic to slaughter a sacred cow – particularly by pointing out sexism in games – because the backlash can be so fierce. Anita Sarkeesian, who appealed for crowdfunding to make a web series about female characters, became the subject of an internet hate campaign as a result. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter\" title=\"\">On the #1reasonwhy hashtag</a>, hundreds of women vented about why they were such rarities in the game industry: they felt their work was dismissed, their opinions were ignored, and some were subject to sexual harassment at conventions.</p><p>That is not a message that many gamers want to hear, nor do they want to confront the fact that this is a mature enough medium to face proper scrutiny. When Carolyn Petit of GameSpot called <em>GTA V</em> <a href=\"http://uk.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-v/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review-6414475/\" title=\"\">&quot;politically muddled and profoundly misogynistic&quot;, </a>the review attracted more than 20,000 comments, many of them viciously hostile. &quot;GameSpot shouldn't have given GTA V to a woman to review … their input is pointless,&quot; was one of the most printable.</p><p>Yet Petit was incredibly positive overall about the title, giving it 9 out of 10, and she tells me that the <em>GTA</em> series is one of her all-time favourites. &quot;I'm much more engaged by a game that makes meanings I find problematic than by a game that doesn't attempt to mean much of anything at all,&quot; she says. &quot;If creators genuinely want to put out works that celebrate misogyny, they are free to do so, and we are free to talk about their work critically.&quot;</p><p>She's right: the conversation needs to be more sophisticated. Without decrying game violence as a symptom of our moral decline, we need to explore how that violence is presented, and what it means within the game world. The same goes for misogyny.</p><p>So yes, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is offensive – deliberately so, because controversy sells. Yes, it is &quot;problematic&quot; in its treatment of gender, race and sexuality. And yes, it is also an incredible technical and artistic accomplishment. In other words, it is just like any other milestone in any other creative field. Fans and detractors alike need to stop the special treatment.</p><p></p><p><em>Helen Lewis is deputy editor of the New Statesman</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417889369|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|878d0223d56ca864e4475cb59ed380a9cf055633 -->",

        "body":"<p>He was known as \"the godfather of the console\", building the Japanese firm Nintendo from a playing cards manufacturer into one of the world's most powerful computer games businesses. Now the gaming industry is paying tribute to the company's former president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who diedon Thursday  at 85.</p><p>For a generation of gamers, Yamauchi's Nintendo represented a golden era of mainstream gaming, dominated by classic titles like Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda and Metroid. In the early 90s, the company's mascot Mario, a moustachioed Italian plumber, became one of the world's most popular animated characters. A 1990 survey found he was more recognisable to American children than Mickey Mouse.</p><p>Yamauchi installed the company's central doctrine – that gameplay is always more important than technology. It is the philosophy that would continue to define the company after his retirement, leading to the hugely successful Nintendo Wii, which introduced a motion control device for gaming but relied on cheap off-the-shelf hardware, unlike its expensive rivals, the PS3 and Xbox 360.</p><p>The company said it was \"in mourning today from the sad loss of the former Nintendo president Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, who sadly passed away this morning.\"</p><p>Yamauchi took over the company after his grandfather, the previous president, suffered a stroke. He transformed Nintendo from a little-known manufacturer of Japanese <em>hanafuda</em> playing cards into the most powerful force in the global video game industry, and stood as president of the company from 1949 to 2002.</p><p>Yamauchi had a reputation for spotting talent and at a Nintendo factory he picked out engineer Gunpei Yokoi, who would eventually go on to develop the Game Boy handheld console. Yokoi had built a robotic arm for his own amusement, but Yamauchi saw the potential to mass-market the device as a product, kickstarting Nintendo's expansion into the toy and gadget market.</p><p>Noting the boom in video games, Yamauchi later asked young artist Shigeru Miyamoto to create an arcade machine that would appeal to the growing global audience. The result was Donkey Kong, a massive success in its own right and the origin of the Mario character.</p><p>The long-standing president would go on to oversee the company's entry into the home console business, which it dominated in the 80s and early 90s with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) consoles. At its height, Nintendo enjoyed a 90% share of the console hardware market.</p><p>Importantly, in the wake of the video game crash in 1983, where a glut of mediocre third-party releases for consoles such as the Atari VCS effectively devalued the whole industry, Yamauchi oversaw the introduction of Nintendo's \"seal of quality\" programme, which restricted the numbers of developers that could release games on its systems.</p><p>He intrinsically understood the importance of good games and talented game designers, rather than engineers and hi-tech hardware. In 2004, he told one Japanese newspaper: \"Cutting-edge technologies and multiple functions do not necessarily lead to more fun. The excessively hardware-oriented way of thinking is totally wrong, but manufacturers are just throwing money at developing higher-performance hardware.\"</p><p></p><p>A shrewd businessman, Yamauchi ensured that Nintendo remained debt-free throughout his long period in charge. Unlike the consoles marketed by most of his competitors, Nintendo machines were always sold at a profit rather than as loss-leaders for software sales; he also ensured that game publishers paid in advance for the manufacturing of game carts, removing the risk for his own company. In this way, he helped to revolutionise the way the games industry functioned.</p><p></p><p>Although Yamauchi stepped down in 2002 to be replaced by current president Satoru Iwata, he remained a major shareholder and retained an advisory role.</p><p>\"Hiroshi Yamauchi transformed a run-of the-mill trading card company into an entertainment empire in video games,\" said Ian Livingstone, co-founder of Games Workshop and life president of games developer Eidos. \"He understood the social value of play, and the economic potential of electronic gaming. Most importantly, he steered Nintendo on its own course and was unconcerned by the actions of his competitors. He was a true visionary.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417792824|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8e3af01932a5641dc8b77c7cc3282906d991ce38 -->",

        "body":"<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 has smashed its way into the record books with the largest ever first-day takings for a video game.</p><p>The latest instalment of the British-produced franchise took more than $800m (£498m) worldwide on Tuesday, underlining the appeal of the medium as Sony and Microsoft prepare to launch a new generation of consoles.</p><p>Billed as one of the most ambitious and expensive games ever created, the California-based crime epic has already more than recouped its $270m development and marketing budget.</p><p>Sales dwarf the previous $500m record set in 2012 by Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and beaten in a single day the $500m in revenue which Grand Theft Auto's fourth instalment generated in its first week nearly five years ago.</p><p>\"The last major Grand Theft Auto title sold just under 13 million [units] in the course of the year. This did that in a day,\" said Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research.</p><p>The success of a game which features mafia bosses, motorcycle gangs, man-eating sharks and cynical movie producers running riot in a fictional town loosely based on Los Angeles, has underlined once again the console's ability to host entertainment franchises more valuable than those produced in Hollywood.</p><p>The biggest ever opening weekend for a feature film was achieved by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011, when it took $480m worldwide at the box office – a fraction of Grand Theft Auto's single day achievement.</p><p>Described by the Guardian's games critic as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\" title=\"\">\"a monstrous parody of modern life\"</a>, the game unleashes the player's inner thug with missions to steal cars and rob banks. It has defied predictions that lavish video game productions will soon be sidelined by a multitude of cheaper and more disposable smartphone apps.</p><p>News that consumers are still prepared to part with £38 for a single title will cheer Sony, which releases Playstation 4 in the United States on 15 November, and its rival Microsoft, whose Xbox One goes on sale a week later.</p><p>\"No one title is an indicator of success of upcoming platforms,\" said David Riley, executive director at market researcher NPD Group. \"You can't say because of GTA the industry would be saved. But it is a boost in the arm of the industry that it has needed for quite a while. We are going to have a great holiday season worldwide.\"</p><p>In August, NPD found US sales of hardware, accessories and software grew year on year for the first time since October 2011, albeit by a modest 1%. But the boost was entirely due to new titles, with sales of consoles down 40%.</p><p>Take-Two chairman and chief executive Strauss Zelnick <a href=\"http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1856046&amp;highlight=\" title=\"\">praised</a> the Edinburgh-based team at Rockstar North which produces the GTA franchise for \"setting the entertainment industry's new standard for creativity, innovation and excellence\". He said in north America alone, 8,300 shops had opened their doors at midnight to make the most of the release.</p><p>Sony said Thursday it expected sales of its new PlayStation 4 console to reach 5 million units this financial year, about 40% more than its third console generated in the same period seven years ago. But smartphones already far outsell consoles, and less complex games like Angry Birds, Candy Crush and Dots are booming.</p><p>\"A lot of kids don't want $40 games any more, they want 40 $1 games,\" Nancy MacIntyre told Bloomberg. A former executive at game studio LucasArts, she now runs a social-gaming network Fingerprint Digital.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417772947|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5f53bfae943e43558fecbc7189b5cffd8b0f5696 -->",

        "body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-417432152\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>There has been a particular theory going round for the last year or so, that \"box set\" TV has replaced movies as the preferred form of mass, culturally meaningful entertainment. It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, <em>hints</em> at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.</p><p>Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.</p><p>This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.</p><p>The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychopathic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.</p><h2>On a mission</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558272'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379335926701/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Trevor feels the Heat</figcaption></figure><p>GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.</p><p>To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.</p><h2>Satirical scope</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558273'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336812314/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: sharp-suited Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises \"the realistic art of contemporary killing\".</p><p>This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is dangerous, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.</p><p>Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.</p><h2>Forgivable flaws</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558274'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379334561650/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: there's a lot of driving</figcaption></figure><p>This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a <em>lot</em> of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think \"Ugh, not another car ride\". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call \"the exposition expedition\": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.</p><p>Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.</p><p>Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.</p><h2>Seductive vision</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558275'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336519788/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Los Santos is glitzily superficial</figcaption></figure><p>Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.</p><p>The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout and Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.</p><p>The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your own vehicle spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.</p><h2>Complicity and culpability</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558276'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336675892/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: explosive action</figcaption></figure><p>And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. <strong>[Spoiler]</strong> Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim <strong>[spoiler ends]</strong>. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.</p><p>Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.</p><p>And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, \"you all live in Los Santos now\". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.</p><p><em>Tested on Xbox 360.

The launch of Grand Theft Auto V at midnight on Monday will see long queues snake down high streets at daybreak as the first copies go on sale.</p><p>The video game series is as controversial as it is successful. So far, it has sold more than 100m copies since it was developed in Edinburgh in 1997.</p><p>Players take on the role of a criminal in a fictional US city and rise through the ranks of organised crime with action-adventure and shootouts.</p><p>The latest version – known as GTA V – is the biggest and most ambitious yet, with an imagined world larger than the rest of the series put together, and follows three criminals as they steal, shoot and shop their way through the fictional city of Los Santos.</p><p>It has taken Rockstar – the firm behind it – four years to develop at a cost, according to one analyst, of about $137.5m (£87m) even before you include its marketing budget.</p><p>Rob Crossley, associate editor of gaming news site CVG, predicts that GTA V may sell twice as fast as Call of Duty: Black Ops, which in 2010 became the fastest selling game in the UK with 1.4m copies sold in one day.</p><p>\"Rockstar has reportedly allocated 3m copies for the UK launch,\" he says. \"It's unlikely all will be sold on day one, but it's an astonishing figure nevertheless. Put it this way, that launch allocation accounts for a quarter of all combined Xbox 360 and PS3 owners in the UK.\"</p><p>The central plot revolves around retired bank robber, Michael de Santa, returning to a life of crime with a young protege, Franklin, and his psychotic cohort, Trevor. But the appeal of the game is as much to do with the extracurricular detail. The world of GTA is full of diversions – from shopping malls to strip clubs and sports events, all open to the player.</p><p>\"Fans appreciate the sheer amount of thought that goes into the GTA games,\" says Nick Underdown, founder of fan site Rockstar Resource. \"A lot of the things people are looking forward to don't involve any criminal activity at all – a lot of the fun will come from the racing, parachuting, playing golf or tennis and all the other sports on offer – and it seems like a small thing, but the soundtrack is so important, it plays a massive part in the setting.\"</p><p>GTA V has more than 200 tracks for players to listen to while driving the game's miles of streets and motorways, from country classics to leftfield electronica and chart hits.</p><p>It's a key part of the appeal – the 2002 title GTA: Vice City featured seven CDs of 80s pop, which enhanced the game's narrative homage to that decade's film and TV shows such as Scarface and Miami Vice.</p><p>\"Lots of my customers have told me they've booked the day off to play it,\" says Gareth Rowbotham, owner of the Playtime chain of video game stores in Nottingham, Sheffield and Doncaster. \"I'm not being derogatory, but our customers aren't high-flying ABC1s with two cars and three holidays a year. They're on minimum wage, working 40-50 hours a week. They'll come in, buy GTA and play it for 12 hours straight. It's a way of escaping the banality of normal life.\"</p><p>Jevon Farr, a fan of the series who helps run community site GTAnet.com, explains the game's appeal. \"It's the freedom, the humour, the atmosphere, multiple concurrent protagonists, a gigantic and detailed world map, a dynamic economy, elaborate customisations and a multiplayer mode that becomes self-perpetuating with user-generated content … however, one of our team just said, 'I want to hurl cars down the mountains.'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417384702'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002664335/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg' alt='Grand Theft Auto V' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA V is more than a car game or a shoot-em-up, say industry experts and gamers. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p>For Adam Saltsman, a game designer, it is the sense of a living, dramatic world that gives the game wider cultural significance and appeal. \"The Grand Theft Auto series is the closest thing games have to a prestigious HBO or BBC series – it is like really high-end TV. There is lots of visceral low art – and I do not use that pejoratively, but there's also lots of high art too. The game is very large and very rich, not just geographically, but almost vertically. It has the gangster story and the sandbox stuff, but then it has all these satirical radio stations, and even weirder, deeper jokes and commentary.\"</p><p>Jesper Juul, a video game theorist and author, says the great expectations are down to GTA V being \"better than 99% of the cinema or novels. It is better for giving players a chance to consider what they would do in a fictional world.\"</p><p>The game's co-writer Dan Houser has described it as a satire on Los Angeles, and more specifically a modern Hollywood fading into insignificance in an era of outsourced production. GTA V is filled with failed actors, drug-soaked producers and various hangers-on. Every aspect of the society it creates was researched, mostly through first-hand interviews.</p><p>\"We just wandered around LA,\" said Houser. \"Our researchers did an incredible job of finding us some of the strangest people: retired cops, former FBI agents, entrepreneurs who'd retired on a massive fund of money at 28, people who specialised in knowing the underworld of LA – and everyone in between. We'd just hang out with them for a few days to see what happened.\"</p><p>GTA V is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. There are rumours an enhanced version will be available on the next-generation consoles, which launch in November. But many already see GTA V as a \"next generation\" game. It hints at a future in which games become more like virtual holidays, a form of all-encompassing escapism.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417148362|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|70aed0dc85feca5c3e18c670863e135b59279c14 -->",

        "trailText":"On the eve of Sonic Lost World's launch,  leader of team Sonic Takashi Iizuka discusses the evolution of Sega's mascot. By <strong>Simon Parkin</strong>",
        "headline":"Sonic the Hedgehog: past, present and future",
        "body":"<p>In recent years Sonic's appeal has waned or, perhaps, curved downwards, towards an ever-younger audience. But on his 1991 debut, Sonic the Hedgehog seemed unstoppable. Bristling with high-energy verbs – spin, roll, streak and ricochet – Sega's video game mascot-in-waiting made his rival Super Mario's clutch of moves seem sedentary by comparison. Leave MegaDrive Sonic unprompted on screen and, after a few seconds, he turns to glare out of the screen, tapping an irritable foot as if you're wasting his time, keeping him from his mission. Spinning at 200 fierce rotations per minute, Sonic was immediately a source of renewed vigour and direction for Sega, a company whose first decade in the video game industry had been characterised by mediocrity.</p><p>Indeed, at the time of Sonic's debut, Sega's rival Nintendo laid claim to 92% of the video game market share.</p><p>At the time Takashi Iizuka was a student at the Tokyo Denki university, studying electrical engineering. Iizuka's peers began to apply for jobs at Sony, Hitachi and the other Japanese electronics giants to where the university's orderly graduates traditionally progressed. \"When I was a kid I wanted to become a manga artist,\" he says. \"At university I learned to put those dreams aside. My parents encouraged me to look at more realistic options. Everyone was expected to go on to work for an electronics maker. It was almost a set path. But in my final year I decided to revisit those dreams and to focus on what I really wanted to do: create something fun and enjoyable.\"</p><p>That summer Iizuka played Sonic the Hedgehog. \"I couldn't believe the game and the technology on which it ran. It was a marvel,\" he says. Iizuka applied to Sega, much to his parents' chagrin (\"Sega wasn't well known at the time. It took a while for my family to come around\") and, in 1992 joined the company and the character, that would come to define his life.</p><p>Until the launch of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's approach to making video games was to develop cheap and quickly. Mark Cerny, the architect of Sony's forthcoming PlayStation 4, worked for Sega in Japan at the time, a company he joined after working for Atari. He recalls: \"Moving from Atari to Sega was like night and day. At Atari it was all about creativity, if the concept wasn't 100% original you weren't allowed to make it. Non-original ideas were thrown out. But Sega was about shovelling the titles out of the door.\"</p><p>Most of Sega's titles at the time were built within a strict three-month deadline, with a single programmer and one artist. \"They made 40 games in this way,\" says Cerny.</p><p>\"But by my judgment only two were really worth playing. Sega didn't get out of that philosophy till Sonic the Hedgehog, where the president decided to put three people on the project for 10 months. They ended up having five people for 13 months. It was Sega's first million seller.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog was designed by one of Sega's artists, Masato Oshima, who worked to a specific brief to come up with an appealing mascot character. \"At the time I had never been outside Japan,\" he says, \"so the experience of moving to America in my first working year was entirely daunting.\" And while the first game was a system-selling success for Sega, it was still unclear whether Sega had, in their restless hedgehog, a mascot of Super Mario's power and appeal. \"We had no concept that the character and series would become what it is today,\" says lizuka. \"For me it was one of those crucial chances we take in life; one of the ones that change everything.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 vastly outsold its predecessor and Iizuka continued to shadow Naka in America, working on two more sequels. But in 1995 the pair returned to Japan to begin work on a new game for Sega's 32-bit system, the Saturn. Iizuka was promoted to lead designer and, while Nights into Dreams shared visual similarities with the Sonic titles, it was a dreamy relative, Sonic through a glass darkly. \"It was the first time I'd worked on a new IP that wasn't Sonic,\" says Iizuka. \"We knew we wanted to create a game that was based on flying, not running, but there were immense challenges doing so within the confines of a so-called 'platform game'. How do you make a platform game without any platforms? We went back and forth for the longest time trying to get the design right.\"</p><p>During these years Yuji Naka led the so-called Sonic Team through a string of inventive hits, from Burning Rangers to Phantasy Star Online. But, contrary to perception, Sonic Team itself doesn't exist. \"There was never a set team as such,\" explains Iizuka. \"Whatever group of people was working on one of Naka's games at the time were referred to as the Sonic Team. But Naka had a keen idea of what Sonic Team's games should stand for.\"</p><p>Naka left Sega in 2006 and stewardship for Sonic Team passed to lizuka. What is the Sonic team essence for Iizuka, the quiddity of Naka's approach to game design and execution? \"One of the most important lessons that Naka taught me was the importance of game feel,\" he says. \"What a video game feels like in the hands is essential. That was there from the very beginning, and still is a core value today. Also, Naka was adamant that we should never be making copies of other games. He would always strive to create new things. That has stuck with me and become my goal.\"</p><p>Iizuka has another chance to prove his adherence to Naka's rules with the launch of Sonic Lost World on Nintendo's Wii U next month. \"For me it's a rethink of all that a platform game is and can be,\" says lizuka. \"One of the main things with Sonic games is speed: we wanted to make this more a controllable game, where that speed can be harnessed in a more effective way than perhaps in the past. It's a case of trying to marry the speed of the earlier Sonic games with the action of the more recent ones.</p><p>It's difficult to keep the classic Sonic feel. But we've kept the way that he moves, and that sense of speed.\"</p><p>One key challenge for the Sonic the Hedgehog series in moving from the 2D graphics of the 16-bit era to contemporary 3D is the increase in costs associated with a character who can fly through scenery quicker than most. \"It's true that, when you feature a speed-based character you require far longer levels,\" says lizuka. That immediately means the production is longer and development is more costly. Crafting background details keeps the costs up. We've tried to keep it to a manageable level while keeping the feel and fidelity of the game world. It's a balancing act, but one that we continue to improve at.\"</p><p>However, lizuka rejects the idea that Sonic has significantly changed over the past 22 years. He says: \"The surroundings have changed. The supporting characters and enemies have changed. But Sonic himself retains the same character as he did in the beginning. I've lived with Sonic ever since then. He's been a part of my life. He keeps me young.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417231376|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|991ad2b7fe000a069c18222f5f70101867dcdb48 -->",

After a year of pre-publicity and a five-year wait since GTA IV, the latest instalment in Rockstar's gangland opus is almost upon us. Featuring a game world larger than than any other title in the series, hours of cinematic sequences and a truly epic cast of crazed characters, Grand Theft Auto V has a scale and ambition that exceeds most triple A development on the current consoles. Indeed, people are already calling GTA V the first next-generation video game.</p><p>Last October I travelled to New York to get one of the first demos of the game. While there, I met Dan Houser, co-founder of Rockstar and co-writer of the Grand Theft Auto titles. There, I asked him about the process of building a new GTA from scratch, and how the different parts of Rockstar North combine to allow its complicated interplay of story, side-missions and sand box freedom. </p><p>In the first part of that interview, he tells us about the creative process, about how the characters are written and how they are brought to life; and about the complexities of marrying narrative and gameplay in such a large adventure. </p><p>Part two follows on Monday.</p><p><strong>How do you begin a Grand Theft Auto game? Are you always thinking of the next one?</strong></p><p>We don't see it as a production line in that way. We have a lot of guys on the team – it's not like a freelance unit that gets taken down and put back together again, so of course, when it finishes we do need to roll on to something <em>fairly</em> quickly, but there's a certain amount of downtime. Not till the very dying embers of this will we give the next one a moment's thought. And that's if we're going to do another one – we always said that if we couldn't think of something interesting to do then we'd stop – for this or Red Dead, but particularly for GTA. As much as anything they are a response to what we think went well or what we could do better or what could be different from the last one.</p><p><strong>GTA IV felt like a real change in direction – or at least a maturation – for the series…</strong></p><p>After San Andreas, with the move to high definition, we really wanted it to be focused and very tight – apart from anything else, we couldn't do any more than that – because of the complexities of just making an HD game at the time. This time, we wanted to make something very broad in scope because we have a bit more understanding of the tech and we wanted to use that to put a big landscape in there and lots of outdoor aspects to it. That was the first sliver of a concept.</p><p><strong>And how do things usually progress after the first kernel of an idea? How do you decide where to go next?</strong></p><p>I think it's Sam [Houser] and Aaron Garbut who decide… they'll certainly discuss it with Leslie [Benzies, producer], myself and a few other people, but it's between the two of them – Aaron especially because he has to plan it and build it. Sam gets really heavily involved in that early stage of where it's going to go. For GTA V, they were keen on LA for a bunch of reasons but in particular because we hadn't done it properly. We made San Andreas, but LA was only a tiny bit of that – it was a section of three small villages linked together by some cool countryside – so we felt that we could do something that was very different. Having a developer in San Diego and business in LA all the time, we all go over there at different points throughout the year – it's a city we know very well and feel we haven't done justice to. We felt we could do something very fresh and new there. So the very first decision is the place. LA gives us the countryside around Southern California, which is spectacular and good for the kind of game we wanted to make. You get the mountains, the desert – that seemed very appealing.</p><p><strong>And what do you think about next?</strong></p><p>On previous games, the next thing has been the character and the reason why they're in the world and what we're going to do with them in the world. That's the normal process – and alongside that, a feature set of things we want to do differently and things we want to improve. This time, we thought about Niko and John Marston: they're kind of single-player odysseys for want of a better word. They were so epic in scope. We thought, what can we do with one player that's better than that? Who, as Franklin, are you most likely to want to follow or believe or not believe? That process began to set the story in motion and the narrative evolved out of the characters' past and their future. As soon as we had those characters, that side of the game came together fairly organically – as it should do. Every time we get the lead character and what their reasoning in the world is, if we're doing a good job and it's the right thing, the rest of it… I mean, maybe the ending needs some work and some of the things driving it forward – but the overall feel of the story should feel very organic to us. If we get that feeling, we know we've got a story that people are going to find compelling.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-417225384\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002289829/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Theft Auto V\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto V's appeal, and that of the rest of the series, is as much to do with the extracurricular detail that creates a world full of diversions, say fans. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Do you feel receptive to influences during this period? The first few GTA games felt cinematic. It felt like you were channeling movie culture – has that changed?</strong></p><p>I think we tried to move away from that, quite consciously, after San Andreas. That was for a bunch of reasons, but I suppose primarily we felt that we wanted to say something that was not speaking about movies but about the wider media world. And also, when you're making something about the 80s, you want to talk about 80s media as much as anything else, but with something about 2008 or 2013, I believe we're as equipped to say that as much as anyone else. It no longer felt relevant to us to [pastiche movies]. We'd had a good experience doing that but it was time to move on and do our own thing.</p><p><strong>Where do you think games sit in terms of modern culture?</strong></p><p>I don't know, you tell me? Where do you think they sit?</p><p><strong>Well, it seems to me that because they are interactive and the way we live now is very fast and hyper social, they better reflect our lives than linear media. I think they're the natural story-telling medium of this century. How about you?</strong></p><p>I think that's a very interesting idea and I hadn't really thought about it in those terms. I wouldn't necessarily have the confidence to think in those terms – but <em>you</em> should as a games journalist because it's up to people like you to push those theories… It's up to <em>us</em> to make the best stuff we can make – it's not necessarily up to us to shout from the rooftops about how clever we are, how progressive we are, or how sophisticated we are. It's our place to make stuff that's as good as it can be.</p><p>And I suppose we're not really seeing the limitations in games… movies have limitations as a storytelling medium and so do games, but the limitations are different. Our job is to be aware of the limitations, find the strengths, and work toward those strengths. And I think as we get more experiences and the medium gets more mature, we do a better job of achieving that. That's not to say that games are perfect or flawless, it's still a very, very young medium.</p><p>Look at the evolution of our games from GTA 2 to GTA 3, through Red Dead. I'm not saying we do a good, bad or indifferent job, I'm just saying there's a clear evolution in technique, if not in talent – the technique at least has clearly moved on. In terms of what we're doing, our understanding, and the technology needed to support that understanding, the way that story and missions and off-mission stuff in the open world games all interplay – it's getting more sophisticated, that's definitely the case. We are hopefully treading ground that hasn't been trodden before and finding a better way of treading it each time. And I don't just necessarily mean as writers, but as technicians in terms of things like how we use the cameras to get you in and out of cut-scenes, the seamless interrelation of cut-scenes and the game, things like that. We've made so much progression – we've got better tech and better technicians working on it.</p><p><strong>One thing that really stands out is the quality of the cut-scenes, the acting, the interplay of the characters on screen – it feels a lot more naturalistic now...</strong></p><p>It used to be like watching youth theatre! The most you could possibly get in the world at one time was three people. It felt so amateurish, but we used to have to push it into the game and hope we could make it just about okay. Now, it's not <em>like</em> they're shooting a big budget Hollywood movie, they are. It's just that there's more of it and they're chopping it into smaller pieces. It's incredible to watch it going on, I feel like a complete spare part. I watch our incredibly talented director, Rod Edge, who's been with us since GTA IV, and occasionally give him a note. But fundamentally, it's their territory, I stay in the background. It's phenomenal what they're doing there – we have a mo-cap set-up that only Weta and James Cameron can match.</p><p><strong>And this is about full performance capture these days?</strong></p><p>We gave up the phrase voice actor in 2008 and we haven't used it since. We don't have voice actors anymore, because they're the same as the mo-cap actors. This is something we discovered by chance. We used to use famous actors, partly because the mo-cap process was so cumbersome and we could only have three people anyway. But on San Andreas, a guy, a sort of second-rate comedian, got offended by the script and stormed out of the recording studio, shouting, &quot;I'm not doing this, it's offensive.&quot; We just thought, well your agent did some great research there.</p><p>We were wondering who we'd get to do it and I was watching the videos of the mo-cap sessions and I was like, 'the guy who's doing it on set is really good, why don't we just use him?' And we did, and the proximity of the performance to the animation was much fresher than we were getting anywhere else. We did Bully straightaway afterwards and that was using kids - there weren't enough famous kids to do it anyway, so we used the same actors and it really brought it to life.</p><p>It's all based on a sound stage now. It's the same performance for voice and body. You do it all in one capture. Any one character might have a range of actors, you might have a stunt man doing some moves or a weapons specialist doing others, but for us, we're forgetting about the concept of an actor and just capturing the person who feels alive in this world. When we get it all feeling seamless, like we did with John Marston, we've done a good job.</p><p><strong>How do you build your characters for GTA? Do you take inspiration from people you know?</strong></p><p>I hope not! It's a sort of collaborative effort, there's not really a formula. Sometimes you see someone, someone on TV or walking down the street, or you meet someone and you think, 'There's an aspect of this person that's so ridiculous, I just want to capture that'. Or one of the other guys will go, 'I just met this maniac who walks like <em>this</em>!' – and the character will evolve from there. The first thing we speak about might actually get dropped, but it will be the atmosphere, some veneer of over-confidence or some rabid insecurity beneath it – that's what we'll wrap a character around. Or sometimes it will be one of us watching a terrifying documentary about a serial killer, and there will be one thing about him…</p><p><strong>So they're not people you know?</strong></p><p>The only one that I would confess to being fully autobiographical to me was this horrible character in Bully who was based on a kid I went to school with. The rest of them, they're all composites from me, from Sam and a bunch of other guys coming up with ideas. Then it's a question of getting the look right. But then once it's written, it's about the combination of animating, game design and acting.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about this collaborative process early in a GTA game?</strong></p><p>So me, Rupert Humphries and Imran Sarwar, one of the main designers, will sit around early in the game, talking about stuff, then Sam, Aaron and Leslie will look at it and sign off on it or offer feedback on it. But it doesn't really matter what we put down on the page, we might imagine certain characters are going to be very strong, and they're not, and others start out okay and turn out fantastic. It's all combined with Mike Kane, who's the chief character designer, and his guys. It's also the actors and Rod and the mo-cap guys bringing these character to life – everyone has input.</p><p>The idea, the page, is one thing, but the end result is often miles away. I think that's a strength rather than a weakness. Sometimes, a character will come back from the first round of mo-cap and you'll go, 'Oh, that's so wrong', and we'll say, 'Get rid of it and do it again'. But usually, they'll come up with something that's different from what we were thinking of – and much better. If we've cast a good actor and they really attack it, they'll help find a direction for it. We have a fairly low attrition rate on that stuff. But getting it to life is definitely a group effort. At all stages. Cameras, different techniques for different characters… there are lots of little tricks to bring it to life and make characters memorable – even though you're only with them a very short amount of time sometimes.</p><p><strong>Do you think about the meaning of the game in the early stages? Do you look to convey specific messages?</strong></p><p>Because of the nature of games, this combination of narrative and freeform experience, they can give you an experience that is very different from what someone else discerns – it can mean different things, which I think is their greatest strength as an immersive medium. We're very hands off in that regard, the authorial presence <em>should</em> be hands off in terms of determining interpretation, otherwise it's not remotely sophisticated. But I'm not saying <em>we </em>are sophisticated!</p><p><strong>You talk about collaboration a lot – it seems very important at Rockstar. Are you constantly having to rewrite narrative based on feedback from the game designers?</strong></p><p>Well… we chop it up. We have an overview that gets turned into a game design and a game flow and the missions. We do bits of it, I'll do some on one mission, the others will do some – it's very easy to fix bits that way. We're not precious about it... well, we're precious at the end – is it any good?</p><p>But it's only occasionally that we'll have real problems We have a couple of game designers with us all the time while we write, so we're not working against game design. It used to be back in the day that there was a bit more of a structural break between game design and story writing and we've really worked hard to get rid of that so we all feel like we're equally invested in it. There shouldn't be this big space: the story needs this and the game designers need that. Hopefully, if we've planned it all together, we should all feel one and the same, we shouldn't feel like separate departments. When it comes to actually writing the exact dialogue for within the body of the mission, the writer and the designer sit together and go through it line by line by line. But even before that, it should feel collaborative all the way along. The conflicts are usually: 'This idea looked great on paper but for whatever reason it aint working,' so we all have to agree on replacing it.</p><p><strong>Do you have creative flashpoints?</strong></p><p>Not really, it doesn't really work like that. The flash points are these: this bit's needed for the story, but it's not working in terms of gameplay – the mission is not fun, it needs to go. We always have missions that get cut out for whatever reason. We either have to rejig bits of the story to make it all tie together or we have to cut that bit of story onto a different mission. This game is very tightly bound because it has three interconnected stories the whole way along, it's complex. But everyone approaches them in the spirit of, 'How do we fix it?' If we all understand what each bit needs, how do we make it all gel together?</p><p>It's a bit like editing a movie in that you need to get it to a certain length. The tech is better now, it makes it slower to work but you can fix things more easily, you can repurpose bits, throw things away, fix them up again. We've always lost bits – 'Oh it's not making any sense!' – then you just redo one scene and it makes perfect sense. That's just a standard part of the process.</p><p>We pride ourselves on not being too pig-headed internally. Our goal as a company isn't for people to say that Rockstar has got good game design but shit stories, or good stories and shit game design; we want them to say Rockstar make good games. Ideally, they can't think about anything except, 'I love the whole experience'. The goal is to have the whole thing feel indivisible.</p><p><strong>Which is something that games criticism has to catch up with…</strong></p><p>You know, game reviewing, when it sort of breaks down into checklists, you feel like you may as well have made a lawnmower. It feels odd to me. I mean, games <em>are</em> sort of like a machine in some ways, but I still think that's a strange way to think about them. Don't think about the graphics or the music or whatever, just think about the whole. Was the experience engaging? That's what we're going for. We tailor our stories and our mission designs to make this total experience that will feel good alongside the graphics, alongside the physics – it should all feel cohesive, it should feel that the whole world exists and you can't really separate the elements. It's all got to gel together – that's when we think we've been successful.</p><p><strong>Part two on Monday covers the making of Los Santos, the emphasis on male characters and the chances of ever seeing another GTA title set in Britain...</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417198952|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|957afa2c31e8cf3ea560f1f1915bbf5f449e7258 -->",
