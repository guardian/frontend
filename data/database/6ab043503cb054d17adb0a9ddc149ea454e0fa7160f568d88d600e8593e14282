We're only a half-hour drive from the jittery Las Vegas Strip but here, on a couch in his office, Tyson sits quietly. He rests his familiar tattooed face in the palm of his hand. After Muhammad Ali he remains the world's most recognisable boxer, and one of sport's most infamous characters. Yet Tyson looks most like a 47-year-old man trying hard to understand his tumultuous life.</p><p>He was once a frightened little boy, beaten often by his mother in a condemned building in Brownsville, Brooklyn, who turned himself into the self-proclaimed baddest man on the planet. Tyson made and then lost almost a billion dollars as the last great undisputed heavyweight champion of the world whose controlled fury in the ring was eventually disfigured by madness and violence. He has had distressing problems with women, been to jail and then imprisoned even more tightly by alcohol and drug addiction.</p><p>Now, however, Tyson taps me gently on the arm. \"I surrendered to a higher power. I said, 'Help me. I can't do nothing no more. Guide me. God, whoever. I don't know what to do …'\"</p><p>Tyson has long been a masterful story-teller, with his obvious intelligence and street-hustling mentality producing a spellbinding raconteur, but this is different. He is not spinning a yarn here. Tyson, instead, is remembering his <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8068048.stm\" title=\"\">four-year-old daughter, Exodus, who died during a tragic accident in 2009</a>. His eyes fill with tears. \"I'll never get over it,\" Tyson says. \"I just can't …\"</p><p>Somehow he manages to control his crying, and he wipes his eyes. \"If I wasn't married I'd be very different. I'd still be that violent schmuck because that's all I once knew – how to hurt people. I used to do all that stuff and I never cared about the repercussions. But I've surrendered now. I was thinking of my daughter when …[he points to his teary gaze] … but I'm just happy I'm not that same person.\"</p><p>Tyson has a way of opening up now that allows the darkness to pour out of him without spreading the carnage that once trailed him wherever he went. He seems amazed he's still here, in one middle-aged piece. \"What's today's date?\" he asks, before recalling last Wednesday's milestone. \"On the 15th, it was five months since I went straight. I've been clean five months. I just don't want to do it no more …\"</p><p>Tyson admits in his relentlessly gripping autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/16/undisputed-truth-mike-tyson-autobiography-review\" title=\"\">Undisputed Truth</a>, that he is a cocaine addict whose recovery was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/aug/27/mike-tyson-drink-drugs-alcoholic-video\" title=\"\">hit by a relapse last summer</a>. \"I was sober three years,\" he says now, \"but I wasn't living a sober life. I know guys who don't take drugs for 20 years but they still don't live a sober life. They're bad, they're manipulative, they're not conscious of other people's feelings. A sober lifestyle needs a sober consciousness. But, still, the concept of happiness is fleeting. I read this book, The History of Happiness, and they go from Homer to Kennedy to Martin Luther King and everybody has a different definition of happiness. Some people believe happiness is overcoming adversity or getting out of a bad situation. Abstaining from sex and then having sex is happiness to someone else. It's so weird.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934754'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390564605630/Mike-Tyson-008.jpg' alt='Mike Tyson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'I look at [happiness] as just living healthily with a good moral sense.' Photograph: Jacob Kepler for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Has Tyson worked out his own definition of happiness? \"I look at it as just living healthily with a good moral sense. Having morality. You know any self-inventory I do tells me the same thing. I look back at the life I once had and see that I didn't have an emotional problem. I had a morality problem. I was without any morals.\"</p><p>Reading his book which, for all its sly humour and savage eloquence, is often harrowing, it's hard to shake the images of Tyson's mother, Lorna, and his mentor, Cus D'Amato, which rise from the page. Tyson relives one his bleakest memories at the age of seven. \"I was a pudgy kid, very shy, and I spoke with a lisp. The kids called me 'Little Fairy Boy'. Once, my mother was fighting with this guy, Eddie, and it's barbaric. Eddie knocked out her gold tooth and me and Denise [his sister] are screaming. But my mother's real slick. She puts on a pot of boiling water.\"</p><p>Tyson looks up – and I can see the looming terror of his tale. \"The next thing I know she's pouring boiling water over Eddie. He was screaming, his back and face covered in blisters. We put him on the floor. My sister takes a lighter and sterilises a needle and then, one by one, she bursts the blisters.\"</p><p>Forty years later Tyson remembers that he and Denise were crying. He gave his mother's burnt lover a quarter to comfort him. Eddie rose to his feet and trudged to the corner store to buy alcohol for Tyson's mother. \"So you see,\" Tyson notes, \"he rewarded her for it. That's why I was so sexually dysfunctional.\"</p><p>Tyson describes his mother as a formidable presence who skewed his perceptions of women. \"That's why I've had to embark on a new life because I used to look upon women as being equal in a physical confrontation. I would take women very seriously. As I tried to explain in the book I didn't grow up around frightened women. If you sleep they might kill you – especially if you disrespected them. I remember my mother – boom! boom! – attacking these men. It was a violent household.</p><p>\"Even today, I don't like looking at a corner of a room. I still think of being in the corner getting beaten by my mother. Back then it was like 'Holy Moly!' [Tyson laughs] but as you get older it seems funnier. But even though people think of me as 'Mike Tyson', this scary guy, I still have that fear today. That's what happens when you're a traumatised kid.\"</p><p>It still hurts him, but Tyson mentions his brother Rodney who is five years older than him. Unlike Iron Mike, Rodney went into medicine and he's a surgical assistant at a hospital in California. Tyson seems stunned by his brother's achievements. \"I was used to living in a slum, in a condemned building. But my brother never talks about that. It must affect him. He said to me last time we spoke; 'I heard you have a magnificent book …' But he hasn't read it. He's just so far away from that world.\"</p><p>Why wouldn't Rodney read his book? \"I don't know,\" Tyson sighs. \"He's the number one trauma guy in the country. He's awesome. He's taken bullets out of some of my friends. He's stitched them up and they've said, 'Mike do you know your brother is a surgeon …' I say, 'Yeah, I know.'\"</p><p>How often does he see Rodney? \"Not much. It's the really sad part about my family. We don't have a close connection. Too many demons, too much pain.\"</p><p>Tyson sounds neither self-pitying nor maudlin when he says, \"my mother never believed in me. Even when I started doing well in boxing and people were writing about me she thought I was insane. I'd tell her, 'Read this article, mom.' She'd say: 'Yeah, I'll read it later …' She didn't have any hope in me because I let her down so much. She must have wondered – 'What do these white people see in my son?'\"</p><p>D'Amato, his supposed saviour, was a dark and complex figure. The sentimental version paints him as a saintly figure, a wise old trainer who rescued Tyson from juvenile prison and used boxing to instil discipline and purpose into his wayward life. But, as Tyson suggests, \"there wasn't a happy muscle in his face.\"</p><p>Tyson nods at the memory. \"He was bitter towards Angelo Dundee [who trained Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard] and all those guys. Cus wanted to be the guy everyone spoke about. You know it's crazy. If he were alive I'd never say these things. I would've made him out to be a saint because otherwise he would have killed me! I would've been so afraid and intimidated by Cus.\"</p><p>A giant painting of D'Amato stares down at us from the wall of Tyson's office. The previous day, Tyson had listened to an old recording of his trainer praising him but worrying, just before his death in 1985, that \"he likes girls too much.\" Tyson cackles: \"He was fucking Nostradamus ...\"</p><p>Tyson stresses that D'Amato made him more aware than anyone that he should be proud to be black – but he is troubled by other memories. \"Cus told me that the word 'no' would be like a foreign language to me when I become world champion. I don't know if that was good advice at such a young age. Another time, when I felt no girl would ever like me, he came in with a baseball bat. He told me I'd need it to beat the women off me.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934755'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390565352261/Cus-DAmato-001.jpg' alt='Cus D'Amato' width='200' height='400' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mike Tyson says of his mentor Cus D'Amato: 'There wasn't a happy muscle in his face.' Photograph: New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>How old was he when D'Amato offered that warped perspective? \"Fourteen, maybe 15. The only morality I knew was to win, to conquer, to be the best. Everything flowed from there. It made me think I should have this, or that girl should sleep with me. I was programmed that way. Can you believe this old man taught me these things? He must have been way out there.</p><p>\"I watch some crazy clips of myself from back then and I can say that I probably wasn't sane for a period in my life. But Nietzsche was crazy too. He was born in 1844 and died in 1900 … but he only had sex once in his life and he got a venereal disease. He said some profound shit, man, but he was totally off his head. I have this book of the world's greatest letters and his mentor was Richard Wagner. But he wrote Wagner a scathing letter. He had thought Wagner was perfect but he was just a leech. Wagner was an extreme megalomaniac. Nietzsche saw through all this and said, 'Hey, you're full of shit. You're a charlatan.' Yet the day Wagner died Nietzsche saw a picture of him and said, 'I love him much …' Nietzsche believed that the poor were supermen, the poor were the ones who could endure and strike back. Dostoevsky too. He was a like a diva but you have to remember that, in 1846, his first novel was called Poor Folk.\"</p><p>Tyson learnt about Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Napoleon, from D'Amato and Norman Mailer. \"You can be an idiot and still learn something from those guys. You didn't need to go to school to get an education around Cus and Mailer. They talked about everything from such a high position. They never come down to laymen's terms. I learnt a lot and it's helped me through all the ups and downs.\"</p><p>Tyson and his wife, Kiki, were once nearly broke. They went to their local supermarket in Henderson and, after all his squandered hundreds of millions, he was worried that they didn't have enough money to pay for their small cart of groceries. \"I kept telling Kiki, 'Put that back' – because once, with my mother in Brooklyn, we didn't have enough. Fuck it. This lady at the till was taking items away and saying: 'Put it back!' I never forgot that feeling. My wife kept saying 'I've got enough, trust me.' I said: 'Baby, please, I don't want to be embarrassed.' But Kiki was right. We had just enough.\"</p><p>From Kiki, via an elderly white drug counsellor called Marilyn and his close friend Hope, to his youngest daughter, Milan, Tyson appears to be have been rescued by females. Of course, being Tyson, his gratitude is freighted with uncertainty. \"I love my boys, but my daughters make me want to be a nice person. I want my daughters to be treated the way I treat them. But I fear not being able to take care of my wife and kids the way they deserve. I fear that my life is just going to sink away and I'll just be a homeless bum. I have so many fears. I'm afraid of being desperate. But I'm trying.</p><p>\"My wife gave me a perception of gratitude that I never had before. I was just a prima donna my whole life, thinking I deserved everything I got. But since then I've learnt gratitude. Sometimes I still get angry because she'll be telling me: 'Remember when we didn't have this …' Now I've got an office and stuff. This is like being in heaven compared to how we were before. But I still want more. Ain't that crazy?\"</p><p>Tyson seems less crazy now than he has done for years. He's trying hard to stay straight and through his family, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2013/may/14/boxing-mike-tyson\" title=\"\">one-man stage show</a>, some acting, his book and his new company <a href=\"http://www.ironmikeproductions.com\" title=\"\">Iron Mike Promotions</a> [IMP], Tyson has enough to sustain him. Yet he is painfully honest about the perennial danger that he will fall again. \"I've had a little success with acting but I can't even enjoy it. I go somewhere with my wife and I'm scared I might get carried away and she might leave me. It's really hard to be happy … but I've got something that makes me think, 'Man, I don't want to fuck this up!'\"</p><p>Tyson has lived a life which, as he says, has been \"full of extreme highs and lows\", and one in which, for all his faults, he has often been treated like a piece of money-making meat. What does he think of people today, having seen the best and the worst of so many – including himself? \"Human beings are just a bad lot. Not everyone but the majority of people. Let's put it like this rather than in a collective sense. The people I invested the most time in disappointed me …\"</p><p>Yet he stresses that his wife and Steve Lott, one of his oldest friends and now his assistant, are two of the exceptions who bolster him most. They are almost always with him as Tyson tries to turn IMP into a boxing powerhouse. Even if he continues to struggle for a promotional license in some states, and he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/10/mike-tyson-banned-uk-rape-conviction\" title=\"\">barred from entering Britain last month</a> because of his criminal record, Tyson appears determined to make his new life work.</p><p>\"We're discussing this deal with Fox TV where we get 32 fights a year. Man, if that happens we'll be in the driving seat. It looks real good. This is the moment. The two shows we did recently superseded all the ratings ESPN had for their Friday night fights. But I never anticipated this thing being that difficult. Still, imagine if I was not Mike Tyson and how hard it would be then.\"</p><p>As the sun sinks across Nevada, Tyson shows me footage of his favourite old fighters. The office is empty but for me, Tyson and Lott and they dig out film of Panama Al Brown – the freakishly tall bantamweight of the 1920s and 1930s who supposedly had a tempestuous affair with Jean Cocteau.</p><p>Tyson has an encyclopedic knowledge of boxing which is at its most irresistible when he zips from one great old fighter to another, from Ted 'Kid' Lewis to 'Baby' Azizmendi, from Harry Greb to Jack Britton, the New York welterweight who had a reputed 350 fights. Panama Al flickers across a screen while Tyson marvels at his skill and venom. He seems happy – lost in boxing again.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934756'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390565016080/Mike-Tyson-008.jpg' alt='Mike Tyson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mike Tyson in make-up before recording an advertisement for WWE. Photograph: Jacob Kepler for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The next day Tyson has to make a television advert at his office for WWE [World Wrestling Entertainment] and the contrast between 21st-century wrestling and boxing at its greatest, all those decades ago, is stark. As if to showcase the similar difference in his own life, he points out that we first need to babysit his four-year-old daughter Milan and her friend. \"They're doing finger-painting,\" Tyson says while we watch the two small girls hard at work in the reception area. \"And we're in charge ...\"</p><p>Tyson is at his warmest and most generous today and it's impossible not to like him as we fritter away the hours before the wrestling advert begins. We talk about his facial tattoo. \"I just hated myself then,\" he says. \"I literally wanted to deface myself. I went to this tattoo artist and said I wanted my face to be covered in stars. He refused. He said I have a good face.\"</p><p>The tattoo artist suggested, instead, that he ink a Maori tribal design on to the left side of Tyson's face. \"It looks awesome. That tattoo is me. Sometimes I see people with tattoos on their face and I'm like 'Woah, this guy is crazy!' I forget that I've got one on my face.\"</p><p>Tyson laughs. \"In the beginning, some people were scared by it. But the bikers would shout out: 'Oh, that's beautiful man, great ink!'\"</p><p>Eventually, to the delight of Milan and her friend, the make-up artist arrives. It seems poignant now, setting aside his past brutality, that Tyson should have his face covered in make-up while his daughter croons, \"Don't worry, daddy, she's gonna make you look pretty!\"</p><p>Tyson looks bashful while the make-up artist powders his tattoo. \"Lipstick! Lipstick!\" the little girls chant, full of glee at the thought that Iron Mike will need lipstick for television.</p><p>We retreat to a conference room where the WWE commercial is being shot. Tyson winks at me before he addresses the autocue which is filled by a stream of words he needs to say out loud while being filmed.</p><p>His only mistake on the first take is to pay homage to 'Cold Stone' Steve Austin – rather than the old wrestler's 'Stone Cold' nickname. He does it again and again and again. By the fifth take Tyson the pro nails it – only for the producer to inadvertently cough during the last line. Tyson needs to do it again and so he tells the unblinking camera that one of the highlights of his career was the moment he was elected to the WWE Hall of Fame. He reels off the blurb a sixth time, perfectly, only to hear that someone had knocked on the window as they walked past.</p><p>Take Seven, however, is unbeatable. The first part is done but he still needs to do another and a Q&amp;A for the WWE.</p><p>\"I need a break,\" he says. Tyson leads me back into his office. It seems like he does not know whether to laugh or cry. Instead, in the quiet of a Friday afternoon, Tyson looks at me and smiles. \"Imagine if that happened 20 years ago,\" he says of his repeated WWE takes. \"I would've smashed up their cameras.\"</p><p>The 47 year-old former champion ponders the damage he would have done and, then, Tyson lets slip a soft laugh. \"Maybe I'm making progress. Maybe, after everything, I'm doing OK.\"</p><p><em>Undisputed Truth by Mike Tyson is  published by Harper Collins and  available from </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk</em></a></p>","headline":"Mike Tyson: All I once knew was how to hurt people.

Never mind the Ashes, or the meltdown in Brisbane, or the one-day series slipping away in Sydney: 10 matches and 131 days since their last victory in Cardiff in September, England beat Australia quite comfortably in the end, leading from the front in a 57-run victory at the Waca that was inspired by fine and fearless all-round performances by Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes.</p><p>Alastair Cook had announced at the toss – a little oddly given heads or tails normally does the trick – that he is now \"desperate\" to stay on as England captain, and in the moment of victory he raised his arms in a weary gesture of triumph before allowing himself to gambol about from team-mate to team-mate with a huge grin on his face. Cook has suffered horribly over the last three months, from a bad back in the opening warm-up match to the successive annihilations of Test and one-day series. Now, though, he will at least always have Perth.</p><p>Powered by yet another display of controlled late-innings butchery by Buttler, England had posted 316 in the first innings, forty runs more the previous highest-winning chase on this ground. With David Warner, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin all missing here, they really weren't going to get a better chance to avoid the looming threat of a 10-match Cookwash decider in Adelaide on Australia day. If the prospect of complete annihilation narrowly avoided is hardly cause for jubilation, moments of grace on this unrelentingly traumatic tour have been scarce and England will seize this one happily.</p><p>England won the toss and batted first for the fourth time having gone into this match unchanged. Australia included an extra pace bowler on a pitch that gleamed in the sun, and which seemed to have quickened up by the afternoon as Australia set off with familiar intent in pursuit of England's total.</p><p>With Aaron Finch in true-track biffer mode Australia surged to 40 for no loss off their first five overs before Tim Bresnan drew an edge from Shaun Marsh that was well caught by a leaping Ian Bell at second slip. Cook remained aggressive in the field throughout even as Australia's 50 came up in the ninth over and nerves began to fray just a little. Finch already looked central to proceedings with Australia's batting order more of a Twenty20 affair, tailing away into a miscellany of all-rounders.</p><p>James Tredwell was allowed to bowl a nagging spell of four overs for 12 runs before Finch, tiring of prodding, hit him on to the roof of the stand at cow corner, and then flicked the next ball flat and hard into the crowd at the same spot. Matthew Wade was finally euthanised from the crease after a scratchy 23, caught at mid-off swiping at Ravi Bopara in the course of – yes, really – England's first maiden over of the series.</p><p>George Bailey departed at 133 for two, well caught by Buttler down the leg side off Ben Stokes, and England were – cautiously – edging in on victory. Finch stroked his way to a fine and occasionally brutal second hundred of the series off 97 balls with eight fours and four effortless sixes.</p><p>Steve Smith came out swinging and also left swinging, edging Stuart Broad behind and finally Finch fell, guiding a short ball from Bresnan into Broad's hands at third man. England were giddy. When Glenn Maxwell was caught by Buttler off Stokes to leave Australia 225 for six and needing almost nine an over, it was only the unscabbed wounds of Brisbane that stilled any premature thoughts of victory. Stokes had suffered at James Faulkner's hands last week, but he got his man here and celebrated with relief as much as any great joy, before Bresnan took the final wicket of James Pattinson.</p><p>Earlier England had batted with a sense of concentrated aggression on a true pitch. Cook took 14 off Nathan Coulter-Nile's first over, thrashing past point with a sense of contained fury. Bell twice stepped down the pitch to loft Faulkner back over his head with lovely easy power, not so much bullying the bowling as tickling it expertly to death, and England were motoring at 55 without loss after eight overs.</p><p>Cook was bowled slogging by Maxwell and Stokes came out at No3 as Bell went to a 50 off 48 balls before departing in the limpest fashion, caught at very short fine leg flicking daintily at Dan Christian's fourth ball. Stokes, though, continued to rumble, bringing up a fine first fifty in one day cricket with a huge straight six off Maxwell, a controlled, assertive innings of orthodox attacking strokes.</p><p>Stokes was out for 70 skying Faulkner's slower ball, Bopara again went cheaply before Buttler began to find the boundary with great power, including a pair of fizzed cover drives off Mitchell Johnson, who was a shadow here of the menacing figure of the Test series. In 20 international overs post-moustache, Johnson's figures are one for 131.</p><p>Buttler continued to bat with a sense of controlled brutality before he was caught at third man for 71 off 44 balls. What a player he is, far too talented to be overlooked by England in any form of the game he wants to play. With Stokes picking up four wickets as Australia fell away and Buttler also taking four catches, there was evidence of the explosive ability in this England team. For now they will simply celebrate a win.</p>","headline":"England finally beat Australia and Alastair Cook stays as captain","trailText":"<p>Ten matches and 131 days since their last victory in Cardiff in September, England beat Australia by 57 runs in Perth</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6b4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564827857/Alastair-Cook-leads-his-v-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564827857/Alastair-Cook-leads-his-v-003.jpg","wordcount":"924","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427927592","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601045","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Barney Ronay at the Waca","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032024","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:47:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/england-beat-australia-alastair-cook-captain","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/england-beat-australia-alastair-cook-captain","tags":[{"id":"sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","webTitle":"Australia v England limited-overs internationals 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-cricket-team","references":[]},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/england-cricket-team","references":[]},{"id":"sport/alastair-cook","webTitle":"Alastair Cook","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/alastair-cook","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cricket","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/barneyronay","webTitle":"Barney Ronay","r2ContributorId":"21010","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/12/barney_ronay_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Barney Ronay is senior sports writer for guardian.co.uk.

Hawkeyethenoo and Grey Mirage, the top two in the weights, both run off three-figure marks, while Timeform has 13 of the 14 runners separated by just 7lb in its ratings.</p><p>Most of the leading contenders are all-weather regulars, but Burning Blaze, a solid mid-80s horse on his turf form who was last seen at Glorious Goodwood, is an interesting running too in the colours of Qatar Racing.</p><p>In such a competitive event, it is a slight surprise to see Hawkeyethenoo, the top weight, clear favourite at a best price of 3-1, with the rest priced up at 6-1 or bigger. Jim Goldie's eight-year-old has acquitted himself well on his two starts at Lingfield this winter but without suggesting he has such an obvious chance as the market suggests off a 1lb higher mark than last time out, when he was beaten one-and-a-half lengths into second place in a similarly competitive heat.</p><p><strong>George Guru (3.05)</strong>, an 8-1 chance this morning, could be the one to beat him. He has been running well without winning so far this winter, but has mostly been running at a mile when his very best form is over a well-run seven furlongs. He was beaten two necks at Kempton in November off today's mark, with Tarooq – who went on to beat Hawkeyethenoo next time out – back in fifth. Adam Kirby, who has a 20% strike-rate at Lingfield since the start of November, is a positive jockey booking too.</p><p><strong>Aureolin Gulf (6.30)</strong> is in a much lower grade at Wolverhampton but still looks a decent bet at 9-2 to back up solid recent form with a win, while <strong>Seven Woods (2.55)</strong>, who returns to hurdling after a spell over fences, is worth chancing in the Pertemps qualifier at Huntingdon.</p><h2>In other news...<br /></h2><p><strong>Alan King</strong> has his first runner since New Year's Day, having closed his Wiltshire yard to combat a virus that was inflaming the lungs of most of his horses. The noises emanating from the yard have become more positive in the past week, so let's hope all is well; it's a miserable thing to happen to anyone and King took a long time to get over a similar issue five years ago.</p><p>His runner today is <strong>Secret Edge</strong> in Huntingdon's 4pm race but he's begging us not to judge the health of his yard on the sole basis of how this one runs. He's out today because he's entered in a sale next week.</p><p>King will have other runners at Doncaster and Cheltenham tomorrow and they will give us more of an insight.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day five<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Mappin Time 11-4</p><p>Imjin River 3-1</p><p>Reggie Bond 2-1</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p><p>Wood Yer 10-1</p><p>Catching On 11-2</p><p>Kayf Moss 6-1</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p><p>Persian Herald 8-1</p><p>Ubaltique 4-1</p><p>Cloudy Joker 5-2</p><p><strong>Thursday</strong></p><p>Time To Think 2-1</p><p>Full Ov Beans 11-2</p><p>Straits Of Messina 15-8</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>CorvusFrugilegus</strong> +18.75</p><p>. . . who found his sixth winner of the week in Time To Think. <strong>72luca</strong> (+13.50) moved into second place by pairing that one with Full Ov Beans.</p><p>For today's thrilling climax, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>2.45 Doncaster</strong>, <strong>2.55 Huntingdon</strong>, <strong>3.50 Doncaster</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GET THOSE TIPS IN EARLY!

Sampras was in the audience at the Rod Laver Arena, the first time he saw them play each other live.</p><p>\"I never thought about 13 grand slams, or 14 either,\" Nadal said. \"I need to keep playing great to win this title. Stan's serve is huge, and he is hitting the ball very hard. I will try to play the same as I did tonight. When I play with Roger, it's a very special feeling. We play a lot of times for important things in our career. He's a really great champion, and it's an honour to play him. We played some tough rallies in the first set, he was playing some very aggressive tennis. I think tonight I played my best tennis of the tournament. After missing last year, it is very emotional for me to be back on this court.\"</p><p>Nadal tried to downplay the effect of a blister on his left hand and it did not seem to inconvenience him unduly – at least not as much as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/rafael-nadal-defeats-grigor-dimitrov-australian-open\" title=\"\">his quarter-final win over Grigor Dimitrov</a>. \"Too much talk about the blister,\" he said. \"It is OK. It is the position of the blister, it is difficult to cover. Normal life, it is OK, but to play the best players in the world it is a challenge. I have a very tough opponent in Wawrinka. He's played some amazing tennis. He will come to the final with a lot of confidence.\"</p><p>At the beginning, this semi-final had the feel of a major prizefight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier-muhammad-ali-1971\" title=\"\">Nadal's Joe Frazier to Federer's Muhammad Ali</a>. And the crowd might have been divided down those lines, too, leaning towards Roger, as ever, perhaps 75-25, craving artistry and style over strength and doggedness. In the early exchanges, Federer's sharper ground strokes, with subtle changes in direction and weight, as well as his new-found eagerness to kill the point at the net at the earliest opportunity, kept Nadal on the back foot. Going into the match, Federer had won 135 of 178 net approaches, and Nadal was sometimes three metres behind the baseline when receiving, and not much further forward after serving, so wary was he of his opponent's aggression.</p><p>Nadal was the first to get into a spot of trouble, having to fight through deuce to hold in eight minutes for 2-2 after a quarter of an hour. Then a stinging cross-court return and a passing shot down the left flank that only Nadal could conjure gave him two break points in the seventh game. But he failed to handle the tricky wind inside the open-roofed arena and his last shot of the game was a shanked forehand that skewed into the seats.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to suffer in the breeze in the ninth game, as he double-faulted and netted to give Nadal his third break point, but hung on, and the Spaniard had to serve to stay in the set at 4-5 after 36 minutes. He held with an ace – as did Federer for a 6-5 lead. The pressure was back on Nadal – who held to force the tie-break, then won it, Federer's final forehand floating long.</p><p>However, after holding to 30 in the first game of the second set, Nadal needed his blister tended to – not a good sign. It did not matter. When Federer slapped a forehand wide in the sixth game, Nadal led 4-2 and comfort flooded his tennis, the pain of his wound forgotten. He closed out the set and his confidence rose appreciably.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to struggle, and he did not handle the challenge so well. The fightback never really took off, from an unpromising deficit, and, when he netted another backhand volley, he fell 2-1 behind in the third, with the end beckoning more quickly be the shot. He delayed the fall to break back at 2-2, but Nadal forced him wider and deeper, and Federer faced a mountain when serving to stay in the match at 3-5.</p><p>He went down in flames, of course, belting an ace and making one final charge at the net, only to be passed again for deuce. There was absolutely nothing he could do about Nadal's arrowed passing shot for a second match point and he was resigned, maybe even a little relieved, when the agony ended on the end of his concluding forehand, which sailed harmlessly over the baseline.</p>","headline":"Rafael Nadal ruthless in beating Roger Federer at Australian Open","trailText":"Rafael Nadal saw off Roger Federer in three hard-fought sets to book his place in the Australian Open final","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m69g","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","wordcount":"813","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427922130","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601035","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne Park","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031982","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:31:50Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","tags":[{"id":"sport/australian-open-2014","webTitle":"Australian Open 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/rafaelnadal","references":[]},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/roger-federer","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australian-open","webTitle":"Australian Open","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevinmitchell","webTitle":"Kevin Mitchell","rcsId":"GNL042083","r2ContributorId":"15957","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/31/kevin_mitchell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Mitchell is the tennis and boxing correspondent for the Guardian and Observer.

Bailey's decision to take Maxwell (1-37)&nbsp;off after 9 relatively frugal overs and the call to introduce the previously-battered&nbsp;Pattinson for the 49th were both head-scratchers.&nbsp;</p><p>Pattinson was all over the shop again and continues to look short of a gallop. There is no mistaking the fact that Australia erred in leaving both of Doherty and McKay out of the line-up&nbsp;but the bowlers picked also failed to do their job. Christian (0-15 off 3) might have bowled a few more overs I thought.&nbsp;Johnson was smashed and the rest were erratic at best.&nbsp;</p><p>England started and finished well, though I continue to be puzzled by Gary Ballance's presence at four. Surely either of Morgan and Buttler would have been better off keeping the momentum going today? The latter was very impressive with his 43-ball 71 and Ben Stokes really came out of his shell in his 74.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, England have something decent to bowl to now and Australia carry a little bit of pressure to extend this winning streak.

England are still going at 6.33 an over, even with Maxwell tying down the other end. Johnson swings one away from Stokes and the Englishman can't get anywhere near it but manages to keep out a fuller, straighter yorker next up.</p><p>The paceman then forces a thick outside edge but it falls short of Shaun Marsh at first slip. &nbsp;Stokes marks the reprieve with a two out to the mid-wicket boundary and I'm starting to think the slips cordon was&nbsp;far too deep there.

There are dots on every imaginable&nbsp;line and length. Clint McKay sits with his feet up on the boundary and must wonder what he's done wrong to miss out today. He was Australia's one-day player of the year last year and his stats put him among Australia's 50 over greats. What gives?&nbsp;</p><p>A leading edge from Stokes comes after four balls of consistent pressure from Coulter-Nile, whose over is in stark contrast to Pattinson's struggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resultant single is the only score of an excellent over.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52e1ea76e4b0532c050965d7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T04:24:45.252Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">15th over: England 106-1 (Bell 42, Stokes 13)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>As Maxwell continues, I'm again thinking about the merits of even picking Pattinson in this series. Sure he needed some kind of warm-up for the upcoming South African series but he's bowling like a drain.

Bell chips it straight at shoulder height for another boundary, though it wasn't without its risks that shot. Stokes then tries to get in on the act by throwing his entire body at a cover drive but Pattinson swings it past his outside edge and through to Wade behind the stumps.&nbsp;</p><p>Stokes then turns another straight one around the corner for two and finishes the over with a crisp straight drive for four&nbsp;wide of mid-on.

The bowler reverts to type (well, recent type) and sprays the second delivery down the leg side for another wide and the next one would have been too if Bell hadn't deposited it over mid-wicket for four. It's the 14th boundary of the innings so far.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/barneyronay/statuses/426315074949496833\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Good to see high standards at the WACA.

After conceding a single to Bell, he bowls a wide of his own with a trampolining bouncer that Cook was unable to lay bat on and then gets murdered through point by Cook's uppish cut shot. Not once, but twice. The second was sublime, hit lower and flatter forward of the man at point.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly for the bowler, none of Cook's shot are as sublime as the last, which he clatters through cover for another four. 14 came from that over and the Aussies are under fire here.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T04:00:01.515Z\">at 4.00am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52e1e2c2e4b00f28d73d3148\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T03:53:51.226Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">7th over: England 41-0 (Cook 21 Bell 15)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Bailey wisely decides that this bowling performance needs an immediate shake-up so Faulkner is on to replace Johnson.

The line of both these opening bowlers has been consistently awful so far, either too straight or straying down leg side to the English&nbsp;opening pair.&nbsp;</p><p>To a short one outside off stump, Cook swishes across the line but can't make contact and a similar stroke from the next ball flies over gully for a streaky boundary.

I guess an optimist would say that the only way is up and a pessimistic might just let out a sad, broken whimper before pulling the covers back over their head and trying to sleep through the horror.</p><p>Australian skipper and recently-named ODI player of the year George Bailey has been declared fit to play, while Michael Clarke, David Warner and Brad Haddin sit back and have a rest. Replacing them in the squad are Steve Smith, Mitchell Johnson and Matthew Wade. Australia are also now officially the top-ranked ODI team in the world thanks to India’s loss to New Zealand on Wednesday. If they lose today it’s all over though – shunted back to second place within two days. Why didn’t they make the most of it and spend yesterday parading through Perth in an open-top bus?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52e1bbfde4b00f28d73d3134\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T02:46:23.027Z\">2.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Russell will be here before long to see if England can find another imaginative way to lose, or whether the tide of the summer will improbably turn in the fourth ODI of the series. In the meantime, here's a brief reminder of how the last one went:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"A lot has happened in two weeks,\" Alastair Cook said after a comprehensive seven-wicket defeat at the SCG. \"We've kept losing games of cricket and I haven't been able to turn it round.\" Cook will at least stay in place for the final two matches of a chastening series that has left England one match away from equalling their worst losing streak of 10 successive defeats, with the chance to set a new personal worst in Adelaide in the final match.</p><p>For now it was a case of another week, another ground, another series lost at the Sydney Cricket Ground. England have already been out-batted and out-bowled by Australia on this tour. Here, by way of variation, they were comprehensively and aggressively out-fielded. In the end Australia's batsmen made laughably light work of their run chase, reeling in England's 243 with 10 overs to spare.</p><p>But in a way Australia's victory was most notable for their performance in the field, with Michael Clarke and Dan Christian taking spectacular one-handed catches to get rid of Ben Stokes and Eoin Morgan respectively. Perhaps the most telling moment came in the first over of Australia's reply. David Warner, who had earlier run out Ian Bell with a kind of one-stump miracle-throw from deep point, had given up on making his ground as Ravi Bopara prepared to hurl down the stumps. Bopara did not even get close. England's shoulders sagged. Warner went on to clout a gleefully dismissive 71.</p></blockquote><p></p> </div> </div>","headline":"England beat Australia in fourth ODI – as it happened","trailText":"Rampant Australia eye up a

Federer dumps a backhand long to give Nadal his first break point. To be brutally honest, Federer has looked beaten for a while. He saves the match point, though, Nadal netting, but he's soon facing another one as Nadal dashes on to a volley and curls a ridiculous forehand pass down the line. Federer misses a first serve. Trouble. Nadal senses his moment but all he needs to do is wait for the error.

A feature of the match against Murray was Federer's willingness to attack the net - a dangerous tactic against Nadal, potentially - and a spinning volley drags Nadal forward again. He tries to flick another backhand past Federer but he wins the point with a fine forehand volley. 0-15. Suddenly Nadal is in a spot of bother. He mishits a shot that drops shot and then can only block Federer's backhand wide. 0-30. He pulls it back to 15-30 with a impeccably backhand pass. There we see the problem Federer has by coming in; Nadal rarely misses. Federer then knocks a backhand long to make it 30-all, before netting a forehand. 0-30 becomes 40-30, just like that. But that becomes deuce as Federer skips around a serve and skelps a forehand return down the line. It's not coming back. Nadal survives this test, though. Federer misses a forehand and then Nadal whips a forehand volley from right to left to hold.<br></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52e22adee4b065f7ddbb8462\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T09:00:46.146Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>First set: Federer* 2-1&nbsp;Nadal (*denotes server): </b>Both players are wearing brightly coloured trainers, <i>writes your resident fashion expert</i>. Federer is in red, Nadal in bright pink. Federer is taken to 30-all in this game as Nadal starts to get into his stride, striking his forehand crisply and thunderously. A beautiful forehand from Federer makes it 40-30 and he wins the game as he pulls Nadal to the net with a drop-shot. Nadal tries a cross-court backhand but Federer reads his intentions and taps the ball back over the net and into the open court.<br></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52e22a3ce4b065f7ddbb8461\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T08:56:57.739Z\">8.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><b>First set: Federer 1-1 Nadal*&nbsp;(*denotes server): </b>Nadal, taking his time in his trademark style, walks to the baseline to serve.

Federer opens the serving then and he's quickly into a 40-0 lead as Nadal fails to make any of his returns.

Rafael Nadal. Australian Open. Semi. Final. What else to say? I'm giddy enough with excitement.</p><p><b>It's not enough?</b> Fine, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDFGINcPH-4\">I guess I'll just have to write my own preamble</a>! It's Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open semi-final and <strike>seriously, what more do you need to know?</strike> everyone 's mighty excited about the 33rd meeting in a classic rivalry that has dimmed in the past few years. This is the first time they have met in a grand slam since Nadal won here in the semi-final two years ago. We thought we might never see the likes of this again. It seemed the time had passed when sparks would fly between these two in grand slams, a combination of Nadal's time out with a knee injury and Federer's relative decline from the days when he dominated tennis as a matter of course, playing as if he could beat an opponent while filing a tax return and performing heart surgery at the same time.</p><p><b>But that was rarely, if ever, the case against Nadal.</b> While Federer gave the young Spaniard a lesson in the art of grass-court tennis in the Wimbledon final in 2006 – at which point he was more or less unbeatable – his other experiences against Nadal have ranged from the disappointing to the downright traumatic, via the heartbreaking and the embarrassing. Who can forget Federer weeping after losing in five sets in the Australian Open final in 2009? It must be difficult for the greatest player of all time to understand how it is possible that this young buck can keep on beating him. That's not what's supposed to happen.</p><p><b>But that's what tends to happen.</b> It's not just the numbers that make us proclaim Federer as the GOAT, although they do make a convincing case, it's the elegance and artistry with which he plays that makes us love him. It's why the majority of neutrals will want to see him win this match. But the counter-argument is that he has a 22-10 losing record to Nadal and that he has lost eight of their 10 meetings in grand slams. There's something about Nadal's brutal power and hard running that unnerves Federer and makes his aim go haywire. Even if Nadal's hand is red-raw because of that blister, his record against Federer means it's hard to see him losing one. Sorry to any romantic types, don't shoot the messenger, I'm just dealing out cold, hard facts. The numbers don't lie and Nadal has won their last four matches – three were on hard courts.</p><p><b>But let's make the case for Federer nonetheless.</b> 1) He's Roger Federer. 2) He's got a brand new big racket that's making him hit the ball cleanly. 3) He's improved his fitness. 4) He's unveiled a brand new volleying game that bamboozled Andy Murray and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. 5) Nadal struggled in his quarter-final against Baby Fed, Grigor Dmitrov. 6) Lists are fun.</p><p><b>Anyway this is all just hot air.</b> It's Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open semi-final! What more do you need to know?</p><p><b>Play begins at:</b> roughly 8.30pm, but don't hold me to that.</p><p><b>The winner plays:</b> Stanislas Wawrinka. He's Swiss. So is Federer. Come on, put it together.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-24T10:12:59.731Z\">at 10.12am GMT</time></p> </div>","headline":"Rafael Nadal beats Roger Federer to reach Australian Open final – as it happened","trailText":"<b>Game-by-game report: </b>Rafael Nadal beat Roger Federer 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the Australian Open final, where he will play Stanislas Wawrinka","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6vj","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390557248300/e91bce1c-7219-405f-a469-a072b89fc0e5-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390557248300/e91bce1c-7219-405f-a469-a072b89fc0e5-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427874549","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e15c31e4b00f28d73d3101","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","displayRelativeTimes":"false","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031742","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T07:00:16Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-live-mbm","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-live-mbm","tags":[{"id":"sport/australian-open-2014","webTitle":"Australian Open 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australian-open","webTitle":"Australian Open","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis","references":[]},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/roger-federer","references":[]},{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/rafaelnadal","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/minutebyminute","webTitle":"Minute by minutes","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jacob-steinberg","webTitle":"Jacob Steinberg","r2ContributorId":"33875","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/1/6/1357492202523/Jacob-Steinberg-byline-002.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jacob is a football and tennis writer for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-steinberg","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/jacob-steinberg","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-a3f3f550-17e4-4428-bc90-14c63fe2f297","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390557247858/e91bce1c-7219-405f-a469-a072b89fc0e5-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390557247858/e91bce1c-7219-405f-a469-a072b89fc0e5-220x132.jpeg","source":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"SAEED KHAN","altText":"Hello Roger, my old friend.","height":"132","credit":"SAEED KHAN/AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Hello Roger, my old friend.

I only follow what I should do on court.\"</p><p>But even the eccentric Li, who has charmed Australian audiences since her first appearance in a final in 2011, will know that Cibulkova has been roaring through the draw like a wired-up pit-bull, all 5ft 3in of her, routing in order Francesca Schiavone, Stefanie Voegele, Caria Suárez Navarro, Maria Sharapova, Simona Halep and Agnieszka Radwanska.</p><p>There are some numbers Li is aware of, however. This is her third final in Melbourne, she was reminded, so would it be third time lucky? \"In China, six and eight are lucky. I'm not sure. I try to find the lucky way.\"</p><p>So, had she, at 32, thought about retiring? \"No. If I lose, I just continue until six or eight.\" While some of Li's musing are impenetrable, she did address the more elementary issue of how and why she has changed not only her grip during her serve, but her basic tennis philosophy, abandoning the baseline to explore attacking options at the net, at the urging of her coach, Carlos Rodriguez.</p><p>\"Of course, in the beginning it was tough because I have to forget things I did for maybe 20 years. The first couple of days, the first week, was terrible for me. But I thought, now at least I am trying to change something. And now I use it on the court pretty well.</p><p>\"When you are on the Tour so many years, everybody knows exactly how you play. So, if I didn't change, I could stay in the top 10, top 20 – but I could not be the best in the world. So I really wanted to push myself to change. It's very tough, having to think first, because you might lose the old things you did. I still trust myself, trust Carlos. I believe the change has helped me.\"</p><p>As for her more go-forward aggression, she has edged up the serve-and-volley league table over the past fortnight, to equal fifth, having converted the point 49 times in 71 visits. By the standards of the women's game, that is better than most, although still a good deal behind the most confident net-worker, Radwanska, who came in behind her 109 times, winning the point on 73 of them.</p><p>\"I think I have a very good volley,\" Li said. \"The first time I went to Carlos he said, 'You should come in more.' I was, like, what is this guy talking about? In the beginning I was thinking, I will stay on the baseline for maybe a hundred years, and never try to come to the net.</p><p>\"But, after he showed me the right way to do it, I tried. I felt good. It was not so bad. Especially at Wimbledon last year, I felt, if I lost the match, at least I tried. I found out something new about myself.\"</p><p>While Li brings quirkiness, Cibulkova brings a different sort of passion. \"I have had this energy since I was a little kid,\" the Slovak said. \"When I play my best tennis, that's where you can see the power and the fight. You have to have something extra if you want to be one of the best tennis players, and you are not the tallest.\"</p><p>Cibulkova is not only not the tallest, she is the smallest player in the top 100 – and would be the smallest slam champion in the history of the women's game were she to beat Li. I think she might.</p>","headline":"Li Na hopes to tame Dominika Cibulkova in Australian Open final","trailText":"Li Na's tactical tweaks have taken her to a third Melbourne final where she meets the contrasting aggressive style of Dominika Cilbulkova","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m69j","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390561180385/Li-Na-of-China-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390561180385/Li-Na-of-China-004.jpg","wordcount":"619","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427922617","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8600660","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne Park","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031985","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:00:26Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/li-na-dominika-cibulkova-australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/li-na-dominika-cibulkova-australian-open","tags":[{"id":"sport/australian-open-2014","webTitle":"Australian Open 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australian-open","webTitle":"Australian Open","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevinmitchell","webTitle":"Kevin Mitchell","rcsId":"GNL042083","r2ContributorId":"15957","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/31/kevin_mitchell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Mitchell is the tennis and boxing correspondent for the Guardian and Observer.

Jones has resisted the temptation to move abroad and agreed a new deal that will keep him at the Swansea-based region until after the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>It is a huge boost for Welsh rugby, given the backdrop of political unrest between Wales's four professional regions and the Welsh Rugby Union. The 28-year-old's decision bucks the recent trend of top players quitting the Welsh domestic game, coming less than 24 hours after Toulon, the reigning European champions, announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/leigh-halfpenny-wales-join-toulon-cardiff-blues\" title=\"\">a lucrative contract for the Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny</a>.</p><p>Several of Jones's Wales team-mates, including Mike Phillips, Jamie Roberts, Dan Lydiate and James Hook, already play in France, while Halfpenny, the centre Jonathan Davies and the lock Ian Evans will join the exodus later this year. But Jones, a mainstay of the Wales team who captained the British &amp; Irish Lions in their Test series-clinching victory over Australia in Sydney last summer, is staying put.</p><p>\"I am very happy to be able to resolve my future, which means I can now concentrate solely on my rugby,\" he said. \"It's flattering to have received offers from elsewhere, but at this point in my career my focus is on being in the right environment to ensure the longevity of both my domestic and international career.</p><p>\"It's important to me that I am playing the right level of rugby to ensure I am at my best, which is why it makes sense for me to accept the offer on the table from the Ospreys.\"</p><p>Jones, who has 74 Wales caps, is favourite to captain the side in next week's Six Nations opener against Italy if Sam Warburton does not return from a shoulder injury. Jones made his Ospreys debut in 2005, he is their current captain and he was a key figure on the past two Lions tours, featuring in all six Test matches against South Africa and Australia.</p><p>The Ospreys' operations manager, Andy Lloyd, added: \"It will give everybody involved with the region – players, coaches, staff, commercial partners and supporters – a huge boost.</p><p>\"Alun Wyn has been, and continues to be, a fantastic servant to this region and is a true role model to those around him.</p><p>\"A natural leader, he demands the highest standards of himself and everybody in this environment, and it will be a better place with him around in the coming seasons.</p><p>\"Given the uncertainty that still surrounds the game in Wales in general, we've given Alun Wyn reassurances regarding his future options, but it is fantastic news that he is staying at the Liberty Stadium.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/leigh-halfpenny-wales-join-toulon-cardiff-blues\" title=\"\">Halfpenny's exit from Cardiff Blues,</a> which will take effect at the end of this season, was accompanied by powerful remarks from the Blues chief executive, Richard Holland, that vividly reflect Welsh rugby's current toxic political climate. Critical areas such as revenue and competition structure remain unresolved amid uncertainty surrounding next season's Heineken Cup.

Or was it Jack Nicklaus? Or Vince Lombardi? Someone else probably said it before all of those guys and is still raging on a street somewhere, beating up passers-by in dismay at missing out on due recognition. Oh well. Still, at least, Jung-Il Byun might sympathise. He was the South Korean boxer who became a punchline thanks to his refusal to accept defeat in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. After being penalised for headbutting during his bantamweight bout with Bulgaria's Aleksandar Hristov, Byun lost 4-1 on points. He and his coaches were so distraught that they filed an immediate appeal in the time-honoured form of an almighty melee. Members of the home crowd joined in by chucking chairs into the ring. Eventually, the fighting died down but Byun's disappointment did not and he began a one-man sit-in protest in the ring. The session's subsequent bouts had to be cancelled. And when everyone else left the arena and the lights were turned off, Byun was still there, sitting in the ring and stewing in his own fury. He and several Korean officials were later suspended for their strops, while the New Zealand referee was the target of so much public scorn that he decided to fly home.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmvBI7X5iKg\" title=\"\">2) Jon Drummond</a></h2><p>The fastest men can be the slowest to simmer down. Jon Drummond proved that in the quarter-finals of the 100m dash at the 2003 world championships in Paris. The American was astonished at being disqualified for a supposed false start, repeatedly insisting \"I did not move!\" as he demanded to be reinstated. He then demonstrated his ability to not move by lying motionless on the track and resisting all pleas to get the hell out of the way. After delaying the race for almost an hour, Drummond eventually got up and stomped away, sobbing uncontrollably. Two hours later his manager informed the press: \"He's still crying. We're making him drink water because he's becoming dehydrated.\"</p><h2>3) Arsenal, often</h2><p>In an era in which José Mourinho has muttered hogwash about Unicef-led conspiracies against Chelsea and Sir Alex Ferguson has tended to accept losses with all the good grace of a pub oaf snubbed in his efforts to chat up the barmaid, Arsenal's players and staff stand out for their attempts to give their defeats a wider significance. According to the Arsenal way of thinking, a defeat for Arsenal is, in fact, a defeat for us all. Arsène Wenger is not just a football manager, he is a moral crusader. Arsenal matches do not merely pit one team against another, they are a clash between Good and Evil. It is not a notion entirely without foundation but it has led to some ridiculous displays of outrage. Thierry Henry could be considered to embody this strange amalgam of class and crassness, the Frenchman's rarefied skill contrasting sharply with his base self-serving righteousness. Consider <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci7XuOCejHAthe\" title=\"\">the tantrum he aimed at referee Graham Poll after Arsenal lost to Newcastle in 2001</a> or his reaction to being beaten by Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League final, after which he suggested that refereeing inadequacy and Barcelona skulduggery were partly to blame for his team surrendering a one-goal lead. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9g40mPUGsE\" title=\"\">\"Next time I'm going to learn how to dive maybe,\"</a> he blathered darkly. But I'm not a woman\". And then there's another of Arsenal's captain, William Gallas and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PTUMgpHPn0\" title=\"\">his infamous on-field lamentation at Birmingham City</a> in 2008, when the prospect of dropping points to an uncouth mob led him to sit down and sob like a child denied an ice cream.</p><h2>4) Luciano Gaucci</h2><p>The thing about trying to show off your power is that it often achieves the opposite and instead betrays your pettiness. Take Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, for instance. He was the head of the Kuwaiti Football Federation during the 1982 World Cup and decided to flex his muscle in pitiful fashion as his country were being trounced by France. After Alain Giresse took advantage of loose defending to score for France, the sheikh barged regally on to the pitch and demanded that the goal be ruled out for offside, threatening to order his players to walk off unless his wish was granted. After much confusion and negotiation, France agreed to let their goal be rubbed out, safe in the knowledge that they would get plenty more. Another World Cup controversy led to an even more pathetic demonstration of smallness in 2002. Ahn Jung-Hwan scored the winning golden goal that knocked Italy out of the tournament after a series of bad decisions in the hosts' favour.  As it happened, Ahn was employed by an Italian club at the time. But not for long. Perugia owner Luciano Gaucci promptly terminated the Korean's contract, reportedly storming: \"I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football\".</p><h2>5) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC28aMWxK9g\" title=\"\">Greg Holst</a></h2><p>Canadian Greg Holst was head coach of several Austrian ice hockey teams, including Villach, whose shootout defeat by Vienna Capitals in 2006 was not well received by Holst. Displeased at the officiating, he launched into a now-legendary post-match rant in which he marvellously fused English and German to claim, amongst other things, that \"es ist ein fuckin' complete skandal\". <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCFj9lf8IQE\" title=\"\">Giovanni Trapattoni's got nothing on this guy</a>.</p><h2>6) Kevin Borseth</h2><p>Please observe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEuOTkTQ8h4\" title=\"\">this textbook entrance to a post-match press conference</a>. As for the rest, it's about offensive rebounds.

Submit your predictions for this year’s all-star game below the line and … well, we will ignore them, just like most of you will do with the game itself this Sunday. Because no matter how many neat&nbsp;wrinkles the league tries to introduce, pro football just is not very&nbsp;compelling when nobody on defense is trying.</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">So, no, we are not actually going to preview Team Sanders vs Team Rice, although if you have any ideas for how the NFL could spruce up the Pro Bowl (ideally ones&nbsp;that<a href=\"http://deadspin.com/relive-the-excitement-of-the-pro-bowl-draft-1507316928\"> do not bore the players themselves</a>)</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">&nbsp;then do feel free to share them in the comments section below. Personally, I will add my voice to those who believe <a href=\"http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/pro-bowl-is-missing-a-skills-competition/\">a skills competition, if done well, would be infinitely more entertaining than what we have right now</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As for this week’s Talkboard, instead of the usual format, we have gathered together a round-up of some of this week’s big stories. At the bottom of this article you will also find a look ahead to the coverage you can expect from us during Super Bowl week. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And of course, this blog also gives us a place to update you on our Pick the Playoffs competition. I will post the full standings below the line shortly, but for now I can tell you that <b>donwendy2</b>, <b>gregGraffin</b>, <b>thedarrenhudson</b>, <b>ToffeeDan1</b> and <b>YorkiePoo</b> currently share first place with nine correct picks out of 10 each so far.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p>And such exceptional postseason form has also been enough to confirm <b>thedarrenhudson</b> as our overall champion. Having already finished top of the Pick Six standings during the regular season, he now stands two clear at the top of the combined table with just one game left to go. Do join me in doffing your caps to a deserving champion; 72 correct picks so far out of a possible 112 so far takes some doing. </p><h2>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">In the news</span></h2><p>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">•&nbsp;No one player has dominated the headlines this week more than Richard Sherman, who if nothing else certainly did a good job of stealing the spotlight with his animated post-game interview following Seattle’s win over San Francisco in the NFC Championship Game. Since then the US sports media have been drawn into a week-long conversation about villains, post-game interviews and, of course, race.</span></p><p>Sherman himself tackled the latter&nbsp;subject head-on during a press conference on Thursday, responding to a question about how it felt to be called a ‘thug’ by saying:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The only reason it bothers me is because it seems like it's the accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays. It's like everybody else says the n-word, and then they say thug, and, 'Oh, that's fine.’ That’s where it takes me aback and it’s kinda disappointing, because what's the definition of a thug, really?<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">… There was a hockey game where they didn't even play hockey. They just threw the puck aside and started fighting. I saw that and I said, 'Oh, man, I'm the thug? What’s going on?

</xml><![endif]--> By all measures, this year’s iteration of Big Bash cricket has been a remarkable success. Crowds are markedly up on last year, but possibly more gratifying for organisers has been its rapid ascent as a blockbuster television hit.</p><p>It’s no coincidence this occurred during the first season Big Bash moved from pay TV to primetime free-to-air, albeit during the non-ratings holiday period. Meanwhile another former pay-TV-only code, A-league football, also made its debut on network airwaves this summer via SBS2.</p><p>The repositioning of both sports and the eagerness with which each administration embraced them provokes a salient question: does sport in Australia still need free-to-air exposure to become mainstream? <p>At first glance, the Big Bash experiment provides an emphatic riposte. </p> <p>Even five years ago there were few willing to suppose a Mickey Mouse competition featuring generic franchises, domestic cricketers (many either unfamiliar to the wider public or past their prime), could be summer’s surprise primetime hit. </p> <p>But Big Bash earned its best ratings over the Christmas holidays, when network television choices are stark. The emphatic turnaround in fortunes for Australia in the Ashes also had a halo effect on viewing numbers. We like cricket. And we like it a lot more when we’re beating England. </p> <p>That Big Bash airs nightly and is (as far as cricket goes) brief and easy to follow also assisted it. </p> <p>The most popular Australian television series last year were nightly reality franchises: The Block, My Kitchen Rules and The Voice. With those off-air, there is a gap to fill. If the Big Bash aired in, say, April or September, it would not work.</p> <p>Either way, Ten proved it could generate numbers of about 1 million viewers nationally a night, something Fox Sports cannot do.</p> <p>It’s at this point that we should acknowledge that without Fox Sports, the Big Bash would not have reached this point. Fox was frequently innovative in its coverage, using player mics, on-field cameras and entertaining on-air talent, several of whom Ten poached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fox Sports has regularly acted as an incubator and&nbsp;when their telecasts generate large numbers, as the Big Bash did, free-to-air often circles. The potential eyeballs offered remain seductive for sporting administrations. </p> <p>Free-to-air digital channels such as 7mate and One may be an impediment for subscription growth. For instance, a fortnight ago, the American NFL playoffs scored 67,000 viewers on Ten’s One digital channel and 45,000 on Foxtel’s ESPN. </p> <p>Compared with the rest of the world, particularly the US, Australia was slow to embrace pay television. Programmers eventually identified the most likely carrot to attract Austrlians to pay: live sport.</p> <p>By contrast with its equivalents elsewhere, Foxtel is an excellent product. Yet despite retaining rights to every AFL and NRL match, most football and cricket, and a giant swath of US sport, household penetration is not what it could be.</p> <p><a href=\"http://if.com.au/2014/01/21/article/Bright-outlook-for-pay-TV-industry/LQZVJSLKCP.html\">According to</a> <i>IF.com.au</i>, the percentage of households that subscribe vary around the country. It’s 35% in Sydney, 28% in Melbourne and Brisbane, 21% in Adelaide, 18% in Perth and just 14% in Tasmania.</p> <p>For those who pay, the sport networks are a boon; they cover sports often ignored or deemed too niche by network television. For this group, the argument is moot. The product is strong, the pictures are in crisp HD (rare for free-to-air) and coverage can be more fan-friendly.</p> <p>Certainly a subset of diehards will eagerly watch Australia’s ODI squad half-heartedly sweat it out against Bangladesh in Dakar. The same group is willing to rise at 3am to witness Lleyton Hewitt play Uzbekistan in a Davis Cup tie.</p> <p>But to those who do not subscribe, many sports shunned by free-to-air exist in a pay-to-play ghetto. To that group, it’s almost as though these events do not exist. </p> <p>Of course free-to-air viewers and networks have something of a love/hate relationship with each other around sport. Networks are impatient, and overtly driven by ratings. If something is not working, no matter how much the rights cost, they will yank it off air. The subscription model allows viewers some certainty that free-to-air does not&nbsp; </p><p>In the past, free-to-air programmers have demonstrated a willingness to cut sports off, delay telecasts, edit out parts of contests, air them at unflattering pre-dawn timeslots or simply warehouse content so competitors cannot get their hands on them.</p> <p>At the premium end, sports such as cricket and rugby league's State of Origin have never been more important to free-to-air networks – they are DVR and piracy proof. This is significant in the US, where one dominant sporting code (NFL) is a surefire ratings winner. </p> <p>Still, sporting bodies such as the AFL are close to a precipice where the limit of what is economically viable for the networks to pay has almost been reached.</p> <p>Equally, following Nine’s big financial losses from covering the London Olympics, Australian networks were hardly eager to sign again with the IOC. Ten eventually did so, primarily because of its dreadful recent primetime ratings.</p> <p>The Olympics are a classic example of the way subscription television can exploit the limitations of free-to-air. Yes, London was a loss-leader for Nine in that they got to promote their slate of programs to a huge audience, but lately evidence of significant post-event traction has not come to fruition.</p> <p>Foxtel’s immersive coverage in London was impressive. Yet the mainstream din was mostly about what Nine's coverage lacked. Foxtel cannot bid for exclusive rights to the Olympics because of its nemesis, the federal government’s anti-siphoning list. Whether that list shrinks under Tony Abbott's government remains to be seen. </p> <p>Yet just because something airs on free-to-air, it will not necessarily attract viewers. Take the National Basketball League. An NBL game on Ten on 12 January landed just 36,000 viewers nationally. On 20 January the figure was 26,000.</p> <p>As for the A-league, overall SBS2 is a positive, but diehard fans will get a better package (more money spent on it, HD pictures, more games) from Fox. And after starting off strongly, certain SBS2 A-league ratings have been modest. The Newcastle-Melbourne Victory clash on 10 January attracted 67,000 viewers on Fox, while 58,000 tuned in on SBS2. </p> <!--EndFragment--> </p>","headline":"Sport on TV: free-to-air still has its strengths if it picks the best moment","trailText":"Big Bash League success shows that the right sport at the right time still delivers more than pay-TV can offer<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m65n","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390538921789/9b343b07-6f0e-476d-bd03-e9362d521b1d-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390538921789/9b343b07-6f0e-476d-bd03-e9362d521b1d-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427902945","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1e16ee4b00f28d73d3145","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Andrew Murfett","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031881","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T15:00:29+11:00"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/24/sport-tv-free-air-pay","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/24/sport-tv-free-air-pay","tags":[{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television &amp; radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/afl","references":[]},{"id":"football/a-league","webTitle":"A-League","type":"keyword","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/football/a-league","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cricket","references":[]},{"id":"sport/twenty20","webTitle":"Twenty20","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/twenty20","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/twenty20","references":[]},{"id":"sport/blog","webTitle":"Sportblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog","references":[]},{"id":"sport/olympic-games","webTitle":"Olympic Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympic-games","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/andrew-murfett","webTitle":"Andrew Murfett","r2ContributorId":"60066","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386810506547/Andrew-Murfett-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Andrew Murfett worked for Fairfax Media, writing for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, for more than 10 years.

The series, which was formed from the merger of Grand-Am and the American Le Mans Series (ALMS), now represents the major, unified sportscar championship in the US and Alex Gurney in the GAINSCO Corvertte of Bob Stallings Racing ensured a spot in the history books by claiming the new championship's first pole position in its inaugural race – the twice-round-the-clock endurance classic, first held here in 1966.&nbsp;</p><p>Bright Florida sunshine welcomed the new series with perfect conditions and approaching down the pine tree-lined boulevard named in honour of the Daytona International Speedway's founder, Bill France, alongside the roar of engines there was a sense of anticipation at what this first meeting of car classes that have never competed against one another might bring.&nbsp;</p><p>The new series is run by Bill's family, the France dynasty that previously owned Grand-Am and has made such a huge success of Nascar in North America.&nbsp;The&nbsp;stated intent is to try and bring some of that popularity to sportscar racing in North America. To that end the 24 hours hosts a generous field of 67 cars, with Daytona Prototypes (DP) and Daytona GT-spec cars from Grand-Am and Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) and Le Mans GT-spec cars from the ALMS set to be racing at the same time come the green flag on Saturday at 2.30pm ET.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;That the DP cars have the advantage at what is their spiritual home on the banking at Daytona was made clear in qualifying despite recent efforts to close the balance of performance between the two classes, with Gurney's time of 1:38.270, a second and-a-half clear of the closest LMP2, Muscle Milk's Lucas Luhr at 139.629 in eleventh, a car he will share in the race with Alex Brundle. Balance of performance across the classes has been a target for the new series but on this basis further tinkering is to be expected as the season progresses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Despite the gap to the ALMS runners, Gurney expected the LMP2 cars to double-stint their tyres and gain and “tighten up” the gap with quicker pitstops, whether it will be enough with the differential as it is seems doubtful. But for the organisers the most important fact was that the new series was underway with a successful first session.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill France's granddaughter, Lesa Kennedy who is the Vice Chairman of Nascar and is on the board of directors of TUSC, said before the weekend that she hoped the merger would move sports car racing “to an amazing new level”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“Like any motorsport it will continue to evolve and change to reach the audience its looking for so you will see that continual evolution,” she continued. Thus far, however, she added: “It has succeeded our expectations .&nbsp;Any time you take two different sanctioning bodies and merge them together it's going to take time, it will take a lot of effort and so far we have been pleased at how far everything has advanced.”&nbsp; </p><p>So far, so good, then. On track Britain's Richard Westbrook at the wheel of another Corvette DP for the Spirit of Daytona racing team rounded out the front row and the only woman in the top class, Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/18/motorsports\">Katherine Legge</a> took eighth in the DeltaWing prototype. The Starworks Riley DP of Scott Mayer was in third but last year's winner Scott Pruett, who is bidding to overtake Daytona legend Hurley Haywood with his sixth 24 Hour win here, could manage only ninth for Chip Ganassi in his Riley DP.&nbsp;</p><p>Gurney who has never won the Daytona 24 and is set to run only five races in the series but claimed a pole in 2007, said it was “one of our times to shine”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“We were pretty diligent all through testing in December, concentrating on full-tank runs, But with low fuel it showed what we had,” he said. “When we pulled the fuel out the time came. We were pretty happy with the car and it was nice to get one in there.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It's the biggest race we do and the one we want to win,” he concluded before the final session of night practice was due to commence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The Oreca of Colin Braun headed the PC class; in GT Le Mans, the SRT Viper of Marc Goossens took pole and in GT Daytona Christopher Haase was quickest in the Paul Miller Racing Audi R8.</p>","headline":"Gurney claims first pole in new era of sportscar racing at Daytona 24-hours","trailText":"<b>Motor racing:</b>&nbsp;Alex&nbsp;Gurney fastest&nbsp;in&nbsp;Rolex 24 Hours'&nbsp;first competitive session in the new Tudor United SportsCar Championship<br>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m64k","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523440848/d3bfb484-5451-4396-b443-6a3a95cb82d1-140x84.jpeg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523440848/d3bfb484-5451-4396-b443-6a3a95cb82d1-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427896702","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52e1b0fae4b00f28d73d312c","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Giles Richards in Daytona, Florida","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031851","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T00:37:12Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/alex-gurney-claims-first-pole-position-in-new-era-of-le-mans-24-hour-racing","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/23/alex-gurney-claims-first-pole-position-in-new-era-of-le-mans-24-hour-racing","tags":[{"id":"sport/motorsports","webTitle":"Motor sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/motorsports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/motorsports","references":[]},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/lemansseries","webTitle":"Le Mans Series","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lemansseries","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/lemansseries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/gilesrichards","webTitle":"Giles Richards","rcsId":"GNL509604","r2ContributorId":"15668","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/11/3/1320345898516/Giles-Richards-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Giles Richards is a senior journalist for the Guardian, the Observer and the Guardian.co.uk <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport\">sports</a> desk</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesrichards","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/profile/gilesrichards","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-f0add1e1-49ce-40b1-9b05-1670092040c7","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523440225/d3bfb484-5451-4396-b443-6a3a95cb82d1-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390523440225/d3bfb484-5451-4396-b443-6a3a95cb82d1-220x132.jpeg","source":"AP","photographer":"John Raoux","altText":"The Action Express Racing Corvette DP heads through the horseshoe turn during night practice for the IMSA Series Rolex 24 hour auto race at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, Thursday, January 23, 2014","height":"132","credit":"John Raoux/AP","caption":"The Action Express Racing Corvette DP during night practice for the IMSA Series Rolex 24 hour auto race at Daytona International Speedway.

World Twenty20, continuing a dramatic 12 months of furniture rearrangement in the national coaching ranks.</p><p>With spin set to be a key factor on the pitches in host country Bangladesh, Warne will work closely with Australia’s spin battalion, which now looks like to include 20-year-old Victorian leg-spinner James Muirhead, selected for Australia’s upcoming T20 fixtures against England.</p><p>“We believe our national teams can really benefit from more specific skill-based coaching as and when it is needed,” said national coach Darren Lehmann of Warne’s appointment. “This will mean that from time to time we will enlist the support of experts in their craft to work with our players and share their experience.</p><p>“We believe spin bowling will be critical to success. There’s no better person than Shane to help guide the spinners we select in that squad. We’re thrilled to have him on board.”</p><p>It’s sound logic that has already reaped rewards for the fast bowlers under the guidance of Craig McDermott, and the addition of Warne as a consultant will lend a familiar, campfire feel to the national coaching setup.</p><p>Warne himself was excited at the prospect of lending a hand to the next generation of Australian spinners and said, “I’m looking forward to helping them with some intense bowling preparation ahead of the world Twenty20, where we’ll specifically work on tactics and mindset.”</p><p>The appointment also adds some intrigue to Australia’s selection plans for the tournament. The chairman of selectors, John Inverarity, has said <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/rookie-spinner-james-muirhead-called-up-for-t20-against-england-20140120-314v5.html\">42-year-old Brad Hogg, a form bowler of the current Big Bash, remains in his calculations</a>. Warne’s presence provides some doubt though, and more likely points to the ascension of Muirhead, for whom Warne could be an invaluable sounding board and tutor. <br></p><p>Like two-Test spinner Michael Beer and discarded batsman Rob Quiney, Muirhead is a product of Warne’s old club side St Kilda.</p><p>All-rounder Glenn Maxwell could provide a further spin option for the Bangladesh tournament, but Hogg, Xavier Doherty and Fawad Ahmed will also press their claims.</p><p>Putting Warne on the payroll shapes as an intriguing prospect for Cricket Australia and no doubt they remain mindful of his outspoken tendencies, particularly on selection and management of the national team. The conflicts with Warne’s media work will be minimal. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland and his marketing team are no strangers to leveraging Warne’s involvement and last year’s ugly Big Bash tussle between Warne and Marlon Samuels showed that even the possibility of bad publicity is of no great concern at Jolimont. <br></p><p>In almost every sense they would view Warne’s presence as a net gain, and they are right.</p><p>Fittingly, it’s almost 12 months to the day since Warne published his idiosyncratic and controversial <a href=\"http://www.shanewarne.com/blog/330/where-is-australian-cricket-at-part-1\">“Warnifesto”</a> series of blueprints for Australian cricket, in which he claimed to be “frustrated on many levels” with the direction of the national team. It’s a document that gets more interesting with time. <br></p><p>In it Warne recommended that his friend Lehmann be appointed in a coaching role, which came to pass sooner than even Warne could have expected, though the current T20 captain George Bailey did not even figure among the squad of 16 players Warne <a href=\"http://www.shanewarne.com/blog/332/where-is-australian-cricket-at-part-2\">earmarked for international T20 duty</a> at that point. He has reportedly moved up in Warne’s estimations since.</p><p>The oft-neglected <a href=\"http://www.shanewarne.com/blog/336/where-is-australian-cricket-at-part-4-the-way-forward-spin-bowling\">fourth instalment</a> is pertinent, relating as it did to Australia’s spin bowling stocks. It&nbsp; pitched T20 cricket as “a hindrance in the development of a young spinner”. Warne may have revised that view since, as well as this nugget: “We should identify our top four spinners and put them on a decent contract and have them play nothing but first-class cricket for 12 months.” <br></p><p>In light of the 2013-14 domestic schedule, some Xbox might have been in order too.</p><p>Warne’s appointment is equally a case of the spinner’s cricket life coming full circle. At 21 he was a precociously talented but ill-disciplined bowling prospect at loggerheads with Australian Cricket Academy coaching staff, but developed rapidly under the tutelage of another former Test spinner, Terry Jenner.</p><p>Jenner’s influence on Warne’s career was profound. On his early days working with ‘TJ’, Warne said his late mentor was “the best thing that happened to me there”.&nbsp; Two decades on, Warne himself looms as the wise oracle and holder of spin secrets, so the cycle continues.</p><p>Warne used a section of his 2001 autobiography to criticise the England coaching set-up for having too many greats sitting in commentary boxes rather than providing guidance to the national team. Now he has a chance to step away from the microphone and muck in himself.</p><p>Warne has always been an outspoken critic of modern coaching practices. His hostile views on the pervasive management-speak culture of John Buchanan’s&nbsp; reign are well documented, but also probably sat as a counterweight to his matey, hands-on coaching relationship with Jenner, who was a kindred spirit. He once said of his late coach: “It helped that Jenner was capable of doing everything that he suggested to me.” <p>His pupils can surely only dream of achieving such symbiosis. </p>

It's tough and it would be tough for an Austrian skier too.</p><p>\"It's the ski family and they really help me, they're the only people to really understand what I'm going through,\" added the Briton, who finished 32nd in her Olympic debut in Salt Lake City in 2002.</p><p>\"With how much I'm enjoying it and if I can afford to do it I'll continue to ski.\"</p>","headline":"Chemmy Alcott's Super-G show puts her in good heart for Olympics","trailText":"Chemmy Alcott finished in 42nd place in the World Cup Super-G in Cortina d'Ampezzo, a day after being named in the Great Britain squad for Sochi","newspaperPageNumber":"7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6vt","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513116673/Chemmy-Alcott-006.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513116673/Chemmy-Alcott-006.jpg","wordcount":"294","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427874534","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8599223","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Reuters","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031741","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-26T22:39:56Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/chemmy-alcott-superg-olympics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/23/chemmy-alcott-superg-olympics","tags":[{"id":"sport/chemmy-alcott","webTitle":"Chemmy Alcott","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chemmy-alcott","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/chemmy-alcott","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics-2014","webTitle":"Winter Olympics 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/winter-olympics","webTitle":"Winter Olympics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/winter-olympics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427889362","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390513108109/Chemmy-Alcott-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Domenico Stinellis","altText":"Chemmy Alcott","height":"54","credit":"Domenico Stinellis/AP","caption":"Chemmy Alcott celebrates making the GB Olympic squad with a solid showing in World Cup Super-G in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy.

Sampras was in the audience at the Rod Laver Arena, the first time he saw them play each other live.</p><p>\"I never thought about 13 grand slams, or 14 either,\" Nadal said. \"I need to keep playing great to win this title. Stan's serve is huge, and he is hitting the ball very hard. I will try to play the same as I did tonight. When I play with Roger, it's a very special feeling. We play a lot of times for important things in our career. He's a really great champion, and it's an honour to play him. We played some tough rallies in the first set, he was playing some very aggressive tennis. I think tonight I played my best tennis of the tournament. After missing last year, it is very emotional for me to be back on this court.\"</p><p>Nadal tried to downplay the effect of a blister on his left hand and it did not seem to inconvenience him unduly – at least not as much as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/rafael-nadal-defeats-grigor-dimitrov-australian-open\" title=\"\">his quarter-final win over Grigor Dimitrov</a>. \"Too much talk about the blister,\" he said. \"It is OK. It is the position of the blister, it is difficult to cover. Normal life, it is OK, but to play the best players in the world it is a challenge. I have a very tough opponent in Wawrinka. He's played some amazing tennis. He will come to the final with a lot of confidence.\"</p><p>At the beginning, this semi-final had the feel of a major prizefight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier-muhammad-ali-1971\" title=\"\">Nadal's Joe Frazier to Federer's Muhammad Ali</a>. And the crowd might have been divided down those lines, too, leaning towards Roger, as ever, perhaps 75-25, craving artistry and style over strength and doggedness. In the early exchanges, Federer's sharper ground strokes, with subtle changes in direction and weight, as well as his new-found eagerness to kill the point at the net at the earliest opportunity, kept Nadal on the back foot. Going into the match, Federer had won 135 of 178 net approaches, and Nadal was sometimes three metres behind the baseline when receiving, and not much further forward after serving, so wary was he of his opponent's aggression.</p><p>Nadal was the first to get into a spot of trouble, having to fight through deuce to hold in eight minutes for 2-2 after a quarter of an hour. Then a stinging cross-court return and a passing shot down the left flank that only Nadal could conjure gave him two break points in the seventh game. But he failed to handle the tricky wind inside the open-roofed arena and his last shot of the game was a shanked forehand that skewed into the seats.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to suffer in the breeze in the ninth game, as he double-faulted and netted to give Nadal his third break point, but hung on, and the Spaniard had to serve to stay in the set at 4-5 after 36 minutes. He held with an ace – as did Federer for a 6-5 lead. The pressure was back on Nadal – who held to force the tie-break, then won it, Federer's final forehand floating long.</p><p>However, after holding to 30 in the first game of the second set, Nadal needed his blister tended to – not a good sign. It did not matter. When Federer slapped a forehand wide in the sixth game, Nadal led 4-2 and comfort flooded his tennis, the pain of his wound forgotten. He closed out the set and his confidence rose appreciably.</p><p>It was Federer's turn to struggle, and he did not handle the challenge so well. The fightback never really took off, from an unpromising deficit, and, when he netted another backhand volley, he fell 2-1 behind in the third, with the end beckoning more quickly be the shot. He delayed the fall to break back at 2-2, but Nadal forced him wider and deeper, and Federer faced a mountain when serving to stay in the match at 3-5.</p><p>He went down in flames, of course, belting an ace and making one final charge at the net, only to be passed again for deuce. There was absolutely nothing he could do about Nadal's arrowed passing shot for a second match point and he was resigned, maybe even a little relieved, when the agony ended on the end of his concluding forehand, which sailed harmlessly over the baseline.</p>","headline":"Rafael Nadal ruthless in beating Roger Federer at Australian Open","trailText":"Rafael Nadal saw off Roger Federer in three hard-fought sets to book his place in the Australian Open final","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m69g","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390562922282/Rafael-Nadal-of-Spain-cel-003.jpg","wordcount":"813","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427922130","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601035","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne Park","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031982","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:31:50Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/rafael-nadal-beats-roger-federer-australian-open","tags":[{"id":"sport/australian-open-2014","webTitle":"Australian Open 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/rafaelnadal","references":[]},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/roger-federer","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australian-open","webTitle":"Australian Open","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australian-open","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/tennis","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevinmitchell","webTitle":"Kevin Mitchell","rcsId":"GNL042083","r2ContributorId":"15957","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/31/kevin_mitchell_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Mitchell is the tennis and boxing correspondent for the Guardian and Observer.

This is not a misprint. England have indeed won a cricket match in Australia. Never mind the Ashes, or the meltdown in Brisbane, or the one-day series slipping away in Sydney: 10 matches and 131 days since their last victory in Cardiff in September, England beat Australia quite comfortably in the end, leading from the front in a 57-run victory at the Waca that was inspired by fine and fearless all-round performances by Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes.</p><p>Alastair Cook had announced at the toss – a little oddly given heads or tails normally does the trick – that he is now \"desperate\" to stay on as England captain, and in the moment of victory he raised his arms in a weary gesture of triumph before allowing himself to gambol about from team-mate to team-mate with a huge grin on his face. Cook has suffered horribly over the last three months, from a bad back in the opening warm-up match to the successive annihilations of Test and one-day series. Now, though, he will at least always have Perth.</p><p>Powered by yet another display of controlled late-innings butchery by Buttler, England had posted 316 in the first innings, forty runs more the previous highest-winning chase on this ground. With David Warner, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin all missing here, they really weren't going to get a better chance to avoid the looming threat of a 10-match Cookwash decider in Adelaide on Australia day. If the prospect of complete annihilation narrowly avoided is hardly cause for jubilation, moments of grace on this unrelentingly traumatic tour have been scarce and England will seize this one happily.</p><p>England won the toss and batted first for the fourth time having gone into this match unchanged. Australia included an extra pace bowler on a pitch that gleamed in the sun, and which seemed to have quickened up by the afternoon as Australia set off with familiar intent in pursuit of England's total.</p><p>With Aaron Finch in true-track biffer mode Australia surged to 40 for no loss off their first five overs before Tim Bresnan drew an edge from Shaun Marsh that was well caught by a leaping Ian Bell at second slip. Cook remained aggressive in the field throughout even as Australia's 50 came up in the ninth over and nerves began to fray just a little. Finch already looked central to proceedings with Australia's batting order more of a Twenty20 affair, tailing away into a miscellany of all-rounders.</p><p>James Tredwell was allowed to bowl a nagging spell of four overs for 12 runs before Finch, tiring of prodding, hit him on to the roof of the stand at cow corner, and then flicked the next ball flat and hard into the crowd at the same spot. Matthew Wade was finally euthanised from the crease after a scratchy 23, caught at mid-off swiping at Ravi Bopara in the course of – yes, really – England's first maiden over of the series.</p><p>George Bailey departed at 133 for two, well caught by Buttler down the leg side off Ben Stokes, and England were – cautiously – edging in on victory. Finch stroked his way to a fine and occasionally brutal second hundred of the series off 97 balls with eight fours and four effortless sixes.</p><p>Steve Smith came out swinging and also left swinging, edging Stuart Broad behind and finally Finch fell, guiding a short ball from Bresnan into Broad's hands at third man. England were giddy. When Glenn Maxwell was caught by Buttler off Stokes to leave Australia 225 for six and needing almost nine an over, it was only the unscabbed wounds of Brisbane that stilled any premature thoughts of victory. Stokes had suffered at James Faulkner's hands last week, but he got his man here and celebrated with relief as much as any great joy, before Bresnan took the final wicket of James Pattinson.</p><p>Earlier England had batted with a sense of concentrated aggression on a true pitch. Cook took 14 off Nathan Coulter-Nile's first over, thrashing past point with a sense of contained fury. Bell twice stepped down the pitch to loft Faulkner back over his head with lovely easy power, not so much bullying the bowling as tickling it expertly to death, and England were motoring at 55 without loss after eight overs.</p><p>Cook was bowled slogging by Maxwell and Stokes came out at No3 as Bell went to a 50 off 48 balls before departing in the limpest fashion, caught at very short fine leg flicking daintily at Dan Christian's fourth ball. Stokes, though, continued to rumble, bringing up a fine first fifty in one day cricket with a huge straight six off Maxwell, a controlled, assertive innings of orthodox attacking strokes.</p><p>Stokes was out for 70 skying Faulkner's slower ball, Bopara again went cheaply before Buttler began to find the boundary with great power, including a pair of fizzed cover drives off Mitchell Johnson, who was a shadow here of the menacing figure of the Test series. In 20 international overs post-moustache, Johnson's figures are one for 131.</p><p>Buttler continued to bat with a sense of controlled brutality before he was caught at third man for 71 off 44 balls. What a player he is, far too talented to be overlooked by England in any form of the game he wants to play. With Stokes picking up four wickets as Australia fell away and Buttler also taking four catches, there was evidence of the explosive ability in this England team. For now they will simply celebrate a win.</p>","headline":"England finally beat Australia and Alastair Cook stays as captain","trailText":"<p>Ten matches and 131 days since their last victory in Cardiff in September, England beat Australia by 57 runs in Perth</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m6b4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564827857/Alastair-Cook-leads-his-v-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390564827857/Alastair-Cook-leads-his-v-003.jpg","wordcount":"924","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427927592","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8601045","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Barney Ronay at the Waca","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2032024","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T11:47:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/england-beat-australia-alastair-cook-captain","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/england-beat-australia-alastair-cook-captain","tags":[{"id":"sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","webTitle":"Australia v England limited-overs internationals 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-england-limited-overs-internationals-2014","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-cricket-team","references":[]},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/england-cricket-team","references":[]},{"id":"sport/alastair-cook","webTitle":"Alastair Cook","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/alastair-cook","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/cricket","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/matchreports","webTitle":"Match reports","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/matchreports","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/matchreports","references":[]},{"id":"profile/barneyronay","webTitle":"Barney Ronay","r2ContributorId":"21010","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/12/barney_ronay_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Barney Ronay is senior sports writer for guardian.co.uk.

Jones has resisted the temptation to move abroad and agreed a new deal that will keep him at the Swansea-based region until after the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>It is a huge boost for Welsh rugby, given the backdrop of political unrest between Wales's four professional regions and the Welsh Rugby Union. The 28-year-old's decision bucks the recent trend of top players quitting the Welsh domestic game, coming less than 24 hours after Toulon, the reigning European champions, announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/leigh-halfpenny-wales-join-toulon-cardiff-blues\" title=\"\">a lucrative contract for the Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny</a>.</p><p>Several of Jones's Wales team-mates, including Mike Phillips, Jamie Roberts, Dan Lydiate and James Hook, already play in France, while Halfpenny, the centre Jonathan Davies and the lock Ian Evans will join the exodus later this year. But Jones, a mainstay of the Wales team who captained the British &amp; Irish Lions in their Test series-clinching victory over Australia in Sydney last summer, is staying put.</p><p>\"I am very happy to be able to resolve my future, which means I can now concentrate solely on my rugby,\" he said. \"It's flattering to have received offers from elsewhere, but at this point in my career my focus is on being in the right environment to ensure the longevity of both my domestic and international career.</p><p>\"It's important to me that I am playing the right level of rugby to ensure I am at my best, which is why it makes sense for me to accept the offer on the table from the Ospreys.\"</p><p>Jones, who has 74 Wales caps, is favourite to captain the side in next week's Six Nations opener against Italy if Sam Warburton does not return from a shoulder injury. Jones made his Ospreys debut in 2005, he is their current captain and he was a key figure on the past two Lions tours, featuring in all six Test matches against South Africa and Australia.</p><p>The Ospreys' operations manager, Andy Lloyd, added: \"It will give everybody involved with the region – players, coaches, staff, commercial partners and supporters – a huge boost.</p><p>\"Alun Wyn has been, and continues to be, a fantastic servant to this region and is a true role model to those around him.</p><p>\"A natural leader, he demands the highest standards of himself and everybody in this environment, and it will be a better place with him around in the coming seasons.</p><p>\"Given the uncertainty that still surrounds the game in Wales in general, we've given Alun Wyn reassurances regarding his future options, but it is fantastic news that he is staying at the Liberty Stadium.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/leigh-halfpenny-wales-join-toulon-cardiff-blues\" title=\"\">Halfpenny's exit from Cardiff Blues,</a> which will take effect at the end of this season, was accompanied by powerful remarks from the Blues chief executive, Richard Holland, that vividly reflect Welsh rugby's current toxic political climate. Critical areas such as revenue and competition structure remain unresolved amid uncertainty surrounding next season's Heineken Cup. Holland is due to attend a media briefing alongside Blues chairman Peter Thomas on Friday in the wake of Halfpenny's departure.</p>","headline":"Alun Wyn Jones signs new Ospreys deal in boost for Welsh club rugby","trailText":"The Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones has said that 'being in the right environment' was a key factor in him deciding not to move abroad","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m68q","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390559586861/Alun-Wyn-Jones-004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390559586861/Alun-Wyn-Jones-004.jpg","wordcount":"517","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"427919461","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8600875","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Press Association","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2031965","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T10:34:06Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/alun-wyn-jones-new-ospreys-deal","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jan/24/alun-wyn-jones-new-ospreys-deal","tags":[{"id":"sport/ospreys","webTitle":"Ospreys","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ospreys","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/ospreys","references":[]},{"id":"sport/rugby-union","webTitle":"Rugby union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugby-union","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/rugby-union","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/wales-rugby-union-team","webTitle":"Wales rugby union team","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/wales-rugby-union-team","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/sport/wales-rugby-union-team","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://internal.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427919656","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390559581573/Alun-Wyn-Jones-001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Huw Evans/Rex","photographer":"Huw Evans/Rex","altText":"Alun-Wyn Jones","height":"54","credit":"Huw Evans/Rex/Huw Evans/Rex","caption":"Alun Wyn Jones has agreed a new contract that will keep him at Ospreys until after the 2015 World Cup.

We're only a half-hour drive from the jittery Las Vegas Strip but here, on a couch in his office, Tyson sits quietly. He rests his familiar tattooed face in the palm of his hand. After Muhammad Ali he remains the world's most recognisable boxer, and one of sport's most infamous characters. Yet Tyson looks most like a 47-year-old man trying hard to understand his tumultuous life.</p><p>He was once a frightened little boy, beaten often by his mother in a condemned building in Brownsville, Brooklyn, who turned himself into the self-proclaimed baddest man on the planet. Tyson made and then lost almost a billion dollars as the last great undisputed heavyweight champion of the world whose controlled fury in the ring was eventually disfigured by madness and violence. He has had distressing problems with women, been to jail and then imprisoned even more tightly by alcohol and drug addiction.</p><p>Now, however, Tyson taps me gently on the arm. \"I surrendered to a higher power. I said, 'Help me. I can't do nothing no more. Guide me. God, whoever. I don't know what to do …'\"</p><p>Tyson has long been a masterful story-teller, with his obvious intelligence and street-hustling mentality producing a spellbinding raconteur, but this is different. He is not spinning a yarn here. Tyson, instead, is remembering his <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8068048.stm\" title=\"\">four-year-old daughter, Exodus, who died during a tragic accident in 2009</a>. His eyes fill with tears. \"I'll never get over it,\" Tyson says. \"I just can't …\"</p><p>Somehow he manages to control his crying, and he wipes his eyes. \"If I wasn't married I'd be very different. I'd still be that violent schmuck because that's all I once knew – how to hurt people. I used to do all that stuff and I never cared about the repercussions. But I've surrendered now. I was thinking of my daughter when …[he points to his teary gaze] … but I'm just happy I'm not that same person.\"</p><p>Tyson has a way of opening up now that allows the darkness to pour out of him without spreading the carnage that once trailed him wherever he went. He seems amazed he's still here, in one middle-aged piece. \"What's today's date?\" he asks, before recalling last Wednesday's milestone. \"On the 15th, it was five months since I went straight. I've been clean five months. I just don't want to do it no more …\"</p><p>Tyson admits in his relentlessly gripping autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/16/undisputed-truth-mike-tyson-autobiography-review\" title=\"\">Undisputed Truth</a>, that he is a cocaine addict whose recovery was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/aug/27/mike-tyson-drink-drugs-alcoholic-video\" title=\"\">hit by a relapse last summer</a>. \"I was sober three years,\" he says now, \"but I wasn't living a sober life. I know guys who don't take drugs for 20 years but they still don't live a sober life. They're bad, they're manipulative, they're not conscious of other people's feelings. A sober lifestyle needs a sober consciousness. But, still, the concept of happiness is fleeting. I read this book, The History of Happiness, and they go from Homer to Kennedy to Martin Luther King and everybody has a different definition of happiness. Some people believe happiness is overcoming adversity or getting out of a bad situation. Abstaining from sex and then having sex is happiness to someone else. It's so weird.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934754'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390564605630/Mike-Tyson-008.jpg' alt='Mike Tyson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'I look at [happiness] as just living healthily with a good moral sense.' Photograph: Jacob Kepler for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Has Tyson worked out his own definition of happiness? \"I look at it as just living healthily with a good moral sense. Having morality. You know any self-inventory I do tells me the same thing. I look back at the life I once had and see that I didn't have an emotional problem. I had a morality problem. I was without any morals.\"</p><p>Reading his book which, for all its sly humour and savage eloquence, is often harrowing, it's hard to shake the images of Tyson's mother, Lorna, and his mentor, Cus D'Amato, which rise from the page. Tyson relives one his bleakest memories at the age of seven. \"I was a pudgy kid, very shy, and I spoke with a lisp. The kids called me 'Little Fairy Boy'. Once, my mother was fighting with this guy, Eddie, and it's barbaric. Eddie knocked out her gold tooth and me and Denise [his sister] are screaming. But my mother's real slick. She puts on a pot of boiling water.\"</p><p>Tyson looks up – and I can see the looming terror of his tale. \"The next thing I know she's pouring boiling water over Eddie. He was screaming, his back and face covered in blisters. We put him on the floor. My sister takes a lighter and sterilises a needle and then, one by one, she bursts the blisters.\"</p><p>Forty years later Tyson remembers that he and Denise were crying. He gave his mother's burnt lover a quarter to comfort him. Eddie rose to his feet and trudged to the corner store to buy alcohol for Tyson's mother. \"So you see,\" Tyson notes, \"he rewarded her for it. That's why I was so sexually dysfunctional.\"</p><p>Tyson describes his mother as a formidable presence who skewed his perceptions of women. \"That's why I've had to embark on a new life because I used to look upon women as being equal in a physical confrontation. I would take women very seriously. As I tried to explain in the book I didn't grow up around frightened women. If you sleep they might kill you – especially if you disrespected them. I remember my mother – boom! boom! – attacking these men. It was a violent household.</p><p>\"Even today, I don't like looking at a corner of a room. I still think of being in the corner getting beaten by my mother. Back then it was like 'Holy Moly!' [Tyson laughs] but as you get older it seems funnier. But even though people think of me as 'Mike Tyson', this scary guy, I still have that fear today. That's what happens when you're a traumatised kid.\"</p><p>It still hurts him, but Tyson mentions his brother Rodney who is five years older than him. Unlike Iron Mike, Rodney went into medicine and he's a surgical assistant at a hospital in California. Tyson seems stunned by his brother's achievements. \"I was used to living in a slum, in a condemned building. But my brother never talks about that. It must affect him. He said to me last time we spoke; 'I heard you have a magnificent book …' But he hasn't read it. He's just so far away from that world.\"</p><p>Why wouldn't Rodney read his book? \"I don't know,\" Tyson sighs. \"He's the number one trauma guy in the country. He's awesome. He's taken bullets out of some of my friends. He's stitched them up and they've said, 'Mike do you know your brother is a surgeon …' I say, 'Yeah, I know.'\"</p><p>How often does he see Rodney? \"Not much. It's the really sad part about my family. We don't have a close connection. Too many demons, too much pain.\"</p><p>Tyson sounds neither self-pitying nor maudlin when he says, \"my mother never believed in me. Even when I started doing well in boxing and people were writing about me she thought I was insane. I'd tell her, 'Read this article, mom.' She'd say: 'Yeah, I'll read it later …' She didn't have any hope in me because I let her down so much. She must have wondered – 'What do these white people see in my son?'\"</p><p>D'Amato, his supposed saviour, was a dark and complex figure. The sentimental version paints him as a saintly figure, a wise old trainer who rescued Tyson from juvenile prison and used boxing to instil discipline and purpose into his wayward life. But, as Tyson suggests, \"there wasn't a happy muscle in his face.\"</p><p>Tyson nods at the memory. \"He was bitter towards Angelo Dundee [who trained Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard] and all those guys. Cus wanted to be the guy everyone spoke about. You know it's crazy. If he were alive I'd never say these things. I would've made him out to be a saint because otherwise he would have killed me! I would've been so afraid and intimidated by Cus.\"</p><p>A giant painting of D'Amato stares down at us from the wall of Tyson's office. The previous day, Tyson had listened to an old recording of his trainer praising him but worrying, just before his death in 1985, that \"he likes girls too much.\" Tyson cackles: \"He was fucking Nostradamus ...\"</p><p>Tyson stresses that D'Amato made him more aware than anyone that he should be proud to be black – but he is troubled by other memories. \"Cus told me that the word 'no' would be like a foreign language to me when I become world champion. I don't know if that was good advice at such a young age. Another time, when I felt no girl would ever like me, he came in with a baseball bat. He told me I'd need it to beat the women off me.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934755'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390565352261/Cus-DAmato-001.jpg' alt='Cus D'Amato' width='200' height='400' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mike Tyson says of his mentor Cus D'Amato: 'There wasn't a happy muscle in his face.' Photograph: New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>How old was he when D'Amato offered that warped perspective? \"Fourteen, maybe 15. The only morality I knew was to win, to conquer, to be the best. Everything flowed from there. It made me think I should have this, or that girl should sleep with me. I was programmed that way. Can you believe this old man taught me these things? He must have been way out there.</p><p>\"I watch some crazy clips of myself from back then and I can say that I probably wasn't sane for a period in my life. But Nietzsche was crazy too. He was born in 1844 and died in 1900 … but he only had sex once in his life and he got a venereal disease. He said some profound shit, man, but he was totally off his head. I have this book of the world's greatest letters and his mentor was Richard Wagner. But he wrote Wagner a scathing letter. He had thought Wagner was perfect but he was just a leech. Wagner was an extreme megalomaniac. Nietzsche saw through all this and said, 'Hey, you're full of shit. You're a charlatan.' Yet the day Wagner died Nietzsche saw a picture of him and said, 'I love him much …' Nietzsche believed that the poor were supermen, the poor were the ones who could endure and strike back. Dostoevsky too. He was a like a diva but you have to remember that, in 1846, his first novel was called Poor Folk.\"</p><p>Tyson learnt about Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Napoleon, from D'Amato and Norman Mailer. \"You can be an idiot and still learn something from those guys. You didn't need to go to school to get an education around Cus and Mailer. They talked about everything from such a high position. They never come down to laymen's terms. I learnt a lot and it's helped me through all the ups and downs.\"</p><p>Tyson and his wife, Kiki, were once nearly broke. They went to their local supermarket in Henderson and, after all his squandered hundreds of millions, he was worried that they didn't have enough money to pay for their small cart of groceries. \"I kept telling Kiki, 'Put that back' – because once, with my mother in Brooklyn, we didn't have enough. Fuck it. This lady at the till was taking items away and saying: 'Put it back!' I never forgot that feeling. My wife kept saying 'I've got enough, trust me.' I said: 'Baby, please, I don't want to be embarrassed.' But Kiki was right. We had just enough.\"</p><p>From Kiki, via an elderly white drug counsellor called Marilyn and his close friend Hope, to his youngest daughter, Milan, Tyson appears to be have been rescued by females. Of course, being Tyson, his gratitude is freighted with uncertainty. \"I love my boys, but my daughters make me want to be a nice person. I want my daughters to be treated the way I treat them. But I fear not being able to take care of my wife and kids the way they deserve. I fear that my life is just going to sink away and I'll just be a homeless bum. I have so many fears. I'm afraid of being desperate. But I'm trying.</p><p>\"My wife gave me a perception of gratitude that I never had before. I was just a prima donna my whole life, thinking I deserved everything I got. But since then I've learnt gratitude. Sometimes I still get angry because she'll be telling me: 'Remember when we didn't have this …' Now I've got an office and stuff. This is like being in heaven compared to how we were before. But I still want more. Ain't that crazy?\"</p><p>Tyson seems less crazy now than he has done for years. He's trying hard to stay straight and through his family, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2013/may/14/boxing-mike-tyson\" title=\"\">one-man stage show</a>, some acting, his book and his new company <a href=\"http://www.ironmikeproductions.com\" title=\"\">Iron Mike Promotions</a> [IMP], Tyson has enough to sustain him. Yet he is painfully honest about the perennial danger that he will fall again. \"I've had a little success with acting but I can't even enjoy it. I go somewhere with my wife and I'm scared I might get carried away and she might leave me. It's really hard to be happy … but I've got something that makes me think, 'Man, I don't want to fuck this up!'\"</p><p>Tyson has lived a life which, as he says, has been \"full of extreme highs and lows\", and one in which, for all his faults, he has often been treated like a piece of money-making meat. What does he think of people today, having seen the best and the worst of so many – including himself? \"Human beings are just a bad lot. Not everyone but the majority of people. Let's put it like this rather than in a collective sense. The people I invested the most time in disappointed me …\"</p><p>Yet he stresses that his wife and Steve Lott, one of his oldest friends and now his assistant, are two of the exceptions who bolster him most. They are almost always with him as Tyson tries to turn IMP into a boxing powerhouse. Even if he continues to struggle for a promotional license in some states, and he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/10/mike-tyson-banned-uk-rape-conviction\" title=\"\">barred from entering Britain last month</a> because of his criminal record, Tyson appears determined to make his new life work.</p><p>\"We're discussing this deal with Fox TV where we get 32 fights a year. Man, if that happens we'll be in the driving seat. It looks real good. This is the moment. The two shows we did recently superseded all the ratings ESPN had for their Friday night fights. But I never anticipated this thing being that difficult. Still, imagine if I was not Mike Tyson and how hard it would be then.\"</p><p>As the sun sinks across Nevada, Tyson shows me footage of his favourite old fighters. The office is empty but for me, Tyson and Lott and they dig out film of Panama Al Brown – the freakishly tall bantamweight of the 1920s and 1930s who supposedly had a tempestuous affair with Jean Cocteau.</p><p>Tyson has an encyclopedic knowledge of boxing which is at its most irresistible when he zips from one great old fighter to another, from Ted 'Kid' Lewis to 'Baby' Azizmendi, from Harry Greb to Jack Britton, the New York welterweight who had a reputed 350 fights. Panama Al flickers across a screen while Tyson marvels at his skill and venom. He seems happy – lost in boxing again.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427934756'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/1/24/1390565016080/Mike-Tyson-008.jpg' alt='Mike Tyson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mike Tyson in make-up before recording an advertisement for WWE. Photograph: Jacob Kepler for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The next day Tyson has to make a television advert at his office for WWE [World Wrestling Entertainment] and the contrast between 21st-century wrestling and boxing at its greatest, all those decades ago, is stark. As if to showcase the similar difference in his own life, he points out that we first need to babysit his four-year-old daughter Milan and her friend. \"They're doing finger-painting,\" Tyson says while we watch the two small girls hard at work in the reception area. \"And we're in charge ...\"</p><p>Tyson is at his warmest and most generous today and it's impossible not to like him as we fritter away the hours before the wrestling advert begins. We talk about his facial tattoo. \"I just hated myself then,\" he says. \"I literally wanted to deface myself. I went to this tattoo artist and said I wanted my face to be covered in stars. He refused. He said I have a good face.\"</p><p>The tattoo artist suggested, instead, that he ink a Maori tribal design on to the left side of Tyson's face. \"It looks awesome. That tattoo is me. Sometimes I see people with tattoos on their face and I'm like 'Woah, this guy is crazy!' I forget that I've got one on my face.\"</p><p>Tyson laughs. \"In the beginning, some people were scared by it. But the bikers would shout out: 'Oh, that's beautiful man, great ink!'\"</p><p>Eventually, to the delight of Milan and her friend, the make-up artist arrives. It seems poignant now, setting aside his past brutality, that Tyson should have his face covered in make-up while his daughter croons, \"Don't worry, daddy, she's gonna make you look pretty!\"</p><p>Tyson looks bashful while the make-up artist powders his tattoo. \"Lipstick! Lipstick!\" the little girls chant, full of glee at the thought that Iron Mike will need lipstick for television.</p><p>We retreat to a conference room where the WWE commercial is being shot. Tyson winks at me before he addresses the autocue which is filled by a stream of words he needs to say out loud while being filmed.</p><p>His only mistake on the first take is to pay homage to 'Cold Stone' Steve Austin – rather than the old wrestler's 'Stone Cold' nickname. He does it again and again and again. By the fifth take Tyson the pro nails it – only for the producer to inadvertently cough during the last line. Tyson needs to do it again and so he tells the unblinking camera that one of the highlights of his career was the moment he was elected to the WWE Hall of Fame. He reels off the blurb a sixth time, perfectly, only to hear that someone had knocked on the window as they walked past.</p><p>Take Seven, however, is unbeatable. The first part is done but he still needs to do another and a Q&amp;A for the WWE.</p><p>\"I need a break,\" he says. Tyson leads me back into his office. It seems like he does not know whether to laugh or cry.

Wenger stressed that Chelsea had done nothing wrong but it was clear that he felt they had sought to manipulate the market.</p><p>\"I am surprised because Juan Mata is a great player and they sell a great player to a direct opponent,\" Wenger said. \"It opens [up] again a little bit the opportunity of this transfer market because Chelsea had already played twice against Man United so they don't play again. They could have sold him last week [before the United game].</p><p>\"It opens, at least, the opportunity of the dates of this transfer window. Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others, not. If you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly in the game, that should not happen. I just think you would want  everybody on the same level. I can understand completely what Chelsea is doing. They do not do the rules but, maybe, the rules should be a bit more adapted to more fairness.\"</p><p>Wenger came in for criticism for selling Robin van Persie in the summer of 2012 to United. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That's why I was surprised [about the Mata deal]. In our defence, we were in a more explicable situation because Van Persie had only one year to go. He was 29 and had played here for a long time. It was not a club  that I wanted to sell Van Persie to. I wanted to sell him to Juventus. But he had decided to go to Man United and, at the end of  the day, you need the agreement of the three parties.\"</p><p>Wenger said that Mata was a player he \"loved\" – he tried to sign him from Valencia before Chelsea got him in 2011. The Arsenal manager does not see United as being in decline and he believes that Chelsea might come to regret moving him to Old Trafford.</p><p>\"They could,\" he said. \"I don't think about Man United like you think about Man United. It's a short moment in their history and I don't see Man United as  a club in decline. This can happen to  any big club but they will come up again, don't worry.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427917759'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390504512144/Ars-ne-Wenger-011.jpg' alt='Arsène Wenger' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Arsenal's manager Arsène Wenger does not agree with the January transfer window. Photograph: Stephen Pond/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Wenger did take into account the size of the fee that United will pay for Mata – a club record £40m – and he veered from his slightly conspiratorial theme when he said that the money was the most persuasive reason for Chelsea's sale.</p><p>\"That is the first time I come to that conclusion with Chelsea,\" Wenger said. \"It means somewhere that Chelsea changes philosophy and they want to get on line with financial fair play. That is a good thing. They sold [Kevin] De Bruyne [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/18/chelsea-sell-kevin-de-bruyne-wolfsburg\" title=\"\">to Wolfsburg for €20m</a>]. And Mata. They lost £50m last year, disguised. Maybe it's more. If they get £37m now for Mata … \"</p><p>United's need for reinforcements in midfield became even more apparent with the news that Michael Carrick is expected to be ruled out for up to four weeks with an ankle injury. The midfielder sustained possible ligament damage in Wednesday night's Carling Cup game against Sunderland but the joint was too swollen to be scanned on Thursday. Carrick has recently returned from six weeks out following surgery on his achilles.</p><p>Arsenal take on Coventry City in the FA Cup at home on Friday night and Wenger said that he would name a strong team in order to maintain the club's momentum. But he feels that something has to change on football's financial side.\"If you imagine 20 clubs in the Premier League with 20 multi-billionaires,\" Wenger said. \"At some stage, they have to sit down and say, 'Look, we are killing each other just for the sake to pay higher wages, or do we make a rule that makes sense?'</p><p>\"It will happen in the longer term, there's no other way. We had only one or two billionaires at the start but once we have 10, they have to respect some rules or they kill each other and it's endless.\"</p>","headline":"Arsène Wenger questions motives of

Obviously I'm a United fan as well but we're playing them so I'm Sunderland all the way.\"</p><p>Brown and his new team were never supposed to go to Wembley this season. After being sidelined with serious knee trouble for almost two years the former England defender was advised to accept medical advice and retire last summer.</p><p>By early autumn though a defiant Brown was close to a thoroughly unexpected first team comeback but, by then, the chaos surrounding Paolo Di Canio's doomed managerial reign and the former director of football Roberto De Fanti's flawed recruitment policy had plunged Sunderland into a relegation battle they remain embroiled in.</p><p>\"Back in September I could not imagine this club would be going to a Wembley final, and that's the honest truth,\" acknowledged Brown. \"If you'd asked in September if there was a chance of us being in a final, nobody here would have said 'yes'. We've come such a long way since then. We're a strong bunch of lads and hopefully we can just keep this going now in the league.\"</p><p>If Brown's return to action was integral to Sunderland's slow rebirth, Gus Poyet's appointment as Di Canio's successor has re-ignited a sense of cautious optimism on Wearside.</p><p>\"Gus has been brilliant,\" said Brown. \"He's on everyone's side. He helps everyone. We know what he wants and that's what we try and do. He changes things at times to see how we react to it and we reacted brilliantly against Manchester United. We have some great and talented players. When we play well you can see that on the pitch. The lads are buzzing and I hope all our supporters are too.\"</p><p>Like Poyet, Brown knows all the euphoria will evaporate swiftly should an alarmingly inconsistent Sunderland – still stuck in the relegation zone – fail to beat Stoke City at the Stadium of Light in the Premier League next Wednesday and then lose the derby at Newcastle United on Saturday week. Even so, he would not be human if he did not allow himself the luxury of looking forward to a final against his one time local rivals.</p><p>\"Obviously it will be nice for me to play against Manchester City,\" Brown admits. \"But regardless of who it is we'd just like to go to Wembley and win the game now. It would be great for the club.\"</p>","headline":"Sunderland's Wes Brown: I feel no sympathy for Manchester United","trailText":"Wes Brown's past may be bound up with Manchester United but
