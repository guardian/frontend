        "body":"<p>Anglo-Irish relations took a momentous step forward on Wednesday when the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-video\">Queen shook hands with Sinn F&eacute;in's Martin McGuinness</a>.</p><p>The historic encounter between the former IRA commander - now Northern Ireland's deputy first minister - and the Queen was unthinkable a little over 10 years ago.</p><p>But the success of the peace process and the Queen's acclaimed visit to the Republic of Ireland last year, when her conciliatory words and gestures won over many critics of the monarchy, paved the way for their meeting.</p><p>The much-anticipated first handshake took place away from the media spotlight behind closed doors.</p><p>They later shook hands in public. McGuinness held the monarch's hands for a few moments and spoke to her in Irish. He told her the words meant: \"Goodbye and God's speed.\"</p><p>McGuinness was a senior member of the IRA when it killed the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten in a bomb blast in 1979.</p><p>The Queen is the head of Britain's armed forces, seen in the past by Republicans as occupying troops in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The pair met in a room within Belfast's Lyric theatre during an event celebrating the arts in the Republic and Northern Ireland.<br /> <br />In a quiet space used by the Lyric for creative learning, the two were joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Northern Ireland first minister, Peter Robinson, the Irish president, Michael D Higgins, and his wife, Sabina.</p><p>The McGrath Suite – named in honour of benefactor Harvey McGrath, former chairman of British insurer Prudential, and his wife, Allison – is usually filled with toddlers enjoying storytelling sessions or drama students taking part in workshops.</p><p>But on Wednesday it was sparsely furnished with leather seating – four chairs and a sofa – set around a circular wooden table decorated with flowers, with tea, coffee and still and sparkling water on a side table.</p><p>The floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on to landscaped gardens and the river Lagan were covered with curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392247125|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|249c682dfb3cec6b2183d53690ec4b51555d945d -->",

The event has been made possible by the earlier negotiated surrender of the IRA.</p><p>Surrendering honourably is better than holding out to the last. The leaders of the 1916 rising in Dublin chose to surrender rather than subject the city's population to further bloodshed – in politics as in other areas of life it is often necessary to compromise principles.</p><p>But there is a gulf between compromise and abandonment that should not be bridged. Otherwise radical ideas and the notion of oppositional currents are devalued. What does it say about the plausibility of the adversarial position if the values espoused in opposition are jettisoned just to make it into office?</p><p>McGuinness will not be standing in front of the British head of state on equal terms, as head of another state that had gained its independence from Britain. He is there as deputy head of a state over which the British hold unalloyed sovereignty and which he ostensibly spent much of his adult life trying to destroy.</p><p>Peter Hain, the former secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has said that \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18557029\" title=\"\">many republicans will see it as a betrayal</a>\". He is right. They will feel that McGuinness and Sinn Féin have not simply compromised core principles but also abandoned them, principles in pursuit of which he and his colleagues in positions of leadership directed others to both take life and risk losing their own.</p><p>In County Derry, where McGuinness is domiciled, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18580864\" title=\"\">graffiti has appeared</a> on walls – \"U Dare Marty\" and \"Sinn Féin sellouts\". At a rally in south Armagh on Sunday, McGuinness was <a href=\"http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/mcguinness-a-judas-say-ex-ira-men-1-3986748\" title=\"\">denounced as a traitor</a> who had persistently lied to his volunteers. Despite the intemperate language in which it is sometimes expressed, the substance of republican opposition to the meeting does not render it the perspective of past-hugging dinosaurs.</p><p>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood recently declined to attend a service in the Queen's presence at Llandaff cathedral which was laid on to mark the diamond jubilee. The Plaid Cymru assembly member for South Wales West, <a href=\"http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18582056\" title=\"\">Bethan Jenkins, described Martin McGuinness as \"naive\"</a> for going ahead with the meeting. Boycotting monarchy is a perfectly legitimate position for republicans to adopt.</p><p>Irish republicans who express that dissent do so in the context of a British state which continues to behave badly: just last week it <a href=\"http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/21963\" title=\"\">denied a public inquiry into the massacre of civilians in Belfast in 1971</a> while continuing to seek prosecution of republicans it suspects of involvement in the IRA campaign. This week it is indulging in gratuitous flag-waving by having the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18546644\" title=\"\">armed forces flag hoisted</a> for six days at Belfast City Hall, riding roughshod over nationalist protests that such action is triumphalist.</p><p>The British monarchy, in opting to shake the hand of McGuinness, must be aware of the perspective <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-23/metro/32368592_1_sinn-fein-leader-ira-commander-ira-bomb\" title=\"\">outlined in the Boston Globe</a>: \"There are many law enforcement officials, Irish and British, who believe McGuinness was running the IRA or was at least on its ruling army council, when the plan to blow up Mountbatten was approved.\"  Yet it is the path the monarchy has decided to tread. Why? <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100167200/on-martin-mcguinness-meeting-her-majesty-the-queen/\" title=\"\">Norman Tebbit, who survived the Brighton bomb in 1984, explained it succinctly</a>: McGuinness and Sinn Féin have \"now accepted the sovereignty of Her Majesty over Northern Ireland\".  Strange bedfellows, perhaps, but the Daily Telegraph is not out of sync with peeved republicans when it proclaims \"<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the British establishment completes the decommissioning of Martin McGuinness</a>\".</p><p>Tomorrow's event will be dressed up in the discourse of the peace process, which invariably serves to mask the truth. Despite much discursive massaging, the matter has little if anything to do with reaching out to unionists. If Sinn Féin and McGuinness were really concerned with embracing unionist sensitivity they would stop denying that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13871535\" title=\"\">the IRA carried out the Kingsmill massacre</a> in 1976, an act on an ethical par with Derry's Bloody Sunday in 1972. The strategic thinking behind tomorrow's meeting is consistent with Sinn Féin's expansionist strategy in the south of Ireland. Its electoral ambitions, not reconciliation with unionism, are what fuels McGuinness's meeting the Queen.</p><p>However, having scorned the opportunity during the royal visit to Ireland last year, Sinn Féin's transparently crass manipulation of tomorrow's event may end up alienating more votes than it attracts.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392201402|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|2d26018997bd6ea2388aaf40ff7e716116633358 -->",

When the Queen moved on to shake hands with the next person, and the spotlight was no longer on McGuinness, he immediately clasped his hands respectfully in front on him – which, ironically, happens to be the same gesture that's so often adopted by the Queen. At the same time he also produced a little mouth-clamp. This is a defensive gesture which shows that, for him at least, this was no ordinary handshake.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392260586|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|053c11686686993bc415ed21edda9b598106ac12 -->",

        "body":"<p>'<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/22/martin-mcguinness-shake-hands-queen\" title=\"\">Queen shakes hands with IRA</a>' would once have caused a sensation. Today it is a happy milestone on the rocky path of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18586783\" title=\"\">Irish reconciliation</a>. Within a year, the monarch has made the first ever visit to the Republic of Ireland and is today greeting a republican leader in Belfast. That greeting is across a political divide but also a religious one, the divide that created <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland\" title=\"\">Irish partition in 1922</a> and has underlain Ulster's troubled history ever since. For a monarch to cross a divide is not to unite it, but it is better than not crossing at all.</p><p>The history of attempts to end communal violence in Northern Ireland since the 1960s is sobering for all who claim for Britain some unique genius for domestic harmony, one that it is entitled to visit on Yugoslavs, Iraqis, Afghans, Libyans and others alike. At least until recently, each hesitant dawn has been followed by bloody dusk. From the collapse of power-sharing in 1974 to its stuttering resumption in Gordon Brown's \"second Good Friday\" in 2009, London's attempt to bring peace to Northern Ireland has demonstrated the maxim that no corner of the British empire is ruled so ineptly as one that is&nbsp;closest to hand.</p><p>Under British ministers, the evils of the old Protestant ascendancy were exacerbated by hamfisted security, school apartheid, state dependency and housing segregation, all contributing to a 30-year upsurge in communal division and bloodshed. Figures indicate that twice as many Ulster parishes are now more than 80% single faith as before direct rule. Each year, yet another incident of sectarian violence emanates – largely from young people educated wholly apart from half their fellow citizens. Far from being reconciled, most of Belfast has merely been segregated.</p><p>As a result, Northern Ireland had, at the last count, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/28/peace-walls-belfast-ceasefire\" title=\"\">80 barriers and \"peace walls\"</a> dividing its urban and suburban neighbourhoods, three times as many as at the time of the partial ceasefire in 1994. Such a collapse in community concord is unknown elsewhere in Europe. It is hypocritical for Britain to lay down the law for \"trouble spots\" round the world when it cannot remove these social obscenities from its own backyard.</p><p>For four decades, a parallel \"peace process\" assumed that power to deliver reconciliation lay somewhere between London, Dublin and possibly Washington. Conferences on \"conflict studies\" used to lump together Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel-Palestine as if they were identical cases. A regular attender was the old IRA watcher, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7791006.stm\" title=\"\">Conor Cruise O'Brien</a>, who predicted that Northern Ireland would find peace not when London or Dublin ordained it but when local militants had grownup children, and craved respectability in retirement. He was right.</p><p>Peace has come to the streets of Northern Ireland crucially because the current generation of politicians, most from extremist groupings, tired of war and decided peace was in their interest. The old Provisionals, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, turned their coats and renounced the bullet in favour of the ballot. A bitterly divided Unionist majority, led by David Trimble, Ian Paisley and the current first minister, Peter Robinson, drifted hesitantly into an oligarchy of frigid and fragile power-sharing.</p><p>This oligarchy remains afloat on huge sums of Treasury cash, enough to make Greece seem a model of fiscal self-reliance. Fewer people than live in Greater Manchester are governed through 12 ministerial departments and a 400-strong first minister's office, bigger than Downing Street. The Belfast academic, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/mar/09/highereducation.highereducationprofile\" title=\"\">Paul Bew</a>, refers to the British&nbsp;taxpayer as \"the great unsung hero of the Troubles\".</p><p>Yet it has eventually worked. To visit Northern Ireland today is to sense a novel stability in the air. In Belfast, two separate citizenries that inhabit one city and who once never met, worked, studied, conferred, let alone governed together, now do at least some of these things. The economic problems of the Republic have halted the depopulation of the north. Security, the bugbear of divided communities, has at last come under local control, lubricated by a £1bn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/21/gordon-brown-northern-ireland-police\" title=\"\">subvention from Gordon Brown in 2009</a>.</p><p>That said, the future needs realism rather than hope. Ulster's present rulers, honed in a bitter struggle, have undoubted calibre, but they are mortal. They can shake hands with each other, not to mention the Queen, because they know they carry the confidence of their constituencies. That confidence may not outlive them. Northern Ireland politics is full of dark woods and frightening places. Sharing power across an ethnic or religious divide is inherently unstable. When the present generation passes, deluge may yet return.</p><p>For the old division remains. Belfast has not achieved religious reconciliation comparable with Glasgow or Liverpool. Northern Ireland was partitioned from the new Irish state to stave off the threat of armed revolt by its Protestant community. Ever since, its politics has relied on a Unionist majority wielding the power of plebiscite. It has relied on London's acceptance that whatever Ulster wants, Ulster gets. But were an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alexsalmond\" title=\"\">Alex Salmond</a> to emerge and demand independence or reunion with the Republic, England would be unlikely to complain.</p><p>Unionism is vulnerable to demography. The first minister, Peter Robinson, admits that it may soon need to preach its virtues to a swath of Catholic voters. The religious division is already in the region of 50-50. A recent poll had 54% of schoolchildren claiming to be Catholics, while only 35% of students now call themselves Protestant.</p><p>This \"population time-bomb\" was once used to explain, if not excuse, unionist paranoia. It is now inverted. Unionists will eventually lose their automatic veto on Irish reunion. They cannot forever coerce Catholics into being British, and must resort to an unfamiliar methodology, that of persuasion. Demography may yet be the&nbsp;greatest peacemaker of all.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392217995|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|4b961f8cfd11f78b9c706ecdf4130afb55e378e0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Queen has arrived in Northern Ireland to celebrate the territory's hard-won peace in a town that suffered one of the IRA's worst massacres.</p><p>Catholic and Protestant leaders from across Ireland united in Enniskillen at an ecumenical service in the monarch's honour on Tuesday as, outside in wind and rain, several thousand people waved union flags.</p><p>The monarch's long-awaited meeting with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness will come on Wednesday in Belfast. But the start of her Northern Ireland tour was devoted to Enniskillen, where an IRA bomb in 1987 killed 11 Protestant civilians and wounded 63 others as they commemorated British dead from the two world wars.</p><p>\"She's a total lady. We were nervous, but she made us feel at ease,\" said Stephen Gault, who was among a group of bombing survivors to meet the Queen and Prince Philip in a Protestant minister's home. Gault was wounded that day, while his 49-year-old father Sam was killed.</p><p>\"Today brings back some terrible memories, to be sure,\" Gault said, \"but above all it shows us that the Enniskillen victims have not been forgotten.\"</p><p>Widespread revulsion at the Enniskillen attack proved a threshold event in Northern Ireland's four-decade conflict, spurring McGuinness and other IRA chiefs to begin sounding out peace terms with Britain.</p><p>McGuinness, now the senior Catholic in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, refused to meet the Queen during her landmark visit to the Republic of Ireland last year, but says the time is finally right.</p><p>The Queen highlighted the impressive resilience of Enniskillen, whose Protestant and Catholic residents long avoided succumbing to the worst of Northern Ireland's sectarian passions. Locals invited the Queen into the town's neighbouring Protestant and Catholic cathedrals. The queen received thunderous applause as she entered St Michael's, her first visit to a Catholic church in Northern Ireland during her 60-year reign.</p><p>Earlier, she and Prince Philip had been honoured at a service of thanksgiving at the Anglican St Macartin's Cathedral, where leaders of all the main churches took turns leading 700 dignitaries in hymns and prayers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392206763|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|9316a77e82cc4968fd207497baa4751f3d19adec -->",

        "body":"<p>On the eve of her historic meeting with the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, the Queen began her two-day tour of Northern Ireland on Tuesday by visiting a community that suffered one of the most notorious IRA attacks.</p><p>The Queen joined Catholic and Protestant leaders in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, scene of the Remembrance Day bombing which killed 11 people and injured 63 others 25 years ago. Crowds gathered in the wind and rain to watch her attend a service of thanksgiving in the Anglican St Macartin's Cathedral, then cross the road to St Michael's Roman Catholic church, where she met members of the community.</p><p>It was the first time in her 60-year reign the Queen had set foot in a Catholic church in Northern Ireland. But then this visit, probably the most significant she has made to the province, has promised some ground-breaking moments. Chief among them is the much-anticipated meeting between McGuinness, the Sinn Féin deputy first minister, and the Queen, the ultimate symbol of British rule in Ireland.</p><p>Wednesday's planned meeting, at an arts event in Belfast and agreed at the 11th hour, has set the tone of the tour. With a focus on reconciliation, Enniskillen was the perfect prelude, given that the bombing of the town caused such widespread revulsion that it kick-started the peace process.</p><p>Among the survivors to meet her privately was Stephen Gault, who was wounded that day, and whose father, Sam, 49, was killed. \"Today brings back some terrible memories, to be sure,\" said Gault, \"but above all, it shows us that the Enniskillen victims have not been forgotten.\"</p><p>Speaking ahead of her visit, he said he believed the Queen's meeting with McGuinness would be difficult for some. \"Nobody has been brought to justice for Enniskillen so it's very hard for the families to accept Mr McGuinness shaking the Queen's hand,\" he said.</p><p>Noel McIlfatrick , whose wife and children were injured, and whose brother-in-law Edward Armstrong was killed in the attack, said: \"I certainly wouldn't shake his hand. It will be difficult for the Queen.\"</p><p>But Robin Eames, the former Anglican Primate of All Ireland, welcomed the gesture. \"When I arrived in Enniskillen today, I found it difficult to forget what happened,\" said Eames, who was in in the town on the day of the attack. \"But I believe the handshake tomorrow is another milestone in the peace process in Northern Ireland. It is a genuine step forward.\"</p><p>In entrenched republican areas, such as the Bogside in Derry, graffiti reading \"Marty U Dare\" and \"Sinn Féin sellouts\", made clear the feelings of dissidents. At a rally in Belfast at the weekend, McGuinness was denounced as a \"traitor\" and a \"Judas\". Had he forgotten, they asked, that the Queen decorated the Parachute Regiment of Bloody Sunday notoriety?</p><p>But on this tour, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will also be required to set aside past emotions. It cannot be easy meeting a man once part of an organisation which assassinated Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, by blowing up his fishing boat in 1979.</p><p>The handshake is the result of prolonged discussion and exact details of its delicate choreography were still not clear on Tuesday. First indications were that there would be no photographic record. McGuinness has recently stated Sinn Féin has no problems with photographs, and \"for it not to be recorded I think it would be cowardly\".</p><p>As final preparations were under way, he stoked up the symbolism further. It would not just be the Queen's gloved hand he was preparing to shake, but, \"when shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth, I'm extending the hand of peace to all my unionist brothers and sisters\". So, it will be Queen Elizabeth's hand he shakes, not \"the Queen's\", a proper noun and a step too far, nor Elizabeth Windsor's, as Sinn Féin has referred to her in the past. Queen Elizabeth would seem to be a compromise in a visit laden with them.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392218180|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|c47e41bdb3875c9e5e3796c2dd838e83726911e3 -->",

He told her the words meant: \"Goodbye and God's speed.\"</p><p>McGuinness was a senior member of the IRA when it killed the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten in a bomb blast in 1979.</p><p>The Queen is the head of Britain's armed forces, seen in the past by Republicans as occupying troops in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The pair met in a room within Belfast's Lyric theatre during an event celebrating the arts in the Republic and Northern Ireland.<br /> <br />In a quiet space used by the Lyric for creative learning, the two were joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Northern Ireland first minister, Peter Robinson, the Irish president, Michael D Higgins, and his wife, Sabina.</p><p>The McGrath Suite – named in honour of benefactor Harvey McGrath, former chairman of British insurer Prudential, and his wife, Allison – is usually filled with toddlers enjoying storytelling sessions or drama students taking part in workshops.</p><p>But on Wednesday it was sparsely furnished with leather seating – four chairs and a sofa – set around a circular wooden table decorated with flowers, with tea, coffee and still and sparkling water on a side table.</p><p>The floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on to landscaped gardens and the river Lagan were covered with curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392247125|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|249c682dfb3cec6b2183d53690ec4b51555d945d -->",

        "headline":"The Belfast handshake: after years of fiery rhetoric came rapprochement",
        "body":"<p>When it came, it was substantial: no light brushing of fingers, rather a firm, sustained grip fully worthy of the import it carried. At least, that was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-shake-hands?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the handshake we saw in public</a> between the Queen and the former IRA commander, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness, now Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, in Belfast on Wednesday.</p><p>After the anticipation, agonising and protracted negotiations over when and where, we eventually got two for the price of one – one public handshake, one private.</p><p>The first historic encounter between the Queen, pre-eminent symbol of British rule in Ulster, and McGuinness, die-hard republican dedicated to unseating her as head of state, was in the private McGrath suite at Belfast's Lyric theatre. Sparsely furnished, and normally used for creative learning workshops, there were four chairs, a sofa and a circular table, with bottled water to ease any nervous, dry throats.</p><p>Despite there being no cameras and no photographic record, this was the theatre's most significant production, and playing to its tiniest ever audience. Just seven people were in the room: the two main principals, plus the Duke of Edinburgh, Irish president Michael Higgins, his wife Sabina, Northern Ireland's first minister Peter Robinson, and the Queen's private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt.</p><p>Cameras were later allowed to record the handshake at the end of the event – an art exhibition organised by cross-border charity Co-operation Ireland, which works to bring divided communities together. There, McGuinness stood second in the lineup as the Queen, in \"apple green\", as described by Buckingham Palace, worked her way down. He did not, as others, bow his head as they shook hands. The handshake, however, lasted three times longer than the others. Then that was it. Long unthinkable, the moment that marked a milestone in the tortured history of British-Irish relations, that drew a further line under the peace process to a conflict that claimed more than 3,600 lives in 30 years of the Troubles, was over.</p><p>\"Martin, are you still true to your convictions?\" yelled a journalist as a smiling McGuinness emerged shortly after the Queen's departure. \"I'm still a republican,\" was the response. \"How did it go?\" \"It was good, it was nice.\" And with those anodyne words, in such contrast to the fiery rhetoric of the past, rapprochement seemed to have been reached between the erstwhile commander of the Irish Republican Army, and the Queen, head of the British armed services.</p><p>Originally the whole event was to be private. Eventually a media pool – one photographer, one TV camera and one reporter – were invited to record the dignitaries viewing the exhibition and meeting the 50 artists and guests. But no conversations were allowed to be recorded.</p><p>There may have been no microphones, but cameras <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-handshake-body-language\" title=\"\">did capture the body language</a>. Prince Philip – whose uncle Lord Mountbatten, the Queen's second cousin, was assassinated by the IRA who blew up his fishing boat in County Sligo in 1979 – appeared to move swiftly away as McGuinness leaned towards him while the group viewed the art exhibition, though he did shake his hand later. Little else betrayed the complex emotions surely harboured by both sides.</p><p>McGuinness had greeted the Queen in Irish: <em>\"Maidin mhaith. Cead mile failte.\"</em> (\"Good morning. A hundred thousand welcomes.\") And bade her <em>\"Slan agus beannacht\"</em> – \"Goodbye and farewell\" – on departure.</p><p>During their private conversation, we were told, he acknowledged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/may/19/queens-dublin-speech-draws-praise?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">her speech in the Irish Republic last year </a>referring to \"all the victims\" of the conflict, and of being able to \"bow to the past but not be bound by it\".</p><p>A Sinn Féin source said: \"He said people had suffered on both sides. He emphasised the need to acknowledge the pain of all the victims of the conflict and their families. And she agreed with him.\" McGuinness had told her their meeting was \"a powerful signal that peace-building requires leadership\".</p><p>\"Let the images speak for themselves. It has been a good, cordial, positive meeting,\" said the source. The only protests against it had been from \"a tiny minority with paintbrushes and a pot of paint\".</p><p>The Queen, meanwhile, \"has always been very open to this\", said a royal source, who described her as \"relaxed\". This was a delicately choreographed 40-minute operation, conducted amid the strictest security, with surrounding roads made sterile, sniffer dogs let loose on every piece of shrubbery, and marksmen on the theatre's roof.</p><p>It was also an occasion designed to meet Sinn Féin's sensitivities. Buckingham Palace described it as a \"patronage\" visit – by the Queen as patron of the charity – stressing it was not connected to the diamond jubilee tour. Peter Sheridan, the chief executive of Co-operation Ireland, said the theatre event \"had a neutral, independent feel to it\". He had offered it as a venue, but it was only on Friday that Sinn Féin's ruling council accepted, though not unanimously.</p><p>Since the Queen's Dublin visit, which Sinn Féin boycotted to wide criticism, there had been a will, but no acceptable way, to engineer such an encounter. The Lyric presentred Sinn Féin with a \"doable\" opportunity – and one away from jubilee hysteria.</p><p>McGuinness, who claims to have left the IRA in 1974, though British and Irish intelligence believe he was active for longer, had acknowledged the difficulties for both himself and the Queen. In an interview before the meeting, he said: \"I represent people who have been terribly hurt by British state violence over many years. I also recognise I am going to meet someone who has also been hurt as a result of the conflict, and someone who is very conscious that in many homes in Britain there are parents, wives, children, brothers and sisters of British soldiers who were sent here who lost their lives in the conflict.\"</p><p>After the handshake, there was praise – and grumblings. Dissident republicans claimed Sinn Féin had sold out, ardent unionists claimed Sinn Féin had \"hijacked\" the jubilee visit. Owen Paterson, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: \"This will move Northern Ireland on to a whole new plane. After all the trauma of Northern Ireland, everyone is looking forward.\"</p><p>Tony Blair, who oversaw the Good Friday agreement ratified in 1998, acclaimed it as \"a magnificent gesture\" by the Queen. For the Queen, it was business as usual, as she made her way to a huge jubilee party for 22,000 people at Stormont. It was business as usual, too, for Sinn Féin, with all of its 29 members of the Northern Ireland assembly boycotting the event. \"Nobody expects Martin McGuinness would be at an event with 10,000 union flags being waved,\" a Sinn Féin spokesman was quoted as saying.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392275349|2013-07-02T13:00:49Z|8ddf884175e3df5c422a215ce7144475ef83a03f -->",
