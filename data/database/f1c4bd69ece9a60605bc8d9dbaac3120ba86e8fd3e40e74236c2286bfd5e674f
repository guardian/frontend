standing on a parking site of the VW plant in Wolfsburg, central Germany. Volkswagen's new boss said the auto giant would need more than a year to fix all its pollution-cheating cars, as the company suspended four employees suspected of being behind the global deception. The world's biggest carmaker by sales has launched investigations into who was behind the scam involving over 11 million diesel cars which were equipped with software that switches the engine to a low-emissions mode during tests.
