Even now he is puzzled about its origins. It had nothing to do with P45s, or Colt 45s, or Rule 45 (the segregation of child offenders in prison), or 45rpm vinyl singles or the year the war ended, 1945. It was the code name for Jewish. “Is he [or she] forty-five?’ his grandparents would ask whenever someone in the family made a new acquaintance.</p> <p>Bernard and Winnie Schlesinger were Jewish themselves, the children of stockbrokers, raised in the same affluent Hampstead milieu and brought together in their teens by a love of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera\">classical music</a>. Their family roots were German (their grandfathers had been classmates in Frankfurt) but both were passionate about England: it, rather than Israel, was “their promised land”. To young Ian, coming over from Holland to spend holidays with them, the life they had created, in an old vicarage in Berkshire, was a pastoral idyll: within their charmed circle, he too became an Anglophile, besotted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket\">cricket</a>, Eagle and Beano, blue blazers and Viyella shirts.</p> <p>Bernard and Winnie were a classic case of assimilation: shedding the marks of ethnic difference and immigrant status, they became more English than the English. It wasn’t that they were self-hating Jews. Nor did they conceal their origins. When her elder brother Walter changed his name from Regensburg to Raeburn, Winnie (unmarried at the time) refused to follow suit. Later, when her son John – one of five children – was being bullied at boarding school, there were thoughts of losing the “ch”: would he have an easier time of it as a Slesinger or Slazenger? But Bernard and Winnie stood firm. And though at times they despaired of John as “spineless” and “a pansy”, his surname didn’t hold him back: he went on to a prestigious film career, as the director of movies such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/billy-liar-my-most-over-rated-film\"><em>Billy Liar</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36282/midnight-cowboy\"><em>Midnight Cowboy</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\"><em>Sunday Bloody Sunday</em></a>.</p> <p>Bernard, too, made a success of life, as a doctor, though it wasn’t without its obstacles. It took him years to get a position at Great Ormond Street hospital, despite his obvious abilities, and he was later denied one at St Thomas’s: “45 – the old, old story,” he wrote. But he remained upbeat about England as a fair and decent society, despite antisemitism being the norm. It just didn’t do to be too “Coheny” (his phrase) if you wanted to get on.</p> <p>Fond though he was of his ageing grandparents, Buruma would have known little about their early lives but for the letters they wrote to each other during a courtship punctuated by the first world war and a marriage punctuated by the second – letters spanning over half a century that they couldn’t bear to throw away and that he read after their deaths. From this huge cache, he has “contrived to produce a kind of novel in letters, with myself as a kind of Greek chorus” – an act of homage that also has a fascinating story to tell.</p> <p>It was a violin recital she gave at his cousin’s house that prompted Bernard’s first letter to Winnie, sent from his home in Fitzjohn’s Avenue (FitzJew’s as some called it) and keen to impress on her his appreciation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ludwig-van-beethoven\">Beethoven</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johannes-brahms\">Brahms</a>. He was still a schoolboy at the time, head of house and in the first XV for rugby at Uppingham, but due to take his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/cambridgeuniversity\">Cambridge</a> entrance exams and, more to the point, eager to get to France and do his bit: it was the spring of 1915 and Bernard was no less patriotic, or naive, than any other young Englishman. The letters Winnie wrote in reply were less lyrical than Bernard’s but romance was blooming on both sides. Then suddenly, before going to the front, he broke it off, in embarrassingly cutesy metaphors about mice and squirrels that only half disguised the reason – his parents had told him he was too young to be “serious” about someone.</p> <p>It was several years before their relationship resumed but in the meantime he wrote to Winnie’s family from the trenches. “It is some life out here I can tell you &amp; certainly an experience not to be missed,” he reported, downplaying the horrors of his job as a stretcher-bearer – whether from chivalry, trauma or fear of the censor, he spared them any detail about corpses. Exhausted and covered in boils, he was shipped back in October 1918, fetching up in the same ward of the military hospital where Winnie was nursing – a coincidence that must have seemed like fate.</p> <p>They announced their engagement in 1922 but it was another three years before they married. Bernard, at Cambridge, encouraged Winnie to go to Oxford, which eventually, after much resistance, she did (she liked to portray herself as a golf-and-horses sort of woman, lacking the brains of her highbrow German cousins). Their grandson thinks they were virgins when they married, quoting from one letter in which Bernard apologises to Winnie for almost “going too far” and another, from 1943, in which he recalls visiting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/pompeii-ruins-italy-preservation-2014\">Pompeii</a> (with its erotic frescoes) on their honeymoon: “And to think we had to get inspiration of ways and means from Pompeii. I am afraid you married rather a greenhorn.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc90171d8e64c65701eba600ee127854dcf363b8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dc90171d8e64c65701eba600ee127854dcf363b8/126_122_947_1299/729.jpg\" alt=\"The couple’s wedding day in 1925\" width=\"729\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple’s wedding day in 1925</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The interwar years, which Bernard and Winnie mostly spent together, are short on letters, naturally enough. But there are sporadic mentions of their growing unease at what was happening in Germany. And in 1938, they took decisive action, arranging for 12 Jewish children “specially chosen from the professional classes” to come to England, setting up a hostel in Highgate where they could be placed, and busying themselves with their comfort and welfare. Most of the duties involved, both with these children and her own, fell to Winnie, since Bernard was soon away as a forces medic, first in Norway and later in India. The letters they exchanged during the second world war are full of fascinating asides: Bernard’s experiences of empire, Winnie’s failure to be accepted as a volunteer for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/international-committee-of-the-red-cross-icrc\">the Red Cross</a> (“One never seems to live down one’s parents’ foreign extraction”), their views on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill\">Churchill</a>, communism, the Nazis (“what fiendish bastards”), homosexuality, religion. As the years pass, Winnie becomes increasingly conservative but liberalism and generosity prevail – as exemplified in 1946 when, despite all the relations they had lost in the Holocaust, they invited two German soldiers from a POW camp to spend Christmas with them.</p> <p>As Greek chorus, Buruma makes few appearances in the narrative, but there is one hilarious story when, at the age of five, he is taken by Winnie to visit a neighbour of hers, whose husband, Colonel James, has just died. Sworn to make no mention of it, young Ian behaves impeccably during tea and cakes – until, with Mrs James waving them off, he sticks his head out the car window and shouts, “Colonel James is dead! Colonel James is dead!”</p> <p>Winnie wasn’t just embarrassed but mortified – to an extent that shows how socially insecure she remained, despite her seemingly triumphant assimilation as (in her words) “an English woman, privileged to live in and for the most wonderful country in the world”. The complexities of class, race and nationhood are subtly teased out by her grandson, who hopes that she and Bernard “would have forgiven me for making [their letters] public”.

Memory is the main concept of this book. In one way or another it makes the reader realise how important the role of memory is. </p> <p>It convinces everyone to trust no-one as there are many manipulative people around you who would do anything for their own benefit. What happens when a person forgets everything she did whenever she sleeps at night? The next day she won’t remember who she is or what she did. She won’t even remember her loved ones, not even those closest. And the only person she has learnt to trust may not be the right choice.</p> <p>Christine Lucas is suffering from various kinds of amnesia, where she forgets everything as soon as she wakes up. Every morning she wakes up next to a stranger she doesn’t recall but is in fact her husband. Some days she wakes up as a teenager in a skin of an old lady; on the others, as a child. And on some fortunate days as herself just without the memory of the past. Slowly she learns that her memories gave up on her due to a traumatising incident in the past. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f6dec9c8428d2eae7bacded2126c4045e0b5e546\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6dec9c8428d2eae7bacded2126c4045e0b5e546/0_0_257_400/257.jpg\" alt=\"fd\" width=\"257\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then a young doctor’s interest in Christine’s case makes her learn her past in pieces which she is not very grateful about. Gradually she maintains a journal which reveals a lot of secrets which do not make proper sense. When she tries to put the pieces together they do not fit. She does not understand whether her memory is failing her or the person she trusts with her life is fooling her. </p> <p>But why? After all this time, all these years of struggles with her, why would he do that? With the help of the doctor, Christine unravels a lot of lies and memories and manages to somehow piece together a truth she never expected. She basically finds herself on a daily basis.</p> <p>Before I Go To Sleep falls under the psychological thriller genre. However, I have never come across a book with the main theme as memory or amnesia, so this was a very new experience. </p> <p>As a reader I think it fulfilled the concept of a thriller because I was internally screaming at all the new revelations that Christine found. And not to forget it made me creep out because I never realized how complicated and fragile a human brain was. She only had one accident but it took away her memories and made her forget who she was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anybody who likes or even dislikes thrillers must experience this because it’s a whole new kind of mystery and I highly doubt you have ever read a book like this. </p> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/boys-don-t-cry.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?

much to praise in this innovation","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>You could describe it as a troubling development in publishing: someone comes along with no real knowledge of the book business, a brash salesman who sells books cheaply, undercuts established rivals, drives them out of business. Then he moves into publishing as well, and allows people to publish themselves without recourse to the gatekeeping taste-makers.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>But I’m not talking about Jeff Bezos and Amazon. I’m talking about <a href=\"http://www.templeofthemuses.org/?page_id=9\">James Lackington</a>, who turned the book business upside down – at the end of the 18th century. His London bookshop accepted cash only, so he could slash prices, and he used his accumulated wealth to buy whole libraries and pounce on publishers’ remaindered stock to sell dirt cheap. One of the books his company subsequently published in exchange for a payment from the author’s husband was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. </p> <p>He loved books, and was a whirlwind in a previously staid industry.</p> <p>Change will always arouse fear in some people, and this is as true of the book business as it is of any other. George Orwell thought Penguin paperbacks were a superb development, but he also thought the availability of cheap books would be disastrous for the book trade. Now we know: it wasn’t. A lot of people thought the end of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/collapse-of-net-book-agreement-within-months-collapse-1388530.html\">the Net Book Agreement</a>, which fixed their prices in the UK, would be equally calamitous and limit the variety of titles published. Now we know: it didn’t.</p> <p>And now, we have Amazon. I have to declare an interest because, having been published by traditional imprints in the past, I’ve now crossed over to the dark side: I’m an Amazon author, through their <a href=\"http://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2011/06/thomas-a-mercer-what-is-amazon-up-to\">Thomas and Mercer crime/thriller imprint</a>. Except it isn’t the dark side. It’s a retail, publishing and media content company. The publishing arm is run by people who are passionate about books and are utter professionals. The company itself uses an evidence-based approach to marketing and selling those books, not relying on the way it has always been done (posters on railway stations, etc). It finds new ways of reaching people – admittedly, with the handy tool of having the world’s largest store as its laboratory.</p> <p>Yet the view of Amazon from the wider literary world has become increasingly poisonous, to the extent that people have responded with grave concern because the Evil Empire is now … opening bookstores! Is this what we’ve come to, that the opening of new bookstores is something to be feared?</p> <p>Yes – because apparently Amazon will use that retail power to shut down other stores and to force crippling terms on other publishers. So, like the supermarkets then? Supermarkets have done more to threaten dedicated bookstores even than the rise of Amazon, and they’ve done so with the complicity of publishers. It’s hard to see how supermarket book sales can be seen as a vital channel for publishers, but dedicated bookstores opened by Amazon are the death knell of the industry.</p> <p>The other argument I’ve seen trotted out is that the bricks-and-mortar stores are a tacit admission by Amazon that ebooks are running out of steam, and that its model for selling online is no longer working. Given the explosive growth of ebooks in the last decade, it’s hardly surprising that sales are flattening, but I know from my own experience that there are enormous numbers of people out there happily reading on Kindles. I also know that my last book, A Death in Sweden, sold more copies in six weeks through Amazon than the global sales of all my previous titles combined. Until then, I was always an “author’s author”, but even so the figures don’t suggest a model that’s broken to me.</p> <p>I haven’t become one of the fan-boys <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/12/lee-child-amazons-real-life-bookshops-why-we-should-be-worried\">Lee Child was talking about in his article on this subject</a>. I still like to read real books, I still support my local indie bookseller and my local Waterstones (in turn, my local indie also stocks my Amazon-published books, whereas Waterstones … doesn’t). And I still have a lot of friends who work for or are published by traditional houses. But I remain baffled at the vitriol that’s directed towards Amazon.</p> <p>It is just a company that’s got big ambitions and is revolutionising the way we shop, read, watch TV and films. If you don’t like what Amazon’s doing, don’t shop there. But it’s here to stay and is already becoming part of the fabric of our lives – maybe give it 200 years and people will wonder what all the fuss was about.</p> <ul> <li>Kevin Wignall will be attending

The grubbiness in question is the taint of decades of rule by the fascist victors of the civil war, the <em>franquistas</em> who have revenged themselves upon their Republican colleagues and neighbours, leaving many of those not dead or in prison unable to pursue careers or support their families.</p> <p>Juan (who has the un-Spanish surname De Vere, with its telling linguistic echo of verity, truth) is 23 years old and working as Muriel’s assistant, in which capacity he spends a lot of time at his employer’s home and has a ringside seat at a dreadfully unhappy marriage. Juan becomes an eavesdropper on scenes of discord and abjection, as Muriel torments his wife, Beatriz, verbally abusing her and refusing the slightest hint of affection. The novel takes place in 1980, shortly before divorce was legalised in Spain, and Beatriz appears to be stuck in a relationship that offers her no escape from her misery. Juan does not understand what lies behind Muriel’s behaviour. He appears to be punishing Beatriz for some past transgression, though what it is, the young man does not know.</p> <p>Outside the doors of the Muriel household, Madrid is caught up in the wild years of <em>La Movida</em>, the period after Franco’s death when Spain’s ossified social conservatism began to dissolve in a hedonistic wave of creativity and experiment. “It was a time when almost no one slept in Madrid,” remembers Juan, who tells the story in retrospect, with the insight and nuance of a much older man. “No one could entirely avoid the nocturnal ferment of those anomalous years, which, if you had a bit of money and however wretchedly unhappy you felt, were celebratory despite the political unease and the uncertainties of all kinds.”</p> <p>Muriel, who often blurs the boundaries between professional and personal, gives Juan a delicate job. He wants him to befriend one of the older men in his social circle, an eminent paediatrician called Jorge Van Vechten, and discover if there is any truth in a troubling rumour. “According to what I’ve been told … the doctor behaved in an indecent manner towards a woman or possibly more than one.” Muriel doesn’t make the nature of this indecency clear, but insists that Juan start taking Van Vechten out to bars and clubs, in the hope that he will boast or confide in the younger man. “See if you can get him talking about the past,” orders Muriel. “Reveal yourself as vile and unscrupulous and watch his response, whether he approves or is of like mind.” Thus Juan, representative of the new post-Franco generation of young Spaniards, is cast back into a sleazy past, in which personal secrets and transgressions are inextricably linked with the country’s brutal political history.</p> <p>This is familiar territory for Marías, both in its forensic examination of the grey areas of personal morality and in the way personal stories reveal truths about the historical trauma buried beneath the surface of modern Spain. His magisterial trilogy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/21/your-face-tomorrow-marias-review\" title=\"\"><em>Your Face Tomorrow</em></a>, which also deals with the legacy of the civil war, has a strong claim to be the best European novel of the 21st century to date, and the fiction he wrote in the 90s, particularly <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/heart-so-white.html\" title=\"\"><em>A Heart So White</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tomorrow-in-the-battle-think-on-me.html\" title=\"\"><em>Tomorrow in the Battle Think On Me</em></a>, pays precise and revelatory attention to the nuances of human relationships: our compromises, lapses and evasions. As with this past work, in <em>Thus Bad Begins</em>, Marías’s narration has a deceptively aimless quality, circling round apparently minor or inconsequential details that are gradually revealed to be integral to an extremely taut structure. As ever, <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/author-list/margaret-jull-costa\" title=\"\">Margaret Jull Costa</a> translates his long, winding sentences into beautiful English prose, both erudite and conversational – a considerable stylistic feat.</p> <p>Marías is a novelist who indulges his foibles, and <em>Thus Bad Begins</em> contains many elements that will be familiar to his fans. An anglophile, who has translated everything from Sterne to Faulkner into Spanish, he frequently takes his titles from Shakespeare – in this case <em>Hamlet</em>: “I must be cruel only to be kind / thus bad begins and worse remains behind.” Lines from the plays echo through his prose, and characters occasionally break off from whatever they are nominally doing for a spot of textual exegesis. At one of Muriel’s social gatherings, a bumptious young professor appositely recites Rumour’s speech from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/henry-iv-part-ii-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>Henry IV</em>,<em> part 2</em></a> (“Upon my tongues continual slanders ride / The which in every language I pronounce / Stuffing the ears of men with false reports”), pausing only to unpack De Vere’s unusual surname, which is also that of the 17th Earl of Oxford, reputed, at least by those who can’t stomach the thought of a clever commoner, to be the “real” Shakespeare.</p> <p>Real or fake, decent or corrupt, Juan, in common with many of Marías’s male characters, has streaks of snobbery and vanity and a slightly old-fashioned sexual preoccupation with tight skirts, heels, laddered tights, and the presence or absence of underwear. <em>Thus Bad Begins</em> takes place in a milieu of queasy misogyny, and sexual transactions are part of the fabric of a high society in which “everyone is everyone else’s jester” and “there are those who live their whole lives in a state of continuous secrecy and concealment”. The cumulative effect of the novel, as Juan is drawn away from the relatively simple pleasures of his twentysomething world into the secrets of older men and women, is a fusion of a coming-of-age story with something like a conspiracy thriller. As ever, with Marías, it is an arch and sophisticated entertainment animated by a probing moral intelligence, a demonstration of what fiction at its best can achieve.</p> <p>• Hari Kunzru’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gods-without-men.html\" title=\"\"><em>Gods Without Men</em></a> is published by Penguin.<strong> </strong>To order<strong> </strong><em>Thus Bad Begins</em><strong> </strong>for<strong> </strong>£15.19 (RRP £18.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/407064/s/thus-bad-begins//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

There can’t be many public events that have been forced to confront such fundamental questions less than 24 hours before curtain-up, but the organisers of the fourth Lahore literary festival faced down the authorities’ concerns about security with a quick change of venue and a one-day programme reduction, prompting Pakistani journalist and novelist Mohammed Hanif to remark wrily, “The government says we can’t give security on Friday but we can do it on Saturday and Sunday. Why is it a security threat on Friday and not on Saturday?”</p> <p>Hanif, whose 2008 debut novel<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/31/fiction2\"><em>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</em></a> was a satire centred on the death of Pakistani president General Zia in a mysterious plane crash, was speaking at a session on George Orwell, whose presence loomed large over the festival as rumours swirled as to whether the clampdown was due to genuine concerns about a terrorist attack or to a standoff between the regional government and protesters against the damage being inflicted on this historic city by the construction of a new metro line.</p> <p>Whether jitters or vindictiveness were to blame, the resulting atmosphere of determined cheerfulness chimed with the themes of an intelligently programmed festival, free to all comers, whose subjects ranged from “Creativity, chaos and capital: the future of the metropolis” to “Foundering freedoms” and, not least, “Satire as self-defence.”</p> <p>There’s no denying that Pakistan is a dangerous place, caught between an authoritarian government and Islamist insurgents. One person who would undoubtedly have attended the festival was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/27/murdered-karachi-free-speech-sabeen-mahmud\">Sabeen Mahmud</a>, the director of an edgy cafe-bookshop in Karachi, who was shot dead in her car last April. Another was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/liberal-professor-islam-shot-dead-pakistan-karachi\">Shakil Auj</a>, dean of Islamic studies at Karachi University, who was assassinated six months earlier, allegedly for writing a book that explored the idea that Muslim women should be allowed to marry outside their religion. As a Pakistani writer remarked, “We all have friends who have been killed.”</p> <p>But both deaths happened in Karachi, and Karachi is not Lahore, where the most immediate threats to life and limb are the jostle of tuk-tuks and motorbikes on the roads and the tangles of power cables crisscrossing pavements in the creative chaos of a teeming capital. Speaker after speaker pointed out that the thing most greatly to be feared is fear itself – and there was little evidence of it in the upmarket Avari hotel, where thousands of people poured through police checkpoints to immerse themselves in a programme that mixed English and Urdu, pop and politics, and to pore over trestle tables groaning with books on the hotel lawns.</p> <p>While politicians such as the former Pakistani foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/29/india-pakistan-kashmir-policy\">Hina Rabbani Khar</a> and the onetime president of Kyrgystan Roza Otunbayeva debated the complexities of the “great game” across Asia and the Middle East, the Egyptian American polemicist Mona Eltahawy, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/headscarves-and-hymens-why-the-middle-east-needs-a-sexual-revolution-mona-eltahawy-review\"><em>Headscarves and Hymens</em></a>, opened a session on feminism with a rabble-rousing “Fuck patriarchy”, and went on to explain how “I want to talk about how as Muslim women we are reduced to what’s on our heads and what’s in between our legs,” holding a young audience rapt with a rhetoric that was thrillingly subversive.</p> <p>“The real question is, who are the pigs?” said Hanif in reference to Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm </em>when talking about the trauma of partition in 1947. “We read that there were trains coming from Amritsar to Lahore that were strewn with dead bodies, but nobody talks about trains that left from here … That’s why Orwell matters as there should be people who stand up, who have the courage to say, ‘Hang on, this is not what happened. There is another side of the story and let me tell you that story.’”</p> <p>If the weekend created a safe space for exploring dangerous ideas, it also opened up different cultures and other ways of seeing and being. Palestinian-American <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/06/the-blue-between-sky-and-water-susan-abulhawa-review-novel\">Susan Abulhawa</a>, author of two Palestine-set novels, talked of the importance of love in a barbaric history of displacement and persecution; South Africa’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/zukiswa-wanner\"> Zukiswa Wanner</a>, author of a string of biting social comedies dealing with life in the post-apartheid world, joked about the irony of her work being deemed too un-African to be published in the west, while she herself was “too African” to be granted visas.</p> <p>At a time when authors in the UK are questioning the value of literary festivals, and fretting about their failure to pay, it was humbling to see writers arriving with suitcases full of their own books to sell – the only way some of them can cross the territorial boundaries of the publishing world to reach an international readership.</p> <p>For the outsider, the LLF revealed a picture of Pakistan that too often gets lost in reporting: a Sunday morning celebration of David Bowie brought pop nostalgists out in force, while literary groupies flocked to a session on Virginia Woolf, and many more turned out for two evening performances of AR Gurney’s <em>Love Letters</em>, a play about a 50-year correspondence between two east coast American blue-bloods.</p> <p>On the way to a session showcasing English writer Emma Woolf’s work on the politics of anorexia, a young volunteer usher complained that her friends teased her about being tubby. “But I’m not – feel this,” she protested, proffering an iron-hard, gym-toned bicep. Among Sunday’s festival-goers discussion of the body and self-image could have filled a hall twice as big.</p> <p>As the search booths were packed up and the Avari metamorphosed back into a five-star wedding venue, there was a palpable sense of happy exhaustion, of obstacles overcome and freedom defended. “How else could you experience so much of the world in a single weekend?” asked one visitor. The sole spot of trouble was splendidly and passionately literary, a Saturday night brawl between poetry devotees unable to get into an Urdu-language recital of work by the 19th-century poet Ghalib.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3q7","wordcount":"988","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/a51922bcdd9df3655b70fd8181592dd8be11454b/0_286_6360_3825/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-29T07:00:15Z","standfirst":"<p>‘How else could you experience so much of the world in one weekend?’ In defiance of security concerns, the Lahore literary festival retained a mood of determined cheerfulness</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/26/lahore-literary-festival-safe-place-dangerous-ideas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/26/lahore-literary-festival-safe-place-dangerous-ideas","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"a51922bcdd9df3655b70fd8181592dd8be11454b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/a51922bcdd9df3655b70fd8181592dd8be11454b/0_286_6360_3825/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/a51922bcdd9df3655b70fd8181592dd8be11454b","altText":"Lahore Literary festival","caption":"Booksellers at the Lahore literary festival.

We don’t judge books on the contents within or even by their covers, but in the purest, quickest, shallowest way possible: from the title.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/sep/02/futuristic-soviet-bus-stops-in-pictures\">Next stop, Siberia!

He also praised <a href=\"http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/store/product.asp?prod=3940\">Behind the Binoculars: Interviews with Acclaimed Birdwatchers</a> for promising to get behind the scenes with “superstar twitchers” such as Phil Hollom, Andy Clements and Debbie Pain. “No, me neither.”</p> <p>Bent is particularly pleased with the academic tone this year: “Once again readers from across the globe have scoured the bookshops and looked into the far-flung corners of the internet to suggest a raft of the peculiar, downright batty and unintentionally hilarious book titles,” Bent said. “Our crack squad of judges – well, me, actually – have whittled the voluminous nominations down to this magnificent seven of a shortlist.”</p> <p>Administered by the Bookseller, this is the 38th prize. The award was conceived in 1978 by Trevor Bounford and Bruce Robertson, co-founders of publishing solutions firm the Diagram Group, after they spotted that year’s winner – Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice – while bored at the Frankfurt book fair.</p> <p>This is the second year that the prize has allowed self-published titles to be entered.<br /></p> <p>According to the Bookseller, the prize was not awarded in “two very dark years - 1987 and 1991”, due to a lack of odd titles.</p> <p>Whichever title wins this year will join a peculiar elite that also include Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers (1996), The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories (2003) and last year’s winner, Strangers Have the Best Candy. As is tradition, the winner will not receive aany money, but a “passable bottle of claret” will go to the person who nominates the winning entry.</p> <p>The shortlist is now open to a public vote, with the winner announced on 18 March. “As with the US Republican presidential primaries, Tivnan said, “we can always rely on an electorate to make the sane and rational decision”.</p> <h2>The shortlist:</h2> <p><strong>Behind the Binoculars: Interviews with Acclaimed Birdwatchers</strong> by Mark Avery and Keith Betton (Pelagic Publishing)</p> <p><strong>Paper Folding with Children</strong> by Alice Hornecke and translated by Anna Cardwell <strong> </strong>(Floris Books)</p> <p><strong>Reading from Behind: A Cultural History of the Anus</strong> by Jonathan Allan<strong> (</strong>Zed Books) </p> <p><strong>Reading the Liver: Papyrological Texts on Ancient Greek Extispicy</strong> by William Furley and Victor Gysembergh<strong> (</strong>Mohr Siebeck)</p> <p><strong>Soviet Bus Stops </strong>by Christopher Herwig (Fuel)</p> <p><strong>Too Naked for the Nazis</strong> by Alan Stafford (Fantom Films)</p> <p><strong>Transvestite Vampire Biker Nuns from Outer Space: A Consideration of Cult Film</strong> by Mark Kirwan-Hayhoe (MKH Imprint)</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3yh","wordcount":"666","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/727b2ef9e50cc77efaed5073431ee17feb945314/0_0_2000_1201/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-29T00:01:06Z","standfirst":"<p>Reading From Behind lines up for public vote alongside works including Soviet Bus Stops and Paper Folding With Children</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/26/diagram-prize-oddest-book-title-shortlist-gets-behind-cultural-history-of-the-anus","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/26/diagram-prize-oddest-book-title-shortlist-gets-behind-cultural-history-of-the-anus","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"727b2ef9e50cc77efaed5073431ee17feb945314","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/727b2ef9e50cc77efaed5073431ee17feb945314/0_22_2000_1236/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/727b2ef9e50cc77efaed5073431ee17feb945314","altText":"Reading from Behind: A Cultural History of the Anus’s cover","caption":"Odd favourite? ...

You should probably keep on wishing.”</p> <p>What follows is a wordy, predictable groaner: the kids these days, Denby writes, are unable to connect to each other outside digital technologies and uninterested in reading the classics. Oh, teens do read, he acknowledges, with a half-hearted nod to science fiction and fantasy favorites, graphic novels, and young adult literature. But they don’t read in a serious way – they ignore Shakespeare, Twain and Salinger. Denby lists a half-dozen other omissions too, only two of them women, it might be observed, and none of them people of color.</p> <p>As someone who spends much of her time thinking about this problem, in Denby’s piece I smell a lack of research and engagement with his purported subject. Sure, <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/68478-pew-survey-shows-adult-reading-in-decline.html\">according to researchers</a>, teens are reading less than they have in the past – but adults are, too. And Denby’s myopic view of “reading seriously” is a frustrating one: it should be obvious that holding a phone rather than a battered copy of Vonnegut doesn’t mean you lack the “reading obsession”. Obsessions are more powerful things than he thinks: a few hours staring at a phone does not necessarily spell out the death of imaginative writing.</p> <p>Take, for example, the behemoth of a reading platform that is <a href=\"http://business.wattpad.com/\">Wattpad</a>. Built a decade ago as a mobile reading app – that’s right, fetch the smelling salts, an explicitly phone-based lure for reading – Wattpad eventually expanded to allow its users to write and share stories. It now boasts a sprawling, complicated network of millions of texts, connected by readers and commenters, fiction made social. Of its 40 million monthly users, the majority are teenagers, and all but a small fraction of them read and write on mobile alone.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/16/teen-writing-reading-wattpad-young-adults\">a 2014 piece for the Observer</a>, 17-year-old Hazal Kirci chronicled her discovery of and transformation via the platform: becoming an avid reader there made her an avid writer, which led her towards traditionally published works (Denby-approved classics) while her sisters finally embraced reading. “Right now, I’m on The Great Gatsby,” she reported.</p> <p>Across other social networks, traditionally published works are celebrated just as fervently as the amateur hits on Wattpad. Tumblr’s bookish corners are vibrant and joyful celebrations of reading. Tumblr book fandom often resembles the rest of Tumblr fandom: books are dissected and analyzed as often as they’re fan-cast with animated gifs. Of last year’s top 10 most reblogged books across the network, which has tens of millions of active users, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://yearinreview.tumblr.com/post/135713868237/most-reblogged-books\">Pride and Prejudice came in at number nine</a>. In fact, anyone who follows book Tumblr knows it’s completely unsurprising to see a 200-year-old book alongside modern fantasy favorites.</p> <p>But nowhere is it more apparent that plenty of teens love reading than at the various conventions I’ve attended over the past few years, from BookCon in New York to the Young Adult Lit Con in London to GeekyCon in Orlando, Florida. Like their analogous online spaces, these gatherings are built on a devotion to reading and they’re places where I saw books viewed with reverence and authors treated like rock stars. The crowds skewed so young at these gatherings that they left me, a person still within the millennial age bracket, feeling ancient. But seeing a vast sea of young, mostly female, readers bubbling with excitement over a writer was extraordinary to watch.</p> <p>The truth is that despite the ample evidence that teens read – passionately – none of this seems quite what Denby is after. He bemoans the fact that kids are unenthusiastic about the texts they’re assigned for class, but his long list of writers reflects stale, even stifling culture we’ve built around reading over the decades, in and outside the classroom.</p> <p>More of the western canon isn’t the solution: the best conversations about books fold in a vast variety of perspectives. Teens read broadly and read deeply, and they read without bias. They clamor for diverse authors, they cross genres without batting an eye, and they’re as likely to read a story on Wattpad as they are one of the Brontë sisters. This open-mindedness marked my teenage years as well: I read great swaths of Denby-approved literature alongside millions of words of Harry Potter fanfiction. (I’m still doing this more than a decade later, and, full disclosure, I freelance for the New Yorker too.) Both camps sharpened my critical tools, and both gave me all the pleasure that reading affords.</p> <p>Perhaps they don’t need me or any other adult to say it, but the kids are all right.

It’s a striking line, given the fact that the film has been much marketed and discussed as a superhero film for adults; it’s already as famous for its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/18/will-deadpool-lead-to-a-deluge-of-hard-r-comic-book-movies\">R rating</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/16/global-box-office-deadpool-the-mermaid-zoolander-2\">record-breaking box office run</a>) as for anything that happens in the movie itself. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/30/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-tim-miller-gina-carano\">Deadpool: ‘I don’t think my mom is going to be able to watch it’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, there’s Colossus, saying that the main character isn’t an adult. What age group is supposed to be the target audience here, anyway?</p> <p>That’s a longstanding question for the superhero genre. Today superhero films are often aimed at grown-ups, and that trend looks likely to become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/18/will-deadpool-lead-to-a-deluge-of-hard-r-comic-book-movies\">even more entrenched with the success of Deadpool</a>. The next Wolverine film has been given an R rating, and it was recently announced that the Batman v Superman film would have an <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/batman-v-superman-going-even-165918477.html\">R-rated DVD director’s cut</a>. But historically, superheroes have been perceived as for kids, being billed as “adolescent power fantasies”.</p> <p>The idea that adults could respectably enjoy tales of spandex-clad do-gooders hitting each other has been a long time coming. Alan Moore and David Gibbons’ 1987 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/06/watchmen-film-review\">Watchmen was a breakthrough moment</a> and, like Deadpool, dealt with adult themes, including sex, violence and homosexuality. Watchmen approached those issues in a more (though not entirely) serious vein, but the subtext worked in a similar way. A world in which Nite Owl needs to worry about how to take his suit off to go to the bathroom is an adult world, as is one in which Deadpool dates a sex worker or gets cancer. Bam, pow: comics aren’t just for kids any more.</p> <p>Comics fans hate that tag line. But the funny thing is, the “Bam! Pow!” was popularized by the 1960s Batman TV show, which was adamantly not (just) for kids. Adam West Batman didn’t say “shit”, of course. On the contrary, the adult part of the TV series was that he so flagrantly, joyously, nudgingly did not say “shit”. Instead Robin declared: “Holy Long John Silver!” Meanwhile Batman drank cool, refreshing milk; the supervillains used knock-out gas so no one really got hurt; and slinky female villains threw themselves at the bat bulge only to be stoically rebuffed. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/11/deadpool-video-review\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gjcz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2454891\"            data-video-name=\"Deadpool – video review\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/11/1455209010239/KP_1789782_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bcba41e4b0d159b0b674de\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/11/1455209010239/KP_1789782_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/11/160211TGFSDeadpoolreview_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/11/160211TGFSDeadpoolreview_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/11/160211TGFSDeadpoolreview_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/11/160211TGFSDeadpoolreview.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/11/160211TGFSDeadpoolreview_large.3gp\"/> </video> </figure>   <p>Oh, and in an episode featuring Liberace, Bruce and Dick literally rush into a burning closet. The show was high, conscious camp, and while the winking was in part a gay goof, it was also a developmental one. Batman was an adult’s view of a kids’ view of adult heroes, who were super square, always prepared, and always whip out the clearly labeled can of Shark Repellant Bat Spray in the nick of time. Those adult authority figures are both good and good at everything: a fantasy for a kid, and a joke for the adults who know it isn’t true. Superhero stories, then, have long been obsessed with that odd, transformative space between being a child, filled with wonder and imagination, and being an adult, filled with power. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/19/deadpool-zoolander-2-ryan-reynolds-mainstream-movies-with-disfigured-heroes\">Disfigured heroes like Deadpool help people like me fight prejudice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In CC Beck and Otto Binder’s Shazam! (a whimsical series which adults have critically validated) the young newsboy Billy Batson enters an abandoned subway tunnel and emerges not just with mystical powers and a cape, but with the body of a fully grown man. Captain Marvel took the Superman archetype and cleverly exposed its inner workings. Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker: they’re all kids, dreaming of the time when they’ll be able to lift amazing weights, drive in cool cars, <a href=\"http://tansyrr.com/tansywp/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sky-kanga.png\">ride on space kangaroos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sikids.com/sites/default/files/sikids/pages/images/cms/imce/users/dantec/2014/11/batman-joker-surfing.jpg\">engage in awesome surf battles</a>.</p> <p>Or alternately, maybe Clark and Bruce and Peter are the boring, staid adults, wearing suits and going off to their mundane jobs but dreaming of that childhood where they wore their underwear on the outside and had loopy dreams of saving the world from <a href=\"http://www.wallpapervortex.com/ipad_wallpapers/ipad_24710_the_powerpuff_girls_powerpuff_girls_fighting_mojo.jpg\">evil monkey masterminds</a>. Superhero stories are (<a href=\"http://axecop.com/\">most of the time</a>) written by adults, after all. Which means they’re very often a conversation between grown-ups and kids about what it means to be one, or the other, or both.</p> <p>Deadpool’s constant cursing and R rating suggest it’s not part of that conversation, or doesn’t want to be. But it can’t seem to help itself. The film’s forced wisecracking and self-aware fourth-wall chatter to the audience papers over a slew of not-particularly-self-aware anxieties: about commitment, about ageing, about death, about power. Under that expressionless mask, Deadpool vacillates neurotically. Does Wade want to grow up and be a superman? Or does he want go grow young, back out of his wrinkles and never die?</p> <p>You can slap an R rating on your film, but the child still haunts the superman, as dream and dreamer. It’s a genre that will never grow up, because it’s about what it means to want to be, and not to be, grown.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3qe","wordcount":"865","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/95391a8504c7ef7cd47748dddd9b90b01dd3ed3c/285_130_2665_1604/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-28T17:30:00Z","standfirst":"<p>For all its profanity and violence, its protagonist is still called out for being a child.

Many thousands of people, often new to historical research, discovered the names of their ancestors and compiled their family trees from census records, wills and parish registers. The local record offices that housed many of these documents reorganised themselves to cope with the surge of interest. David Hey, who has died aged 77, was unusual among professional historians in responding to a development that colleagues tended to regard with indifference or even disdain.</p> <p>He explained the flourishing of family history partly in practical terms, because people had time to do research and the records had become more readily available. Above all, family historians gained pleasure from satisfying their curiosity and engaging in detective work. As Hey revealed in his first book on the subject, Family History and Local History in England (1987), he had hunted his own ancestors mostly in the vicinity of his childhood home near Penistone in the then West Riding of Yorkshire. He could share with the enthusiasts the frustrations involved in following the clues to find a lost relative.</p> <p>His main aim was to encourage the family historians to venture beyond the names on their family trees to find out more about the places and times in which their ancestors lived. Family history could be a gateway into social history. He pursued this campaign in a succession of books, including The Oxford Guide to Family History (1993) and Journeys in Family History: The National Archives’ Guide to Exploring Your Past, Finding Your Ancestors (2003).</p> <p>Hey’s own specialism in the field lay in the social history of surnames. He showed that many unusual family names had originated in the 13th century when an individual acquired a surname from a unique place name, such as Bagshaw, a remote hamlet in north-west Derbyshire – and that most of the thousand people now called Bagshaw, according to the phone books, are still living within 50 miles of their ancestral home.</p> <p>Social historians believed that populations were very mobile, but through surname studies Hey was identifying a strong element of stability in which at least a handful of “core families” survived in or near the same place for centuries. He noted the relevance of genetic studies to surname research, and collaborated in writing Surnames, DNA and Family History (2011) with another surname historian, George Redmonds, and Turi King, a geneticist.</p> <p>Hey was able to venture so successfully into family history because he already had a strong reputation in local history and social and economic history. He published highly regarded academic monographs, on village society at Myddle in Shropshire (1974), on the packmen and packhorse roads of Derbyshire and Yorkshire (1980), and on the social and industrial history of Sheffield, The Fiery Blades of Hallamshire (1991). They were all focused on the decades around 1700, which he saw as a period of growth in manufactures well before the Industrial Revolution.</p> <p>Over a span of 30 years, he wrote a dozen local history books on southern Yorkshire, Yorkshire as a whole, Penistone, Sheffield and Derbyshire, most of them covering all periods. They highlight the visual historical evidence, and contain many images of the landscape, town plans and buildings. The books are aimed at a wide readership, and one of the motives for writing them was to give his local readers a sense of pride in their surroundings, though he also had in mind the outsiders who would discover that the region’s past was not backward, obscure, dull or ugly.</p> <p>The son of George, a coalminer, and Florence (nee Batty), Hey was born in the remote hamlet of Catshaw, west of Penistone. His family moved to the town itself when David was 11, and he went to Penistone grammar school. Although he was strongly attached to Yorkshire, he spent some time in the Midlands, gaining his first degree at the University College of North Staffordshire (now Keele University) in 1960. He returned to teach in Yorkshire schools, and in 1967 became a lecturer at Matlock College of Education, Derbyshire. At Matlock he met his future wife, Pat, and they married in 1970. He gained an MA (1967) and PhD (1971) at Leicester University, and spent four years as a research fellow at Leicester, well known as a centre for English local history.</p> <p>In 1974 he was able to return to his native territory when Sheffield University offered him a post as a lecturer in its department of extramural studies. His job thereafter was to immerse himself in the history of Sheffield and its region, and to hold adult evening classes on local history.</p> <p>He did this supremely well, as he spoke with authority, but with humour and informality, in a clear Yorkshire voice. The material prepared for the classes, as he often acknowledged, provided the content of his books, and one can detect in his written words their origin as talks for students. His enthusiasm stimulated the students to form research groups, and he thanked them in his books for their help. Sheffield University recognised his talents with a chair in 1992, and made him dean of his faculty in 1994. He received an honorary doctorate in 2015.</p> <p>He had a reputation for good sense and leadership as well as skills in dealing with people. He served as president of the British Association for Local History, president of the British Agricultural History Society, and chair of the council of the British Record Society.</p> <p>He is survived by Pat and their children, Emma and Jonathan.</p> <p>• David Hey, local and family historian, born 18 July 1938; died 14 February

three notebooks written from 1960 to 1962 are being reissued by Penguin alongside their admirable project to publish all 75 of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/nov/09/georges-simenons-maigret-gets-a-new-look-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Simenon’s Maigret novels</a>. He began writing the notebooks on 25 June 1960, after completing a novel he dismissively described as his “hundred-eightieth-and-some”. An astonishingly prolific author, Simenon recalls that he used to have a contract with Gallimard to write six novels a year, “because in terms of income, that corresponded to my style of life”. His writing had made him a very wealthy man, but, aged 57 and troubled by his health, he was clearly haunted by his own mortality. These personal, even confessional notebooks, were written for his young family, to “show my children that I’ve had my weaknesses”. As well as his footloose early life, living on a boat writing Maigret novels (which he dismisses as “minor works”), the Belgian author frankly discusses his promiscuity and alcoholism, his fascination with criminology, his <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5020/the-art-of-fiction-no-9-georges-simenon\" title=\"\">writing</a> (“hours of anguish rather than euphoria”) and his intense love for his family.

young adult fiction. Why is this, asks author <strong>Juno Dawson</strong>?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Can we talk about acne? To say it’s something that <a href=\"http://acnetreatment.org.uk\">80% of 11-30 year olds suffer from</a>, it’s not something that you’d spot very often in the world of young adult fiction. Why is this? I’d argue that authors (and I totally include myself in this), in much the same way as TV and movie casting directors, are perpetuating the myth of physical perfection.</p> <p>It might be that we do it unconsciously, but I’ve been told that my characters should be ‘aspirational’ – whatever that means. In YA, both male and female characters, if they are imperfect, often have ‘adorable’ physical flaws because this makes them relatable. So we’re talking about ‘boyish figures’, ‘lopsided smiles’, ‘unruly hair’ and the like.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/feb/23/world-book-day-2016-costume-ideas-dressup-guide\">What can I wear on World Book Day 2016? – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For me I think it’s wish fulfilment. It shouldn’t come as a surprise (<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/james-dawson-transgender-woman/\">given the year I’ve had</a>) that I dearly wished, aged twelve, that I could be the most beautiful girl in school and that the tough-but-secretly-sensitive rugby captain would fall hopelessly in love with me. It’s sad though, that ‘aspirational’ characters do, perhaps inadvertently, exist to make us feel bad about ourselves. The flipside of aspiration is insecurity. Too much of our media fully relies on the exploitation of our insecurities to get us to buy things.</p> <p>Several years ago I had the seed of an idea called ‘Pizzaface’ about a girl with acne whose life is changed when she enrols on a clinical drug trial. To be honest, I just assumed someone would have already done it. I couldn’t even imagine that title was still going free. But I looked on Amazon and Goodreads and not only was ‘Pizzaface’ free, but I couldn’t find any books about acne. If I’ve missed one, please do alert me to it.</p> <p>I just didn’t understand how something so, SO common could be so overlooked. We have YA books about incest, conjoined twins and intersex characters – all wholly worthwhile stories – but something that affects hundreds of thousands of teenagers seems to have slipped through the net.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/11/what-are-the-world-book-day-2016-1-books\">What are the World Book Day 2016 £1 books?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that brings us to Spot The Difference. When World Book Day asked me to write a novella for this year’s celebration, I knew it was time for Avery, my acne sufferer, to take centre stage. I wasn’t allowed the title ‘Pizzaface’ because it was, rightly, thought people might use the word to target sufferers. It’s not just a story about spots, it’s a story about beauty, feminism, superficiality, and the power of popularity.</p> <p>It’s also a story of hope. ‘Sebavectum’, the drug Avery takes, is fictional, but similar medications do exist. I spoke to many sufferers at the research stage, and the one thing they had in common was that doctors had been kind and sympathetic to the serious problem of acne. It can, and does, get better.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://acnetreatment.org.uk/\">92% of acne sufferers report depression</a> and 14% say they have felt suicidal because of their skin. Acne is no laughing matter and I really hope Spot The Difference starts a conversation about something which can really crush the confidence out of young people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"635d4cacf45c078452cbe28af82c40058977f162\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/635d4cacf45c078452cbe28af82c40058977f162/0_0_1745_2803/623.jpg\" alt=\"gf\" width=\"623\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>World Book Day £1 books, including Spot the Difference by Juno Dawson, are released today.</em></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4h3z3","wordcount":"543","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d5b8f18a993a58f2b83dbb402db437971f32fc86/0_161_4992_2995/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>80% of young people suffer from acne, but it’s not something you spot very often in the world of young adult fiction.

Kate Young turns to one of the meals from Elizabeth Goudge’s 1940s children’s classic","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<blockquote> <p><em>The supper was delicious. There was home-made crusty bread, hot onion soup, delicious rabbit stew, baked apples in a silver dish, honey, butter the colour of marigolds, a big blue jug of warm mulled claret, and hot roasted chestnuts folded in a napkin.</em></p> </blockquote> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/01/little-white-horse-elizabeth-goudge\">The Little White Horse</a>, Elizabeth Goudge</strong></p> <p> ---</p> <p> There are days when food needs to provide pure comfort. Anxiety-inducing, unsettling days, when it feels like nothing is certain or guaranteed. This week, I had one of those days.</p> <p> I have spent my whole life adhering to schedules – at school, at university, at work. I am happy with schedules. They provide stability and reassurance, that I am in the place I need to be, doing the thing I need to be doing. This year, I have started to live a life without them. Though I have some work hours, and some meetings, I am spending most of my time working from my desk, writing a book. My day to day life is, all of a sudden, completely in my own hands. </p> <p> On days when I struggle with this, I turn to the kitchen – I need something to keep my hands busy and my mind clear. It’s also important that it’s foolproof; complex patisserie should be reserved for those days when I feel on top of the world. What I am looking for is something to chop, or knead, or stir. A handful of ingredients, and minimal equipment. Soup and a loaf of bread seem to be the obvious solution.</p> <p> Once I have made something to eat, I need to find something to read. Something familiar. I am rarely far from a copy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/29/fiction.margaretatwood\">Anne of Green Gables</a> or <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/6/17/bread-butter-and-honey-i-capture-the-castle\">I Capture the Castle</a> or <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/5/16/supper-club-the-secret-garden\">The Secret Garden</a>. These are the stories I read and loved during childhood and, miles from where I started, they still make me feel safe. In this respect, The Little White Horse is also perfect. My copy is oft-read and dog-eared on almost every page. At times, the characters seem simply to go from extraordinary meal to extraordinary meal. Some of these – a pie, a syllabub, some biscuits – will be finding their way into the book next year, but in the meantime, there’s this soup. Marmaduke Scarlet, the cook at Moonacre, makes the dinner described above for Maria and Miss Heliotrope on their first night in the manor. It’s exactly what I’d want, on arriving somewhere unfamiliar. A bowl of warm, homely soup, a loaf of crusty bread, and butter the colour of marigolds.</p> <h2><strong>Onion Soup: the recipe</strong></h2> <p><strong> Serves 2 generously (or 1, with convenient leftovers)</strong></p> <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br /> 1kg brown onions<br /> 40g butter<br /> 10 sprigs thyme<br /> Ground black pepper <br /> Two generous pinches flaked sea salt<br /> 2tbsp plain flour <br /> 400ml vegetable stock (you can use a stock pot, but it’s not hard to make your own, and I think it’s really worth it here) <br /> <em>Vegetable Stock (optional)</em></p> <p> Please note, the amounts below are a suggestion – you can add or subtract depending on what is in your fridge<br /> 2 carrots<br /> 2 sticks celery<br /> 1 small brown onion<br /> 1 red onion <br /> Handful parsley stalks<br /> 5 whole peppercorns<br /> 3 spring onions<br /> 1.5l water</p> <p> <strong>Equipment</strong> <br /> Large saucepan <br /> Sieve<br /> Knife<br /> Chopping board<br /> Wooden spoon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63b7d890993b4e59d1063ca0dc50d658875173e0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/63b7d890993b4e59d1063ca0dc50d658875173e0/0_0_1821_1821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"soup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘These are the stories I read and loved during childhood and, miles from where I started, they still make me feel safe.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1</strong> First, make the stock. Throw the vegetables (cleaned and chopped, but not peeled), peppercorns and water into a large saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer, and allow to bubble away for around an hour with the lid off. Sieve and set the stock aside.<br /></p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Peel the onions, cut in half and slice into thin semi circles. If your onions are making you cry, try to avoid breathing through your nose as you slice, or store your onions in the fridge instead of the cupboard. Melt the butter in the saucepan until it foams. Tip the sliced onion in, and fry over a moderate heat for ten minutes. Once the onions are soft and translucent, strip the leaves from the thyme stalks, and add them, along with the seasoning.</p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Once the onion is golden in places, add the flour and stir constantly for two minutes until it is evenly distributed. Pour the stock into the pan and stir again. Bring the soup to the boil, reduce the heat and then simmer until it is as thick as you’d like it (you may prefer more or less liquid than I have here).</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Serve piping hot with plenty of <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/6/17/bread-butter-and-honey-i-capture-the-castle\">bread and butter</a> for dipping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bcb06108af523fc8135b9d4d42ff3f01f6cb7d3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6bcb06108af523fc8135b9d4d42ff3f01f6cb7d3/0_0_1510_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"soup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Marmaduke Scarlet, the cook at Moonacre, makes the dinner described above for Maria and Miss Heliotrope on their first night in the manor.

They are scary, because they deal with genocide, the events of 9/11, ageing, terminal sickness, caretaking, and death; “old” because most of the characters are between the ages of 65 and 99; sex-centered, because several stories feature aging spouses in bed together, taking their medications, using their lubricants, employing various aphrodisiacs, and wives thinking longingly about their former husbands. Old sex is both scary and farcical. “No one over 40 should be allowed to make love in the daytime,” one wife reflects; naked old men sprout “papules, papillomas, skin tags, moles”, and look like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\" title=\"\">Lucian Freud</a> paintings. But unaesthetic nudity is the least of the obstacles to love-making among the married elderly, which is “like running a war: plans had to be drawn up, equipment in tiptop condition”. The lovers suffer from many ailments, ranging from acid reflux, arthritis and sleep apnea to acute myelogenous leukemia. They need special equipment including Vagifem, Viagra, clomipramine and other antidepressants, Astroglide, K-Y jelly, lab gloves, and a CPAP mask. Pornographic fantasy plays a part in these scenarios as well.</p> <p>While the older characters in Heyman’s stories are elaborately dosing up, suiting up and lubing up for their careful coitus, the younger ones are covering up for their elderly parents: a respectable father who has a fatal heart attack in bed with his receptionist, and a vain but incontinent mother who has to be cleaned up before her card game. “Nothing human is alien to me,” one narrator, a microbiologist, thinks, and she wants to believe that earthiness is a tie to creativity and life.</p> <p>One story, however, “In Love with Murray”, stands out for its thematic difference, and its explicit autobiographical connection. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/21/10-best-new-museums-new-york-venice-germany\" title=\"\">Whitney Musuem</a>, the heroine Leda, a beautiful 19-year-old art student, meets a well-known older painter, Murray Blumgarten, who is married, with three grown-up children. She initiates a passionate affair in which Murray educates Leda about art, literature and politics while Leda teaches Murray about sex and self-indulgence: “Despite the 28‑year difference in their ages, she turned out to have had more sexual partners.” But the affair ends when he catches her with a younger man, and she is devastated.</p> <p>The story is dedicated “in memory of Bernard Malamud”. In 1961, when she was a 19-year-old student at Bennington College, Heyman had a lengthy affair with Malamud, who was her creative writing professor. According to Malamud’s biographer Philip Davis, he was “besotted” with Heyman, got her an internship at Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishing company, wrote her loving notes and letters, and as she recollected, “waited for me, here, there, and everywhere”. They travelled together in Italy in the summer of 1963; that September, he wrote to end their relationship. But it never ended completely; they stayed in touch until her wedding in 1979, which he attended, and then until his death in 1986, to the distress of his wife, and his daughter Janna Malamud Smith. Smith kept Heyman’s letters, entrusted to her by her mother, for 22 years after her father’s death. The letters are now in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in Austin.</p> <p>Having planned to be a writer, Heyman wrote a novel, <em>Lovers and Ghosts</em>, from which “In Love with Murray” is adapted; but it was never published. Instead, she went to medical school and trained to be a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. Malamud made her his muse, and wrote about her as the seductive Fanny Bick in <em>Dubin’s Lives</em> (1979). But her deepest literary fame comes from Philip Roth’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ghost-writer.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Ghost Writer</em></a><em> </em>(1979), in which, Heyman’s publisher notes, “she is said to be the inspiration” for Amy Bellette, a young student who is the mistress of the reclusive, reserved novelist EI Lonoff. Lonoff is also based on Bernard Malamud; and to complete the triangle, Roth’s avatar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/29/fiction.philiproth\" title=\"\">Nathan Zuckerman</a>, the young writer who tells the story, persuades himself that Amy is really <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-frank\" title=\"\">Anne Frank</a>, who has miraculously survived Bergen-Belsen, and is the perfect combination of erotic muse and Jewish saint.</p> <p>In short, <em>Scary Old Sex</em> has a lot more literary history and mystery going for it than most first-time collections. It’s always an event when the silent muse speaks up for herself, and in Heyman’s case, the muse’s voice is lusty, tough and life-affirming.</p> <p>• Elaine Showalter’s <em>A Jury of Her Peers: American Women Writers from Anne Bradstreet to Annie Proulx</em> is published by Virago.

Knausgaard’s autobiographical My Struggle series, the author returns to his native Norway to deliver two talks. Drinking coffee at a kiosk in Kjevik airport, he runs through his cues, reassuring himself: “It’ll be fine … It didn’t matter too much that these were old ideas and I no longer believed in them. The important thing was that I said something.”<br /></p> <p>This notion might also be applied to Knausgaard’s autobiographical novels, which, like real life, can be inconsistent and contradictory. His thoughts on art, philosophy, marriage and raising children can be fallible and often change, but the fact that he has written them down, unrestrained and without moderation, is what counts. In this vein, Knausgaard has produced something colossal, prioritising “presence” and personal truth over all else.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was constantly afraid [and] full of fear, non-stop everyday… But then almost everybody has been extremely generous</p> <footer> <cite>Karl Ove Knausgaard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In conversation with Professor John Mullan at a Guardian Live event on Tuesday, Knausgaard explained what he was “looking for was presence, that was the most important thing: presence in a situation … It’s here and now and that’s the structure throughout the whole book. When I’m 16 it’s here and now, and when I’m 32 it’s here and now.”</p> <p>Following the deep trauma contained in its predecessor, A Death in the Family, which focuses on the writer’s difficult relationship with his late father, A Man in Love turns to the nitty-gritty of Knausgaard’s own family life. The idea was that the first book would be about death and the second about love, which doesn’t necessarily equal a much brighter affair. It’s crammed with frustrations and insecurities – even a children’s party is transformed into gripping, turbulent drama – but there is some relief.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"01fc987eebbf353bcaf1c72fef9cf36c1fad799f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/01fc987eebbf353bcaf1c72fef9cf36c1fad799f/0_588_3744_4683/799.jpg\" alt=\"Observer New Review 09/02/2015 Karl Ove Knausgård is a Norwegian author, known for six autobiographical novels, titled My Struggle.

I need light, I need a love story … That was two days before the deadline.”</p> <p>In order to give the book what it lacked, he sat down for 24 hours and wrote 50 pages that went straight in. He found that writing rapidly for such a long time took him into a kind of ecstatic state. “It was a very intense experience and I know I could never write like that again.”</p> <p>Listening to him reflect, one got the sense that this velocity, this unplanned and unrefined approach, was integral to the success of the whole project. He was taught at school to write in short, succinct sentences, but in My Struggle he writes with freedom, allowing impulse and intuition to dictate direction. Everything changed for him, he said, when in 1995 Marcel Proust, with whom he is often compared, was first translated into Norwegian. The long sentences, the movement and flow, were liberating. Before then, he hadn’t been able to write for five years. “I read Proust [and] two years later my first novel came out.”</p> <p>Of course, you can’t discuss Knausgaard’s work without touching on the people he’s written about. At the same time as going to extraordinary lengths to describe in minute detail – and uncommonly prosaic language – the banality of everyday life, he has dedicated reams to the people close to him: his wife, the poet and novelist Linda Boström Knausgaard; his mother-in-law Ingrid, who gets the toughest treatment in A Man in Love; and his best friend, the author Geir Angell Øygarde, for instance.</p> <p>For a work so fearless in its final form, it stands to reason that getting there was a tumultuous ride with a lot at stake, but what he’s done seems to have been largely accepted by those within his immediate circle. “It was very, very risky and dangerous doing this and I was constantly afraid [and] full of fear, non-stop every day … But then almost everybody has been extremely generous.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/12/man-in-love-knausgaard-review\">A Man in Love by Karl Ove Knausgaard – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite struggling with some aspects of what he’s written about others, he has no such concerns for what he’s divulged of himself: “I want it to be a good novel and if takes that, I tell everything, even the most embarrassing thing, then I’ll put it in the book, because I don’t care that much for myself – I care much more for writing novels … If I could have cut off my left arm, I would have done it if it ended up in a novel. I don’t regret anything about what I’ve been writing about myself.”</p> <p>• Karl Ove Knausgaard was speaking at a Guardian Live book club event.

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"715","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45xtn","wordcount":"3166","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608387704/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it? Marvelous! *in bridget jones&#39; voice.* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyweate\">@jeremyweate</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/XKz2ReQAqT\">pic.twitter.com/XKz2ReQAqT</a></p>&mdash; Ainehi Edoro  (@brittlepaper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/status/546265681302286336\">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missaminathula\">Amina Thula</a>’s Cape Town romance Elevator Kiss, the leading couple break all the rules when, as perfect strangers, they kiss on their first encounter. This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"439","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1024","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This
