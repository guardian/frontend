Robin Lustig, a judge for the journalism prize, said of Freedland: &quot;He has been on the shortlist of the Orwell prize seven times now. His writing has a lucidity and elegance of style that deserves reward.&quot;</p> <p>Guardian foreign correspondent Ghaith Abdul-Ahad won the Orwell prize for journalism for his work on the Syrian conflict, including a special report on a jihadist group effort to take control in the country. Lustig said: &quot;He has shown great personal courage and a rare depth of understanding. He writes with deep compassion for those whose lives have been shattered by the conflict.&quot;</p> <p>The winners were chosen from 235 entries to the book prize and 167 entries to the journalism prize.</p> <p>The books category was won by former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson for his memoir, This Boy, which also won the Ondaatje literary prize.</p> <p>Sue MacGregor, a judge for the books award, said: &quot;This is a tale told without a trace of self-pity, but with great grace and good humour, of what it was like growing up poor in a single- parent family in post-war Britain. It is at once deeply personal and nationally significant, and a highly engaging read.&quot;</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","wordcount":"248","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2014-05-21T18:50:36Z","internalComposerCode":"5699e5dce4b02dca51f5ad35","internalOctopusCode":"9072206","internalPageCode":"2096785","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T19:23:55Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3pe6j","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3pe6j"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","webTitle":"Two Guardian journalists win Orwell prize for journalism","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-21T18:55:31Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","type":"article","id":"books/2014/may/21/guardian-journalists-jonathan-freedland-ghaith-abdul-ahad-win-orwell-prize-journalism","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
