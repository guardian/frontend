The demand is unchanged this morning:&nbsp;&quot;Congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached,&quot; Obama said.</p> <p><strong>• Obama went directly after the Tea Party caucus, calling them &quot;extremists&quot; who were demanding a &quot;ransom just for doing their jobs.</strong>&quot; He quoted the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/government-shutdown-third-day-live#block-524d8c0ee4b0f459d922d156\">most inflammatory statement to come out</a> of the Tea Party during the shutdown: &quot;We're not going to be disrespected, We have to get something out of this.

So they're not even accomplishing what they said they want to accomplish.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Call a vote, Obama said: &quot;My simple message today is, call a vote.</strong> Call a vote! Put it on the floor, and let every member of Congress make up their own minds.&nbsp;That way the American people will be clear about who's responsible for the shutdown.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• A lot of people are showing interest in Obamacare, Obama said,</strong> including more than 6m visitors to the web site on Tuesday, nearly 200,000 people who phoned the call center and&nbsp;nearly 11,000 Kentuckians &quot;who applied for new insurance plans in the first two days.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• Obama said &quot;an economic shutdown that results from a default would be dramatically worse&quot;</strong> than a government shutdown. &quot;There will be no negotiations over this,&quot; he said.</p> <p><strong>• The Treasury department released a study warning that &quot;a&nbsp;default would be unprecedented</strong> and has the potential to be catastrophic.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• Republicans are said to be seeking a big deal as a way out of the current budget impasse</strong>, one that would wind up the current stopgap spending bill, the debt ceiling, and for good measure tax policy and nondiscretionary spending.</p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;Americans blame Republicans in Congress&nbsp;for the shutdown 44-35 over President Obama</strong> and the Democrats, according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57605822/poll-americans-not-happy-about-shutdown-more-blame-gop/\">new poll from&nbsp;CBS News</a>, taken after the shutdown began Tuesday</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-03T16:59:01.565+01:00\">at 11.59am ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524d8c0ee4b0f459d922d156\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-03T16:25:57.704+01:00\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>President Obama </strong>accused&nbsp;&quot;extremists&quot; in the House of playing games with the livelihood of Americans.

Monitoring of foodborne disease has <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/02/cdc-director-microbes-didnt-shut-down/\">fallen off</a>. Most federal parks remain <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2021945885_yosemiteclosedshutdownxml.html\">closed</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Washington, a meeting between the president and congressional leaders late Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-shutdown-talks-stalemate-obama-congress\">failed to produce discernible result</a>. House speaker John Boehner emerged to repeat the Republican refrain that the president &quot;will not negotiate.&quot; Senate majority leader Harry Reid&nbsp;said Obama told Republicans &quot;he will not stand&quot; for their tactics.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan/statuses/385540314335039488\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>90 min White House meeting seems to have moved everyone about 90mm, if that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shutdown&amp;src=hash\">#shutdown</a></p>— Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan/statuses/385540314335039488\">October 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>The public doesn't like the shutdown and blames both sides, Republicans more than Democrats, according to a new poll taken after the shutdown went into effect. We'll look at those numbers. We'll also look at rumors of a Republican desire to expand the terms of the current would-be negotiations to encompass a debt ceiling deal. There's a report out there that fellow Republican senators took Ted Cruz to the woodshed yesterday for launching a battle without a battle plan – we'll digest that. And finally this morning we'll check out the new TV ad in the Virginia governor's race that uses Cruz to bash the Republican candidate.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418974605|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|c635101cebd4aea87cc576416a54af8ff28a5f19 -->",
