But cutbacks mean that no more of the blue plaques commemorating the birthplaces, homes and other London landmarks associated with historic figures will be approved until funding is found in two years' time.</p><p>A plaque to be unveiled next week in Great Russell Street for architect John Nash is expected to be among the last after the announcement by English Heritage of the suspension of the blue plaques scheme, which the body blamed on a 34% cut in its overall funding from government.</p><p>There are currently 869 of the plaques, put up as part of the scheme established in 1866 and believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world.</p><p>A number of plaques that have already been approved are still expected to be installed by a team reduced to two full-time employees.</p><p>The plaques cost an average of £965 to install, while English Heritage's budget is dropping from £130m in 2010-11 to £92m in 2014.</p><p>The scheme was started by the Royal Society of Arts and has been run by English Heritage since 1986.</p><p>Recently approved plaques include one in memory of the historian and broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/ajp-taylor/\" title=\"\">AJP Taylor (1906-1990), known as \"</a>Tthe history man\", who is to be commemorated at 13 St Mark's Crescent, Primrose Hill, where he lived from 1955 to 1978.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/idamann/\" title=\"\">Other recent approvals include a plaque for Dame Ida Mann (1893-1983)</a>, a pioneering ophthalmologist and trailblazer for women in medicine, who is to be commemorated at 13 Minster Road, West Hampstead – her childhood home. Plaques were unveiled last year in memory of Fred Perry, Britain's most successful male tennis player, Constance Spry, florist for the Queen's wedding and coronation, and the writers, Jean Rhys and Elizabeth Bowen.</p><p>The only previous time installations have been stopped was between 1915 to 1919 and 1940 to 1947, coinciding with the wartime economies of the first and second world wars.</p><p>A spokeswoman for English Heritage said: \"Following our 34% funding cut in the 2010 spending settlement, English Heritage commissioners made the decision that the blue plaques scheme was to be funded in an alternative way in the future.</p><p>\"As a step towards creating a new and more self-sustaining scheme, the blue plaques team will be reduced to two people during 2013.</p><p>\"They will continue to erect plaques already agreed by the independent advisory panel and work up the details of a new approach to running the scheme that will be announced in 2014.\"</p><p>The heritage body said its decision to reduce staff and suspend new installations would allow it to make savings of £240,000 over the next two years. Possible sources of finance after 2014 could come from private investment or other heritage foundations, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>• This article was amended on 7 January 2013. The original said funding for blue plaques would drop from £130m in 2010-11 to £92m in 2014.
