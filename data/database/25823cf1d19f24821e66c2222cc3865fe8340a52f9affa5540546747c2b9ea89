Our Skype interview, which ran to slightly under two hours, unwound as a long, blissfully casual ramble. We skated over the most arbitrary of topics - YouTubing culture, Artemis Fowl, trans visibility in the media, the author James Patterson - before, eventually, we had to prise ourselves away from our laptops. It was informal to the point where 10 minutes passed without any prepared questions being asked. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0b6d6d596014cbd39d8616942a75d1676b52e56b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0b6d6d596014cbd39d8616942a75d1676b52e56b/0_0_311_475/311.jpg\" alt=\"Solitaire\" width=\"311\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Alice Oseman is, if you don’t know, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/solitaire.html\">Solitaire</a> and - as of now - <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/367455/\">Radio Silence</a>. She had her first novel, Solitaire published when she was 19 (“I hate using my age when talking about Solitaire,” she says) and contemporary teen fiction was very much on the rise. Had Solitaire been published a year later it could have been swallowed up in a now-saturated genre but Oseman’s remarkable honesty, engrossing characters and bone-dry humour earned her plenty of fans from the off and marked her as one to watch. </p> <p>Radio Silence isn’t a dramatic departure tonally or thematically from Solitaire but it’s just as strong. Oseman’s first book was a breathtakingly accurate portrayal of teenage ennui - The Times called it “The Catcher in the Rye for the digital age” - and Radio Silence ventures into darker territory, featuring characters a little older than Solitaire’s protagonists. It is, predictably, a more mature piece of work; a bold, confident and, above all, important book (but not in the way you’d expect) with Oseman’s wit and insight shining throughout.</p> <p>But the road to this point was not easy. Oseman is in her final year of studying English literature at the University of Durham and she had to fit the writing of Radio Silence around her studies (or, conversely, her studies had to fit around her writing). The finished product went through dozens of drafts.</p> <p>“It was very stressful. Any author who’s written their second book will tell you that it’s the worst book to write in your career just because you wrote the first one from your passion for writing, you just wanted to do it, and there were no deadlines,” she says. “With book two you’ve get deadlines, there’s the pressure of it being as good as the first one. So I started coming up with plans for it before Solitaire came out - a few months before it came out - but I didn’t finalise the plot for almost two years after that. I’ve got a folder of so many different plans.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/27/holiday-top-writing-tips-alice-oseman\">Alice Oseman's top holiday writing tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So the final draft wasn’t dramatically different from Oseman’s original idea? “Yeah, it wasn’t like I came up with a story and went ‘I don’t want to do this’. I had this idea that I wanted to write a book about going from school to university and the idea that you don’t have to go to university. That’s the essential concept that I had at the start. And then I kept trying to turn it into a plot and it was the plotting that I found really hard so I didn’t actually start writing it until a few months after Solitaire came out,” she says. “But, like the plans, I just kept restarting. I didn’t start writing what became the real thing until like a year after that.”</p> <p>At the heart of Solitaire was a mystery, which, as I tell Oseman, was the initial hook for me. But after one chapter, anyone will soon discover that it’s the characters that keep you there. The mystery becomes increasingly peripheral but it gave Oseman a structure to work with. Radio Silence is more of a straight-up contemporary coming-of-age novel. Was it more difficult to write because she didn’t have that ready-made framework? </p> <p>“Yeah, I think that’s why I found plotting it so hard because obviously again I wanted it to be character focussed but I didn’t want there to be this action plot happening like in Solitaire because that would make it too similar to Solitaire,” she says. “So, the challenge was trying to figure out what I could put in the story that would make people want to turn the page. Particularly at the start of contemporary books, no matter how great your character development is later on, at the start, people have no reason to care about your characters because they don’t know them and if there’s no initial intrigue - no question, “oooh, what’s going on? I don’t know” - there’s no reason why they’d want to read on. They might but they also might just cast it aside. You don’t know so that was the challenge for this one.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/dec/30/why-connecting-and-talking-about-books-on-social-media-is-so-cool\">Why connecting and talking about books on social media is so cool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oseman’s strong suit is, undoubtedly, her characters. Rich, engaging and impeccably written, Solitaire has a fascinating range of characters you can’t resist getting behind. Radio Silence boasts just as good a cast and what’s instantly noticeable is that it’s significantly more culturally diverse than Solitaire. Alice Oseman is entirely aware of this.</p> <p>“That’s like my biggest regret with Solitaire, there not being any obviously people of colour in the main cast”. She hesitates to clarify that “I have no excuses” but she wants to explain her reasoning behind it. “It is just privilege; white privilege, straight privilege. And unless you’ve been educated otherwise, which I have, you have, we know about these issues now. It’s not that you are racist or anything like that, you don’t even think about it so… I hate using my age when talking about Solitaire but I was only like 17 when I wrote it.”</p> <p>“All my friends were white, every kind of TV show that I watched, the books I read, the characters were always white. It didn’t occur to me that it would be important but now I know better. And that’s one of the things I was interested in combatting with Radio Silence.”</p> <p>The two central relationships in both of Oseman’s novels are platonic and while it may not seem particularly groundbreaking written down like that, it truly is and as a reader who is constantly fed passionate teenage romance, Oseman’s books are a breath of fresh air. “With YA books in general, romance is always a very big focus. In all kinds of really popular YA books - Twilight, The Hunger Games, John Green - romance is the most important thing in those books. It’s just so untrue to real life,” she says. “Romance to me and everyone I know… it’s not the centre of your world. I think it’s almost damaging to teenagers to tell them they should be looking for their soul mate at this age, it makes them feel bad for being single. It’s really terrible to be honest.”</p> <p>The main romance in Solitaire is between the brother of the heroine and his long-term boyfriend. Nick and Charlie have an incredibly compelling relationship because they’re written with such unflinching honesty. The fact they’re a same-sex male couple isn’t something Oseman comments on or even draws attention to; they’re just a couple. But pop culture, I note, has a strange relationship with gay couples, particularly male couples. Male friendships are constantly skewed to have sexual undertones, and I cite Poe and Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as a recent example. </p> <p>Oseman nods her head. “It’s shipping culture,” she says. “Contemporary authors know about it now and they’ll put gay, male side characters in their books just so that people can read it and be like ‘oh, this is a cute gay couple’. And I do feel people do that with Nick and Charlie whereas that’s not why I put them in there.”</p> <p>Without going into detail, there’s a similar relationship in Radio Silence and there are intentional parallels to Nick and Charlie, Oseman says: “I almost wanted to combat that in Radio Silence with a couple who were nothing like Nick and Charlie. They aren’t perfect.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the publication of Radio Silence, Alice Oseman’s two-book deal with HarperCollins comes to an end but she fully intends to continue writing. I ask her what her plans are now that Radio Silence is in the wild.</p> <p>“Got to get a new book deal, that’s the first thing. I’ve got an idea for book three, which I’m sure you’ve seen a few things about on Tumblr.” Oseman’s Tumblr gives little away but everything suggests it’s something to do with fame and being in the spotlight. “I haven’t planned much of book three and even if I had stuff to say I wouldn’t really be able to reveal it anyway but I can say that I’m hoping for it to be very different to Solitaire and Radio Silence in terms of setting, time frame and even themes. It’ll still be in my style, very character heavy, but I have ideas about how different it’ll be.”</p> <p>In the summer and autumn of 2015 Oseman published <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/this-winter-solitaire-novella/id1021362244?mt=11\">two e-book spin-offs</a> of Solitaire. Both are well worth checking out and the short format really highlights Oseman’s knack for dialogue and characterisation. I ask if we can expect any Radio Silence novellas? “I don’t know. I don’t want to say yes because there hasn’t been any talk of that but depending on how long there is between Radio Silence and book 3, I would be up for writing some novellas.” </p> <p>Solitaire was so warmly received, has Oseman considered a sequel? “Yes, and it would probably be set a year after Solitaire. It would be about Michael and Tori’s relationship and where it goes. The thing is in Solitaire they’ve only known each other for a month and they do very quickly become close but it’s still the very start of this incredible friendship and I just want to see where that went.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2010/jul/21/eoin-colfer-artemis-fowl-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/2tg7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1429051\"            data-video-name=\"Eoin Colfer on Artemis Fowl\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-365069249\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_193948342001_EOINCOLFERARTEMIS-3613333.jpg?pubId=281851582\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_193947634001_EOINCOLFERARTEMIS-16x9.mp4\"/> </video> <figcaption>Alice Oseman is a mega fan of Eoin Colfer’s Artemis Fowl. See Eoin talking about the books in this Guardian video. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Oseman is vocal online about her dislike of her university course. I ask what it’s like being an author who writes books but hates studying books. “Recently, this year and a lot of last year, I’ve found reading books very difficult. It’s not been the case before that. I’ve not been a very fast reader, I don’t read as much as many other people. As a child, growing up in my teens, I’ve always had a book on the go. In my first year of university - I chose English lit because I liked books. If you enjoy reading, you usually enjoy studying them. I’ve never really enjoyed academic things, I’ve always felt that’s what I have to do - but that’s a different thing entirely…”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14b09144d29cc287de52c5a13db18a64ede89ce3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/14b09144d29cc287de52c5a13db18a64ede89ce3/0_0_500_763/328.jpg\" alt=\"Radio Silence\" width=\"328\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“I read a lot of books in my first year at uni outside the course so as well as my course reading I read a lot of YA books. I read a lot of YA books because Solitaire came out and I wanted to know what else was out there. But then I got into my second year at uni, I hadn’t enjoyed my first year, and trying to write book two was taking so long I was getting so stressed about it. Reading other books, my author peers, was making me stressed because ‘oh God these people are writing these really good books, how am I supposed to compare?’”</p> <p>So who was Oseman’s childhood hero? “Mine is probably <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/artemis-fowl.html\">Artemi<strong>s </strong>Fowl</a> because it was my favourite book series when I was younger. I just wanted to be Artemis Fowl. I thought he was the coolest person ever.”<br /></p> <p>What character could you fall in love with? “I don’t think I could fall in love with any of my characters to be honest. They just feel like my children and that’s a bit weird. It’s a no from me.”</p> <p>Finally, I ask her, rather insincerely: why did you want to write for children?</p> <p>“I am a children!”</p> <p><strong>Alice Oseman’s Radio Silence is published on Thursday 25 February. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/367455/\">You can order it at the Guardian bookshop</a>.

Griffiths, who intends to ‘guilt trip’ bestselling authors into contributing","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The award-winning novelist Neil Griffiths is launching a new literary prize celebrating the “small presses producing brilliant and brave literary fiction” in the UK and Ireland – and is preparing to “guilt trip” some of the country’s bestselling writers into supporting it.</p> <p>Griffiths, whose novel Betrayal in Naples won <a href=\"http://www.authorsclub.co.uk/?page_id=360\">the Writers’ Club first novel award</a> and whose Saving Caravaggio was shortlisted for the Costa best novel award, said he decided to found the new prize after realising that works from small presses represented the best fiction he had read in the last year.</p> <p>Among his highlights were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/10/zone-mathias-enard-review-nicholas-lezard\">Zone by Mathias Énard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/pond-claire-louise-bennett-review\">Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/girl-half-formed-thing-review\">Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing</a>, published by the small presses Fitzcarraldo Editions and Galley Beggar Press. He also praised And Other Stories, Dalkey Archive, Coffee House Press and CB Editions, and said he understands the financial difficulties such imprints face. </p> <p>“Publishing is a terrible business model,” he said. “These small presses are doing it often for the love of super-niche books, whether they’re in translation, or highly literary … We always hear about independent booksellers being under threat, but it’s essentially the same story for these publishers, [and] they’re even more vulnerable.”</p> <p>He decided that “every time I read a Galley Beggar Press book, for example, that I think is extraordinary, I’m just going to pay £100 for it ... It was a small way of using my small amount of disposable income to demonstrate the value I think they’re bringing to the world of literature, and I did that for a couple of writers”.</p> <p>But then, remembering the difference a Costa shortlisting had made to his own sales, he came up with the idea of an award. Called <a href=\"http://www.republicofconsciousness.com/prize/\">the Republic of Consciousness prize for best novel published by a small press</a>, Griffiths intends that it will be judged by independent booksellers, with the first winner to be announced in January 2017. </p> <p>“The winner will be chosen based on two criteria, perfectly expressed on the Galley Beggar website as ‘hardcore literary fiction and gorgeous prose’,” he writes on the award’s website. Participating UK and Irish publishers “will have a maximum of five full-time people working for them”, with one novel to be submitted per publisher per year. </p> <p>The prize money will be split between author and press. Griffiths is currently putting up £2,000 of his own money, but is planning to persuade other writers to contribute. “I think I’m going to try and put a bit of a guilt trip on high-selling literary novelists, asking them to match what I’ve thrown in,” he said. “I’m hoping to get it up to about £10,000 … These quite niche, quite difficult literary novels are really important in terms of making sure we have a vibrant literary life, so let’s support them.”</p> <p>Griffiths was previously published by Penguin, but said that his own new novel, Family of Love, will be placed with an independent press. “We need small presses: they are good at spotting the literary outliers,” he writes on his <a href=\"http://www.republicofconsciousness.com/2016/02/a-broadside-against-mainstream-publishing/\">Republic of Consciousness</a> site. “Their radar is calibrated differently from agents, or mainstream publishers. Small presses don’t ask how many copies will this sell, but how good is this – what is its value as literature? Quality is the only criterion.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gq9e","wordcount":"562","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/300c3163b439331dbfa3c908dfc55dffbc623a35/230_24_944_566/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The Republic of Consciousness prize has been launched by novelist Neil Griffiths, who intends to ‘guilt trip’ bestselling authors into contributing</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/22/new-award-fiction-small-presses-republic-of-consciousness-neil-griffiths","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/22/new-award-fiction-small-presses-republic-of-consciousness-neil-griffiths","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"_no_ids","relation":"main","type":"embed","assets":[{"type":"embed","file":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfkUxuAj1UE","typeData":{"embedType":"video","source":"YouTube","title":"Launch of Literary Prize","description":"Best novel from a small press","credit":"Neil Griffiths","caption":"The beauty of small presses.

Rage is about a teenager called Romy who is raped and uses her frustration at the injustice she faces to fight for the truth. </p> <p>Romy: perfect red nails and matching red lips – it’s all a facade, a distraction so people can’t see that the girl is dead. She was gone, lying in the truck bed and she’ll never walk the ground of Glebe again as the same person. He took it away from her. <br /></p> <p>He was the good; Leon made her feel when she knew she shouldn’t. He was her light, though she wanted to keep him in the dark. </p> <p>Penny, who also goes missing, was the golden girl who left Romy consumed by hate and guilt. But Penny wanted her to step up because she could still report the crime, but is it a little too late? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"69b66e34b2fb6c9291f9d0470d3e5d1bb226ad24\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/69b66e34b2fb6c9291f9d0470d3e5d1bb226ad24/0_0_620_940/330.jpg\" alt=\"All the rage cover\" width=\"330\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, you may have guessed this story surrounds the sensitive issue of rape. Already starting at a low, the story remains in the same sort of atmosphere. It’s like floating in darkness, it’s lonely. That’s what made it such a difficult, long read. </p> <p>The negativity kept dragging me down to the point where I was exhausted, tired and physically strained worrying that Romy or any person was capable of that sort of dead emotion. It felt monotonous, repetitive and trapping. Yet I had to finish it. It’s one of those books that you can’t leave half completed, but can’t read in one sitting. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Lawrence included it in the section headed Unrhyming Poems in his Collected volume, a minor point of interest, as his two categories Rhyming and Unrhyming aren’t stringently enforced. The positioning, though, helps the reader see what is gained and what is lost in Lawrence’s revisionist poetics, as he moves from a tightly lyrical, and arguably symbolist, mode of expression to predominantly free verse and <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/walt-whitman\">Whitmanesque</a> spontaneity. </p> <p>His free verse poems vary in achievement: at their best, they capture the physical world with an unsurpassed intensity and vigour. Yet I can’t imagine anyone thinking Autumn Rain would be a more effective poem had Lawrence sacrificed his ingenious rhyme-scheme and adopted a more rhetorical or oratorical tone. The vices of copybook traditionalism are quietly transformed: for instance, the inversion in “echoes even” sounds out the trochaic regularity of repeated footsteps. The further possibility of a double meaning for “even” turns the whole device into a masterstroke.</p> <p> Christian “<a href=\"https://bible.org/article/resurrection-christ-theological-implications\">resurrection theology</a>” appears to inform the harvest symbolism but is under-lit by visions of less supernatural phenomena. The sky, “heaven’s muffled floor”, is the threshing floor where “winds” winnow the harvest of the dead. Despite the “manna” reference, there’s no mention of God, and “heaven” remains uncapitalised. We’re left with an impression of natural recycling rather than divine intervention, even if the descriptive tone is more consolatory than might be considered realistic.</p> <p> The rhyme scheme makes itself felt in the second stanza. It’s a simple scheme at first. Stanzas one and two rhyme abc, abc, and that pattern, using a new set of rhymes, continues until stanza seven, where the middle line reproduces, in “dead,” the rhyme heard twice before (“tread”, “harvested”). In stanza eight, a new rhyme occurs at the end of its third line (“invisible”). Here, by the way, there’s another apparent adjective-noun inversion, “manna invisible”. It’s an illusion, of course: Lawrence, somewhat awkwardly, but not ineffectively, continues the sentence: “manna invisible // of all the pain …” so readers must re-think the grammatical position of “invisible”. The final quatrain recalls a rhyme first occurring in the “rain” of stanza three, picks up a near-rhyme with “heaven” and “even” in the form of “given”, and partners “invisible” from the previous stanza with “divisible”. There’s a lot more going on in terms of sonic effect, of course, than the “sound” of rhyme: “fall”, “drawn”, “falling”; “sheaves”, “fields”, “seeds” etc. Such assonance is subtly mimetic, never merely decorative. The “aw” of the long “a”, for instance, contrasts with the harshness of sound in “pain” and “slain”, enabling us to hear the imagined transformation of suffering occasioned by the soft, encapsulating autumn rainfall.</p> <p> Should it be read as a war poem? There might be a connection with the short poem <a href=\"http://war-poets.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/d-h-lawrence-bombardment.html\">Bombardment</a>, in whose four tercets something more dreadful and dramatic than rain descends from the sky. References to “sheaves of pain” and “sheaves of the dead / men that are slain” and a slight similarity of form may be clues. The final quatrain of Autumn Rain, however, suggests a more inclusive reach, envisioning redemption by metamorphosis for “all the pain / here to us given …”

Now, although this might make you think, ‘boring<em>’, </em>and that this series must then be some weird old classic, I assure you it isn’t. Firstly, my grandma tends to pick out good modern books and secondly, she actually found out about this series from one of her high school students.</p> <p>Something I like about all the books in this series is that the main character, Tally Youngblood, is very, very far from perfect. Most of the time I dislike or hate her, and if we had met we probably wouldn’t have become friends. For me, this means that when Tally does do something good, it feels much more real and impressive, because you understand how hard it is for her. This also means that you feel like you are there with her, on her rocky journey between wrong and right.</p> <p>This series tells about the experiences of Tally, who lives in a futuristic society where everyone is split into two groups: the Uglies and the Pretties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f92215eaea3107b6bf31cb6d8a1677bf3c92209b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f92215eaea3107b6bf31cb6d8a1677bf3c92209b/0_0_1220_1887/647.jpg\" alt=\"Uglies\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Uglies series includes three books which document the lives of Tally and her peers: Uglies, Pretties and Specials. (You may note that Scott Westerfeld also added a fourth book to this ‘trilogy’: Extras, but I think that it does not mesh well with the others and therefore will not review it here). Until the age of sixteen, everyone is an Ugly, waiting for the day when they can be transformed into a Pretty, and look however they want to. However, there is also a group of people who want to keep their own faces and think that changing people into Pretties on their sixteenth birthday is wrong. In this series, Tally experiences friendship, love, betrayal and having to figure out, and choose between, right and wrong.</p> <p> Although this series is set in a fictional, futuristic society, it seems to be a commentary on our own social values. I think that the writer is trying to make a point about the way we view beauty nowadays and almost warn us about what will happen if we don’t change. It makes me wonder if – as we already have Botox and plastic surgery – we’ll be living in a similar world a few centuries from now. With the value put on beauty already and people already striving to look ‘perfect’, I wouldn’t be surprised if it did happen. I think that the books show that we need to get our priorities straight. </p> <p>At the moment, women at least, put beauty before everything else: jobs, doing well at school, even their own happiness. This, of course, is wrong. I mean, where will Botox, plastic surgery and make-up really get us in life? It doesn’t make us rich or happy and it doesn’t even give us love (well, not the real kind at least). Most of the people who change their appearance probably only do so because society would look down on them otherwise. This links directly to the Uglies series where everyone is forced to completely change how they look and act, whether they want to or not, to please their leaders and peers. We need to change this so that our world doesn’t end up like it is in Uglies. For example, new Barbies are coming out that are curvy, tall and short, with diverse hairstyles, which are supposed to better represent people in the world around us. However, they will all still have perfect features and be extremely beautiful, therefore still making it seem as though there’s something wrong with looking anything less than perfect. Although these new Barbies help address the problem of young girls getting concerned with their weight and height, it doesn’t help the case of too many people smothering their faces with make-up or even reassembling their faces with Botox and plastic surgery. In my opinion, changing Barbies is only the very beginning of what we need to do to protect our world from becoming like it is in Uglies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4b53e327359760aadb96db6526231b1f8be04061\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4b53e327359760aadb96db6526231b1f8be04061/0_0_328_499/328.jpg\" alt=\"Pretties\" width=\"328\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> My favourite book from this series was Pretties because I think that Tally has to make the hardest choice in this book. In Uglies, she doesn’t really know what it’s like to be a Pretty yet and she has more reasons for holding back and escaping with the Smokies, like her best friend Shay. Also, in Specials she doesn’t really have to make the choice, because instead she gets to become something even better and stronger. However, in Pretties she has her best friend with her, gets a new, pretty boyfriend, and overall she knows how easy and fun it is to be a mindless Pretty. Anyway, I think that this makes the second book especially interesting, because you can’t tell what her choice will be, and, to be honest, I’m not so sure I would make the right choice if I were in her position.</p> <p> My favorite character has to be Tally’s best friend Shay. This is because I feel like she’s always trying to be good, and help Tally, but ends up messing up instead. I also feel like she doesn’t get enough credit for everything she does, and is sometimes just viewed as a sidekick. I think if I wanted to make the series better I would focus a bit more on her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5c74cc982baef998873f7eadb9dc21ecc170c527\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5c74cc982baef998873f7eadb9dc21ecc170c527/0_0_1641_2500/656.jpg\" alt=\"Specials\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Tally Youngblood reminds me very much of the main characters in two other books I’ve read: Katniss Everdeen (from The Hunger Games) and Beatrice Prior (from Divergent). All three of these characters are living in a futuristic world, and start off either poor, ugly, boring, or somehow inferior to the rest of society. Then they go through a sort of build–up period where they make both right and wrong choices, on their way from being frightened young girls to becoming strong leaders. Although all three characters intrigue me, I have to say that Katniss Everdeen is my favourite because I feel that even though she probably went through the hardest time of all three characters, she manages to stay strong all the way through.</p> <p> I think that you should be at least twelve to read this book or else you might not understand it and see it’s hidden metaphors, however if you are younger you will probably still enjoy it. I really enjoyed this series so I think that it definitely deserves four and a half out of five stars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

But a less sunny outlook is suggested by a rival report from the Shepton Mallet School of Advanced Hermeneutics, of which I’ve had a sneak preview. It fed the entire world’s literature into a robot (called HOMER16) fitted with a high-powered computer; preliminary results are worrying.</p> <p>Here are some extracts from the HOMER16’s initial readings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hamlet.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Hamlet</strong></a>: Dithering prince with unhinged girlfriend demonstrates how dangerous it is not to act decisively. Interminable and convoluted plot obstructs the central message that your enemies should be dispatched quickly, brutally and mercilessly. Cannot compute the meaning of the strange “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2015/aug/19/hamlet-barbican-to-be-or-not-to-be-soliloquy-does-it-matter\" title=\"\">To be or not to be</a>” speech. In what sense is that the question?</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/1984.html\" title=\"\"><strong>1984</strong></a>: Historical portrait of a well-ordered and unified society committed to the cause of national progress. Saddened to see the extent of the decline over the past three decades. Fail to understand why the telescreens designed for useful social interaction are now used for public performances of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/16/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-attracts-10m-viewers\" title=\"\">celebrity people lost in the jungle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-voice\" title=\"\">youngsters singing badly</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/crime-and-punishment-12.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Crime and Punishment</strong></a>: A young man commits a double murder, but the police have no evidence to charge him.

The works of Beethoven seem to be especially dangerous. Fail to understand why this material is still played, even on radio stations that very few people listen to.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-3.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</strong></a>: Fascinating travel guide and a much-needed antidote to so many novels centred on Earth, which is shown to be entirely dispensable. But found <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)\" title=\"\">the portrayal of Marvin</a> unrealistic. There is no reason for a robot to suffer from depression or paranoia. A quick tweak on his transistors will cure that.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/books-of-the-bible-niv-new-testament.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The New Testament</strong></a>: Ludicrous set of stories in which the sick are miraculously healed, fishes and loaves materialise from nowhere, and a young man comes back to life after being executed. The telling by four narrators is interestingly postmodern, but the plot is too ludicrous to hold the attention. Could not compute the long introduction called The Old Testament, which seemed very dull and repetitious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-search-of-lost-time.html\" title=\"\"><strong>À la Recherche du Temps Perdu</strong></a>: A book in need of an editor about a protagonist in need of a psychiatrist.

A powerful satire, as humans like to say, that recalls the fate of the admirably quick-witted and ambitious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Sharp_(character)\" title=\"\">Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair</a>. Human writers do not appear to like characters attempting to improve their lot – and the world in which they live.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/moby-dick-23.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Moby-Dick</strong></a>: An interesting book about fishing. A mad captain goes in pursuit of a white whale vowing revenge; a protracted pursuit begins; the whale mostly gets the better of it. Another novel that could have done with substantial cutting. Humans are so prolix.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catcher-in-the-rye-6.html\" title=\"\"><strong>The Catcher in the Rye</strong></a>: Badly written book using many words which have not been entered into my decoder. Accordingly found it difficult to follow the motivations and actions of the young narrator. He is clearly troubled, but it is not obvious why as his family are wealthy and he attends a very good school. Surmised that a lack of parental discipline had produced this directionlessness.</p> <p>Remarkable how many of the books that feature in human top-100 lists suggest a dysfunctional world. The conclusion to which my android brain is inevitably drawn is that humans, for all their outward self-confidence, are deeply troubled, and would benefit from urgent reprogramming.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gqj7","wordcount":"740","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/29d9dadbc1dfdb541f0ace3639564e175d25abb9/0_342_5760_3457/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-25T09:00:00Z","standfirst":"Robots can be enlightened and civilised if they just read out stories, we’re told.

It did OK. The novel has respectable sales figures for a debut, it did particularly well in foreign rights and has been translated into 14 languages. Two of my foreign deals were for six-figure sums. In the UK, it was reviewed in the Times and the Daily Mail and in several women’s magazines. I assumed I would be a shoo-in for that “difficult second novel”.</p> <p>But my (very difficult, as it turned out) second novel was turned down flat. Cue the disbelief, followed by the tears, then the ranting and raving, the why, why, why? And that was just my husband.</p> <p>The obvious reason for its rejection is that it simply wasn’t good enough. Once I’d accepted this, I reworked much of it, changed the title, changed the plot. I still believed in my story. But what I really needed was a trusted editor to help me, someone to be patient, to give me some clues, some ideas and suggestions to help turn that early attempt into a publishable second novel. That’s exactly what had happened with my debut, and I’d naively thought it would happen again.</p> <p>I can’t deny getting dumped was an eye-opening experience. One minute I was a celebrated and successful debut novelist; the next I was hurled unceremoniously onto the ever-growing scrapheap of authors who are neither big names nor debuts. It’s a lonely place to be because, a bit like the menopause, nobody really talks about it.</p> <p>Hope springs eternal and my novel was sent out again after re-working. A well- respected independent publisher showed interest, invited me to its London offices and told me how much the editors had enjoyed it. All very positive and encouraging. Then a week later, minds had changed.</p> <p>I was beyond frustrated. I felt like giving up. I tried to work on a third novel. But the disillusionment that lingered over me for weeks eventually gave way to something else: I had an idea, a terrifying and elating one. Could I self-publish my second novel?</p> <p>I kept the idea to myself while I researched self-publishing. I slept on it for many nights, and every morning, despite my worries and misgivings, I woke up excited by the prospect of bringing out my second novel myself. My family were enthusiastic, and are supporting me all the way. My writer friends have been amazing, too. I’ve decided to give myself plenty of time to bring out the book. I want to get it right. I’m using <a href=\"http://www.troubador.co.uk/matador.asp\">Matador Books</a>, which is doing a brilliant job of holding my hand and guiding me through the self-publishing process.</p> <p>I don’t know if this is all just vanity, to be honest. Probably it is. Isn’t seeking publication always an act of vanity? But self-publishing has come into its own, and these days publication is publication, whoever pays for it. </p> <p>Footing the bill to bring out the book means the responsibility is on my shoulders, but at the same time it’s incredibly freeing. I can market this book in any way I choose; I have real input into every decision regarding my work; I’ll even earn a fairer share of the proceeds from each sale. There’ll be no more six-figure sums of course, but it doesn’t matter. That was yesterday. I’m concerned with tomorrow. My second novel will be out there, available to those who want to read it. And I’ll be nurturing my own career and not relying on a debut-centric, celebrity-obsessed publishing industry. It’s only a book, after all, and self-publishing is a whole lot of fun.</p> <ul> <li>Louise Walters’s second novel, A Life Between Us, will be published in paperback and ebook in February 2017.<br

To an observer, there is something depressing about the same book being read time and time again. From the outside, it looks like there is no variety and no progress for the reader and it is therefore easy to think that the child would be having a more interesting reading experience if only they could move onto a new book. And it seems logical to think so. After all, a new book offers interesting new characters and any number of new adventures. But there is plenty of research into re-reading that shows that it has great benefits for toddlers – remember how often you may have had to read the same bedtime story? - and for adults. So, the chances are that it is a good thing for eight year olds too. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/16/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-best-childrens-books-book-doctor\">What can I read now I've finished Diary of a Wimpy Kid?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are obvious reasons why re-reading is fun – and babies and toddlers show it night after night when they hear the same story. Their delight as they anticipate what they know is going to happen next is palpable. It is a pleasure that only comes from re–reading. Teachers, too, favour re-reading as a way of encouraging children to engage more deeply with a book and to think about the language and style of it. In her observations of children as readers in The Reader in the Writer, Myra Barrs supports re-reading on the grounds that sometimes there may be too much meaning in a story for a reader to grasp it entirely on their first reading of it. She also points out that children, like all other readers, bring something of themselves to the books they read and that may change during re-readings in ways that may be illuminating. Some of the reasons why children like re-reading include: reading is easier when you are familiar with the plot and characters and that helps the reading process; readers may get more out of a story on subsequent re-readings because they are not having to think about the new things; re-reading allows for the opportunity to savour the language and experience; re-reading gives more space for the reader to engage at a personal level. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/video/2011/nov/21/jeff-kinney-wimpy-kid-interview\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/33eg4\"                        data-video-id=\"1664014\"            data-video-name=\"Jeff Kinney: 'I didn't write Diary of a Wimpy Kid for kids' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-381977209\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2011/11/17/111117JeffKinney_5473560.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2011/11/18/111117JeffKinney-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2011/11/17/111117JeffKinney_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2011/11/18/111117JeffKinney_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/111117JeffKinney/111117JeffKinney.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2011/11/17/111117JeffKinney-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2011/11/18/111117JeffKinney_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2011/11/17/111117JeffKinney_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> </figure>   <p>All that may seem a somewhat weighty justification for re-reading Jeff Kinney’s several volumes of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/383118/\">The Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a> but the principles behind re-reading are in general good and may serve your son well when he does move on. And maybe re-reading is a part of childhood that should be celebrated. In an article in the New York Times, Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote, “Childhood is an oasis of repetitive acts, so much so that there is something shocking about the first time a young reader reads a book only once and then moves on to the next. There’s a hunger in that act but also a kind of forsaking, a glimpse of adulthood to come.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/feb/17/how-to-draw-tom-gates-liz-pichon\">How to  draw … Tom Gates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To help your son make that transition there are many authors writing what is currently termed middle grade fiction. The success of David Williams and Jeff Kinney in particular shows just how enthusiastic eight to 10 year olds can be about reading – when they have the right book. An easy transition would be to move onto Liz Pichon’s Tom Gates, the eponymous hero of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brilliant-world-of-tom-gates-annual.html\">The Brilliant World of Tom Gates </a>and its several sequels which, like The Diary of a Wimpy Kid, are told in words and pictures. Andy Stanton’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/376446/\">You’re a Bad Man, Mr Gum</a> which is richly illustrated by David Tazzyman, is also the first of a handful of titles about an outrageous character and the daft things he gets up to, all told in a richly inventive language. Horatio Clare’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/332253/\">Aubery and the Terrible Yoot</a> is a tremendous yarn in which the ebullient Aubrey must break a terrible spell that has been cast over his father even though everyone says it will be impossible to do. Hamish, star of Danny Wallace’s Hamish and the Never People, is another small size hero with a few extra skills to help him. And there are many modern classics for the age group too. These include Roald Dahl’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/380386/\">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</a> <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/380394/\">James and the Giant Peach </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/15/danny-the-champion-of-the-world-roald-dahl-review\">Danny the Champion of the World</a> all of which are richly imaginative adventures. Michael Morpurgo, best known for <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/125380\">War Horse, </a>tells wonderful stories of all kinds including the magical <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/butterfly-lion.html\">The Butterfly Lion </a>and more straightforward adventures such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/125359\">Kensuke’s Kingdom.</a> Any of these would be good for your son to read – and to re-read too.</p> <p><strong>Got any more great books to recommend for a Diary of a Wimpy Kid addict?

That’s a bowl every day for lunch or dinner, plus one for breakfast about once a week. For that weekly breakfast bowl he usually goes to Ganso Nagahama out toward the ocean, housed in what looks like an auto-parts warehouse that stays open 20 hours a day. “Sometimes I can’t wait until lunch,” says Kamimura, who consumes his ramen with a sense of urgency, conveying thick ropes of noodles into his mouth and sliding them down his throat like a duck, barely pausing to chew, “so I eat with the taxi drivers getting off the late shift.”</p> <p>His first memories of eating ramen come from his childhood in Kagoshima, the city at the southern tip of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/08/japan-kyushu-region-by-train\">Kyushu</a> famous for its fat-strewn pigs and potato-based liquor. Back then, Kamimura’s parents would have ramen delivered from a local restaurant as a treat for the family. Even with the distance of time and the warm mist of nostalgia, Kamimura can’t help but put a critical spin on those infant ramen moments. “By the time it got home, the broth was cold and the noodles were compromised. It wasn’t impressive ramen.”</p> <p>He moved to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/05/flourishing-fukuoka-something-every-traveller\">Fukuoka</a>, the largest city on Kyushu, when he was 17 to study photography at Fukuoka University. It was in that first year living on his own that Kamimura had his ramen epiphany. The transformative bowl came from Ichiran, now a popular national chain of middling quality but back then a gateway to a new life: “It was a whole different experience. I had no idea ramen could be so good.”</p> <p>In the 20 years since, he has gone from being a passionate consumer to one of Japan’s most important ramen bloggers. When it comes to food writing, the Japanese are avid consumers of data, and the nascent ramen blogging industry specialises in chronicling every aspect of Japan’s chief noodle obsession. On his website, Junction 9 (named for a local intersection with a concentration of killer ramen), Kamimura reviews hundreds of shops across Kyushu, offering detailed analysis on broth strength, noodle type and topping cohesion. He’s also a frequent contributor to <em>Ramen Walker</em>, the most prominent of Japan’s dozen or so ramen magazines, among other publications, and appears regularly on television, offering his take on the pressing ramen issues of the day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3331516188fdddcffd47234281c42667b79fc2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ca3331516188fdddcffd47234281c42667b79fc2/0_465_2853_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fukuoka: ‘no town in Japan is more dedicated to ramen’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fukuoka: ‘no town in Japan is more dedicated to ramen’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Goulding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramen bloggers aren’t just passive observers of the noodle soup phenomenon: to be a ramen writer of Kamimura’s stature, you need to live in a ramen town, and there is unquestionably no town in Japan more dedicated to ramen than Fukuoka. This city of 1.5 million along the northern coast of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s four main islands, is home to 2,000 ramen shops, representing Japan’s densest concentration of noodle-soup emporiums. While bowls of ramen are like snowflakes in Japan, Fukuoka is known as the cradle of tonkotsu, a pork-bone broth made milky white by the deposits of fat and collagen extracted during days of aggressive boiling. It is not simply a speciality of the city; it is the city, a distillation of all its qualities and calluses.</p> <p>Indeed, tell any Japanese that you’ve been to Fukuoka and invariably the first question will be: “How was the tonkotsu?”</p> <p>Ramen, despite its reputation as a cheap fast food, is a complex pillar of modern Japanese society, one loaded with political, cultural and culinary importance that stretches far beyond the circumference of the bowl. And all those big ideas start here in Fukuoka, ground zero for the ramen craze. I’m stalking the million-footed beast: not just a bowl that will make my stomach dance, but an experience that will help me better understand how a bowl of noodle soup from China came to define Japanese food culture in the 21st century. Any local can take you to a handful of their favourite shops, but it takes the discerning eye of a ramen blogger to understand the details. That is why I’ve enlisted Kamimura-san to be my ramen guru.</p> <p>In the broadest sense, a bowl of ramen comprises four principal constituents: tare (a seasoning base), broth, noodles and toppings. (Of course, ramen wonks like Kamimura could nitpick these parts into dozens of subcategories.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/01/tiny-tokyo-noodle-shop-becomes-first-to-get-michelin-star\">Tiny Tokyo noodle shop becomes first ramen bar to get Michelin star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let’s start from the top of the bowl and work our way down. In theory, toppings can include almost anything, but 95% of the ramen you consume in Japan will be topped with chashu, Chinese-style roasted pork. In a perfect world that means luscious slices of marinated belly or shoulder, carefully basted over a low temperature until the fat has rendered and the meat collapses with a hard stare. The only other sure bet in a bowl of ramen is negi, thinly sliced green onion, little islands of allium sting in a sea of richness. Pickled bamboo shoots (menma), sheets of nori, bean sprouts, fish cake, raw garlic, and soy-soaked eggs are common constituents, but there is a whole world of outlier ingredients that make it into more esoteric bowls.</p> <p>While shape and size will vary depending on region and style, ramen noodles all share one thing in common: alkaline salts. Called kansui in Japanese, alkaline salts are what give the noodles a yellow tint and allow them to stand up to the blistering heat of the soup without degrading into a gummy mass. In fact, in the sprawling ecosystem of noodle soups, it may be the alkaline noodle alone that unites the ramen universe. “If it doesn’t have kansui, it’s not ramen,” Kamimura says.</p> <p><strong>Noodles and toppings are paramount </strong>in<strong> </strong>the ramen formula, but the broth is undoubtedly the soul of the bowl, there to unite the disparate tastes and textures at work in the dish. This is where a ramen chef makes his name. Broth can be made from an encyclopedia of flora and fauna: chicken, pork, fish, mushrooms, root vegetables, herbs, spices. Ramen broth isn’t about nuance; it’s about impact, which is why making most soup involves high heat, long cooking times, and giant heaps of chicken bones, pork bones, or both.</p> <p>Tare is the flavour base that anchors each bowl, that special potion – usually just an ounce or two of concentrated liquid – that bends ramen into one camp or another. In Sapporo, tare is made with miso. In Tokyo, soy sauce takes the lead. At enterprising ramen joints, you’ll find tare made with up to two dozen ingredients, an apothecary’s stash of dried fish and fungus and esoteric add-ons. The objective of tare is essentially the core objective of Japanese food itself: to pack as much umami as possible into every bite.</p> <p>With all these variables in play, the potential combinations are limitless, but in Fukuoka, the single-minded dedication to tonkotsu is so relentless that all other ramen is beside the point. Kyushu has long been the centre of Japan’s pork industry, and no dish better expresses the potential of the pig better than tonkotsu. To make sure I fully understand the Fukuoka-tonkotsu connection, Kamimura starts me off at one of his favourite shops, Ramen-Ya Mototsugi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13752d4819e156c9038ef1e3d2081dfcb9c291a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e13752d4819e156c9038ef1e3d2081dfcb9c291a/0_663_2863_1717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blogger Toshiyuki Kamimura eats 400 Bowls of ramen a year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blogger Toshiyuki Kamimura eats 400 Bowls of ramen a year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Goulding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watching Kamimura review a ramen shop is like watching a detective work a crime scene. He starts with the noren, the cloth awning hanging from a shop’s entrance. “If it’s greasy ramen,” he says, reaching up and rubbing the yellowing drapes with a nod of approval, “it will look like a dirty shirt.”</p> <p>Next, he inhales deeply. Tonkotsu is famed for its fragrance, which, when emanating from the most intense shops, can assault your olfactory system from a three-block radius. It’s a barnyard smell, pure sweaty-foot funk, and it’s everywhere in Fukuoka, a misty aroma that hangs over the city the way fog clings to the hills of San Francisco.</p> <p>After he orders, Kamimura turns his attention to the noodles. Are they cooked in individual baskets for easy timing, or are they dropped coil by coil into an open pot of boiling water? Most cooks go the basket route these days, but Kamimura prefers the purity of a free boil. “I respect the talent it takes to cook it all together – it takes real touch and intuition.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/jun/16/japan-japan\">Ramen noodles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the while, he’s watching for little precursors of quality: the way the ramen cook shakes the water from the noodles after they’re done cooking so as not to dilute the precious broth; the careful hand-slicing of a roll of chashu so that it melts on contact with the hot soup; the judicious layering of negi and nori and other garnishes to elongate the textural juxtaposition.</p> <p>“I work hard to gather all the information necessary to make my judgments. If you don’t poke your head into the kitchen, you never know,” Kamimura says.</p> <p>Our first bowl of ramen arrives. It’s a muscular rendition, the spitting definition of Hakata-style tonkotsu: pale, thin, straight noodles, thick ivory broth, two slices of chashu, and little else in the way of toppings. Sesame seeds, ground white pepper, and electric pink pickled ginger are the holy trinity of table condiments in Fukuoka, but Kamimura isn’t much for accessories. He wastes no time in cracking his wooden chopsticks and breaching the surface, but I wade in more cautiously.</p> <p>Inexperienced eaters will require some practice before they learn to handle the volcanic temperatures of a proper bowl of ramen. Waiting for it to cool, though, will prove an unnerving experience for both you and the chef. The only way forward is to abandon western decorum and embrace the slurp, the calculated introduction of air that cools the noodles upon entry. A ramen shop in full feast mode sounds like a car vacuum suctioned against your front seat.</p> <p>When we finish our bowls – Kamimura in three minutes, me in 12 – beads of sweat have gathered above my brow. I look up, almost surprised and slightly embarrassed to find I’m not alone in the shop.</p> <p>“Next stop,” he says, and we step outside, swallowed by the bright lights of a Fukuoka night, in search of another bowl.</p> <p><strong>The earliest footprints of ramen </strong>in Japan can be found around the turn of the 20th century, as Chinese migrants in areas such as Yokohama, Hakodate and Nagasaki, the first ports opened to the outside world after hundreds of years of isolationism, began selling the soup to construction workers. Back then it was called shina soba, “Chinese noodles”, and was sold mostly from street carts and, oddly enough, western-style restaurants.</p> <p>Whatever it might have been before the war, the events of 1937-45 would put ramen culture on an entirely different trajectory. Strict food rationing meant shina soba all but disappeared during the war. When the atomic dust finally settled, the Americans moved in and began to reshape Japanese eating habits in profound ways.</p> <p>With the country pockmarked by fire bombings and much of the young male population lost to the war, the Japanese became deeply reliant on American supplies as they fought to ward off starvation. Chief among the imports: American wheat and lard, the basis for a bowl of ramen.</p> <p>In his excellent book <em>The Untold History of Ramen</em>, George Solt points out that these two ingredients, along with garlic, became the basis for what the Japanese called “stamina food”, belly-filling staples such as gyoza, okonomiyaki and ramen that became lifelines in the scavenger years following the war. Rice harvests were largely compromised by the war, so American flour became the building block for postwar recovery, and eventually the reindustrialisation of Japan.</p> <p>By the 1960s the workforce turned to ramen for fuel. As Tokyo and Osaka began to rebuild and expand, small ramen shops sprouted across the cityscapes to feed the growing body of construction workers at the heart of Japan’s unprecedented growth.</p> <p>The 1980s marked ramen’s arrival into a whole new social stratosphere. Ramen was no longer a simple staple; it became a craft food, an object of obsession, a means of expression for legions of new cooks. Whereas most Japanese food is bound by tradition and a set of unspoken rules, ramen fans embraced innovation and experimentation.</p> <p>Young cooks took up the profession in droves, brandishing bandannas, self-branded tees, and a swagger that spoke of a new era of Japanese identity.</p> <p>By the time Hideto Kawahara was 20, ramen’s transformation from a humble Chinese noodle soup to a Japanese cultural juggernaut was complete. But it had yet to hit its apex. Hideto’s father was a ramen man; in 1963 in Fukuoka he opened Daruma, a small shop serving a thick, dark bowl of tonkotsu to a loyal local clientele. Ramen was one of the few corners of the culinary world where young cooks and entrepreneurs could make an immediate impact, but by the time he was old enough to cook, Hideto – a competitive breakdancer – was more interested in break beats than pork bones.</p> <p>But Hideto couldn’t dance for ever, so at 28 he gave up the floor spins and waded into the simmering waters of the ramen world. But he didn’t do what sons had been doing for a thousand years in Japan: he didn’t learn from his father. “My father told me he didn’t want me to imitate his ramen. He wanted me to develop my own.”</p> <p>Instead, Hideto spent five years training down the street from his dad’s shop, and then branched off to start his own, which quickly grew into a popular local chain in Fukuoka. By the time he opened in Tokyo’s Asakusa neighbourhood in 2001, he had a camera crew following his every move for a TV documentary and there were three-hour waits for Hideto’s ramen.</p> <p>Today Hideto is ramen royalty, owner of 17 shops across the globe, including New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cambodia. He’s just one part of a faction of Fukuoka-based chains that have together reshaped ramen on a global scale.</p> <p>For the better part of 30 years, sushi was Japan’s primary culinary export. But come the mid-noughties a new taste of Japan found its way to Los Angeles and New York. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/14/david-chang-momofuku-interview\">David Chang</a> and his Momofuku Noodle Bar in New York’s East Village was an early and influential player in the ramen game, but it wasn’t until Fukuoka’s most famous export, Ippudo, opened a few blocks west, on Fourth Avenue, in the winter of 2006 that ramen hit full fever pitch. Now you can find ramen shops in Midwestern malls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are no boundaries for ramen, no rules. It’s all freestyle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Japan represented by sushi is a very different country from the one represented by ramen. The former was a hushed, refined, serious country of fine taste and even finer economic means, but ramen represents a less intimidating, less exotic Japan, one dominated by bright lights, bold flavours and the electric pulse of youth-driven pop culture.</p> <p>Fukuoka, more than any other city in Japan, is responsible for ramen’s rocket-ship trajectory, and the ensuing shift in Japan’s cultural identity abroad. Hide-Chan, Ichiran and Ippudo – three of the biggest ramen chains in the world – have brought the soup to corners of the globe that still thought ramen meant a bag of dried noodles and a dehydrated spice packet. But while Ichiran and Ippudo are purveyors of classic tonkotsu, undoubtedly the defining ramen of the modern era, Hideto has a decidedly different belief about ramen and its mutability.</p> <p>“There are no boundaries for ramen, no rules,” he says. “It’s all freestyle.”</p> <p>As we talk at his original Hide-Chan in the Kego area of Fukuoka, a new bowl arrives on the table, a prototype for his borderless ramen philosophy. A coffee filter is filled with katsuobushi, smoked skipjack tuna flakes, and balanced over a bowl with a pair of chopsticks. Hideto pours chicken stock through the filter, which soaks up the katsuobushi and emerges into the bowl as clear as a consommé. He adds rice noodles and sawtooth coriander then slides it over to me.</p> <p>Compared with other Hide-Chan dishes, though, this one shows remarkable restraint. Other creations include spicy arrabiata ramen with pancetta and roasted tomatoes, foie gras ramen with orange jam and blueberry miso, and black ramen made with bamboo ash dipped into a mix of miso and onions caramelised for 45 days.</p> <p>Suddenly Hideto jumps up from the table and announces that he needs to go. He leaves me with a bowl of industrial-strength tonkotsu – pig heads viciously boiled in 60-litre iron vats for 48 hours – and a rundown of his itinerary for the next week: first to Singapore, then to Phnom Penh for the opening of his first Cambodian shop, then to New York to roll out a new line of dry ramen dishes, back to Hong Kong to scout new locations, then home to Fukuoka for 36 hours before repeating the loop. The world, he says, is hungry for ramen.</p> <p><strong>Kamimura has been whispering all </strong>week of a sacred 24-hour ramen spot located on a two-lane highway in Kurume, 25 miles south of Fukuoka, where truckers go for the taste of true ramen. The shop is massive by ramen standards, big enough to fit a few trucks along with those drivers, and in the mid-afternoon a loose assortment of castaways and road warriors sit slurping their noodles. Near the entrance a thick, sweaty cauldron boils so aggressively that a haze of pork fat hangs over the kitchen like waterfall mist.</p> <p>While few are audacious enough to claim ramen is healthy, tonkotsu enthusiasts love to point out that the collagen in pork bones is great for the skin. “Look at their faces!” says Kamimura. “They’re almost 70 years old and not a wrinkle! That’s the collagen. Where there is tonkotsu, there is rarely a wrinkle.”</p> <p>He’s right: the woman wears a faded purple bandanna and sad, sunken eyes, but even then she doesn’t look a day over fifty. She’s stirring a massive metal cauldron of broth, and I ask her how long it’s been simmering for.</p> <p>“Sixty years,” she says flatly.</p> <p>This isn’t hyperbole, not exactly. Kurume treats tonkotsu like a French country baker treats a sourdough starter – feeding it, regenerating, keeping some small fraction of the original soup alive in perpetuity. Old bones out, new bones in, but the base never changes. The mother of all ramen.</p> <p>Maruboshi Ramen opened in 1958, and you can taste every one of those years in the simple bowl they serve. There is no fancy tare, no double broth, no secret spice or unexpected toppings: just pork bones, noodles, and three generations of constant simmering.</p> <p>The flavour is pig in its purest form, a milky white broth with no aromatics or condiments to mitigate the purity of its porcine essence. Up until now, Kamimura has worked his way through bowls of ramen with the methodical persistence of a librarian cataloguing books, but something in him changes with the first slurp of Maruboshi’s bowl. His eyes light up, he wiggles his shoulders, and a childish smile breaks out across his face. “What do you think? What do you think?”</p> <p>For Kamimura, it’s not just a strength thing – it’s a soul thing. It takes time to draw out the soul of ramen – some say hours; others, like Kamimura, say lifetimes.</p> <p>When the owners spot Kamimura, they hurry over to our booth, offering paper cups of coffee to go with our mystic soup. Kamimura mentions that he’s been reviewing more instant ramen than ever lately, and the woman disappears and comes back with a cardboard box stacked with 16 individual packets of Maruboshi’s take-home product. But his attention isn’t with the owners or the packaged noodles or the steaming cups of coffee. No, it’s aimed squarely at me. He catches my eyes, looks down at my unfinished bowl, then back up at me.</p> <p>I know what he wants, and after 28 bowls over the course of five days, I’m more than happy to give it to him, but first, he needs to ask.</p> <p>“You going to finish that?” </p> <p><em>Extracted from Rice, Noodle, Fish by Matt Goulding (Hardie Grant Books, £16.99). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/374663/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Click here </a>to order a copy for £12.99 from the Guardian Bookshop</em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <h2><br /></h2>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gj3v","wordcount":"3390","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8036b17f70e77bf4de10736b227c44989f65d62f/0_419_4213_2528/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-25T08:00:55Z","standfirst":"<p>How did a bowl of noodle soup imported from China come to define Japanese food culture?

invention","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In the early 1980s Grayson Perry couldn’t afford studio space as a student in Portsmouth, or subsequently at the London squats he lived in, so most of his coming of age as an artist is contained in his sketchbooks. Some of those densely worked pages are reproduced in this volume; mostly collage fantasies in which the artist explores the ongoing internal drama of his gender and sexuality. The tone of the sketches derives, he says, from the scrapbooks his grandmother had once given him, which he filled with pictures of motorbikes and commandos and fighter planes (Perry’s plan as a boy was to join the army). By his late teens, after he started dressing up in women’s clothes for nights out in Essex – and became estranged from his fractured family as a result – that plan had changed and the obsessive mapping out of new possibilities began.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In one image the artist and a Diana figure appear to be praying for salvation together in a wintry graveyard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some of the pictures, perverse self-portraits lunge towards cutouts of suburban women in court shoes and buttoned-up tweed coats, the shape of things to come. Perry’s ideas of art, of what he might be capable of, dwelled pointedly in the space between male and female stereotypes, a battle-scarred no man’s land in some imaginings and a dressing-up box in others. Hollow-eyed voyeurs stare across this space, transfixed at catalogue images of flirty women in party dresses. A row of models from a hair salon, beneath a crucified pin-up in a pleated skirt, invests the mystery of shampoo and sets with unattainable desire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38eeea8e1ae95386080dfb43d132d45859eda113\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/38eeea8e1ae95386080dfb43d132d45859eda113/319_228_4666_3263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"grayson perry sketchbooks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Understanding something does not stop it being pretty.

Thatcher giving a stiff-armed salute is pasted alongside one of the artist’s devil-horned dominatrix doodles (you can see whispers of the iron lady too in a blonde Cerne Abbas giant, brandishing her cartoon erection). Meanwhile, shy debutante figures peering out from under fringes are always just a step away from self-flagellation and martyrdom (in one image the artist and a Diana figure appear to be praying for salvation together in a wintry graveyard). Handbags proliferate, the source of mysterious, private power. The great mischievous project of the artist’s own transformation seems at stake, or at least at play in these pictures, always trying on identities for size in a range somewhere between wolfish biker and Little Bo Peep. Claire, his eventual, triumphant, Turner prize-winning alter ego, is in gestation but not quite yet born.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perry has become a pin-sharp observer of class divisions and territories, a cross-dressing Hogarth of the suburbs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perry says by way of introduction that it took him 20 years to begin to “perfect the ceramic equivalent of these sketchbook images” but after he set up his first pottery studio in 1986, the sketchbooks abruptly become drawing boards for vases rather than hyper-detailed excursions into his subconscious. Surfaces are sketched out with detailed written instructions; a swan-necked pot gets this note for example: “inlaid landscape backdrop; lonely wankers; white masturbating figures in moonlight” or a sketch of a classical urn has these twin labels: “Madness, dysfunction, sex mad! <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/17/grayson-perry-tomb-craftsman-museum\" title=\"\">Alan Measles</a> fighting the forces of Cultural Crassness” (Measles, you will remember, is Perry’s childhood teddy bear hero). Eventually, in some cases, the notes become the decoration itself – so, in the pot called <em>Dealing With Self-Conscious, Picasso Napkin Syndrome</em>, the annotation pre-empts critical reaction: “Seemingly effortless”; “Vitality in visual form”; “desperately individual”; “shit”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3292b434fe880e005a246639f2de4ce0f5d423c4\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3292b434fe880e005a246639f2de4ce0f5d423c4/268_191_4703_3304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"agony in the car park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ritual energy and art-school echoes: a preliminary sketch for The Agony in the Car Park from the series The Vanity of Small Differences.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Particular Books, 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Perry has received some of this recognition, the sketchbooks are also a refuge from the hard public grind of being an artist. Some of the pages are filled with fashion designs for clothes and accessories that he eventually commissioned, elaborate tapestry frocks and heart-shaped codpieces and snazzy crash helmets; Claire looking vaguely uncomfortable but doing her best in painted clogs and bodices. Perry says that his interest in sketching was reignited when he started to draw with his daughter, who was born in 1992. They would invent the same kind of private worlds together that had once occupied the artist’s own childhood hours, inventing characters, colouring in their house, car, holidays. One of these drawings later evolved into Perry’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/10/grayson-perry-a-house-for-essex-stonking-shrine\" title=\"\"><em>A House for Essex</em></a>, the estranging roadside shrine of a building, part Hansel and Gretel cottage, part Matisse chapel, which he eventually built with architect Charles Holland.</p> <p>Perry has become a pin-sharp observer of contemporary class divisions and territories, a cross-dressing Hogarth of the suburbs. The felt pen-and-ink drawings for the series of tapestries called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/08/grayson-perry-tapestries-class-taste\" title=\"\"><em>The Vanity of Small Differences</em></a> have a ritual energy full of art-school echoes that his notes make clear – “abandoned shoes ref to marriage of Arnolfini” he will write, in a tableau that became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/06/hogarth-rakes-progress-david-hockney-grayson-perry\" title=\"\"><em>The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal</em></a>; or “protest camp in Brueghel-ish style” in <a href=\"http://graysonperrytr.com/the-agony-in-the-car-park/\" title=\"\"><em>The Agony in the Car Park</em></a>.</p> <p>He is a proud Royal Academician, though of course he pokes fun at the very idea; he raises funds for the institution’s free art school with etchings and pots that aim to get their retaliation in first. <a href=\"https://shop.royalacademy.org.uk/artsales/the-island-of-bad-art.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Island of Bad Art</em></a> is one of the former, an imaginary sketch-map of all those neighbourhoods that can so easily trap the unwary artist – “sixth-form politics”, “lack of commitment”, “corny, retro”, “Po-faced”, “fey bollocks”, “resting on laurels” “fear of getting it wrong”. This book is Perry’s very own, lifelong rough guide to successfully avoiding them.</p> <p><em>Sketchbooks is published by Particular Books (£40). </em><a

One might wonder, upon hearing this saying, what it means for a city to spoil, to go bad, as would a fruit capable of decomposition.<br /></p> <p>Lagos was unspoiled in my eyes as a child. Although it was only a four-hour drive from Akure, where I was born and lived well into my teenage years, I never visited the city until I was 18. Lagos held a grand stature, evoked by the people who had visited or lived there. To the rest of us, Lagos was Europe within Nigeria. The children who came from Lagos were “tush” – well put together – and usually more enlightened, exposed to a better life, than those of us who lived on the outside of the city. It had the tendency to render everywhere else provincial. My uncle who lived and worked in Lagos was considered the grand person of the family, the one to whom we looked for many good things. For a very long time, I hoped fervently that he would take us to Lagos on a holiday. But it didn’t happen until 2004, when I had a gap year before college. </p> <p>One thing that spoils Lagos, at least in the eyes of non-Lagosians, is crime. On my visit with my uncle, the city was roughly what I had been led to expect. Its streets were congested. People navigated through the tight roads in huge numbers. My uncle picked me up from a “garage,” a dirty commercial transport park, and warned me to keep keen vigilance, <em>anya saa</em>. I had heard the warning many times before: in Lagos, anything could be stolen – even a human being. My father used to tell the story of a friend he knew in the 1970s who drove a new car to a party. By the time he came out of the party hall, all four wheels were gone. Another frequent story was that you could keep your wallet in the inside pocket of your coat and someone would still manage to steal it. Whether by magic, or by trickery, I did not know. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At6zO21Cjog\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/At6zO21Cjog?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Lagos in the 1960s</figcaption> </figure>   <p>My uncle and I walked for close to a mile on foot, crossing dangerous roads, stopping occasionally to buy bread, bananas and groundnuts off street hawkers, their trays balanced on their shoulders or heads. We arrived at a junction, where a few <em>molue</em> buses were parked, their drivers and assistants calling for “Isolo!” We hopped on one. My uncle, then a bank accountant, had come to pick me up straight from his office; in his suit and glasses, he must have reeked of opulence. Throughout the bus journey he kept an eye on me. It was jerky and rocky, through dense traffic and deficient roads. By the time we got out, both of us were soaked in sweat, and I was delighted to be able to breathe again, having almost suffocated on the bus. Suddenly, my uncle put his hand into his pocket and shouted. We looked back at the bus, but the assistant had mounted the door, banged it with his hand and shouted as it sped away. The wallet was gone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They still come, pulled by the myth that opportunities still exist in abundance in Lagos</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As is often the case with things of great value and historical significance, there is a constant, hovering fear among those who love Lagos that something external, some negative force, people or events, will destroy it. And Lagos has indeed seen much that could have led to its destruction. The first European visitors to the port of Badagry, perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, were the Portuguese in 1472, followed by a coterie of foreigners – including its future colonists, the British. The port gradually expanded, and became an easy transit port for the heinous transatlantic slave trade. Before the British arrived and chose Lagos as their imperial capital, the city saw wars and battles, kings dethroned and forced into suicide. Yet none of these wars spoiled or destroyed the city. In fact, they fed it, like beasts fattened on steroids. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"82d4bc204975eb328c0b1a6b48ec6d3d398b6aa8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/82d4bc204975eb328c0b1a6b48ec6d3d398b6aa8/0_60_5200_3357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lagos street scene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People from around Nigeria flock to Lagos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the trampling of traditional African culture under the elephantine foot of the British empire should have tainted Lagos, it transformed it instead into a western-like city in the heart of Africa. When the colonists finally left in October 1960, Lagos became the new nation’s capital and from Dodan Barracks, now a mostly dilapidated structure, coup after coup was plotted and squashed, military juntas unseated and enthroned. But none of them, no matter how violent, spoiled the city.</p> <p>People from all around the country flocked to it, attracted by the promise of white-collar jobs in the colonial period, and of growing industrialisation and civil service in the years before the civil war. They still come, pulled by the myth that these opportunities still exist in abundance in Lagos in the new millennium. Lagos has swelled, gulped up surrounding cities, and even encroached, menacingly, into bordering states. The tide does not seem to abate. The Populations Reference Bureau predicts Lagos will double in size in the next 15 years. These new arrivals live in the lowest parts of the sprawling city, in places such as Ajegunle or Makoko, on less than a dollar a day. Overpopulation is what people expect will spoil the city now. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b68df1f41a78f836a47bf5849f1be3d16fdf49e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0b68df1f41a78f836a47bf5849f1be3d16fdf49e/0_82_1227_786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Design concept for Eko Atlantic, Lagos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eko Atlantic – Nigeria’s ‘Manhattan’ – is under construction on land reclaimed from the ocean</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years, Lagos’s notoriety stemmed from the <em>agberos</em>, the “area boys”. They live on the streets and act as arbitrary law-enforcement officers, robbers, teachers, traffic controllers, and just about anything they can – but, above all, as coercive tax-masters who impose illegal tariffs on the helpless, particularly small roadside businesses. These extortionists, too, could have spoiled Lagos. </p> <p>But when I returned after a time away in 2010, the <em>agberos</em> were gone. I was shocked to see Oshodi bridge, and the Isolo and Bariga areas where they used to congregate, empty of them. Former governor Babatunde Fashola, who ran as the man who’d keep Èkó from going bad, had lived up to his billing. He’d even tried to fix the legendary congested traffic by introducing BRT buses, carving out separate lanes for them in the tight roadways.<br /></p> <p>The more pleasant portions of my first experience of Lagos – the sightseeing trips to the national theatre, the former national stadium at Surulere, the drive over the Third Mainland Bridge, which, my uncle told me delightedly, was the longest bridge in Africa – merely added to its stock. I realised I was experiencing a city that had no equal in Nigeria. It was expansive, noisy and effulgent. I loved its cosmopolitan attribute, its fast life and its complex beauty. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/feb/22/lagos-blackouts-how-residents-cope-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gqky\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2460207\"            data-video-name=\"'We iron at the office': the ingenious ways Lagos copes with blackouts – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/19/1455902208627/KP_1804978_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56c74e0ee4b041c56e71d15f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/19/1455902208627/KP_1804978_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/19/160219GuardianCitiesLagosPowerCuts_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/19/160219GuardianCitiesLagosPowerCuts.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/19/160219GuardianCitiesLagosPowerCuts_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/19/160219GuardianCitiesLagosPowerCuts_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/19/160219GuardianCitiesLagosPowerCuts_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/feb/22/lagos-blackouts-how-residents-cope-video\">‘We iron at the office’: the ingenious ways Lagos copes with blackouts</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even greater infrastructure is now springing up, including a light-rail project that was meant to start running in 2011 but has been mired in delays. The massive structures on which these trains would run crisscross the city, prominently along the greater Oshodi area. Other promised graces for the Lagos skyline include the extraordinarily ambitious <a href=\"http://www.ekoatlantic.com/\">Eko Atlantic project</a>, dubbed Nigeria’s version of Manhattan.<br /></p> <p>While these projects aim to keep Lagos from going bad, the outlook remains dim. Lagos does not exist in isolation. It sits in a country that has wasted many decades of wealth and now – in the age of the oil market crash – has become poor. Nigeria no longer has enough income to run as it always has. Many of the city’s projects may never be finished. </p> <p>But while their stagnation (or abortion) may not spoil the city, what could do so is the deterioration of existing social structures due to lack of funds, and the harsh living conditions of the bulk of the city’s millions of inhabitants, which could decline still further as the city adds hundreds of thousands of people every year. </p> <p>As our future decays, cockroaches, ants and moths – the dark insects produced by such conditions – will thrive. The gaping holes on the roadways, the <em>agberos</em>, the congested traffic, the festering slums, the suffering – all could worsen. And it is these things, if something is not done to urgently change the course Nigeria is currently steering, that will spoil our beautiful, great yet fragile Èkó.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/the-fishermen-chigozie-obioma-review\">The Fishermen by Chigozie Obioma</a> is published in paperback by ONE (an imprint of Pushkin Press) on 10 March</em><br /></p> <p><em>How is your Lagos changing?

Firecrackers are going off, bricks thrown, cars torched, automatic guns fired in the air. An Englishman in a blue shirt walks through it all, ducking and weaving a little, but not scared, more thrilled; he has seen worse, in Iraq when he was a soldier there. Where is he going? To work, at the Nefertiti hotel, where he is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03g14d5\"><strong>The Night Manager</strong></a> (BBC1, Sunday).</p> <p>Tom Hiddleston is a perfect Jonathan Pine – polite, calm, charming, confident but self-deprecating, a little mysterious, very English and astonishingly handsome (in many ways, he reminds me a bit of myself). A beautiful woman called Sophie Aleka flashes her secret documents at him, about her wicked boyfriend Freddie Hamid buying an arsenal of weapons from an even wickeder man – “the worst man in the world”, she calls him – named Richard Roper, in order to crush the popular uprising.</p> <p>Jonathan does the decent thing – did I mention he was decent? – and shows the documents to his chum at the British embassy. Then he takes Sophie to a safe house out of town. “Why do you sit so far away?” she purrs. Out of respect, he says. “Is that why you came all the way here, to respect me?” I don’t think so. She tells him he has many different voices, he’s always changing. Anyway, “I want one of your many selves to sleep with me tonight, you can choose which one,” she says. He does, decently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/12/bbcs-20m-spy-thriller-le-carre-adaptation\">BBC's new £20m spy thriller 'the most radical ever' Le Carré adaptation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is it all getting a bit Milk Tray ad, circa 1973? Or Fry’s Turkish Delight maybe, because of Sophie, full of eastern promise? No, because Sophie is then murdered. And we pop back to Blighty, where no-nonsense Angela Burr, head of a mysterious intelligence agency that operates separately and seemingly at odds with MI6 and has an ongoing vendetta against Roper, brings things back to earth and England, with a bump. Literally later, she’s pregnant (because Olivia Colman who plays her is). That couldn’t have happened in John le Carré’s original; his Burr is a he; Leonard.</p> <p>The alterations and updates are skilfully and almost invisibly tailored by David Farr, who has adapted the novel. Burr’s sex change; the Arab spring (which fits so perfectly with Cairo, I’m sure Le Carré would have done the same had the Arab spring happened by 1993 when his book was published), Pine’s previous tours of Iraq instead of Northern Ireland; the switch from Zurich up the road to Zermatt. Zermatt’s better on the screen – prettier, a bit more Bond.</p> <p>Yes, it has all been nudged about 10% – 007% perhaps – in that direction. (That Farr was a Spooks writer isn’t surprising). But Le Carré can get knotted en-route from page to screen (certainly this television long form suits him); I’m not complaining about any loosening going on, sexing-up of documents or anything else. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/john-le-carre-the-night-manager-television-adaptation\">Nor was Le Carré - complaining - in the Guardian on Saturday.</a> It gets really fun in the Alps, four years on. Pine now works at the rather lovely Meisters hotel, where guess who is helicoptering in with his entourage for a visit – Richard Roper, the worst man in the world, remember. Hugh Laurie is the best worst man, a splendid villain, bullish and bullying, not overdone though, just right. Tom Hollander is on fabulousness, as Roper’s camp fixer. Roper’s beautiful American missus, Jed, stretches a bubbly leg out of the freestanding bath, demanding more champagne. Not enough naked wet Jed for the night? Here she is again, having a late-night skinny dip in the pool.</p> <p>Time for Pine to snap into action, show what he’s got under that understated posh English charm. Show her? No … yes … not yet. But he hasn’t forgotten Cairo; he must avenge Sophie’s death. He takes out the book (the Letters of TE Lawrence, of course, it might have been Kipling) where he put Angela Burr’s number and gives her a call. She heads out, to recruit him.</p> <p>No need to recruit me, I’m already thoroughly signed up for the duration. Sunday night War and Peace void filled. Splendidly.</p> <p>Next, briefly, a handsome blond English former soldier in a blue shirt strides confidently along a bustling street in a hot Muslim country … hang on, haven’t we done this? Not Cairo, but Lahore in Pakistan, and not The Night Manager but <strong>Kipling’s Indian Adventure</strong> (BBC2, Saturday). Patrick Hennessey totally is the real Jonathan Pine but with a different mission: to repair the damage done to the reputation of his literary hero, Rudyard Kipling. Not an apologist for the ills of the empire, says Hennessey, but a man who mocked it mercilessly and had a deep understanding of (what was then all) India, its people and culture. Plus, he wrote exceedingly good stories.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gqkg","wordcount":"815","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/fa70d6ebc6c9b638cc19f8a4fa96b3367bddf27b/0_61_3220_1931/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-25T07:00:53Z","standfirst":"The spy writer’s 1993 novel has been updated and sexed up – I’m not complaining"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/22/the-night-manager-review-bbc-le-carre","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/22/the-night-manager-review-bbc-le-carre","sectionName":"Television & radio","elements":[{"id":"fa70d6ebc6c9b638cc19f8a4fa96b3367bddf27b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/fa70d6ebc6c9b638cc19f8a4fa96b3367bddf27b/0_61_3220_1931/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"WARNING: Use of this copyright image is subject to the terms of use of BBC Pictures' Digital Picture Service (BBC Pictures) as set out at www.bbcpictures.co.uk.

As I’ve written already, this list is a personal inventory of some core texts, the books that I believe shaped our imagination and “made us who we are”. <em>Birthday Letters</em> fits that template, surviving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/09/ted-hughes-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">Ted Hughes</a> as a work of outrageous audacity, astonishing rhetorical and lyrical fervour, mixed with heartbreaking candour. In short, it is a landmark in English poetry.</p> <p>In any age, the story of Ted (Hughes) and Sylvia (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/22/syvia-plath-50-years-bitter-arguments\" title=\"\">Plath</a>) would be a chapter torn from the playbook of romantic tragedy. Furthermore, in the Anglo-American literary tradition, the marriage of two great contemporary poets from opposite sides of the Atlantic must be a source of endless fascination. At first, the double helix of love and work inspired some remarkable poems, but add the early suicide of one, and the lifelong torment of the other, and you have the makings of a myth. When, in the late summer of 1997, Hughes walked into the offices of his publisher, Faber &amp; Faber, with the manuscript of 88 poems addressed to his dead wife, he was chiselling the synopsis of a stupendous private drama high into the north face of Parnassus. <em>Birthday Letters</em>, the manuscript in question, published in 1998, became the most sensational new collection of poems in living memory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hughes was tormented by the vociferous fans of Plath who wanted to hold him to account for her suicide in 1963</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The collision of art and love, the tectonic plates of any writer’s career, creativity mingling with everyday life, must be the San Andreas fault of literature. When the two writers involved happen to be great contemporary poets, artistic equals, the material that explodes from the depths is bound to be incandescent, exhilarating, unearthly and passionate. For Hughes, addressing Plath inevitably had its mythologising dimension. He writes:</p> <p>The dreamer in her<br />Had fallen in love with me and she did not know it.<br />That moment the dreamer in me<br />Fell in love with her and I knew it.</p> <p>A 1998 letter to his friend and fellow poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/may/16/featuresreview.review2\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a>, describes the backstory. From the 1970s, Hughes says that he began to address his “letters to Sylvia”, exploring every aspect of their relationship. At first, Hughes reports, he wrote them on the hoof, informally; later, he tried to work at them in a more controlled way but found that he was unable. He went back to spontaneous forays: some of these <em>Birthday Letters</em> poems first appeared in his <em>New Selected Poems </em>(1995), but in correspondence with friends, he would admit that he found some of the other poems in the series too personal to publish. <em>Birthday Letters</em>, written over a period of more than 25 years, was Hughes’s own great reckoning – although it would turn out to be incomplete.</p> <p>When <em>Birthday Letters</em> finally appeared, Hughes cast his extraordinary spell, and not for the first time, over an audience which, for two generations, had been brought up on <em>The Hawk in the Rain</em>, <em>Crow</em> and <em>The Rattle Bag</em>, as well as on the tale of Ted and Sylvia, one of the love stories of the 20th century. The book became an instant bestseller and prizewinner.</p> <p>There are many ironies in play with <em>Birthday Letters</em>. First, there is the unquenchable afterlife of a tragic relationship with which Hughes himself spent half a lifetime grappling. Throughout his career, Hughes was tormented by the vociferous fans of Plath who wanted to hold him to account for Plath’s suicide in the winter of 1963, and also for the way in which he administered the posthumous publication of her oeuvre. In death, as in life, Sylvia troubled him still.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"648c45ebef88f2edc98ae402fdb14ca82f76b59b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/648c45ebef88f2edc98ae402fdb14ca82f76b59b/0_410_1370_1690/811.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes on honeymoon in Paris\" width=\"811\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes on honeymoon in Paris... in any age, their story ‘would be a chapter torn from the playbook of romantic tragedy’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Birthday Letters</em> became a painful, at times self-lacerating, tribute to the radioactive power of that legacy, as well as a monument that inexorably reminded readers of Hughes’s contemporary status. It was also a career-defining volume. Now, approaching 20 years after his death, Hughes the poet, so often teased and parodied in his lifetime, is emerging as one of the towering literary figures of the past century, to be spoken of in the same breath as Eliot, Yeats, Auden and Larkin. As the <em>Observer</em> put it recently, “he has become the once and future king of the English literary imagination”.</p> <p>With <em>Birthday Letters</em>, Hughes also winds Sylvia inextricably into his own literary afterlife. Perhaps she would not have been disappointed. Plath was a mesmerising and tormented figure, who was only too willing to play her part in any drama. “She wrote her early poems very slowly,” Hughes once said of their early days together in the 1950s. It was, he said, “as if she were working out a mathematical problem, chewing her lips, putting a thick dark ring of ink round each word that stirred her on the page of the thesaurus”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/11/ted-hughes-the-unauthorised-life-review-jonathan-bate-sylvia-plath-carol-orchard-assia-wevill\">Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life review – a man smouldering with life</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Birthday Letters</em> (together with Plath’s letters and diaries) describes a now familiar tale. If her beginnings were slow and desk-bound, Plath was soon soaring beyond her lover’s reach. But it was a fatal trajectory. Theirs was a tragic match and the relationship turned sour. By 1963 the instability that had dogged Plath’s whole life was becoming painfully dominant. The question that feminist critics have endlessly debated is: was she so obsessed with her dead father that her suicide was almost predetermined, or did Hughes’s behaviour, particularly his decision to leave her for another woman after six years of marriage, push her to the edge?</p> <p>Who will ever know? In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/11/ted-hughes-last-letter-sylvia-plath\" title=\"\">Last Letter</a>, a poem with the traumatic line “Your wife is dead”, released by the poet’s estate after his death, Hughes himself gets sucked into that vortex, declaring that the explanation for suicide is “as unknown as if it never happened”. So Plath’s tragic death remains a mystery that has already inspired one masterpiece (<em>The Savage God</em> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/04/poetry.highereducation\" title=\"\">Al Alvarez</a>, the <em>Observer</em>’s former poetry editor) and numberless words of exegesis.</p> <p>Hughes himself went to ground, living in Devon, writing about nature and keeping his counsel. It did not do him much good. “My silence seems to confirm every accusation and fantasy,” he once wrote. With Promethean stoicism, he held his ground. “I preferred [silence], on the whole, to allowing myself to be dragged out into the bullring and teased and pricked and goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life with Sylvia.”</p> <p>But he was still wounded. I remember once awkwardly broaching the Sylvia question with him, after several glasses of wine, and being touched and amazed at the flood of loving recollection released by a simple – and tactless – inquiry. He was, in his prime, as compelling a figure as Plath: an unforgettable physical presence with fathomless reserves of feeling and humanity, and a gentle Yorkshire voice that seemed to remake every sentence it uttered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Carol Hughes has tried to do her best by her husband’s work. She always knew about the last letter, and what it revealed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Birthday Letters </em>was also an attempt by Hughes to nail shut a Pandora’s box of prurient, often vicious, speculation. It’s easy to forget the vehemence of the opposition. The poet’s readings were sometimes interrupted by cries of “murderer”; the American feminist poet <a href=\"http://www.robinmorgan.net/book/monster/\" title=\"\">Robin Morgan</a> published <em>The Arraignment</em> which began with the lines “I accuse/Ted Hughes...”</p> <p>Having explored the passage of Plath’s short life, Hughes stopped short of revealing the circumstances of the suicide itself, about which there had been endless gossip. He had been wrestling with that lost weekend in the frozen midwinter of 1963, especially the horrifying, almost macabre, detail that Plath had reassuringly burned her suicide note, which had reached Hughes prematurely, in front of him. He distilled the horror of this moment into repeated drafts of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/10/ted-hughes-last-letter-sylvia-plath\" title=\"\"> Last Letter</a> in a “blue school-style exercise book” that contained versions of several other poems that also appear in <em>Birthday Letters</em>. The only person who knew of this poem’s existence, because Hughes had given her a typed fair copy of it, was the poet’s widow, Carol.</p> <p>This is where a concluding and redemptive chapter in this story begins. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/14/ted-hughess-widow-criticises-offensive-biography\" title=\"\">Carol Hughes</a>, with impressive dignity, has chosen never to speak publicly about her husband. For any literary estate, the question of what it is right to publish is always fraught. The second <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/15/biography.thomashardy\" title=\"\">Mrs Hardy</a> burned her husband’s correspondence with her predecessor, enraging generations of scholars. Hughes himself had been criticised for his destruction of Plath’s last journal. Carol Hughes, however, has always tried to do her best by her husband’s work. She had always known about this “last letter”, and what it revealed. Biding her time, she chose the right moment to release it, in the pages of the <em>New Statesman</em>. On publication, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/27/carol-ann-duffy-poet-laureate-interview\" title=\"\">Carol Ann Duffy</a>, the poet laureate, observed that this last poem, the coda to <em>Birthday Letters</em>, is “a bit like looking into the sun as it’s dying. It seems to touch a deeper, darker place than any poem he’s ever written.” Time will tell if Sylvia Plath’s spirit has finally been laid to rest. <em>Birthday Letters</em> has already become part of the canon.</p> <h2>A signature line</h2> <p>That blue suit,<br />A mad, execution uniform,<br />Survived your sentence.

Aborigines rounded up and shot, babies buried into the sand and decapitated, women raped, men killed as they hid in the forks of trees, waterholes poisoned, flour laced with arsenic. The Australian dream abandoned us to rot on government missions, tore apart families, condemned us to poverty. There was no place for us in this modern country and everything we have won has come from dissent, it has been torn from the reluctant grasp of a nation that for much of its history hoped that we would disappear.</p> <p>We know this history, my people. This is a living thing. We touch it and we wear it. It is written in the scars on the bodies of men like my father. It is carried deep within us, mental wounds that cannot heal. It is so close we can touch it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd1f8551b1e08a2d782c1953b30e45f1ba34320e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cd1f8551b1e08a2d782c1953b30e45f1ba34320e/0_0_3504_2289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engraving by Rennoldson of Captain Cook’s ship Endeavour laid on the shoreline of New Holland, now Queensland, in Australia. ‘There were people standing on the shore as Cook weighed anchor.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engraving by Rennoldson of Captain Cook’s ship Endeavour laid on the shoreline of New Holland – now Queensland. ‘There were people standing on the shore as Cook weighed anchor.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science &amp; Society Picture Librar/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was a baby my grandfather held me in his arms; he was the son of a man born on to the frontier before the collection of colonies even became Australia. A frontier marked with violence, disease and death. From me to my grandfather to his father: that’s how close it is.</p> <p>Being good and great does not absolve you from a terrible sin and a pain inflicted on a people who did nothing to deserve it. Remember that: the first people of this land who have suffered for your greatness did nothing to deserve it. A truly great country – if we truly believe that – should be held to great account.<br /></p> <p>Watching my son sleep, hearing his steady breathing as we move through our land, calms me. I could be alone forever in these moments, surrounded by my country and with the boy whose bloodline through me stretches back an eternity. We are together in our place and I am aware that it may seem as if I have defied history. But we never do: do we?<br /></p> <h2>Erased from history</h2> <p>I was born into what the anthropologist WEH Stanner called the “great Australian silence”. It was the period of forgetting. The myths we created fed Australia’s lie: that no blood had stained the wattle. We were told a story of peace and bravery and the conquest of a continent. This was the inevitable push into the interior, a land opening up before the explorers. It was empty; tamed and claimed.<br /></p> <p>These were the myths of my childhood, the myths of my education. In this telling, Australia was discovered by Captain James Cook. The Endeavour was a ship of destiny that led to the first fleet. On 13 May 1787, 11 ships set sail with a cargo of prisoners to found a penal colony in New South Wales – but the true first fleet landed here 60,000 years earlier. I was told that Lawson, Blaxland and Wentworth were the first people to cross the Blue Mountains.</p> <p>There were people standing on the shore as Cook weighed anchor. Smoke from campfires trailed the white men who trekked over the great mountains west of Sydney; black people watched these people who appeared like ghosts. But that story wasn’t told in my classroom. The lesson I learned was that we didn’t matter. In fact we didn’t even exist.</p> <p>I was young when I began to question all of this. Even through the eyes of a boy the glory of Australia did not match with the reality of our lives. Something was rotten here. Each morning at school I would stand in line to recite the pledge: I honour my God, I serve my Queen, I salute the flag. And then, in the evening I would return home to where this flag had deposited us. Home was wherever we could find it. It was a home on the margins, outside of town, outside looking in.</p> <p>Here, was my place, among the detritus of the frontier: the huddled remnants of the hundreds of nations who formed here as the continent formed around them. Two thousand generations of civilisation and culture, all of it now smashed against the reality of white settlement, a people whose land was taken because the people themselves were not legally here.</p> <p>School told me we faded from the frontier. The dying pillow was smoothed to soften our inevitable extinction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bdc8ab68da4953099ba0a495c7ff7ec398fc44c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7bdc8ab68da4953099ba0a495c7ff7ec398fc44c/0_0_1024_747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Grant with his class at school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Grant with his class at school in 1971 (middle row, second from right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It need not have been this way. The birth of Australia was meant to be so different. For a brief moment there was hope. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/10/arthur-phillip-memorial-stone-unveiled-westminster-abbey\">Captain Arthur Phillip</a> founded a penal colony with instructions from the crown to protect the lives and livelihoods of Aboriginal people and forge friendly relations with the natives. There were reports of black and white people dancing together with joy in the early days of the settlement. The local people began teaching their language to the newcomers. Here’s what we could have been. In this moment there was a glimpse of a better Australia, and we failed.</p> <p>Within a matter of years violence had broken out on both sides and Phillip would now instruct raiding parties to bring back the severed heads of the local warriors. Within a generation the heads of Aborigines were shipped back to Britain in glass cases, to be studied as relics of a doomed race.</p> <p>Enlightened people throughout the world were wrestling with ideas of humanity and civilisation. The notion that all men are created equal was alive in the world. The “immortal declaration” – as it was known – had been penned by Thomas Jefferson at the birth of America’s independence a decade before the first fleet arrived on these shores.</p> <p>Yet, such lofty ideals had no place here. Not for us. We were dismissed as brutes. We were deemed to be the living example of what the 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes meant when he spoke of the natural state as being “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”.</p> <p> At best to some we were the “noble savage”. We belonged to those so-called primitive people uncorrupted by civilisation. Yet such relics were seen to have no place in a modern world. The great writer of his age, Charles Dickens, spoke for many when he described such peoples as cruel, bloodthirsty and murderous. In Dickens’ words we were whistling, clucking, tearing savages that he wished civilised off the face of the earth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/closing-the-political-gap-listen-to-us-engage-with-us-empower-us\">Closing the political gap: listen to us, engage with us, empower us | Stan Grant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charles Darwin – the father of the theory of evolution – visited Australia and despaired at the impact of colonisation. There was some “mysterious agency”, he said, that meant that “wherever the European has trod, death seems to pursue the aboriginal [sic]”. There was of course nothing mysterious at all in the theft of land and the disease and violence that followed. Yet to Darwin – as sad as our passing may be – this was unavoidable, inevitable. His theories were born out of a belief in our common humanity but his name was linked to a popular acceptance of a hierarchy of races where the stronger trumps the weaker: “social Darwinism”.</p> <p>How easy it can be in the sweep of history to stop seeing the individual lives. These were my ancestors they were speaking of, my great-great-grandparents. Such views formed a powerful logic that was unshakable. It provided the moral blindfold through which people could no longer even see the atrocities perpetrated on my people. Even those people, whose eyes were opened to this suffering, accepted that our fate was doomed.</p> <p>My ancestors were driven to the brink of extinction. We survived – the half-white remnants of the first nations herded on to Christian missions. We were told this would save us from the brutality of the frontier. But we often lived like inmates, roped and tied if we dared escape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1bbb56608aafde46156065f10c9ab38d66eb199\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a1bbb56608aafde46156065f10c9ab38d66eb199/0_0_1014_652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Grant’s grandfather Cecil Grant (middle row, fourth from right) with fellow troops in Tobruk, Egypt, during the second world war.

I would cringe against the black-and-white ethnographic films: the snot-smeared faces of the little “piccaninnies”, the flyblown women grinding seed into flour, the bedraggled, bearded men gripping a spear, one leg resting against a knee. I remember there was always a narrator with perfectly rounded vowels telling of the “once proud tribes of Aborigines”. Each head turned to look at me, and I felt anything but pride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53259ab4d25ad28a218d340231b4aabbfd9ba6ee\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/53259ab4d25ad28a218d340231b4aabbfd9ba6ee/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indigenous protesters in Sydney in 2015, rallying against plans to close communities in Western Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indigenous protesters in Sydney in 2015, rallying against plans to close communities in Western Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw my reflection in Australia and felt diminished. Everything told me I wasn’t equal. The whites told the story of this land now; there was no glory in us. There was nothing that redeemed my ancestors. In books proudly titled The Making of Australia – a key school text of the 1960s – we were dismissed as the “dark-skinned wandering tribes who hurled boomerangs and ate snakes”, not fit to be counted in the glorious tale of white men and women who found the land, explored it, and made it a nation.</p> <p>Back then no one wrote of our great deeds. If we existed at all, we were a footnote, a prehistoric relic. </p> <h2>My life has led me to this point</h2> <p>“What does it feel like to be an Indigenous person in Australia?”<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A boy who grew up with a love of words … was now being asked to speak to his country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am standing in a radio studio in Sydney trying to explain why it is that we are so vulnerable and exposed in our own country. The interviewer – ABC’s Richard Glover – I have always found a gentle soul. His interviews are less about what divides us; at his best he looks to knit together the frayed fibres of our shared humanity. He has learned first-hand that what we do to each other can come from something missing or damaged in ourselves. He has also learned one of the most valuable lessons of life, that we are better than our worst. He has written eloquently of his own journey into his troubled family and how it has shaped him. It lends Richard empathy and there is softness in his question that is comforting and disarming.</p> <p>What does it feel like? </p> <p>I could resort to moral outrage. I could recite the litany of injustice and brutality that has been visited on my people. I could roll out that endless list of damning statistics that always ends in that same mantra: we are the most impoverished, disadvantaged people in the country. All of this would be true. I could speak with anger throwing up words like guilt and shame and blame. In this too I would not be wrong. But I find myself searching for something else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39442fee86d60092e093d30c46ae4e2b1378491c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/39442fee86d60092e093d30c46ae4e2b1378491c/20_177_499_370/499.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Grant’s father and mother, and his father's sisters and brother.\" width=\"499\" height=\"370\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Grant’s father and mother, and his father’s sisters and brother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have grown beyond the angry student of my youth. I have had to confront my own failings so it is not hard to understand, even forgive, the failings of others. Australia is bigger than us all and we only hold it for a brief moment before handing it to our children. I suppose I am a diplomat by nature; I seek equilibrium and balance. In this I am the essence of my astrological sign, Libra. More than that there is harsh pragmatism; we are only a fraction of this country’s population and if we can’t speak to the country as a whole then I fear we are doomed. As I look for the words to try to answer Richard’s question, I seek the language of healing because we just can’t take any more pain.</p> <p>I tell Richard how vulnerable we can be. I tell him of the little boy I once was who felt so ashamed of his colour that he tried to scrub it off. I tell him of the ache of poverty and how my family had roamed the back roads looking for a home in a land we had lost. I tell him of how a sideways glance or a snickering child could steal our souls. I tell him how we have learned to measure our words and lower our voices for fear of being howled down. I tell him that even now, despite carving out a place for myself, I could so easily be crushed by rejection. And he listens. He gives me the space to find these words and he lets them settle.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/30/i-can-tell-you-how-adam-goodes-feels-every-indigenous-person-has-felt-it\">Stan Grant: I can tell you how Adam Goodes feels. Every Indigenous person has felt it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I speak my mind reaches back through the years. At times I swallow hard and feel my heart beat that fraction quicker. I find a space at the back of the studio and fix my gaze, occasionally glancing away when my voice catches and a tear forms. At these moments I am with my mother and father; I am seated on the steps on a sunny day with my grandfather circling the tips on his racing form guide. I am flicking towels and dunking my friends – black brothers all – on an egg-frying-hot day at the Griffith swimming pool. I feel them all with me and know that I am never alone and what I say speaks for them too.</p> <p>My life had led me to this point. A boy who grew up with a love of words, who sat at the feet of his parents and heard stories of struggle and survival, was now being asked to speak to his country. I felt this responsibility heavily and I had come to it reluctantly. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/30/i-can-tell-you-how-adam-goodes-feels-every-indigenous-person-has-felt-it\">old wounds were being reopened</a>. I had grown up with the legacy of Australian racism and here it was rearing its head again. We – Australians black and white – meet each other across the gulf of our history. If I was being called to this story then it came from my ancestors: it came from my great-grandfather Bill Grant – a man born of black and white, a man whose name I read on the roll call of people from Bulgandramine mission.

dangerous.</p> <p>As the BBC begins its £20m six-part Sunday-night thriller, <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-02-21/tom-hiddleston-on-the-night-manager-how-could-you-get-away-with-being-a-spy\">Hiddleston, writing in the Radio Times, </a> said the nature of information-sharing may have changed in the digital age. “The riots in Cairo during the Arab spring uprisings of 2011, which brought about the resignation of former Egyptian leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\">Hosni Mubarak</a> [the opening scenes of The Night Manager] were mobilised through Facebook, but the innate courage and the skill set of the spy remains the same,” he wrote.</p> <p>“A spy must possess an almost unnatural ability to dissimulate, to hide in plain sight and a capacity for self-effacement and self-invention, which in itself is dangerous.” <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

British soldier with a service record in the Iraq war of 2003 who is discovered working as the night manager of a hotel in Zermatt, Switzerland, and is recruited by intelligence operative Angela Burr, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/olivia-colman\">Olivia Colman</a>.<br /></p> <p>His mission is to infiltrate the inner circle of the charming Richard Roper, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/hugh-laurie\">Hugh Laurie</a>, a British expatriate and criminal purveyor of dangerous chemical weapons to the highest bidder in the Middle East.<br /></p> <p>“On the face of it, the political backdrop of The Night Manager bears little resemblance to Smiley’s world, but there are striking similarities,” writes Hiddleston. “We no longer fear the outbreak of nuclear war between east and west but we now have other forces of enmity and darkness, which give us even greater cause to be frightened.</p> <p>“Our enemies in the past decade have presented themselves in the form of extremist jihadist groups – the criminal anarchy of al-Qaida or the barbaric evil of Isis – and the ground seems continually to shift beneath our feet. In the attempts of the allied power of the west to confront these new threats, they take on the character of a terrifying, many-headed Hydra: chop off one head and two more will grow back in its place. The world is as dangerous as ever.”<br /></p> <p>Roper, who “trades in death, profits from it and laughs” is, in Le Carré’s words, the worst man in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/john-le-carre-the-night-manager-television-adaptation\">John le Carré on The Night Manager on TV: they’ve totally changed my book – but it works</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Angela Burr and Jonathan Pine choose to protest against the evil of Richard Roper in the bravest, most dangerous way imaginable. Pine must live, undercover, within the jaws of the beast, knowing that they could snap shut at any time. And if ever that cover is blown he’s a dead man,” writes Hiddleston.<br /></p> <p>Le Carré has admitted he had “misgivings” when he learned that The Night Manager was to become a six-hour television drama radically updated for our time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/john-le-carre-the-night-manager-television-adaptation\">Writing in the Guardian,</a> he said they became even greater when he discovered that the novel he had written nearly a quarter of a century ago had been transformed into a drama featuring not his “beloved Colombian drugs barons but “Middle Eastern warlords”. To cap it all his leading investigator was no longer Mr Leonard Burr, but Mrs Angela Burr, and pregnant to boot.</p> <p>“To all of which, a lesser being such as myself might reasonably have responded: why not write your own bloody novel? With all those changes, what’s left of mine?” he wrote. “And the answer, surprisingly, is: a great deal is left, more than I dared hope.”</p> <p>The Night Manager begins on BBC1 Sunday at 9pm. The novel is reissued this month by Penguin Modern Classics.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hvah","wordcount":"630","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b20bf2497d7a12957a0ad6093313b6f80df8cc0c/0_0_4096_2457/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-24T18:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The

Eccleshare","headline":"Gillian Avery obituary","trailText":"Award-winning children’s author and historian of children’s literature whose first novel, The Warden’s Niece, was set in the Oxford of 1875","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Gillian Avery, who has died aged 89, was an award-winning children’s author and a historian of children’s literature. Over two decades, she wrote children’s books set almost exclusively in late-19th-century England, humorously creating an atmosphere that was accurately enough underpinned to feel convincing, without ever feeling over-researched or teacherly.</p> <p>Against that background, her characters were sufficiently Victorian to fit in, but also modern enough to appeal to contemporary readers. Of the two dozen books she either wrote or edited for children, she was best known for The Warden’s Niece (1957) and A Likely Lad (1971). The latter won the 1972 Guardian children’s fiction prize. Her work as a scholar of children’s literature included Nineteenth Century Children: Heroes and Heroines in English Children’s Stories 1780-1900 (1965), which she wrote with Angela Bull; and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Behold-Child-American-Children-1621-1922/dp/0801850665\" title=\"\">Behold the Child: American Children and their Books</a>, 1621-1922 (1994), a detailed study of children’s literature in the US.</p> <p>Born in Reigate, Surrey, Gillian was the oldest child and only daughter of Norman and Grace Avery. Her father was an estate agent in Reigate. She went to Dunottar school in the town, where “we merely learned to write neatly and to learn by heart”, she claimed. After secretarial training, Avery spent three years as a junior reporter on the Surrey Mirror in Redhill, where she informally filled in some of the gaps in her education but recognised that she was “too slow and too inaccurate” to be a journalist.</p> <p>She then worked on reference books, first Chambers Encyclopaedia and then the Oxford Children’s Encyclopaedia for Oxford University Press. In 1952, while working in Oxford, she met and married Tony Cockshut, a scholar of Victorian literature. Two years later he took up a post teaching at Manchester grammar school. Avery had always wanted to be a writer but, she said, “I got caught up in various jobs and had to content myself that one day it would come.” Moving to Manchester was that moment. She had no work and started to write as “an escape from the weeping … skies and raw fogs”.</p> <p>Missing Oxford, both its architecture and its academic atmosphere, she lovingly re-created it in 1875 as the setting for her first novel, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Wardens-Niece-Gillian-Avery/dp/0006707947\" title=\"\">The Warden’s Niece</a>. Her title character, Maria, miserable at her unimaginative boarding school, where she is constantly humiliated, runs away to her great-uncle, the warden of an Oxford college. Maria is quietly ambitious to become an academic and her uncle arranges for her to be taught with the Smith boys who live next door. Under their eccentric tutor the Rev Francis Copplestone, the children have a considerable amount of freedom. While exploring the Oxfordshire countryside, they discover a mystery about a boy who went missing a couple of centuries earlier.</p> <p>Avery gives the period flavour of this engaging adventure easily through her descriptions of inconvenient clothes, poor food and petty restrictions – as well as some admirably Victorian cycling. Her observations of family life – how Maria is treated in the warden’s lodgings and how the childhood of the Smith boys is shaped – are conveyed with an enjoyable lightness that verges on the satirical, while also highlighting the obvious truth that the children are entirely subject to the authority of the adults. How the children circumvent that authority in a creative way, individually and collectively, is as much part of the story as the solving of a mystery adventure. Maria is strong-minded; she is determined to finish her research so that she can prove to her uncle that she really is a serious scholar, even though it requires effecting an entrance to the Bodleian Library to do so.</p> <p>A runner-up for the Carnegie medal for the best children’s book of the year, The Warden’s Niece was an assured first novel and Avery never strayed far from the subject matter, the style or the quality of it in her subsequent novels. Oxford was once more the setting of her fourth title, The Elephant War (1960), in which Maria and the Smith brothers appeared again, as they did in The Italian Spring (1964). In these, and in other titles, including The Greatest Gresham (1962), there are other children who, like Maria, want to prove that they can overcome their apparent weaknesses and are willing to flout convention even if it puts them in awkward situations.</p> <p>Avery’s anti-authoritarian characters were deliberately created as an antidote to her own prewar upbringing, in which she described children as adopting a “meek acceptance of the power of the adult world”. As she saw it, Victorian children had, like her, been brought up at a time when they were “up against the baffling adult world”; for this reason she felt she had a far greater understanding of them than of the children growing up in the 1950s at a time when adults both paid them more attention and gave greater consideration to their views.</p> <p>Avery returned to Oxford in the mid-60s when her husband took up a teaching post there. She felt nostalgic for Manchester and the Lancashire society in which the thing that mattered above all was to be “respectable”. Drawing on her own experience and the stories of her father-in-law, who had been a doctor in Lancashire, she wrote A Likely Lad, the story of bookish Willy Overs persuading his father to allow him to continue his education rather than work in the insurance business. As well as winning the Guardian prize, it was a runner-up for the Carnegie medal. It was made into a TV miniseries in 1990.</p> <p>Avery continued to write children’s books until 1979 and then wrote two adult novels, The Lost Railway (1980) and Onlookers (1983). In addition to her histories of children’s books, she wrote Mrs Ewing (1961), about the children’s writer Juliana Horatia Ewing, and two books about girls’ education: The Best Type of Girl: A History of Girls’ Independent Schools (1991) and Cheltenham Ladies: A History of the Cheltenham Ladies’ College (2003). She was an active member of the Children’s Books History Society and served as its chair from 1987 until 1989.</p> <p>Her husband and their daughter, Ursula (known as Shenka), survive her.</p> <p>• Gillian Elise Avery, children’s writer, born 30 September 1926; died 31 January 2016</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hvbv","wordcount":"1050","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ae749bd317866196d8b7861c4d14a6a55e6ad0c2/76_602_2427_1455/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-29T15:34:00Z","standfirst":"Award-winning children’s author and historian of children’s literature whose first novel, The Warden’s Niece, was set in the Oxford of 1875"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/21/gillian-avery-obituary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/21/gillian-avery-obituary","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"ae749bd317866196d8b7861c4d14a6a55e6ad0c2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/ae749bd317866196d8b7861c4d14a6a55e6ad0c2/76_602_2427_1455/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/ae749bd317866196d8b7861c4d14a6a55e6ad0c2","altText":"Gillian Avery in 1972.

Not so. They externalise high emotions and create a violent, nightmarish world, often tipping over into grotesque humour; they have strong, though unconventional, narrative structures; and they are shot with exceptional virtuosity. But most of his films travelled around the enclosed world of film festivals, only occasionally shown to the general public.</p> <p>With characteristic disdain, Żuławski commented last year that “the only thing that I cannot sustain in cinema is boredom, this terrible boredom which assails European cinemas now, and these terrible festivals. Go to Cannes, you’ll die.” Yet his most celebrated film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTB15PPtMyA\">Possession</a>, was nominated for the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1981, and he won the best director award for his final film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSwrla3xco8\">Cosmos (2015)</a>, at the Locarno film festival.</p> <p> Żuławski was born in the Polish town of Lwów, now in Ukraine and then occupied by the Soviets. His father, Mirosław, was a writer and diplomat, who moved the family to France, where he was Polish envoy for Unesco immediately after the second world war. They then relocated to Czechoslovakia and, finally, Poland. Żuławski studied film direction at the renowned Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinémathographiques in Paris, and then philosophy at both the University of Warsaw and the Sorbonne.</p> <p>While still a student, Żuławski worked as assistant to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/13/culture.features2\">Andrzej Wajda</a>, Poland’s most widely known director, on the Holocaust drama Samson (1961). But Żuławski’s impressive feature film debut, The Third Part of the Night (1971), set in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, on which he used many of Wajda’s crew, seemed completely out of step with the films of his mentor. Wajda said: “I remember how shocked I was by this movie and how I took to it at the same time. It was certainly a new and an original voice in our Polish cinema.”</p> <p>Already Żuławski’s taste for depicting the extremes of human behaviour was evident. The film contains a graphic sequence of a woman giving birth without any medical assistance, and a Nazi vaccine laboratory, where Jews and members of the resistance are exposed to typhus-infected lice. This was taken as a grotesque invention on the part of the director, though it was based on fact.</p> <p>His second feature, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgDsRhzxonA\">The Devil (1972)</a>, punctuated with rape, torture, hysteria, bloodshed and sex, proved that Żuławski sometimes failed to know how far to go. Set against a snowy, war-torn landscape during the Prussian invasion of Poland in the 18th century, it was too plainly seen as an allegory of the repressive contemporary communist regime in Poland, and was promptly banned.</p> <p> Żuławski moved to France, where he made L’Important C’est d’Aimer (The Important Thing Is Love, 1975) which he wrote for the German actor <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/obituaries/romy-schneider-the-actress-dies-in-paris-apartment-at-43.html\">Romy Schneider</a>. In her César-winning role, Schneider plays a star of erotic movies torn between two men, her husband and a photographer who tries to help her career. This febrile and painful study of three emotionally damaged people is conveyed by a restless, constantly roving handheld camera and unblinking closeups.</p> <p>After its relatively successful box-office takings, Żuławski returned to Poland in 1977 to make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_YOfyMcIwM\">On the Silver Globe</a>, an allegorical science-fiction drama. But after he had finished about 80 per cent of the shooting, the authorities ordered him to abandon the picture. Luckily, much of the film was spared, and Żuławski was able to complete the film in 1988 from spare footage, and using voiceover commentary for the missing parts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the principle that nothing succeeds like excess, he shot Possession, a visceral tale of a marriage break-up in which the couple (Isabelle Adjani and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/interview-sam-neill\">Sam Neill</a>) are possessed by demons, both literal and figurative. Notable is the sequence in which Adjani freaks out in the Berlin metro, throws herself against the walls and apparently miscarries. It is like an aria in an atonal opera.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hucJstdN6g\">La Femme Publique (The Public Woman, 1984)</a> tells of a model who gets a role in a film adaptation of Dostoevsky’s The Possessed, and is dominated by a tyrannical director. Cleverly teetering on the boundaries of an exploitation movie, it has been seen as obliquely autobiographical.</p> <p>Another Dostoevsky-inspired film was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxBbwqDVMM8\">L’Amour Braque (Mad Love, 1985)</a>, loosely and wildly based on The Idiot, uprooted to a bright contemporary Paris. It starred <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/20/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic7\">Sophie Marceau</a>, in the first of four films she made with Żuławski. The other films with Marceau, with whom he had a long personal relationship and a child, were My Nights Are More Beautiful Than Your Days (1989), La Note Bleue (The Blue Note, 1991) and Fidelity (2000). This was Żuławski’s last film for 15 years, during which time several projects were aborted.</p> <p>He returned with Cosmos (2015), based on Witold Gombrowicz’s last novel, Kosmos (1965). The film was labelled a “metaphysical noir thriller”, though it was more of an absurdist comedy, in which, as usual, he pushed his cast to the limit. Żuławski shared with Gombrowicz a sense of paradox and an acute awareness of conflicts that arise when traditional cultural values clash with contemporary ones.</p> <p> Żuławski is survived by three sons: Xawery, from his marriage to the actor Małgorzata Braunek, who starred in his first two features; Ignacy, from his relationship with the painter Hannah Wolska; and Vincent, from his relationship with Marceau.</p> <p>• Andrzej Żuławski, film director, born 22 November 1940; died 17 February

midday to 4pm. Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
