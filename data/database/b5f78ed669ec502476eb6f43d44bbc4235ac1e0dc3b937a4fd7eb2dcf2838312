Twelve year old Finn is a Legend Hunter-in-training. The first book starts with him fighting a minotaur, but the minotaur is winning, so his father comes to the rescue and dessicates the beast. (No, he doesn’t turn him into tiny pieces of dried coconut – dessication is a common method for legend hunters to defeat monsters in this fantasy world.)</p> <p>Finn’s training leads him to uncover a plot where his father’s old friend, Mr Glad, is working with monsters to destroy Darkmouth. In book two, Finn’s father has disappeared whilst working on his Dessicator bomb, through a gateway to the monster realm, known as the Infested Side, and Finn tries to rescue him.</p> <p>I really enjoyed these books because they were fun and exciting and had a lot of hidden twists along the way. The storyline was full of action and well plotted. Characters aren’t what they seem and the books are full of surprises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ad86b85c3eadd0ffa3b5d3187acffb61cd991ea2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ad86b85c3eadd0ffa3b5d3187acffb61cd991ea2/0_0_216_346/216.jpg\" alt=\"Darkmouth cover\" width=\"216\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finn loves animals and isn’t a natural fighter, whereas his father Hugo is one of the greatest Legend Hunters to ever exist. Finn’s mum is a dentist, ordinary on the outside, but being married to a guy who turns monsters into leathery balls makes her an interesting character, because she accepts all of these weird things happening around her. Other characters are also the mysterious Emmie, who has suddenly arrived in Darkmouth with her father Steve, also a Legend Hunter but one who has never actually fought a monster. Emmie becomes Finn’s friend, but Steve is there for OTHER reasons… Steve adds to the mystery of the story and the comedy, as he is always trying to insult Hugo.</p> <p>A good addition to the books are the clever and detailed illustrations, which add a lot of humour to the story but also help you to imagine things and bring the story to life.</p> <p>The author Shane Hegarty has a brilliant imagination, because the books are filled with lots of strange monsters and interesting characters. It’s packed with small details, like names and setting descriptions, that make this original and unusual – for example, the Wolpertinger, the Hobgoon, the Fomorians and the books within the book ‘The Most Great Lives of the Legend Hunters’ and ‘The Purge’ etc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegarty creates an imaginative world, with its own history and myths that is also quite modern and is like our own world – except for the rampaging monsters!

I’ve been going there for the last five years on a weekly or fortnightly basis to take out books as well as use their other services.

They are warm and helpful and are always doing the maximum they can to cater for the needs of the community. </p> <p>It’s proposed that the library building will become a gym instead. But no gym or any other facility could ever replace the wonderful Carnegie library, so we have to keep it open. We, as the people of Lambeth, will continue to occupy the building for as long as we need to because this library has to stay open to continue serving the community. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixQZERfYgnU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixQZERfYgnU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Site member The Vampire’s Assistant (AKA George) travelled 50 miles to deliver a letter to the Carnegie occupation.

Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dr Simon Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Park, a senior lecturer in molecular biology at Surrey University, used a cellulose-producing bacterium to create the cover for the book, which he then illustrated using a series of different-coloured bacteria. Park chose Darwin’s seminal work, he said, because “as a microbiologist I know that all the life we see now started off as bacteria and related organisms, so they really were the origin of species”.</p> <p>Park, who curates <a href=\"http://exploringtheinvisible.com/2016/03/27/c-mould-at-edinburgh-international-science-festival/\">C-MOULD</a>, the world’s largest collection of microorganisms for use in the arts, believes that On the Origin of Species is the world’s first bacteria-grown book. So far, he has only created the first page, which took a little under two weeks, but has plans to create a longer version.</p> <p>“I have a collection of bacteria I have collected over the last 10 years, with unusual or interesting properties – for example I’ve a whole palette of different-coloured bacteria. Most are cream coloured, but occasionally you find brilliantly coloured ones,” he said. “One of the other types I have is one that produces cellulose, the stuff which is used to make things like paper and cotton. This bacterium naturally produces cellulose, and over a week will grow into a big, thick mass of cellulose, which when it is dried down, becomes … basically a bacterially-created paper.”</p> <p>In large quantities, his coloured bacteria “have the consistency of oil paints or acrylics”, so using a stencil, he printed the cover of the book on to the paper his bacterium created.”I’m pretty certain it’s the first [book to have been created this way],” he said.</p> <p>He displayed the book at the Edinburgh international science festival last week. “People were intrigued,” he said. “You can see the cogs ticking over as they try to match the concept of the book with bacteria … Most of the time, people only think about bacteria when they’re causing diseases – they don’t think of [their] other aspects.”</p> <p>Darwin himself, Park predicted, would have been interested by his project. “When he was alive people were just discovering bacteria, and I know he had an interest in that,” he said. “But he didn’t live long enough to appreciate [their] dominant role … Had he known about them, then they would have been an important part of his evolutionary story.”</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6mh","wordcount":"411","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6dc6c0026948e41c275d47a7131f83e025b14e43/0_35_2500_1500/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-13T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Molecular

Hughes","headline":"The Secret Poisoner by Linda Stratmann review – a century of murder","trailText":"This fine social history charts the changing patterns of using poison – from arsenic to strychnine – but also shines a light on domestic desperation in Victorian times","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Given the uncanny constancy with which Victorian poisoners set about their dirty business, it seems amazing that the victims didn’t cotton on sooner. Indeed, to read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/17/marquess-queensberry-linda-stratmann-review\" title=\"\">Linda Stratmann</a>’s account of how these ghastly deeds were done is to find yourself frustrated by all those unsuspecting chumps who insist on gulping down gallons of funny-tasting soup or refrain from asking sharp questions about where all the rat poison has gone. So, by way of a safety announcement, here is what any potential victim of a Victorian poisoner should be watching out for:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Be careful if you have a doctor in the family or, failing that, a pharmacist – or if you live next door to a farmer who is particularly partial to sheep dip.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Although this person has always given the impression of not liking you very much, these days they can’t seem to do enough for you. They even want to cook you dinner, despite having previously left that to someone else (poisoners are generally narcissists and consider themselves far too special for housework).</p> <p><strong>3. </strong>When, having eaten the proffered dinner, you start feeling queasy, don’t be surprised if the suspect acts strangely. Either they seem insultingly unconcerned, or else they throw themselves around in a ballyhoo of anxiety that would embarrass you if you weren’t already feeling too peculiar to care.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Now you’re lying in bed, gushing from every orifice. Instead of leaving the cleaning to the servant (narcissism again), the suspect has turned into a neat freak. They can’t stop whisking bedpans and sick bowls away and – odd, this – burying the contents in the garden.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> You’re dead now, but keeping a beady eye out from the afterlife and feeling increasingly indignant. The poisoner has been putting it about that you had a weak heart, whereas in fact you’ve always been fit as a fiddle. If he’s a doctor, he signs the death certificate himself, or else he gets his brother-in-law, who once almost qualified three decades ago, to do it.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> It turns out that your friend went to the undertaker and ordered a coffin a week before you were taken ill. It was exactly your size.</p> <p>Although the protocol for poisoning remained remarkably steady throughout the 19th century, the toxins themselves changed. Whereas arsenic had initially been the substance of choice, the telltale traces it left both in the body and on utensils made it a risky proposition. Strychnine, opiates, even nicotine and Spanish fly were all pressed into service, as murderers tried to stay one step ahead of the increasingly smart forensics.</p> <p>The general public, though, didn’t care much about the detail. What outraged them was the principle of the thing. Poisoning was just so sneaky. Shooting, stabbing or bludgeoning someone to death was understood. But poisoning took so much planning – buying the stuff, storing it, finding a way to slip it into dinner, standing by glassy-eyed while the victim frothed and fitted – that it struck right-thinking people as positively inhuman.</p> <p>And just look at who went in for it. If the poisoner wasn’t a doctor, then chances are a woman was the culprit – exactly the person who should be safeguarding the domestic hearth rather than working towards its destruction. Of course, thinking practically, you can see why poison might appeal to the female criminal mind. Arsenic and opiates could easily be bought in the high street and stored in plain sight in a kitchen cupboard. Slipping them into food was, quite literally, a piece of cake. Best of all, there was no worry about overpowering the victim: assuming all went according to plan, they simply keeled over. There was, it is true, more clearing up than you might have anticipated (Stratmann doesn’t spare us any of the spilled body fluids), but, at a pinch, poisoning could be construed as a ladylike way of bumping someone off. Classy, almost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed92e7714980bf63d7e4547ff3aa0de931c230c9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ed92e7714980bf63d7e4547ff3aa0de931c230c9/0_0_2831_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The murderous aunts in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Just a small glass of elderberry wine, sir’ … the murderous aunts in <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em> (1944).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you were particularly squeamish, you could even manage the whole thing from a distance. One of the best cases in this book concerns Miss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/poison-arsenic-gun-control-crime\" title=\"\">Christiana Edmunds</a>, who in 1870 went on a killing spree that earned her the tag of “the Brighton Borgia”. Her MO was to put strychnine in chocolates and leave them lying around temptingly in public places. Although her first intended victim was the wife of the man she was in love with, Edmunds soon became positively profligate in her attempts to wipe out half the seaside town. She started sending poisoned chocolates in the post to anyone she had never much cared for. Although her tally of mortalities amounted to one boy and a dog – where poison was concerned there was many a slip ’twixt cup and lip – this was horror enough and earned her a sentence to hang, later commuted to a life in Broadmoor.</p> <p>The most striking thing about Stratmann’s fine account is the light it sheds on domestic desperation. In a time before easy divorce or legal separation, the main reason people poisoned each other was either to obtain a marriage or to get out of one. In the first instance, existing spouses and inconvenient stepchildren were ruthlessly eliminated as impediments to nuptial bliss. In the second scenario, violent husbands and drunken wives were made to disappear in a frantic bid for some kind of peace.</p> <p>The other motive was money. The book is awash with heiresses of a minor stripe who attract some suburban adventurer fallen on hard times. It rarely goes smoothly. There is always a mother in the mix, some old trout who starts to ask difficult questions about why her darling girl has started looking so peaky ever since you took to hanging around the kitchen when dinner was being prepared. So you end up having to poison her too. And then there’s the maid, who is both nosey and a tattle. To stop her saying what she’s seen, you’re obliged to slip something into her evening cocoa. What had once seemed so simple – stylish, even – has now become a big old vomity mess that ends, more often than not, with you swinging for it.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>The Secret Poisoner</em><strong> </strong>for £16 (RRP £20) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/380467/s/the-secret-poisoner//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

The Carnegie Library in Lambeth has been under peaceful occupation since 31 March, the day it was due to close after 110 years. What began as a sad party for a few locals grew into an occupation, when those involved, including several very articulate, slightly cold but generally well-nourished children, decided to stay on for the night, and the next night. They shall not be moved, as one of them said, “until the council change their mind”. When the building reopens next year, it is supposed to be as a “healthy living centre”.

All were ultimately ignored and by Christmas the local council had accepted the plan. Lambeth council’s response to the occupiers’ message of defiance has been patchy. One councillor tweeted a picture of a yawning cat, then took it down. Another referred to “a small number of people” who had “decided to be obstructive”. A possession order has been served to the occupiers, and a large rally in their support is planned for 9 April.</p> <p>To add further support, local writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stella-duffy\">Stella Duffy</a> and I have drafted a letter to Lambeth council. In it, we ask them to reopen the library as a library, cancel the gym plan and work with the librarians to find a way forward. Within 24 hours of inviting writers and illustrators to come on board, we had 220 signatures – among them those of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/neil-gaiman\">Neil Gaiman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters\">Sarah Waters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidmitchell\">David Mitchell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgesaunders\">George Saunders</a>, the American short-story writer who said, “We’ve seen this trend in the US, too – the idea of libraries having to step up and be profitable and ‘appealing’. Next thing you know, there’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/starbucks\">Starbucks</a> in there and a stripper pole.”</p> <p>What’s really amazing, and encouraging, is the imagination that has gone into the occupation. There is more fun, passion, humour and intellectual energy hanging on the iron railings outside Carnegie Library than you’ll ever find posted on a healthy living centre notice board. <a href=\"http://friendsofcarnegielibrary.org.uk/\">friendsofcarnegielibrary.org.uk/</a></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t7xc","wordcount":"389","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/93dd7c4fde1ab3537a9d4212c990fb6c1fe23aa3/224_126_2449_1469/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-15T14:34:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Since it’s closure last month, the Carnegie Library in Lambeth has been under peaceful occupation – but the council’s response to the message of defiance has been patchy</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/08/why-we-continue-our-fight-to-save-lambeth-carnegie-library","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/08/why-we-continue-our-fight-to-save-lambeth-carnegie-library","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"93dd7c4fde1ab3537a9d4212c990fb6c1fe23aa3","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/93dd7c4fde1ab3537a9d4212c990fb6c1fe23aa3/224_126_2449_1469/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2016 Rex Features.

Very disheartening. But I really wanted to do it, so just kept going.”</p> <p>Sue Armstrong at Conville &amp; Walsh, who signed Cole after being sent three sample chapters of his manuscript, Ragdoll, described him as a “brilliant writer”. “I’m literary in my taste and the quality of his writing made him feel quite distinctive.” Armstrong receives up to 200 unsolicited submissions a week. “A lot are quite good. The ones that immediately catch your eye turn out to be special. This made me want to read on and I got very excited about it,” she says.</p> <p>The lead character of Cole’s series is detective Nathan Wolfe, reinstated to the Met Police after months of psychological assessment following accusations of a shocking assault. In the opening story of the series, he is called to a gruesome crime scene – the dismembered parts of six victims stitched together like a puppet into a corpse that becomes known in the press as the ragdoll. Wolfe’s ex-wife, a reporter, is then anonymously sent photographs from the crime scene along with a list of six new names and the dates on which the killer intends to murder them. The final name on the list is Wolfe’s.</p> <p>Cole describes Wolfe as a man with “a very troubled past” who is “very loyal”, “funny” and convinced “he’s always right”. Armstrong said: “I felt he was someone I wanted to spend time with.”</p> <p>Cole, whose mother is a schoolteacher and father is a mechanic, had just started a job in the control-room of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in his hometown of Bournemouth when his book was accepted. Having previously worked for three years as a paramedic, Cole’s direct experience of life’s horrors fed into his writing, although he wanted to ensure that the story was also entertaining. It has a gallows humour, he said, “that comes from the emergency services jobs – the coping mechanism”.</p> <p>At the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.londonbookfair.co.uk/\">London Book Fair</a> in April, Cole’s series will be offered to overseas publishers and will be published in the UK in January 2017.</p> <p>Sam Eades, senior commissioning editor at Orion, said: “Daniel is the next big brand in crime fiction, with a long and exciting career ahead of him.”</p> <p>Sam Symons, script executive at production company Sid Gentle, who made ITV’s The Durrells said the company had long been searching for a crime story that was distinctly different when it bought the rights to Cole’s work, and that his writing made the crimes feel “very real” without sensationalising them</p> <p>Sally Woodward Gentle, a former creative director of Carnival, which made Downton Abbey, and the founder of Sid Gentle said: “We’re driven by the writing first. A strong story and strong script should attract a strong cast. There are strong actors now wanting to do clever TV.”</p> <p>Symons said: “It’s a well-conceived story. Nathan Wolfe feels like a strong iconic character that will work well on screen,” adding: “It’s rare to get something as exciting as this.”</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6kb","wordcount":"605","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24089e8f98e64f672e5a3f0729355630b46b900/100_0_4844_2908/500.jpg","standfirst":"<p>The

When you’re on a train, what do you see? Almost everyone is on their phones, iPods, tablets or some kind of funky electronic device and all are almost always either on social media or listening to music. There are barely one or two people who have a book open in their hands – but we need more people like that.</p> <p>I was watching an episode of Russell Howard’s Good News recently and a man was talking about how he just doesn’t see anyone reading on public transport anymore. He asked, <em>how do I make my book stand out so others want to read more</em> and Russell replied by saying, <em>Just make your book look like it’s the most fascinating thing in the world… use facial expressions to express how amazing it is</em> – which I thought was hilarious but then also sad in a way, as it clearly shows that many people just don’t really have an interest in reading any more. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/17/how-libraries-brought-out-my-inner-book-geek\">How libraries brought out my inner book geek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not just about what you see on public transport, though. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/09/decline-children-reading-pleasure-survey\">Fewer and fewer teenagers</a> are interested in reading for pleasure. I feel as if there’s a direct relationship between advances in technology and the decreasing number of young people who read books. I’m currently doing my A levels and I’ve realised that hardly any of my friends or fellow students have time to read anymore. When they aren’t studying, they’re on social media, so clearly when they do have spare time they don’t make it time to read.<br /></p> <p>I know that younger children used to read the most because they have the most free time and I often see my local library flooded with children in the summer holidays. When I was younger, I remember borrowing twelve books at a time from the library and just reading all the time. But now younger children also have access to technology, my younger siblings included, so they very rarely talk to each other at home because one is busy on her iPod, the other on his PSP and the other on her tablet and it’s a constant cycle day after day. Not once have I seen them pick up a book by themselves.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/25/teenagers-studying-books-english-gcse\">Teenagers need to enjoy the books they are studying at GCSE</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It only gets worse as you get older. I feel as though in school students learn to loathe books: we have to analyse and interpret and remember quotations... and sometimes we start to believe that what we are taught for our exams is all reading is about, when of course it isn’t. Reading should be for pleasure and for fun, and students should not experience it as a chore.<br /></p> <p>I think reading is about escaping and being able to live in another world, then another and another, and almost everyone who reads wants to become an author, myself included, so that they can create their own worlds and adventures. The beauty of reading is that everyone loves it for a different reason, and once people read more, they will realise that they love it. People just need to take the time out of their day, even if it’s just ten minutes, to give books a go.</p> <h2>Is there a books topic you want to write about? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the Guardian children’s books site</a> and you could do just that.</h2>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hkkp","wordcount":"569","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/37c398681b7cbc600aca7ac93b48aa1f42b27e32/6_341_5765_3459/500.jpg","standfirst":"<p>With TV, YouTube and social media, there’s a lot of competition for young people’s attention. <strong>Teen site member </strong><strong>Ayesha </strong>urges you to put down your phones and spend 10 minutes a day just reading for fun</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/07/stop-decline-in-kids-reading-for-pleasure-give-books-a-go","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/07/stop-decline-in-kids-reading-for-pleasure-give-books-a-go","sectionName":"Children's books","elements":[{"id":"37c398681b7cbc600aca7ac93b48aa1f42b27e32","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/37c398681b7cbc600aca7ac93b48aa1f42b27e32/6_341_5765_3459/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2014 Rex Features.

Mrs Broom’s eldest daughter was at the door, her second daughter took her bag, her son came running down the stairs to greet her, and her husband put the kettle on.</em></p> </blockquote> <p> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/757880.The_Bear_Nobody_Wanted\">The Bear Nobody Wanted</a>, Janet and Allan Ahlberg</p> <p> ---</p> <p> I applied for my first job as soon as I was able – at fourteen and nine months. The fish and chip shop up the road, supplier of our occasional Friday night supper, was on the hunt for new staff. I typed up a CV of sorts – it can’t have been more than a couple of lines – and took it up. I started a week later, and spent the next six months with my trainers and cargo shorts (this was 2002, after all) smelling of fish and oil. I moved on relatively quickly, to the <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2015/10/20/goat-curry-vanity-fair\">Indian restaurant</a> down the road, but this first job has stayed with me. A whiff of potato scallops or a chorus of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABuWphlnZ1A\">Craig David</a> song (again, this was 2002) and I’m right back behind the deep fryer.</p> <p> Although I didn’t realise it at the time – my eyes, at this point, were fixed firmly on studying medicine – these six months were formative for me in terms of my career. In addition to the obvious lessons that come with working in a customer facing job (ie always be generous and friendly to the person behind the counter), I learnt how to cook fish, whip up a batch of batter and layer a burger so it doesn’t fall apart. We’d play around with deep-fried chocolate bars on slow Saturday mornings and experiment with the best combination of fish and condiments. In short, I realised I love working with food. While friends got jobs in supermarkets and clothes shops, I stayed in the food service industry until I moved to England and, all going well, I’ll be back doing it again soon enough.</p> <p> I did feature a fish and potato recipe <a href=\"http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2016/3/31/fish-cakes-and-salad-the-sea-the-sea\">last week</a>, so you probably don’t need another so soon. But I was staying with a friend (the brilliant <a href=\"https://oliviapotts.wordpress.com/\">Livvy Potts</a>) on Easter weekend and she sent me on my way on Sunday afternoon with a batch of hot cross buns and a loan of three new books, including this, a childhood favourite of hers. I’ve read books by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_and_Allan_Ahlberg\">Ahlbergs</a> before (<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385250.The_Jolly_Postman_or_Other_People_s_Letters\">The Jolly Postman</a> will be making a feature in the book I’m writing), and recently listened to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fbl6n\">Allan Ahlberg’s interview</a> on Desert Island Discs in tears. But I’d not seen this one before. It’s lovely; a picture of late 1930s and 1940s London through the button eyes of a poorly formed teddy bear. He passes from family to family, observing multiple dinners, but it’s this first meal, one that is packed alongside him on the journey home, that I imagine he’d find particularly memorable. </p> <p> I know that you can find perfectly good (and often great) fish and chips throughout the UK, packed up for you to carry home in paper. However, now miles from my old favourite in Haggerston, I thought I would try making my own. Doing so reminded me of just how glorious battered fish can be when it isn’t given the chance to go soggy on your walk home: hot and crisp on the outside, with perfectly flaky fish in the centre. And, happily, you can have as many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scraps_(batter)\">scraps</a> as you want alongside it too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6669a3863273cd1856f2abf8ff11aa1305c15ba8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6669a3863273cd1856f2abf8ff11aa1305c15ba8/0_0_2162_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fish and chips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A whiff of potato scallops or a chorus of a Craig David song (this was 2002) and I’m right back behind the deep fryer.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fish and Chips: the recipe</strong></h2> <p><strong> Serves 2</strong></p> <p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br /> <em>Chips<br /> </em> 200g Maris Piper potatoes<br /> 2l vegetable oil</p> <p> <em>Fish</em> <br /> 300g sustainably sourced white fish (I used cod loin fillet, but haddock or pollock would do well here too) <br /> 100g plain flour (+3tbsp, for first coating)<br /> 1tsp baking powder <br /> 125ml fizzy water</p> <p> <em>And <br /> </em> Salt and vinegar <br /> Mayonnaise/tartare sauce <br /> Mushy peas <br /> Pickled onions</p> <p> <strong>Equipment</strong> <br /> Vegetable peeler<br /> Knife and chopping board<br /> Medium sized saucepan<br /> Colander <br /> Large high-sided saucepan<br /> Small flat bowl <br /> Mixing bowl <br /> Whisk<br /> Slotted spoon<br /> Plate and kitchen towel</p> <p>A note: Store your flour, fizzy water and fish in the fridge for this recipe until the moment you want to use them - cold ingredients hitting hot oil will give you the lightest, crispiest batter. <br /></p> <p> Another note: It goes without saying, but hot oil does deserve your full attention in the kitchen.

Boil them in water in the medium saucepan until just tender enough to pierce with a knife. Keep a good eye on them, as you don’t want to overcook them at this stage. Drain, and leave them to cool.</p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Heat the oil to 150C in the high sided saucepan. If you don’t have a thermometer, check this by putting the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. If tiny bubbles fizz around it, it’s ready. If the bubbles move vigorously or bubble to the surface, it is too hot, and you should turn it down a little. Tip the chips into the oil and cook for around five minutes until pale golden. Remove them and drain on some kitchen towel on a plate. Leave to cool while you cook the fish.</p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Turn the oil up slightly, until it reaches 180C. At this stage, the bubbles around the wooden spoon should be moving enthusiastically and should be varied in size. Get the batter ingredients out of the fridge. Put the extra 3tbsp flour in the flat bowl, ready to coat the fish. Whisk the flour and baking powder in the mixing bowl. Pour the fizzy water into the mixing bowl and whisk vigorously. You should have a thick, bubbling batter.</p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Press a piece of fish into the flour, then shake off and dip into the batter, ensuring it is completely coated. Allow the batter to drain off slightly, and then place it into the oil, moving it back and forth a little as you do so, to start the batter puffing and ensure it floats. Add the rest of the fish in a similar fashion, if the pieces will fit comfortably. If your pan is too small for this, cook it in stages. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Turn the fish over once or twice as it cooks, removing it to a plate lined with kitchen towel when it is golden brown (about five or six minutes). Allow to drain while you finish the chips.</p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Tip the cool chips back into the oil for another two minutes until golden. If you fancy some scraps (stray, puffed bits of batter), dribble some leftover batter in too. Remove the chips to a plate lined with kitchen towel and allow to drain for a minute. </p> <p>Serve immediately, sprinkled with lots of salt and vinegar, and dip into a condiment of your choosing.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6pj","wordcount":"1174","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d46ecb7424ad3cd72957ba7cdfbb5e8e74ff646/0_292_1907_1144/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-14T16:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Kate

In an energetic defence of his profession, Scott argues that good art and good criticism go hand in hand","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In 2012, the New York Times’s widely admired and genially erudite chief film critic AO Scott went to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-avengers\"><em>The Avengers</em></a>. He left unimpressed. Not only was the movie full of “overblown, skull-assaulting action sequences”, he wrote in his review, but its dirty secret was that it was “a snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else, that something else being a giant ATM for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel\">Marvel</a> and its new studio overlords, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company\">Walt Disney Company</a>”. Egged on by one of its stars, Samuel L Jackson, ranks of fanboys and trolls took to the internet to rain down abuse on Scott for being a pompous egghead who wasn’t down with the people. Their orchestrated outrage even made the news in Brazil and Japan.</p> <p>In the era of media downsizing their numbers have been reduced, but professional critics are still a minority it’s OK to hate. Tolerated and quoted as long as their opinions chime with those of their readers, more often they are abominated as miserable sods and nabobs of negativity; parasites and vampires who feast on the living; thwarted or second-rate creators who take out their disappointment on successful artists. Real people, it’s suggested, are happy just to enjoy art; critics, by contrast, are too sceptical or suspicious. They’re likened to butchers, forensic scientists, prosecutors.</p> <p>Scott argues this is a silly segregation. Everyone thinks about why some films or books or pieces of music work or don’t work. Everyone makes value judgments about art. To deny or seek to downgrade the importance of interpretation and individual responses has, he believes, serious aesthetic and political implications. It “lulls us into passivity”. It “encourages us toward either the defensive group identity of fanhood or a shallow, half-ironic eclecticism”. The dangers of the latter, and it’s hard not to imagine he has one eye on the ongoing freakshow of American politics, is that “we are conscripted into a polarised climate of ideological belligerence in which bluster too often substitutes for argument”.</p> <p>According to Scott, to believe that criticism and art are mutually antagonistic is also a mistake. With his endearing fondness for familial metaphors, he claims criticism is “art’s late-born twin. They draw strength and identity from a single source, even if, like most siblings, their mutual dependency is frequently cloaked in rivalry and suspicion”. He points to individuals who excelled at both: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charles-baudelaire\">Baudelaire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/bernardshaw\">Shaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\">TS Eliot</a>, Berlioz, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard\">Godard</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Criticism, far from being a minor, petty, secondary art, is in fact larger than the others</p> <footer> <cite>AO Scott</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His bolder argument is that “all art is successful criticism”. By this he means that all artists find themselves reckoning with the past, judging its achievements, assessing its relevance for the present, revolting against or carrying the baton for it. Huge swaths of contemporary culture – from hip-hop, to the films of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\">Quentin Tarantino</a> and the Coen brothers – are constructed from “borrowing, quotation, and meta-commentary, much of it bracingly original”. Seen in this way, they are not just poster children for postmodernism, but direct descendants of Shakespeare who “ransacked the cupboards of high and low literature, history and folklore in search of viable scenarios, cobbling together scraps of Ovid, Holinshed, Latin comedy, commedia dell’arte sketches”.</p> <p>At times like these, or when he asserts “criticism, far from being a minor, petty, secondary art, is in fact larger than the others”, Scott comes on like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> at his most grandiloquent. The sections of the book styled as dialogues – in which conflicting versions of the author tussle with each other – read clunkily. But if there is nothing here as amusing as David Lee Roth’s quip – “Most music critics love Elvis Costello, because most music critics look like Elvis Costello” – Scott is still an amiable guide through some of the key historical, philosophical and practical issues concerning criticism. Kant makes an appearance, Rilke too, but so does Anton Ego, the restaurant critic from the Pixar animation <em>Ratatouille</em>. A warning about “the promiscuous hurling of adjectives” is worth heeding.</p> <p>Scott writes for a well-regarded broadsheet that prides itself on its extensive arts coverage, can afford to employ fact checkers and abjures the boosterish zeal of zines and passion-project blogs. It would have been interesting, though, to learn how critics occupying a less liberal or centrist position conceive of their jobs. They function – sometimes valuably – as champions for emergent genres or entire art forms, zealots whose ripped‑and-torn prose can expose the ossification of the cultural mainstream.</p> <p>Critics – paid critics, at least – are a dying breed. What price nuance or ambiguity, when the onus is to provoke social-media mayhem, ignite below-the-line indignation and drive online traffic? Qualified enthusiasm doesn’t really cut it against clickbaiting, monetisation-friendly, five-star panegyrics for <em>Avengers</em> sequels. Small wonder that laid-off or freelance writers are migrating to academia: there, sometimes, they can get properly paid. But they pay a price, too, mutating from critics to scholars, from writing for the general public to specialist readers. In the process, something special, some vision of the commons, is fatally eroded.</p> <p>• To order <em>Better Living Through Criticism</em> for £10.39 (RRP £12.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=better+living+through+ciriticsm&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

It will leave lots of great memories – please share yours","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>It was conceived in the ashes of the old millennium as a prize that would celebrate new voices, challenge old genre boundaries and capitalise on the wisdom of crowds.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge we had set ourselves back in 1999 became immediately clear when the wisdom of the reading groups based at bookshops around the country, whose votes helped shape the shortlist, clashed with that of the celebrity judging panel over who should be the first winner. The groups united behind David Mitchell’s novel Ghostwritten, while the individual judges ruled in favour of Philip Gourevitch’s We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed with our Families.<br /></p> <p>Gourevitch’s account of the Rwandan genocide “transcended reportage”, as judge Amanda Foreman said, “haunting all of our thoughts long after we had read it”. It set a standard for books of moral as well as literary stature. Nevertheless, there’s a bit of me that has always mourned the absence of Mitchell from a roll of honour that has grown in stature as the winners have moved through their careers. It’s extraordinary today to think of Zadie Smith as a nervous 25-year-old waiting to step into the limelight of her very first literary award in 2000, or of Chris Ware struggling for words in 2001 as he became the first graphic novelist to win a generalist literary award, not just in the UK but anywhere.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/07/guardian-first-book-award-all-the-winners\">Guardian first book award: all the winners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But prizes grow up, and find themselves jostling for space in territories where they were once pioneers. This year’s Baileys women’s prize for fiction has no fewer than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/08/baileys-prize-longlists-self-published-debut-and-10-other-first-novels\">11 first novels on a shortlist of 20</a>, and there has been a proliferation of newer initiatives that reach across genres for exciting new literary departures: think of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/11/novel-about-john-lennon-and-primal-screaming-wins-goldsmiths-prize\">Goldsmiths prize</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/27/kate-tempest-ted-hughes-poetry-prize\">Ted Hughes award</a>.<br /></p> <p>So, not without a few tears on the books desk for an institution that has been a centrepiece of our year for nearly two decades, we’ve decided to call it a day.<br /></p> <p>We like to think we’ve played a part in kickstarting the careers of 17 fabulously innovative and diverse authors, ranging from nature writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/11/guardianfirstbookaward2003.guardianfirstbookaward\">Robert Macfarlane</a> to novelist and short story writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">Yiyun Li </a>and back-to-front biographer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\">Alexander Masters.</a><br /></p> <p>We’re immensely grateful to the judges who have given their time and expertise over the years, to the Waterstones reading groups who have enlivened the process – and the annual award parties – with their smart, and often pithy, opinions. And to our online books community for their sometimes game-changing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/31/guardian-first-book-award-10th-finalist\">10th title nominations</a>.<br /></p> <p>So there’s much to celebrate and, rather than sign off in maudlin mood, here are some favourite behind-the-scenes moments. If you have been involved in any part of the prize, please add your own in the comments below.<br /></p> <h2>2001</h2> <p>Comedian and yet-to-be bestselling children’s author Charlie Higson’s passionate championship of Chris Ware’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/21/biography.highereducation\">Jimmy Corrigan: the Smartest Kid on Earth</a>, which converted even the deeply sceptical science historian Roy Porter into a born again graphic novel fan.</p> <h2>2002</h2> <p>Biographer Hermione Lee coaxing Irvine Welsh into line when he threatened a walkout over the decision to award a British prize to an American: Jonathan Safran Foer for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\">Everything Is Illuminated</a>. (Also Lisa Jardine’s whispered confidence that she wished the novel had been eligible for the Booker, which she was chairing that year.)</p> <h2>2008</h2> <p>An overheard encounter with Radiohead’s Colin Greenwood at the afterparty for Alex Ross’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/14/rest-is-noise-alex-ross\">The Rest Is Noise</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Are you a musician?” </p> <p>“I play a bit in the garage with my brother.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>2009</h2> <p>Petina Gappah’s winner’s speech for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/19/short-stories-elegy-easterly-gappah\">An Elegy for Easterly</a>: “Did you read the books on the shortlist? I mean, seriously good. If I’d been judging the prize I certainly would not have chosen me.”</p> <h2>2011</h2> <p>Newbie publisher Stefan Tobler’s response to the shortlisting of one of his first titles, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/may/29/guardian-first-book-award-2012\">Down the Rabbit Hole,</a> which was nominated by readers: “We launched the year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/20/hmv-sells-waterstones-russian-billionaire\">Waterstones almost went bust</a> and pretty much stopped ordering books for a while. The fact that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guardianfirstbookaward\">Guardian first book award</a> led to Down the Rabbit Hole becoming an overnight success was pure magic.” </p> <h2>2012 </h2> <p>William Dalrymple and Jeanette Winterson being told to behave when they blocked against the award of a single prize, on the grounds that it was impossible to judge fiction against nonfiction. They duly behaved and awarded the prize to Kevin Powers’s novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/the-yellow-birds-kevin-powers-review\">The Yellow Birds</a> (Katherine Boo’s account of a Mumbai slum, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/behind-beautiful-forevers-katherine-boo-review\">Beyond the Beautiful Forevers</a>, was the underrunner.) </p> <h2>2015</h2> <p>Andrew McMillan’s bracingly literal demonstration that there’s nothing precious about new poetry, at the party to announce his win with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/guardian-first-book-award-2015-andrew-mcmillan-poet\"> Physical</a>. The first poet to make it to the podium entertained the crowd by reading from a poem entitled Urination, which began “I’m scared of bumping someone while they piss” - and went on to illustrate why.<br /></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6jf","wordcount":"822","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6538c19b704471f5bd9a600f760031a8f3b3df31/0_274_5616_3370/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-13T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>After 17 years of hunting the best new writing, of terrific winners and terrific rows, we’re saying goodbye to the prize.

Fifty years on, the original, hand-corrected, typed manuscript for the bestselling novel is headed to auction in California, where it is estimated to sell for between $25,000 and $50,000.</p> <p>“This manuscript will appeal to both the literary collector as well as the collector of pop culture,” said Brian Chanes of Profiles in History, the auction house that will offer the unbound 598-page manuscript on 18 April, alongside presidential autographs, Mark Twain letters and a René Magritte archive.</p> <p>Valley of the Dolls was released in February 1966, hit the bestseller list a month later, and reached No 1 in May. It has since sold 31m copies, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.valleyofthedolls.com/jacquelinesusann/#bio-shift\">a website</a> run by the estate of Jacqueline Susann. </p> <p>For Susann, a struggling actress who wanted nothing more than to see her name in lights, writing was an afterthought. She had landed a few minor roles on Broadway and on television in the 1940s and early 50s, but neither she nor her press agent/producer husband, Irving Mansfield, could generate enough star power. She was 45 when she published her first book, Every Night, Josephine! (1963), about her pet poodle. It was an unexpected hit. She returned to her pink typewriter and wrote Valley of the Dolls, a novel about the sordid lives of three young women seeking fame and fortune in postwar New York City.</p> <p>The novel was deemed sensational and crude, even within the context of 1960s America. Not only is it crammed with sex and drugs – “dolls” being the nickname for pills – but Susann’s characters, based on her own experiences in show business, are vicious. The world hidden behind marquees and movie sets, Susann intimates, is sleazy. </p> <p>Her literary agents, Annie Laurie Williams and Maurice Crain, received several rejections from New York’s top publishers. The legendary Simon &amp; Schuster editor Michael Korda, who would edit Susann’s next novel, The Love Machine (1969), recalls in his memoir, Another Life, that Valley “seemed to many of the old guard of book publishing like the beginning of the end, Hollywood vulgarity at the door of the temple of culture”.</p> <p>Finally, Bernard Geis offered Susann a contract for Valley of the Dolls. Having previously published Helen Gurley Brown’s Sex and the Single Girl (1962), he was nonplussed by Susann’s “dirty” prose. (His office, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/fashion/valley-of-the-dolls-jacqueline-susann-lena-dunham.html?_r=0\">according to the New York Times</a>, “was the kind of Swinging Sixties office whose two floors were joined by a fire pole”.) Because Susann and her husband were expert self-promoters, the novel took off. She had “reinvented the woman’s novel”, writes Korda.</p> <p>The book was quickly adapted into a 1967 film starring Barbara Parkins, Sharon Tate and Patty Duke that is now considered a cult classic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/29/patty-duke-the-miracle-worker-dies-at-69\">Patty Duke, Oscar-winning actress and former child star of TV show, dies at 69</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To fete the novel’s 50th anniversary this year, Grove Press will issue a <a href=\"http://www.groveatlantic.com/?title=Valley+of+the+Dolls\">new edition</a> of Valley in July, with an introduction by fashion commentator and Barneys New York creative ambassador Simon Doonan. Writing about the novel as a cultural phenomenon for <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/doonan/2016/02/valley_of_the_dolls_is_50_and_more_relevant_than_ever.html\">Slate</a>, Doonan argues that Susann’s novel is so hot, it may require trigger warnings even after five decades.</p> <p>The anniversary also brings with it the opportunity for selling promotional merch: various editions of Susann’s three bestsellers, a “special edition” DVD of the film, a notebook and mug set, and a designer pillbox.</p> <p>The California auction appears to be unrelated to anniversary events, though good timing all the same. The Valley manuscript has been in private hands since it was sold at Sotheby’s to a book dealer in 1984. This is the first manuscript of Susann’s that Profiles in History has ever seen or handled, said Chanes.</p> <p>Typed on onionskin (not the colored paper Susann would become known for), the manuscript shows annotations and editorial proofreading marks in multiple hands, “which would include agents, editors and Jacqueline Susann herself”, said Chanes. It also bears the ink stamp of her literary agency.</p> <p>Whether the book’s blockbuster history will be enough to arouse collector interest is unclear. But, said Chanes: “This is the manuscript of one of the most successful books of all time. Although some might consider the book innocuous by today’s standards, it set a precedent and became a pattern for a genre of fiction which concentrates on the personal lives of the very famous and successful.” </p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t6gz","wordcount":"749","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c8f96337b9451bfe6dc4316991bb69f44cbfea72/0_228_3360_2017/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-10T14:30:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The sale of one of the great pulp successes of the 1960s sheds light on a misunderstood book and its one-off author, Jacqueline Susann</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/07/jacqueline-susann-valley-of-the-dolls-manuscript-auction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/apr/07/jacqueline-susann-valley-of-the-dolls-manuscript-auction","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"c8f96337b9451bfe6dc4316991bb69f44cbfea72","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c8f96337b9451bfe6dc4316991bb69f44cbfea72/0_228_3360_2017/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"THIS COPYRIGHTED IMAGE MUST NOT BE USED WITHOUT PERMISSION","picdarUrn":"GD*13409770","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/c8f96337b9451bfe6dc4316991bb69f44cbfea72","suppliersReference":"390892","altText":"The original manuscript of Jacqueline Susann’s ‘Valley of the Dolls’ is back up for sale.

In between late nights and working all day, Georgie barely gets any time to spend at home with her husband Neal and her two little girls (Alice and Noomi), and when she tells Neal that she can’t make it to his parents for Christmas because of a work deadline, he takes off with the girls.</p> <p>But when she gets the chance to fix her marriage, will she take the chance or will she change her entire future?</p> <p>Refreshingly honest and interesting, this book does not only focus on teenagers but adults too. It is a much more realistic piece of fiction than books in a similar genre – it shows what marriage and your relationships with people can actually be like. It helps to separate from the classic idea that all YA fiction (simply because it is aimed at young adults) must be about young people (specifically young love). Because this book is YA but about adults (though in part they are younger), it helps to show the people who are reading that YA fiction is much broader than it is said to be, and in part helps broaden their minds as is shows them that other kinds of books are also interesting, and will help them venture into different territories when it comes to genre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"64f23eafaf05fa0fe1b43769781f838743d7c139\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/64f23eafaf05fa0fe1b43769781f838743d7c139/0_0_318_468/318.jpg\" alt=\"Landline cover\" width=\"318\" height=\"468\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If I had to fault anything, it would be that one person would, all of a sudden, be able to fix a relationship that had been struggling for so long so easily.

Which story’s safari would you go for?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>It is cold and wet here this morning, and I was feeling particularly sedentary until this tale of adventure inspired me to greater feats. Athletes Alan Rankin and Willie Gibson are due to recreate the complete journey of David Balfour, hero of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Kidnapped, to raise money for charity.</p> <p>“In the summer of 2016 we will set sail from South Queensferry [west of Edinburgh], around Orkney down the Minch to the island of Erraid, off Mull. From Erraid, the team will go by foot the 270 miles back to South Queensferry,” they <a href=\"http://www.kidnapped130.com/\">write on their website</a>. “The overland leg will cross some of the wildest and most stunning landscapes in Scotland, following the route as described in the book, and mapped on the long-distance route <a href=\"http://www.stevensonway.org.uk/\">the Stevenson Way</a>.”</p> <p>“We plan to follow as close as possible to the route described in the book,” Rankin <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/adventurers-plan-recreation-of-robert-louis-stevenson-s-kidnapped-1-4093103#ixzz4586Q6K6H\">told the Scotsman</a>. “However, unlike the story, there will be no real-life kidnapping and, hopefully, no shipwreck either. We hope to complete the whole trip in under 18 days. Heading off in late May offers us long daylight hours for the sailing leg and hopefully we will be finished the trek before the midges are out in force.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/moors-brontes-yorkshire-charlotte-emily-anne\">How the moors changed my mind about the Brontës | Lucy Mangan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Quite apart from the fact that I’d forgotten just how entertaining Kidnapped is – I’ve been looking through it this morning and am planning an evening wrapped up in David’s adventures – just how much fun does their trip sound? It’s a step beyond the usual literary tourism of visiting <a href=\"http://www.keats-shelley-house.org/\">the Keats house in Rome</a> (although I did love that) or the Brontë parsonage in Haworth - and I find myself craving my own real literary adventure.</p> <p>Kidnapped is a great choice: Stevenson is so detailed in his descriptions of where David is taken that it makes for an easy route to follow. “And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map. On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan’s boat, we had been running through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle Eriska in the chain of the Long Island. Now to get from there to the Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of Mull.

Landers faces disbelief on a variety of fronts throughout his divine mission – from the media, the religious authorities and his wife to name a few.

I first picked up The Manifesto Of How To Be Interesting whilst I was on holiday, and pretty much finished it in one sitting. Am I Normal Yet was the most true to life story with an OCD-suffering main character I’ve read, well, ever – and then this one came along and I was desperate to read it. Helpful tip for you: if you’re desperate to read a book, probably don’t order it online – it might be cheaper but is it worth the wait?</p> <p>Amber’s jetting off to California for the summer, to spend time with the mother who left her, remarried and moved to California, changing her personality at the same time. What’s she to do when all she wants is a little bit of love? Especially when Prom King Kyle arrives, the guy all the girls are after. Is he seriously after Amber? And if so, should she follow Evie’s advice and take it carefully, or should she listen to Lottie, “mount him and worry about it later”. Nobody can deny it: love is hard.</p> <p>After being completely blown away by Holly’s past novels, I expected nothing less from this novel, and I wasn’t disappointed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3dc79c58e4e0f6d49773897db191f5ed916d8afc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3dc79c58e4e0f6d49773897db191f5ed916d8afc/0_0_313_475/313.jpg\" alt=\"How Hard Can Love Be cover\" width=\"313\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Holly’s got a really unique writing style that’s both hilarious and serious, one that knows when to be serious but also can lighten up, which is perfect for this book. It’s one you can read and laugh about, but you can also expect some really serious themes about family troubles, relationships and feminism from.</p> <p>I was also really impressed by how Evie’s story (Am I Normal Yet?) ties in with this new novel; Evie’s presence is clearly baked into this story but not so much that it’s just a byproduct of the first novel.</p> <p>Amber and Kyle are both really well described characters as well. We know so much about the two of them, as well as all the other characters, and the book is written in a realistic and accurate manner. I loved seeing how these two seemingly incompatible characters’ stories intertwined with each others, and it really made this book.</p> <p>I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for their next book to read. Holly’s an amazing writer, and she’s only gone and done it again with How Hard Can Love Be?</p> <p>Plus, she’s got at something too with that question; love’s complicated.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368950/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>confessionsofabooklover:</strong> ‘Holly’s got a really unique writing style that’s both hilarious and serious’","headline":"How Hard Can Love Be by Holly Bourne -

It’s an intriguing mix of styles, perhaps because when Paul, the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview19\" title=\"\"><em>Salmon Fishing in the Yemen</em></a> who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/19/paul-torday-dies-67\" title=\"\">died in 2013</a>, was too ill to continue the book, his son Piers, a children’s writer, took up the task with panache.</p> <p>The plot hinges on a single event, when a barn owl flies into the windscreen of a car driven down a dark country lane by a Conservative MP, Andrew Landford. Also in the car is Landford’s Oxford friend and somewhat reluctant communications adviser, Charles Fryerne, through whose eyes the story is told. What follows is part witty satire on the state of British politics – with a cast of politicians driven by ambition to the exclusion of all honour and humanity – and part gothic drama in which revenge comes painfully and ineluctably. The sense of impending doom as the novel reaches its apocalyptic climax is especially well crafted.</p> <p>There is a problem, though. It takes a long time to get to the owl – 113 pages – and by that time the reader has settled into a comfortable tale of Charles’s semi-requited love for Landford’s intriguing sculptor girlfriend. Charles is a realistically self-deprecatory narrator. He relishes the fact that “the Fryernes had achieved a kind of obscurity so comprehensive as to be rather unusual in its way”. He is so lacking in self-confidence that, despite his dislike of ostentation, he joins an expensive Bullingdon-style dining club at Oxford just because he has been invited. By his own account, his sole virtue is his inability to tell a lie, and yet for some inexplicable reason he is inveigled into helping the odious Landford achieve his political ambitions. Since he clearly loathes Landford, this leaves you wondering why.</p> <p>There are other plot anomalies. When the Tory leader of the opposition resigns, the loyalist Landford is considered one of just two possible candidates to replace him, despite being so new that he has never served on the government or opposition frontbench – something that has never happened in Britain. Similarly unconvincing is the Tory MP (he is meant to be the likable one) who is made to say: “I am very, very important. There’s even talk – although, being you, you either haven’t heard or don’t care – of me becoming a junior minister one of these days.” I have never heard an MP speak like that. Yes, people see MPs – me included – as arrogant and narcissistic, but if a politician were to mouth off like that, he would be slain by the press, by Twitter or by his colleagues in very short order.</p> <p>The least credible plot twist of all is when a newspaper deliberately outs a leading Tory MP as gay. There is, thankfully, no UK newspaper that would do that today. They might tease readers, make indirect allusions and even place a photograph of the MP on the same page as a story about another gay man – but none would be so crass, scurrilous or immoral as to out someone. It’s true that snide wink-wink innuendo used to be the order of the day when it came to matters of sexuality. I recall, for instance, driving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> down to the Christchurch byelection in 1993 and explaining to him why the Lib Dems referred to the Tory candidate, Rob Hayward, as “unmarried”. It worked for the Liberal Democrats in their despicable 1983 campaign in which they presented the byelection as a “straight choice” between Peter Tatchell and Simon Hughes. But no British politician or party today would seek to use an opponent’s sexuality against him or her – if only because it would backfire.</p> <p>This isn’t an attempt at political verisimilitude. It’s a delightful gothic fantasy, infused with an element of taut anger. But one day someone will write a novel that shines a light on modern British politics. It will have credible characters and a believable plot – and it will get the simple diurnal facts about politics right. I live in hope.</p> <p>• Chris Bryant is MP for Rhondda and shadow leader of the House of Commons.

Possets were served in ceramic posset pots, which looked a bit like a teapot with two handles. They were usually very decorative and extremely expensive to buy. This dish is therefore one of a high standard. Posset was originally more of a drink than a pudding and was often given to people in rich households when they were feeling unwell.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>My Lord of Carlisle’s Sack-Posset</em></p> <p><em>Take a pottle of Cream, and boil in it a little whole Cinnamon, and three or four flakes of Mace. To this proportion of Cream put in eighteen yolks of eggs, and eight of the whites; a pint of Sack; beat your eggs very well, and then mingle them with your Sack. Put in three quarters of a pound of Sugar into the Wine and Eggs, with a Nutmeg grated, and a little beaten Cinnamon; set the Bason on the fire with the Wine and Eggs, and let it be hot. Then put in the Cream boiling from the fire, pour it on high, but stir it not; cover it with a dish, and when it is settlede, strew on the top a little fine Sugar mingled with three grains of Ambergreece, and one grain of Musk, and serve it up. </em></p> <p><em>Sir Kenelm Digby, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Closet_of_the_Eminently_Learned_Sir_Kenelme_Digbie_Kt._Opened\">The Closet of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened, 1669</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>The Recipe<br /></h2> <p><strong>Makes 8–10 posset pots or teacups<br />850ml (29 fl oz) thin (pouring) cream<br />1 cinnamon stick<br />1 mace blade<br />6 egg yolks<br />3 egg whites<br />230ml (7¾ fl oz) sherry or Madeira (for an alcohol-free posset, use orange or lemon juice)<br />100g (3½ oz) raw sugar</strong></p> <p>In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer with the spices, then remove from the heat.</p> <p>Whisk the egg yolks and whites in a clean saucepan, then pour in the sherry (or juice, if preferred) and sugar.

de force. Thursday marks her birthday: but why has Leduc been left in the margins?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The explicitly sexual tell-all memoir, with its eager flirtations with the pornographic and dislocations of heterosexuality, has blossomed in the US and France in recent years. But Violette Leduc, who did it all and said it all more than 50 years ago, is a ghostly presence in its genealogy.</p> <p>It is a mysterious marginalisation: Simone de Beauvoir, who took on Leduc as a protege, remains a feminist icon. Leduc’s contemporary Jean Genet, also wrote sexually explicit, homosexual texts and is widely read and venerated as a pioneer in French avant-garde writing. Not so Leduc. Her first book, the autobiographical novel L’Asphyxie, has still not been translated into English. Her novel Thérèse and Isabelle, written in 1955, was not published uncensored in France until 2000 and was only translated and published in English by the Feminist Press last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Leduc’s feminist education came not from books or cafe chats but from her mother’s exhortations at the breakfast table</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A journey through Leduc’s rejections, documented in her autobiographies La Bâtarde (1964) and Mad in Pursuit (1970), lay bare the insidious gatekeeping that money and masculinity exert on literary inclusion, then and now. Leduc was born poor and illegitimate; her mother is the help, her father is the heir and she, the child of their furtive union, is unwanted. Her single mother has to scrounge and serve, always skirting the boundaries of respectability until she finally finds a “respectable” husband. For much of her childhood, Leduc’s feminist education comes not from books and café chats but from her mother’s exhortations, delivered at the breakfast table. She learns about men from her mother: “There wasn’t a single among them to redeem the race as a whole. To take advantage of you, that was their aim. I must get that into my head and never forget it. Swine. All swine.”</p> <p>Predictably, Leduc’s early childhood is peopled entirely by women. Her mother’s angst at her sickliness and illegitimacy is tempered by the unconditional love of her grandmother, Fideline. Her death, when Leduc is nine or ten, marks the end of her childhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/28/therese-isabelle-violette-leduc-review\">Thérèse and Isabelle by Violette Leduc – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When her mother finally marries, Leduc, installed at a boarding school, feels bereft and betrayed, now an outsider in the home her mother is making with another man. The love she believes she cannot find at home she looks for in other girls – and women, having an affair with her music instructor who was later fired. Her first sexual encounter, erotically rendered in both Thérèse and Isabelle (where it is fictionalised) and La Bâtarde (where it is not), reveals a writer exceptionally gifted in rendering the depth and passion of sex. Lust, its fever, its delicacy and its delusions, are here - and throughout Leduc’s work – is overwhelming, the basis for all human connection, its construction and destruction.</p> <p>It is no surprise that when she finally meets Simone de Beauvoir in 1945 (after months of stalking her at Paris’s Cafe Flore), her obsession is as much sexual as intellectual. De Beauvoir, the privileged product of elite schools, takes Leduc under her wing and encourages her to write. Leduc’s first novel, L’Asphyxie, is published by France’s premier publishing house, Gallimard, thanks to De Beauvoir’s efforts. After De Beauvoir rejects her sexually, Le Duc writes of her devastation: “She has explained that the feeling I have for her is a mirage. I don’t agree.” The word wounds her in its implication that her starved longing for love is somehow less than real – or in De Beauvoir’s terms, less authentic. “My life lies elsewhere,” Beauvoir writes in a letter to Leduc, and Leduc correctly guesses that her lover, the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre “is inside that word ‘elsewhere’”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60c321f44e34d2d99b082e8648a67e6489d4f1a2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/60c321f44e34d2d99b082e8648a67e6489d4f1a2/0_591_1881_1131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone de Beauvoir and French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in Paris, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, in Paris, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The juxtaposition of De Beauvoir and Leduc is revelatory in terms of who defines feminism and who actually lives it. Here is Leduc, a woman made feminist by experience: a fatherless, poverty-stricken childhood, a youth spent grovelling for affection and sustenance, her wartime hustle smuggling legs of lamb to rich Parisians. Her autobiography painfully and pointedly underscores her constant alienation, her surfeit of emotion. Ever the outsider, she steals, she smuggles; when she reads and learns, it is in bits and pieces. Days spent writing are imbued with worries about eating, surviving. Uninterested in branding and constructing her own myth, she bluntly tells De Beauvoir that she is not an intellectual. This annoys her mentor, to whom Leduc recalls retorting: “You are an intellectual because you write.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A provincial woman, a smuggler, a lesbian who lived wildly and loved madly was not part of the French cultural narrative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>De Beauvoir spent her time earning the title “intellectual”. Her story is one of early erudition, acing exams, stunning philosophical acuity and a romantic (if also conveniently strategic) alliance with Sartre. In Leduc, she sees the authenticity that she theorises, and in playing midwife to her self-exposition she seeks the vindication of her philosophy. In existentialism, we are all free to choose, exercise our radical free will; the constraints of past experience can be shaken off, truth told and freedom achieved. Leduc’s life, told in her writing, has to be evidence of the truth of this. De Beauvoir’s feminism, unleavened by any literal struggles with the whims of men, needs Leduc’s literary liberation to prove its practical application.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/06/10-inspiring-female-writers-you-need-to-read\">10 inspiring female writers you need to read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet it is only De Beauvoir’s prescient and crisply analysed feminism that we remember and celebrate. The lived feminism of Leduc – raw, passionate, and devastatingly honest – is what we choose to forget. There are contemporary iterations to this divide: like Leduc, the women <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/china/21577396-supply-female-factory-workers-dwindles-blue-collar-women-gain-clout-girl-power\">fighting the battles on the factory floors of China</a>, or in the classrooms of Egypt or the streets of Karachi do not have the luxury of writing their lives and finding liberation. The lived feminisms of the women who clean French hotel rooms, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/nothings-changed-10-years-after-french-riots-banlieues-remain-in-crisis\">eke out lives in banlieues</a>, who are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/20/schools.france\">expelled from schools for wearing headscarves</a>, are absent from the country’s feminist and literary narrative. </p> <p>It is still De Beauvoir’s compelling feminist recipe that one wants to believe. It is, however, Leduc’s truth that presses closer: speaking of De Beauvoir’s prescription, she says: “To write is to be liberate oneself. Untrue. To write is to change nothing.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leduc would have been 109 on Thursday; she passed away in 1972.

John Metcalf’s charming London A to Z, from 1953, is a potent reminder of what is lost if you let a city morph into a global currency reserve","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>If you are tired of period guides to London, as I was saying to Dr Johnson the other day, you must be tired of life. Just take a look at John Metcalf’s London A to Z.</p> <p>No, no that one. This slim volume, recently rediscovered, is a guide to points of interest in the city, rather than a map. Entries run from ACHILLES STATUE (“One of the bigger, bronzier, nuder of Victorian statues”) to ZEBRA CROSSING and ZOOS, brought to life with line drawings by Edward Bawden, who also illustrated the book jacket. Published in 1953 to help the hordes of visitors descending on the British capital during the Queen’s coronation, it was always intended as an idiosyncratic rather than comprehensive guide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/may/22/london-through-eyes-graphic-designer-edward-bawden\">London through the eyes of illustrator and graphic designer Edward Bawden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book’s charm and distinctive voice (despite there probably being multiple contributors and no actual Mr Metcalf) endure in entries such as the ALBERT MEMORIAL: “Long the target, through the 20s and 30s, of the mockery of aesthetes, it is now enjoying a certain vogue amongst the sort of people who use the words ‘quaint’ and ‘charming’”. In the hidden, unchanging world of the INNS OF COURT, writes the author, “the whole fibre of London’s noise comes only faintly to you, muted and muffled by the centuries”. </p> <p>And on the statue of EROS in Piccadilly Circus: “That this inconsequential statue, balanced precariously on one foot, should stand in the centre of solid London, is a typical paradox of the English character. Anyway, we like it.” </p> <p>Many of the other entries, of course, offer a window on to a world long gone, from BARROW BOY (“the modern and somewhat more sophisticated counterpart of the Cockney costermonger”) to FLEET STREET (“the newspaper headquarters of an Empire … In it work the people who make news about the people who make news”). Meanwhile, POLICEMEN (Metropolitan and City) are recognisable by “a deliberateness of gait, a slow helpfulness of manner and a near-divine sense of dignity. Impossible to shock or ruffle, you’ll find them, even in the most unlikely circumstances, your friends.” O tempora. O mores.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you hollow out the likes of Soho and overwrite history with glass and steel you are losing something precious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This timely republication reminds us of a confident, colourful London, a city that can survive and thrive without being in thrall to foreign money. It reminds us of what is lost if you let a city’s buildings become a global reserve currency instead of homes, businesses, nightclubs (skanky, fancy and everything in between). It throws into relief the short-termism of current thinking about London and suggests (though it does not dream of the possibility) that if you hollow out the likes of Soho and overwrite history with glass and steel you lose something precious.</p> <p>Occasionally, there is a last glimpse of a world that was vanishing even as the book was written. After LOST PROPERTY, for instance, comes LOVELY SWEET VIOLETS – “one of London’s last-remaining street cries – of the septuagenarian flower girls of Piccadilly Circus”. And there are many more that are taking on a spectral aspect in our own time: “There will be a POST OFFICE quite near you, wherever you are”; “There are free PUBLIC LIBRARIES in every borough”; “Under the National Health Scheme, treatment by doctors and at hospitals is free”. That sort of thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f861f50447b30c93634d6adedff95b29fc8a7d6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7f861f50447b30c93634d6adedff95b29fc8a7d6/0_0_4925_6026/817.jpg\" alt=\"Page pic from London A-Z 18-19 LA LAZ\" width=\"817\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Literally ... a page from the London A to Z, showing Edward Bawden’s line drawings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thames and Hudson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It offers a record of quaint traditions, striking statuary (the bronzier and nuder the better, in my opinion) and important institutions (from dining clubs to the city guilds – Armourers and Brasiers, Broderers, Cordwainers, Loriners, Paviors, Poulters and more). But what really makes it a period piece is its loving attitude towards the past – teased sometimes, but not mocked, respected but not revered – and towards the present. </p> <p>This is a London – a world – which is scared neither by the Then or the Now. The then brand-new-and-not-yet-royal FESTIVAL HALL (“an exhilarating example of modern architecture, and acoustically perfect”) is as gloried in as Hampton Court. DELICATESSENS, “many of them with special Continental importations”, are as welcome a presence on the teeming scene as DEBUTANTES, the STONE OF SCONE (“now tucked safely underneath the coronation chair again”) and ST JAMES’S PALACE (“originally founded by Edward I as a hospital for 14 leprous virgins”).</p> <p>You cannot read a book that looks happily backwards, around and forwards and not want to beat your head against the nearest current policymaker in his hatred of the underleveraged present. Once the city is scrubbed clean of its layers of history, the folk memory of loriners and poulters, and the smell of lovely sweet violets, once the fibre of London is finally buried by this new century, it will have no future because the people who could bring it will have no reason to come.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/London_A_to_Z/9780500292471\">John Metcalf’s London A to Z </a> is published by Thames and Hudson.</li> </ul>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t5xh","wordcount":"788","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/0384012e8cf85ade41dd5e5eec0f6f22fc376389/15_24_1170_702/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-12T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Does the current London mayor know his barrow boys from his lovely sweet violets?

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"715","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45xtn","wordcount":"3166","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608387704/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you.

great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"439","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1024","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This
