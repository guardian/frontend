        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya\">Surabaya</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/antananarivo\">Antantanarivo</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quelimane\">Quelimane</a> – exotic places with names evoking mystique and a sense of adventure. How about <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/\">Kakadu</a> – or Gaagudju as it was known before white settlement?</p> <p>It’s a name which conjures images of wilderness where time is oblivious to the protocols of place names or designations such as World Heritage Site. It is, nonetheless, a domain sensitive to the effects of too much love or too little respect. The nearby monolith, Uluru has also been classified a globally significant site where ancient culture now amazes and provokes visitors from around the world.</p> <p>This new four-part series (<strong>ABC1, Sundays 7.30pm</strong>), narrated by Tom E Lewis and superbly photographed by Luke Petersen and Nick Robinson, offers an intensely personal view of the area through the activities of people entrusted with maintaining its integrity while simultaneously providing access to its wonders.</p> <p>The first thing to become obvious as the exploration unfolds, is that those who manage and protect the land are superbly attuned to the physical and the spiritual concerns of the work. This is stewardship of a natural resource upheld with unswerving belief and sensitivity for the balance between careful exploitation and preservation for the future.</p> <p>“Our land is our life, we have to protect it forever” says one savvy ranger. “Money doesn’t mean anything to me” says Jeffery Lee, a traditional owner. &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”</p> <p>Fair enough. Tourists, while generating income, are essentially the most vulnerable and least necessary element in a complex eco-structure involving insects, microscopic creatures, plants, animals, reptiles, birds and aquatic animals such as the formidable saltwater crocodiles which have survived the searing heat and flooding rains of the region for millions of years.</p> <p>World Heritage listing of Kakadu, which is one third the size of Tasmania and half the size of Switzerland, began in 1981 and was formally completed in 1992.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f498b12-8245-46a7-9a98-1f6fd23f0190\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381034430611/9adc0f26-ce3f-4949-b2a0-c982c0a7e08c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jeff Lee Kakadu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jeffrey Lee: &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”&nbsp;Photograph: /ABC</figcaption> </figure> <p>About 500 people live within its borders but upwards of 250,000 visitors come to the region annually and their safety is a key thread through the series - seen through the work of wildlife officers charged with ensuring crystal clear escarpment rivers and murky billabongs aren’t reservoirs of disasters for the unwary or outright foolish that are arrogant enough to turn a blind eye to the bleeding obvious. They occasionally end up&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the bleeding obvious.</p> <p>Traditional owners such as Jeffery Lee can see beyond these clear and present dangers to the long-term peril of permitting insensitive and greedy operators to ruin the place. How uranium mines can be condoned inside Kakadu is as much a cause for bewilderment as the natural wonders which constitute the real wealth of the park.</p> <p>Viewers join cheerful botanists, environmental scientists, anthropolgists and rangers – not your standard Steve Irwin model – and naturalists such as Anne O’Dea and Ian Morris as they patrol.</p> <p>Fire is one of the elements that defines Kakadu. It can serve man and, equally, place him in grave jeopardy – as illustrated during an encounter with Steve Anderson, Jabiru’s fire officer and his band of “Angels”.</p> <p>They tackle a potentially lethal&nbsp;blaze – probably started by an unextinguished campfire – threatening their community. The stewards of Kakadu also have to deal with man-made disasters such as the devastation created by the misguided introduction of cane toads into Queensland in 1935. As a consequence no king brown snakes or giant spotted goannas, previously prolific, can be seen in 200 X 100 km park. Other species at risk, like the Northern Quoll, are being trained to avoid the toads and their toxic venom.</p> <p>It’s a salutary example of the balance of Nature being upset. Humans can at least be steered into compliance or obedience, and recreational anglers coming to fish for Barramundi or crabs find the law is enforced rigorously – a little too decently you might think after a confrontation between rangers Garry Lindner, his offsider, Andrew Wellings, and a boofheaded poacher.</p> <p>There are moments when the series veers into the style of reality documentary where actuality is accentuated and over-dramatised but by and large, the overwhelming reality of the place defines an eminently watchable series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419167641|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|dcdf731fab828e6d4db67330bab8d57da2595ac8 -->",

        "headline":"Michael J Fox: 'Nobody pities me and that's great. I couldn't stand it'",
        "body":"<p>When Michael J Fox walks into the reception of his office in New York, he arrives like a bantam-weight boxer ready for a fight. It is not so much the way he moves, although that is partly why he gives that impression, his weight shifting restlessly from foot to foot. \"I feel like I'm dangling from a coat hanger, with my toes scraping and kicking at the ground,\" he writes in his excellent autobiography, Lucky Man, describing the effects of Parkinson's disease, which for more than two decades now has racked his body.</p><p>What really gives him the appearance of a readying boxer is the look in his eyes. Whenever Fox meets someone for the first time, he slips on this look as instinctively as others shuck on a jacket when they leave the house. It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;proud and confrontational look, honed from 20 years of dealing with people's initial reaction to him, stricken at what has happened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/aug/31/the-10-best-time-travellers\" title=\"\">Marty McFly</a>, who once moved with such grace on a skateboard.</p><p>\"Hi, thanks so much for coming,\" he murmurs, his right arm swinging out to grab my hand. We are exactly the same height – 5ft 4in (1.63 metres) – and he looks me straight in the eye for a few seconds before leading me into his office, which is decorated with Emmy awards, classic guitars (Johnny B Goode!) and photos of him and his wife Tracy Pollan and their four children.</p><p>\"Is the chair OK? Right, so …\" he says, sitting on the sofa and looking up,&nbsp;ready.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107805'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904961767/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the comedy Spin City, which he left in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue.</figcaption></figure><p>The reason Fox has agreed to endure this journalist's reaction to him is because he is promoting his new sitcom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/28/michael-j-fox-parkinsons-disease-sitcom\" title=\"\">The Michael J Fox Show</a>. It is his first since he left the highly lauded Spin City in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue. Although Fox is best known internationally for his films – Back to the Future, Teen Wolf, Doc Hollywood – he&nbsp;has always been TV gold in America. He was launched to fame on the hugely successful 1980s sitcom Family Ties as Alex P Keaton, the Republican son of hippie parents. Since leaving Spin City, Fox has appeared in several TV shows to great acclaim, including his friend Denis Leary's show Rescue Me (for which he won an Emmy), The Good Wife, Boston Legal, Scrubs and, most amusingly, as himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm, in which Larry David accuses him of exaggerating his Parkinson's symptoms to annoy him (\"I thought I was the sickest guy on this block but you're the new champ,\" Fox replies.) American networks vied fiercely for Fox's new show and it is difficult to walk for more than two blocks in New York without seeing a giant advert for the 22-episode series. It is an extraordinary achievement for a&nbsp;52-year-old man who was told when he was 30 that he would be lucky if he could still work when he was 40. He takes special pride in having defied the doctors' prognosis, just as he would once defy school sports coaches who would look at his slight build and pick him last for a team: \"If you pick me last, I will do everything I can to make you look like a fool,\" he says.</p><p>The show tells the story of Mike&nbsp;Henry, a news anchor who retired five years previously because of Parkinson's and has now decided to return to work. It is an avowedly traditional sitcom and, judging from the pilot, it hasn't quite figured out how to let Fox display the sparkiness and bite in which he always excelled as a comic actor. But for those of us who grew up watching Fox, it is a&nbsp;joy to see him working again, and it is a sentiment he echoes.</p><p>\"Denis [Leary] told me after I did Curb that I should get back to work, and I&nbsp;wanted to, to create a world and entertain people. There is also a satisfaction in knowing that maybe you're doing something bigger, but that's not for me to ponder. However, if&nbsp;the show does cure humanity's ills, that's cool,\" he says drily.</p><p>But Fox clearly set out to make some points about Parkinson's through the show (as well as being the star, he is the executive producer.) It is repeatedly emphasised that, while the public sees&nbsp;his character Mike purely as a man with Parkinson's, applauding whenever he enters a room, Mike's family does not. They make no allowances for him, grabbing food from under his nose that he is too slow to eat, and that is just what he wants.</p><p>\"A lot of times, people who are in a health situation become the observed patient and other people project their own feelings on to them: 'No, you're too tired to go there,' 'No, you don't want that.' But I don't want to make my&nbsp;life more complicated by accepting other people's projections of me, or making my own projections about how they should deal with me,\" he says, reaching for a water bottle, which he wrestles with studied practice towards his mouth.</p><p>His children have never known him without Parkinson's: his son was born in 1989, two years before his diagnosis, his twin daughters were born in 1995 and his youngest daughter was born in 2001. \"So for them, it's just part of the household. If you asked my kids to describe me, they'd go through a whole list of words before even thinking about Parkinson's. And honestly, I&nbsp;don't think about it that much either. I talk about it because it's there, but it's not my totality,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107806'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380905081768/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>With his wife, actor Tracy Pollan, last month. Photograph: Jeff Vespa/WireImage</figcaption></figure><p>The pilot also stresses that Mike and his wife have a&nbsp;very happy physical relationship, showing them scampering into the bedroom and frequently touching one another. Was this a point Fox wanted to&nbsp;make clear to the public?</p><p>\"Yeah, it's important. When people ask me about my relationship with my wife, I say that it all depends who's the agent of motion at that time. But other than that it's all good,\" he replies, and although his face can't quite make the smile, the grin is in his voice.</p><p>Fox is still as boyishly handsome as he was when he appeared in Back to the Future at the age of 24, and the voice is the same one that once begged Doc Brown to return him to 1985. Born and raised in Canada in a military family where money wasn't plentiful, Fox started acting in his teens, partly for fun and partly for the cash. He has not needed the money in a long time, and he writes in his book about how much luckier he has been than most early-onset Parkinson's patients, who suffer crippling financial problems when they are forced out of work.</p><p>The&nbsp;first 20 minutes or so when we sit&nbsp;down are when he is at his most unsteady, and twitches and cramps roll&nbsp;through his body like water rolling over a rocky riverbed. After he was diagnosed with Parkinson's, he hid his&nbsp;illness from the public for years and he still sometimes tries to incorporate his tremors into seemingly deliberate gestures: an arm in sudden spasm will be forced upwards as though he simply meant to smooth his hair. Yet he never loses his strand of thought, and even if he struggles to find a word occasionally, he always gets it in the end.</p><p>His mental alertness is so vivid that I&nbsp;soon don't notice the physical shifts, which eventually calm from waves to&nbsp;small ripples anyway. He is also extremely funny and, as Fox says himself, the best way to overturn pity is to find the humour. When I ask him whether the secret to his and his wife's happy 25-year marriage is love or friendship, he replies without missing a beat: \"Regular animal sacrifices.\" When I later tell him that he looks in great shape, he replies with an audible wink: \"I move around a lot, you know.\"</p><p>Although Fox insists, \"I never set out to be heroic\", he knows that he is,&nbsp;nonetheless, the public face of Parkinson's. In the past, some people with the condition have criticised him&nbsp;for appearing on talkshows after taking his medication, thereby not showing the true effects of the illness. At the other extreme, radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh displayed the ignorance and cruelty for which he is so handsomely paid when he mocked Fox in 2006 for \"exaggerating the effects of the disease\" when he appeared in a political advert unmedicated. Does he feel conflicted about how best to present the disease to the public?</p><p>\"No, not at all. I take the medication for myself so I can transact, not for anyone else. But I am aware that it is empowering for people to see what I&nbsp;do and, for the most part, people in the Parkinson's community are just really happy that Parkinson's is getting mentioned, and not in a pitying way,\" he replies.</p><p>Fox has an absolute horror of being pitied and that is almost certainly another factor in his return to work.</p><p>\"Because of all the things I've done, nobody pities me, and that's great. I&nbsp;couldn't stand it,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107807'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904795095/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='200' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>As Marty McFly in the 1985 film Back to the Future. Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>Some people might have wanted a bit of pity if they were diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 30 with a young family, I say. He shakes his head sharply: \"Pity is just another form of abuse.\"</p><p>This determination to control the reaction to his illness also lies behind his well-known optimism. As the title to his autobiography makes clear, he considers getting Parkinson's \"a gift\", albeit \"one that keeps on taking\", and he has been an unflappable advocate in&nbsp;finding a cure. His eponymous foundation has raised more than $350m to fund research into Parkinson's and despite facing hurdles that would fell many – the Bush administration's opposition to stem cell research, for example – he has continued with determined equanimity. It took a few years to find this optimism and when he was first diagnosed he used to \"punch and pummel\" his arm when it started twitching. But these days, he is full of epigrams about looking on the bright side and some of his phrases feel as worn down as an ocean-tossed pebble, smoothed through years of repetition to reporters, his family, himself: \"You get what you get and you don't get upset\", \"It is what it is.\" He knows that some people might doubt the veracity of his attitude: \"But all my happy talk and rah-rah cheering, that's as real as someone else's anger. I chose not to choose anger,\" he says.</p><p>It was really his wife who helped him to make that choice. Fox and Pollan met when she played his girlfriend on Family Ties and he was helplessly smitten when she told him off one day for being rude. They got married in 1988.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tracy, I don't doubt that. People picture Tracy as this paragon of stoicism, this long-suffering wife, and that's all bullshit. This is my situation and she deals with it, and I never feel like, 'I'm sorry you have to put up with this' – it's nothing like that. When I told her about the Parkinson's I said to her, 'Are you in for this?' and she said, 'I'm in for it.' And that was it. It was still a struggle but that was a really great moment. She is so funny and she puts up with my happy idiot persona.\" Also, he adds with a look of delight, \"She is so HOT! Sometimes I look at her and I&nbsp;just can't believe it!\"</p><p>Fox has the tendency of those who have been through therapy to look at his past and see patterns and answers. As a celebrity, he grew used to the staring, the whispering, the sense of a&nbsp;loss of a control. When, in the late 80s, his drinking was getting out of hand (\"I&nbsp;come from a Canadian background: you drink to the point of saturation\"), he employed the same tools to dry up that he would later use to cope with Parkinson's: \"Accepting your powerlessness with grace.\"</p><p>So fame and alcoholism helped prepare him for Parkinson's?</p><p>\"Exactly. It was perfect.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107808'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904631733/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the 1985 film Teen Wolf. Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>When Fox was first diagnosed with Parkinson's, after noticing his little finger twitching during the filming of Doc Hollywood, he was at a tricky point in his career. Family Ties and the Back to the Future franchise had ended and he, along with many other 80s teen idols, was realising that audiences were not so sure if they wanted to see him play a grownup. He grabbed any role he could, appearing in the underrated The Hard Way and the more successful but less smart Doc Hollywood. When he was diagnosed he decided to appear only in things he actually liked, starting with a return to TV in Spin City and doing the voiceover in Stuart Little. Would he have been able to step back if he hadn't become ill?</p><p>\"I don't think so – there was too much ego going on. I also don't think I&nbsp;could have curtailed my drinking without [the diagnosis], and maybe my wife and I would have drifted apart because of that. I don't know.\" This is why he believes getting Parkinson's was a gift. But while he no longer resents getting the disease, he definitely wants to find the cure.</p><p>Fox has spoken in the past with moving certainty about the likelihood of a cure being found imminently and how he plans to \"dance at my children's weddings\". Does he still think about&nbsp;it?</p><p>\"Finding a cure? I don't view that as&nbsp;something that will happen in my lifetime,\" he says.</p><p>I'm astonished at this crack in the optimism. Really?</p><p>He looks, for the first time, a little sad: \"That's – that's not my purpose, to find a cure for myself, and that's not noble of me, that's just the way it goes. But I know somebody will one day figure it out,\" he says, and he takes another drink of water.</p><p>Fox's office is on the ground floor of the Upper East Side apartment building where he lives with his family. It is&nbsp;a rarefied, leafy neighbourhood, peppered with museums and private schools, just two blocks from where his wife lived as a child, and he clearly loves being a part of her world, which is so far from the one in which he grew up. When he talks about his wife's childhood, I mention that I, too, grew up a few blocks away.</p><p>\"What school did you go to?\" he immediately asks, like the New York dad he is.</p><p>I mention a nearby school and his eyes pop happily: \"That's where my girls went!\" I try to return to asking questions about him, but he's not having any of it: \"So you're one of those girls! Now I get it. Wow!\" he grins and looks at me in an almost paternal way. He proceeds to reel off the names of teachers I'd long forgotten: \"Did you have her? She was quite imperious and frightening.\"</p><p>At the end of our time together, I ask him for something that I have never before asked of an interviewee: a photo. He cheerfully agrees and slings an arm over my shoulders as I fumble with my phone. Afterwards he forces his arms around my body, cradling me with fatherly care. Back outside I&nbsp;look down at my phone. In each of the pictures, his face is&nbsp;slightly blurred due to the tremors. But his gaze never wavers and his eyes stare straight back at the viewer, hard and clear and bright.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419099563|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|8ce1d2d2250e58b601dc81b6ef3882f923ab1f07 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ayub Khan-Din began his career as an actor, starring in the 1987 film <em>Sammy and Rosie Get Laid</em>, and making small screen appearances in soaps such as <em>Coronation Street </em>during the 1990s. Born in Salford, his experience of growing up in a British-Pakistani family inspired his first stage play, <em>East Is East</em>, which was nominated for a Laurence Olivier award in 1998. The following year saw the release of the critically acclaimed film adaptation, with a sequel, <em>West is West,</em> in 2010.  His latest adaptation brings ER Braithwaite's novel, <em>To Sir, With Love</em>, to the stage and is touring the UK.</p><h2><strong>Qawwali Flamenco by Faiz Ali Faiz, Duquende, Miguel Poveda and Chicuelo</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096167'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883894394/Faiz-Ali-Faiz.-001.jpg' alt='Faiz Ali Faiz.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Faiz Ali Faiz. Photograph: Stephanie Paschal/Rex</figcaption></figure><p>I love the passion in flamenco and qawwali music. There are many similarities between the two. I've seen both [genres] played live individually, but never on the same stage. I listen to music all the time, especially when I am working.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/fiction.features2\">Family Matters by Rohinton Mistry</a></strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096168'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883924919/Rohinton-Mistry.-001.jpg' alt='Rohinton Mistry.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rohinton Mistry. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I love this book because it gives you a real taste of life within the Parsi community of Mumbai. I lived for about five months in Mumbai and the book is written about the period which I was there, so it brings back lots of memories. I love Indian writers because they all have such a strong influence on the areas of India that they come from and for me, as a writer, it's almost like a shorthand to be able to revisit those places. Rohinton Mistry writes fantastic dialogue as well, so you really get a sense of the personalities on the page.</p><h2><strong>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096169'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380885111581/The-Metropolitan-Museum-o-001.jpg' alt='The Metropolitan Museum of Art.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Photograph: Brooks Walker</figcaption></figure><p>I had a musical on Broadway in which I had to take over the lead part because, after the second performance, my leading actor fell down some steps, damaged his arm and couldn't go on. Either the show folded and lost over a million dollars or I took over. I ended up taking over for the whole run, so I was in New York for three or four months. I went to the Metropolitan Museum, which I thought was absolutely amazing. You could spend weeks going around the exhibits there. They've got this whole Egyptian temple (the Temple of Dendur) that they managed to save when the Aswan Dam was built, which I thought might be dull but they've done it so well.</p><h2><strong>Granada, Spain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096170'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883955970/The-Alhambra-in-Granada-S-001.jpg' alt='The Alhambra in Granada, Spain.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Photograph: Miguel Angel Molina/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>This is my local city. It's a stunning place to visit – I'd recommend it to anybody. They have the Alhambra, within which there's another palace where they have open-air concerts right through the year. We went to see a Spanish guitarist play there. Below the Alhambra there's the old Moorish town, a place called Albayzín, which is a maze of streets like you'd find in a North African souk.</p><h2><strong>Pippin at the Music Box Theatre, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096171'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884186784/The-cast-of-Broadways-Pip-001.jpg' alt='The cast of Broadway's Pippin.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cast of Broadway's Pippin. Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Pippin is an old musical which was on in the 1970s, but they've just redone it. The producer who worked on my musical (Bunty Berman Presents) produced this one as well. They've updated it and Cirque du Soleil play a major part in it. We took our kids along and it just blew their minds. I was never liked musicals at drama school, and when I told my friends I'd written one which was going on Broadway they laughed their heads off.</p><h2><strong>Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life, Tate Britain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096172'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884069042/The-Fever-Van-1935-by-LS--001.jpg' alt='The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry.' width='220' height='178' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry. Photograph: Walker Art Gallery/Tate</figcaption></figure><p>I grew up in Salford, [home of the] original gallery where most of the paintings were kept. It was a big old Victorian gallery with peeling paint. As young as 11 or 12, I used to go there and spend hours looking at the paintings, so it was great to see them in this exhibition, with a new appreciation of his work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419005195|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|15577eed63701ac195866a17334dae2f348eed6c -->",

        "headline":"All My Sons – review",
        "body":"<p>It hadn't occurred to me that there might be any issues attached to this Royal Exchange co-production with the black-led theatre company <a href=\"http://www.talawa.com/\" title=\"\">Talawa </a> of American playwright Arthur Miller's 1947 play. Then I read the correspondence on <a href=\"http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/event.aspx?id=717\" title=\"\">the Exchange's website</a>. People wondered whether the play would have to be directorially adjusted to accommodate a non-white cast. As far as I could see, Michael Buffong (who directed the award-winning production of Lorraine Hansberry's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/14/raisin-in-the-sun-hansberry\" title=\"\"><em>A Raisin in the Sun</em></a> for the Exchange in 2010) has made no changes to the text, nor were any necessary: skin colour is not Miller's theme; ideological orientation is.</p><p>A small businessman discovers that, to be fully human, he must look beyond the narrow limits of making money for his immediate family. In Miller's work, there is such a thing as society and we are all answerable to it. (I wonder: how many of the supposedly arts-loving Conservative party thronging the city visited the theatre during their conference visit?)When Don Warrington's Joe is finally forced to acknowledge that the strangers destroyed by his self-protective self-interest are \"all my sons\", the production reaches an intensity that fuses his statement into a declaration that is both emotionally wrenching and rationally convincing. Warrington is tremendous in this last act. So are Doña Croll, his ghost-haunted wife, and Chiké Okonkwo, his upright but blinkered surviving son. Each shatters the accretions of lies that have carapaced their characters with devastating precision.</p><p>On press night, the first two acts were less assured. Ellen Carins's set looks good, with its clapboard porch, garden benches and fallen apple tree (symbolically hinting at the lies that thread the play). But the dappled green lawn of the yard seemed too big for the actors, who fidgeted about trying to hit a collective rhythm. In a cast of 10, eight were making a first appearance at this demanding theatre in the round. It felt as if, as a company, they hadn't yet quite mastered the space. Hence, three stars on our new rating system. Given the quality of individual performances, though, I would expect that, by the time this review is published, it will be four (or more?).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983312|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|21fd04ac1aaf882df6d8fcceb670a02ae723de1d -->",

It’s 1997 and New York’s Manhattan Island has been converted into a maximum-security stockade surrounded by a 50ft “containment wall”. When Air Force One crash-lands and the president is captured by prisoners, special forces soldier-turned-bank-robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to get him out. Russell’s dry-witted, one-eyed antihero is the role of a lifetime, while the film’s look – high-tech police state outside, semi-destroyed cityscape inside – was partly created by a young James Cameron, then a special-effects artist, and proved hugely influential.",

Other homegrown highlights include Cath Staincliffe poking around Manchester's criminal underbelly, meanwhile, among the visiting names there is Neil Gaiman on his pirates-and-dinosaurs kids' adventure, and other highlights are ballet dancer-turned-writer Carlos Acosta, and Lionel Shriver who authors this year's Manchester Sermon.</p><p><strong><em>Various venues, Mon to 20 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>AB</em></p><h2>Yam Yam!, London</h2><p>Mixing food with theatre isn't for everyone, and those who tut at the unwrapping of a humbug probably won't have much fun here. But the combination makes perfect sense when trying to engage with audiences beyond the stage door and this festival uses creative imagination to do just that. There is a history of fried chicken to peruse, as well as cooking workshops that take in cuisine from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Plus, Jan Blake presents his stories about Mali, which should make for a delicious literary treat.</p><p><strong><em>The Albany, SE8, Sun to 16 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>FlipSide festival, Snape</h2><p>Rural Suffolk may not be the most obvious location for a festival of Brazilian literature, but that makes this weekend event all the more intriguing and appealing. Born out of a small Brazilian literary gathering called FLIP, this intimate festival presents Adriana Calcanhotto in concert tonight, preluded by Will Self in conversation with Bernardo Carvalho. British novelist Ian McEwan also talks with Milton Hatoum about his love of Brazil, his work and his inspirations.</p><p><strong><em>Snape Maltings, Sat &amp; Sun</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>Out &amp; about</h2><p><a href=\"http://powderhamfoodfestival.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Powderham food festival</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Devon foodies are joined by TVs Incredible Spice Men, Tony Singh and Cyrus Todiwala, who can tell their bhunas from their bhajis.</p><p><em>Powderham Castle, Saturday</em></p><p><a href=\"http://london.vegfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Veg Fest UK</strong></a><strong>, London, Saturday &amp; Sunday</strong></p><p>London leg of the huge herbivore gathering which features food (duh) plus comedy sets from Dave Spikey and the excellent Andrew O'Neill.</p><p><em>Olympia, W14</em></p><p><a href=\"http://cupararts.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cupar arts festival</strong></a><strong>, Saturday to 17 Oct</strong></p><p>Annual arts shindig in the Scottish market town; including art inspired by porridge oats.

        "body":"<p>Over-exposure has been a hot topic in pop discourse of late. Anyone holding Haim's current media ubiquity against them, though, might do well to contemplate the stranglehold on tittle-tattle and moral outrage exercised by one singer from Tennessee. She is currently embroiled in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\">ugly exchange with Sinéad O'Connor</a> over her raunchy image. Those easily shocked by calculation in pop should look away now.</p><p>Last spring, Miley Cyrus dropped a song called We Can't Stop. In tandem with its <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/miley-cyrus/we-cant-stop-music-video/1923501/\" title=\"\">ribald video</a>, it did unspeakable things to the memory of Hannah Montana, the tween star once played by Cyrus. A party anthem, this album's lead single endorses ecstasy (\"dancing with Molly\") and twerking, essentially the 21st-century US urban version of \"slack\" Jamaican dancehall moves. If the song sounds like a Rihanna number, <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1566461/miley-cyrus-we-cant-stop-originally-intended-for-rihanna\" title=\"\">that's because it nearly was</a>. When Cyrus twerked at MTV's Video Music awards back in August, <a href=\"http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125139/Miley-Cyrus-Raunchy-VMAs-Performance-Helps-Star-Gain-213104-Twitter-Followers-And-Sell-90000-Downloads\" title=\"\">her social media profile increased 112%</a>, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine. Then there was the video for Wrecking Ball, a power-ballad turbo-charged by the fact that Cyrus is starkers for much of the video, sometimes licking a mallet.</p><p>To coincide with the release of <em>Bangerz</em>, her fourth album, MTV US screened a documentary, <em>Miley Cyrus: The Movement</em>, that purported to show how <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/articles/mtv-miley-cyrus-the-movement-documentary/\" title=\"\">this brouhaha has been gleefully choreographed by a stage brat-turned-wild child</a>, one with a gimlet eye on the big time, whose last album – 2010's <em>Can't Be Tamed</em> – pretty much flopped. When it's not an almighty attention-seeking device, <em>Bangerz</em> is an album about very public heartbreak. In an announcement that chimed fortuitously with the build-up to <em>Bangerz</em>'s release, it was recently confirmed that Cyrus's four-year relationship with actor Liam Hemsworth is no more.</p><p>Against big odds, this craven album actually begins with the calm musical resolution of Adore You, a bid for the listener's sympathy, and one of its least showy and most successful cuts. Here are unhurried beats, a few chords and Cyrus's languorous vocal, \"ah\"-ing and \"hey\"-ing into a song about power imbalance in love.</p><p>As the title suggests, another heartbreak track, FU, is less resolved, but just as interesting. Here, Cyrus liberates her inner Christina Aguilera in the company of rapper French Montana, blending old-time jazzy balladry, I Put a Spell on You, romantic righteousness and dubstep sub-bass. Including recent US No 1 Wrecking Ball, the heartbreak section of <em>Bangerz</em> mostly repays your attention. More intriguing genre experiments follow – not least My Darlin', essentially a pimped-up version of Ben E King's Stand By Me.</p><p>But for all the mash-ups, <em>Bangerz</em> feels stitched together in the dark, and the attention-seeking begins to grate. Setting aside the sexual content of Cyrus's recent oeuvre, the crux of the internet chat has been her new fetish for R&amp;B and southern hip-hop. This really is not the first time a Southern white singer has appropriated poses first developed in African-American contexts (Elvis, Justin Timblerlake), or, indeed, the first time a former teen pop starlet has turned to R&amp;B for a raunchy style reboot (Aguilera, Britney Spears). Pharrell Williams, who mentored Cyrus through the project, is sympathetic (\"Why is she twerking?… She's a product of America,\" he says), but others feel uncomfortable with the <a href=\"http://www.waywordradio.org/ghetto_pass/\" title=\"\">\"ghetto pass\"</a> Cyrus has issued herself, like so much fake ID.</p><p>It might be a different story if many of the hip-hop- and R&amp;B-inspired cuts were better. SMS (Bangerz) is a bad rip-off of Salt-N-Pepa's Push It, with a phoned-in Britney guest spot. Love Money Party, meanwhile, finds Cyrus rapping a series of non-sequitur buzzwords, gibberish loosely connected by a bit of production, driven by the inescapable purpose of <em>Bangerz</em>: a desire to wind people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418843838|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ff9b832b68b1114a94add370d9a15bd0013e4cc1 -->",

        "body":"<p>He is the anonymous street art vigilante who uses the nondescript walls of cities to stage million-dollar exhibitions. In many places around the world, Banksy's graffiti art, with its strong political motifs, has become a cultural symbol and a community treasure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/02/bansky-arrives-new-york-street-art-residency\">This month he is in New York</a>, for what is expected to be a month-long residency featuring several new projects. </p><p>However, with great artistic acclaim and value comes a surge in commercialization. Many of Banksy's murals – prized greatly by art fans but even more so by private property owners – have been displaced and auctioned. In Los Angeles in August, a Banksy Flower Girl piece was removed from a gas station and put up for auction. The starting bid was $300,000. In February, <a href=\"link http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/11/banksy-slave-labour-mural-row-sale\">a piece entitled Slave Labour</a> disappeared under mysterious circumstances from a North London Poundland store, only to turn up in a Miami auction later that month, with an asking price of $700,000.</p><p>And then there are the Banksy pieces that have been put at risk simply because of their public nature. In Bristol, Gorilla in a Pink Mask was painted over by a building's new owners, who thought it was just a vandal's graffiti. In New York this week, Banksy's first mural was tagged by other artists within hours – before being erased entirely.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181710'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381065085579/Banksy-art-painted-over-N-008.jpg' alt='Banksy art painted over New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A piece in Manhattan's Lower East Side on Allen Street was painted over less than 24 hours after it was put up. Photograph: Alexander Ayer/Barcroft USA</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding such threats of removal or damage to public art, cities are faced with two questions: should they protect the art? And if so, how? Banksy's murals are most often public art drawn – illegally, in some cases – on private property. This raises issues of ownership and preservation.<br /> <br />Amy Adler, professor of art law at New York University, suggests that \"amendments to planning legislation are therefore a possible next step\", in order to empower public authorities to preserve art in public spaces. </p><p>In Los Angeles, legal proceedings were brought when a large mural by the artist Ed Ruscha, on private land, was suddenly painted over. This was one of the few instances in which a work of public art was protected under federal visual artists rights regulations, preserving the work even if the ownership of the physical property changes. </p><p>Adler contends, however, that in Banksy's case, \"for this to apply, Banksy himself would have to file for protection, which given his penchant for anonymity and illegality of his graffiti, he does not do\".</p><p>When a mural has been put on a publicly owned space, local authorities have greater power to decide what to do – in some cases, they have taken on the task of preservation themselves. In 2006, Bristol city council polled residents when a Banksy image appeared on a public clinic: 97% said they wanted it to stay. </p><p>However not everybody agrees that the art should be preserved. In New York, authorities reacted less kindly to a Wall Street rat painting, critical of corporate America, and Let Them Eat Crack was ordered to be painted over. Banksy's Pulp Fiction bananas suffered the same fate after Transport for London claimed it employed \"cleaners and not professional art critics\".</p><p>\"If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art,\" Robert Davis, the chairman of Westminster Council's planning committee, said at the time. \"To go and deface other people's property is graffiti. Just because he's famous doesn't give him that right.\" </p><p>Steven Thomas, a partner at the Irell &amp; Manella law firm in LA, lends supports to this stance, as \"the moral rights of Banksy are trumped by the fact trespass on the property took place. The building owner or local council can do as they wish\".</p><p>Local governments find themselves powerless when the piece is on private property, where the retention depends on the owner. The recent removal of Slave Labour from a convenience store wall in London was a sting to the local community who regarded it as a source of pride to an otherwise degenerate area. The local Haringey Council protested that public works should not be for private enjoyment. It was eventually sold in London, though not reinstalled on the wall.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181709'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381064472173/Banksy-in-New-York-008.jpg' alt='Banksy in New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Street art reading 'Playground Mob, The Musical', allegedly done by the Banksy, is seen in the Lower East Side. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011 John Webster of the University of Bristol, in Banksy's home town, suggested the addition public art to national historic registries. In the US, though, the National Register of Historic Places considers pieces of \"historical interest or great artistic value\", but only after at least 50 years. The UK only considers significant work after 15 years – but does protect it under a National Trust Lottery fund. Webster therefore proposes that an extension to criteria would have to be considered to incorporate protection for future generations.</p><p>Regarding the situation in the US, Phillipa Loengard, director at the Columbia Kernochan Center for Law and Arts, says: \"The problem with the register is that the whole building would have to be listed resulting in more bureaucracy with developers and owners.\" </p><p>She cites a recently overturned ordinance by the Los Angeles city council that now allows street artists to paint murals in public. </p><p>\"Cities should instead adopt something like the California Civil Code 989 which allows any community group to ask for protection by the building owner, if they fundraise for the preservation.\" </p><p>The legislation requires \"recognized quality\" and \"substantial public interest\" which is yet to be tested, but this could prove to be the way forward for many different communities.</p><p>Successful preservation has happened when local groups work directly with the artists and property owners to come to an agreement – something which is hard to do with a mysterious artist like Banksy. </p><p>Adler says: \"The real problem we have is the rich irony of cultural preservatio. The intention of the work is social change and vandalism. By trying to preserve it, it is contrary to the ethos of the work and subversive street culture.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419137912|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|808cd1c96d8ae0505c92e2314c19a37a824728d5 -->",

In fact, she wasn't even sure that her first album, released in 2011, was going to do particularly well.</p><p>\"My ambition was to sell 5,000 records,\" she says. \"I thought, if I do that, I'll be OK.\" She pauses and a smile creeps across her face. \"Obviously, it sold quite a lot more than &nbsp;that.\"</p><p>In fact, Anna Calvi's eponymous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/16/anna-calvi-debut-album-review\" title=\"\">debut</a> shifted more than 170,000 copies worldwide and was shortlisted for the Mercury prize. It marked the arrival of an extraordinary and uncompromising talent: with her swelling guitar chords, passionate lyrics and a voice that sounds like it comes from within an echoing cave of emotion, Calvi garnered rave reviews and was compared to Patti Smith by none other than Brian Eno (who is such an admirer that he sang backing vocals on two of the tracks).</p><p>At the age of 33, Calvi is about to release her second album, <em>One Breath</em>. Her signature sound is still there but there is, this time round, more light and shade at play in her songs. \"What she has more of now is subtlety,\" wrote one critic after a recent live gig. Calvi tries not to dwell too much on what other people might think of her.</p><p>\"The idea of trying to please people is dangerous because you're constantly trying to chase something that's elusive, that you'll never find,\" she says. \"I think the danger is if you put something out and you don't really like it yourself, then you're completely fucked really.\"</p><p>She is sitting on a low sofa in the offices of her record label, her small hands wrapped around a mug of tea that seems too big for her. We are meeting here because she is in the midst of signing 800 copies of her new CD. How many has she done so far?</p><p>\"Ten.\" She chews her lip guiltily. Does she feel famous enough to have developed an autograph yet?</p><p>She grins. \"I guess I realised that since it's my name, I should change it from my general signature I used for other things like credit cards.\"</p><p>We are speaking in a glass-partitioned box dotted with corporate furniture. The only other chairs in the room are positioned at a higher level than the sofa and perhaps it's this that makes Calvi seem so tiny: a hunched little figure with a shock of curly hair in black cropped trousers and a cobalt blue shirt who looks like she might always be a bit too cold. She speaks as though constantly on the verge of a quiet giggle.</p><p>But her slightness is even more striking because of her strong, physical presence on stage. The power of Calvi's live performances, often delivered in the guise of a male flamenco dancer with slicked-back hair and androgynous tailored shirts, has been much commented upon. Her mastery of the guitar (an instrument she studied alongside the violin as part of a music degree at Southampton University) has led to mild astonishment among male music journalists that she can actually play so well.</p><p>Calvi rolls her eyes. \"Sometimes interviewers ask, 'What's it like being a woman playing guitar?' I get asked that sooo much,\" she says. \"And, 'What's it like playing such a phallic instrument?'\"</p><p>I'd never thought of the guitar as particularly phallic, I say.</p><p>\"Neither have I!\" she squeals. \"I was saying, 'If anything, the shape of a guitar is more like a woman' and then the guy was like, 'Yeah, but the neck, the neck.' And I said,'Well, I guess the flute is a phallic instrument; you should ask all the flautists what it's like.'\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-371604901\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/15/100211annaCalviHIW_4341725-2-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/15/100211annaCalviHIW_4341725-2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_784036460001_100211annaCalviHIW-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/15/100211annaCalviHIW_4341725-2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/8/15/100211annaCalviHIW_4341725-2/100211annaCalviHIW_4341725-2.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>Such experiences have crystallised Calvi's own feminism. At the beginning, when people used to ask her whether she was a feminist, \"I felt insulted... I was, like, 'Why are they saying that to me? Just because I'm strong on stage...'\"</p><p>But now, having worked for a few years in what she concedes is \"a male-dominated environment\", Calvi has become less apologetic.</p><p>\"Yeah, now I would say that I am a feminist,\" she says. \"My belief is that men and women need to reclaim the word 'feminism'. It doesn't need to have any negative connotations. It's about a cultural evolution that everyone should be equal.\"</p><p>She has grown, then, both as an artist and as a woman and <em>One Breath</em> is the product of what Calvi describes as \"a feeling of transition\". Over the year that she was writing it, a beloved family member died (she does not want to tell me who, only that it was an older relative). That got her thinking about the fragility of memory and the permanence of loss.</p><p>\"I suppose the year that I wrote [the album] was quite turbulent on a personal level,\" Calvi says. \"It's... kind of... very thrilling to feel you're out of control and don't know what's going to happen but it's also scary... I think that becomes very apparent when someone passes away because, suddenly, everything you thought was your reality changes.</p><p>\"Ultimately, what I imagine is the scariest thing about dying is not having control of your body any more. So that's a theme. I think about it a lot in my life and it comes out in my music and I think this record is about addressing that in various ways.\"</p><p>Is she scared of dying?</p><p>\"Yeah. I'm not scared about being dead – I don't care about not existing – but the process of dying scares me.\"</p><p>It's interesting, this obsession with control, because both Calvi's parents, Claudio and Veronica, are psychotherapists and, as a child, Calvi got quite used to being hypnotised as a way of dealing with various aspects of her life. If she had a bad day at school, for instance, her father would get her to lie back on the sofa and tell her to start imagining a train journey. I say that I have always been scared of hypnotherapy for precisely the same reason Calvi says she doesn't take drugs: a fear of losing control.</p><p>\"Hypnosis definitely doesn't feel like being on drugs – it's really peaceful. It's a bit like… you know that moment when you're just falling asleep and you kind of know that you are and you can explore your dreamworld?\" I nod. \"That's what it's like.\"</p><p>More recently, she had hypnosis for an arm injury and also for a bout of tinnitus. The process did not leave her cured, but \"it's amazing what your brain can do. If you don't focus on something it will just disappear. It's really bizarre\".</p><p>Claudio and Veronica had a lasting influence on the formation of Calvi's artistic temperament. It wasn't just the hypnotherapy. Claudio, Italian by birth, had come over to England at 18 and met his future wife shortly afterwards while asking her directions to the nearest Wendy's. Her Italian family, Calvi says, \"are all very dramatic and slightly hysterical\" while the English half is \"quite reserved\". She can see the two sides at work within herself. In person, she is quiet, shy and precise in the way that she expresses herself. In her music, by contrast, she is \"very emotional and dramatic and passionate\".</p><p>What's she like in an argument?</p><p>\"I get really angry. Yeah, I shout. I'm kind of like a sleeping lion – it takes a lot to make me go but when I do, I get angry.\"</p><p>She grew up in Mortlake, south-west London, where, with her older sister, Nuala (now an author), she was introduced by Claudio to a range of artists – from Rossini and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/14/mariacallasthegreatest\" title=\"\">Maria Callas </a>to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/captain-beefheart\" title=\"\">Captain Beefheart </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/therollingstones\" title=\"\">Rolling Stones</a>. Summer holidays were spent in Rome, where Calvi used to listen to her grandfather playing the piano. At the age of five, she was \"begging\" her parents to get her a violin after seeing one at a friend's house.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QXoKdF3bc\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video</a></p><p>\"I remember feeling really drawn to it. I really wanted to touch it and make noise on it. So when I was six, they got me a violin. And I was a tiny six-year-old so it was, like, an eighth [size] violin.\" She smiles. \"It must have looked really cute.\"</p><p>She loved painting and drawing, too, and often sees music visually, or instruments as colours, slashed across a canvas. At one point, Calvi confesses that, occasionally, when she looks at a painting, she hears music coming out of it. This either means she has a form of synaesthesia (the fusion of two or more senses that are normally experienced separately) or that she has encountered more than her fair share of faulty music systems.</p><p>\"When I'm writing, I definitely imagine the song as a kind of mini-film,\" she explains. \"Sometimes, I sketch out the story of the song; I draw it or I paint it as a way of helping me see where it wants to go.\"</p><p>At university, she learned to score and arrange and, after graduating, earned money by giving guitar lessons. The work she has put into mastering her craft has left her with minimal tolerance for the kind of manufactured pop currently dominating the charts.</p><p>\"I'm not interested in listening to music just because it's cool or fashionable or part of a trend. I mean, I definitely feel like the whole <em>X Factor</em> thing… I wouldn't even describe it as music. It's so far away from anything I would feel any connection to and I think it's really sad it exists, actually, really depressing.\"</p><p>What was the last piece of music that made her cry?</p><p>She thinks for a long time. \"I listened to some choral music by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/feb/29/gioachino-rossini-google-doodle\" title=\"\">Rossini</a> and I felt very moved by that. I really love choral music – there's something about it that just gets me.\"</p><p>But it wasn't until 2006, by which time she was in her mid-20s, that Calvi started to sing herself. She had been writing songs since the age of 10 but, for unexplained reasons, had always been \"really phobic\" of singing them herself.</p><p>\"I really wanted to see if I could overcome my fear of it. So I just practised for hours and hours every day, listening to singers I loved like Elvis, Edith Piaf, Nina Simone and Maria Callas and it was like chipping away: eventually, I found this strong voice underneath. Because I have a really quiet speaking voice, I assumed I wouldn't be able to sing really loud, but I like the fact that there's that difference – that I can exist in that quiet way and then be really forceful and strong when I'm making music.\"</p><p>The success of her first album catapulted her into the limelight in unanticipated ways. She was courted by fashion designers including Gucci's Frida Giannini, who provided clothes for Calvi to wear on her American tour, and Chanel's creative director, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\" title=\"\">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, who <a href=\"http://fuckyeahannacalvi.com/post/17146737069/anna-calvi-by-karl-lagerfeld\" title=\"\">photographed her</a> for an ad campaign for a French millinery house.</p><p>What was Lagerfeld like?</p><p>\"He's cool. He's quite no-nonsense. I told him, 'I don't really want to wear a short-sleeved top' and he said  [she breaks off to do a convincing impression of a <em>mittel</em> European fashionista]: \"'Why, what's the problem with your arms?'\" She laughs. \"It was really funny. He was like, 'I don't like insecurity.' He very much says what he means. Slightly scary, but also very charming.\"</p><p>Calvi recounts a funny story about Lagerfeld wearing sunglasses throughout the shoot, even though it was conducted indoors. As a result, every time he raised the camera to take a picture, it clunked against his shades.</p><p>\"He said to me, 'You have a perfect nose – the kind of nose that surgery cannot buy!'\"</p><p>What was Calvi's reaction? She squirms in her seat and flaps her hand, embarrassed. \"I was like, 'Oh, Karl.'\"</p><p>Calvi is a likable mix of contradictions: insecure yet confident, passionate yet reserved, fragile in person yet strong on stage. She guards her privacy keenly but wants people to understand where her music is coming from. \"I use my image as a way of promoting the sentiment of the music, but it's not about fame. I don't want it to be about me. I find the idea of having to talk about myself very bizarre.\"</p><p>And yet, with the release of her new album, her fame will doubtless increase. There will be more autographs for her to sign, more contradictions for her to confront. Over the next few months, Calvi's profile will continue to rise.</p><p>At least, as Lagerfeld noted, it's a profile that comes with a perfect nose.</p><p><em>One Breath is released on 7 October on Domino</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418862827|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|8bbb16bb34b6cd81ae987c53c9bc446309dd6e05 -->",

        "body":"<p>Until recently, anyone who wanted to see the film <em>To Dorothy a Son </em>had to lock themselves deep in the bowels of the British Film Institute off Tottenham Court Road, London, and watch it on an old Steenbeck editing machine. A little-known comedy from 1954, <em>To Dorothy</em> is no one's idea of a classic. It has an infuriating star in Shelley Winters, a creaky screenplay by Peter Rogers (later the producer of the <em>Carry On</em> series) and a set that looks as if it is on loan from a local amateur dramatics society.</p><p>We are in the home of Tony (John Gregson) and his baby-faced wife, Dorothy (Peggy Cummins). Dorothy is heavily pregnant, and confined to bed. Tony is a composer with a deadline to meet, bailiffs to keep at bay and, thanks to the condition of his wife, a home to run. The house is a mess: when the telephone rings it can't be found beneath the piles of paper. Then, just to make things even more chaotic, Tony's American ex-wife, Myrtle (Winters), turns up, bearing the news that she will inherit her uncle's $2m fortune if, by a certain date, her former husband has not yet produced a son. There follows, as the film's poster had it, \"a riot\". Myrtle is desperate that Dorothy does not give birth until her legacy is safe. Tony, meanwhile, is panicking about another of her announcements – thanks to a clerical error, they may not have been divorced. It's all quite silly. In the end, though, Tony discovers that he and Myrtle were not married at all; Dorothy gives birth to twins, a girl and a boy, the latter arriving just after the deadline has passed; Myrtle decides to share her legacy, thus solving Tony and Dorothy's money worries once and for all. Hooray! Let the titles roll.</p><p>But something dark is at play beneath this surface fluff. In 1954, the divorce rate was six times what it had been before the war. Countless women, moreover, were involved in phoney second \"marriages\", their surnames changed by deed poll the better to make them appear respectable. Many people believed that marriage was in crisis. <em>To Dorothy a Son </em>reflects this anxiety. It's all here: the untimely reappearance of a first wife/husband; the dread exposure of a bigamous/sham marriage and its shameful consequence, illegitimacy; the painful postwar recalibration of the roles of men and women. Even as Dorothy makes demands on Tony, she fears his resentment. \"I don't want the baby,\" she tells him. \"I hate babies.\" But what she really hates, you suspect, is her own powerlessness – and, perhaps, the sight of her husband running around in an apron.</p><p>\"Men were made to wear the pants, and the pants were made to carry the dough,\" says Myrtle sarcastically, amused by the change in her ex. But she only half means it. After years as a struggling singer, Myrtle is thrilled to have her own money to spend: if Dorothy has two babies, she will have two mink coats. Hunkered in my screening room for one at the BFI, it was with some amazement that I realised the two women would end as friends, not rivals – a weirdly feminist twist in a film whose female characters are mere archetypes. Myrtle splits her inheritance not in half but three ways, and in doing so silently asks the question of the hour: why should only Tony escape the tyranny of the feather duster?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419081765'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380888051049/John-Gregson-Shelley-Wint-001.jpg' alt='John Gregson, Shelley Winters and Peggy Cummins in To Dorothy a Son (1954).' width='460' height='275' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>John Gregson, Shelley Winters and Peggy Cummins in To Dorothy a Son (1954). Photograph: BFI</figcaption></figure><p>Every year, during the film awards season, the cry goes up: where are all the women? But in Britain, in 1954, they were everywhere. It's hardly surprising that <em>To Dorothy a Son</em> came with a subliminal feminist message, for its director was <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/479374/\" title=\"\">Muriel Box</a>, a passionate feminist. Amazingly, this was her second picture of the year. Even as she was shooting it – Shelley Winters driving her round the bend with her refusal ever to learn her lines – she was editing <a href=\"http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/174029/Beachcomber-The-Original-Trailer-.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Beachcomber</em></a>, a drama starring Glynis Johns filmed on location&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ceylon.</p><p>Alas, neither <em>The Beachcomber</em> nor <em>To Dorothy </em>was a hit for Box: \"Spent nearly £8 on a pair of evening shoes… shocking!!!\" she wrote in her diary, having spent a consolatory day shopping after the \"lousy\" reviews for the latter. Many of her colleagues, however, were having better luck. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/28/wendy-toye-obituary\" title=\"\">Wendy Toye</a>, a recent winner of the prize for best short film at Cannes, had directed a respectable if rather baggy thriller, <em>The Teckman Mystery</em>, starring Margaret Leighton. A former debutante called Joan Henry had adapted her bestselling prison memoir, <em>Who Lie in Gaol</em>, for the director J Lee Thompson, and the result – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH61nx6KyFE\" title=\"\"><em>The Weak and the Wicked</em></a>, starring Glynis Johns as a gambling addict – had grossed £200,000 at the box office. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1EFOWjMGAY\" title=\"\"><em>The Belles of St Trinian's</em></a>, the third most popular film of the year, had been edited by the brilliant Thelma Connell.</p><p>Most stunning of all, though, was the success of Betty Box, the sister of Muriel's husband, Sydney. Betty had produced the hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVWjAeAa52o\" title=\"\"><em>Doctor in the House</em></a>, which had made a star of Dirk Bogarde, whom she'd cast as the duffle-coated student Simon Starling in the face of stiff opposition from her bosses at Rank. \"An uproarious, devil-may-care, almost wholly ruthless picture of the goings-on in medical training at a London hospital,\" the critic <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/473849/\" title=\"\">Dilys Powell </a>had written of it. Oh, yes. That's another thing: women film critics were 10 a penny. The most famous were Powell at the <em>Sunday Times </em>and <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/463484/\" title=\"\">CA Lejeune </a>at the <em>Observer</em>, but there were others too: E Arnot Robertson at the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Isabel Quigly at the <em>Spectator</em>, <a href=\"http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/45_IKWIG/Contemporary/Sketch.html\" title=\"\"><em>Elspeth Grant</em></a>on the <em>Daily Sketch</em>. In 1956 a woman, Penelope Houston, was appointed editor of <em>Sight and Sound</em>, the journal of the British Film&nbsp;Institute.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVWjAeAa52o\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p><p>Muriel Box was a curious mixture: easily disheartened yet doggedly ambitious. When she heard that the distributors of <em>To Dorothy</em>, her fifth film, would not be giving it a West End run, she fell into a depression. But she also knew the territory. You had to keep going. The one thing that she and Wendy Toye, Joan Henry, Thelma Connell and her sister- in-law Betty had in common, apart from their sex, was that they ate setbacks for breakfast. It wasn't only the men who were against you (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9HSqKgmRAM\" title=\"\">Michael Balcon</a>, who ran Ealing Studios, would tell anyone who would listen that women lacked the qualities to control a film unit). Some women were too. Kay Kendall, soon to appear in Muriel's film<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl8F_rMiH9c\" title=\"\"><em>Simon and Laura</em></a><em>,</em> would say that it had felt \"strange and uncomfortable\" to be directed by Box; Muriel Pavlow, her co-star, insisted \"I respond better to a male director\".</p><p>The other thing Muriel had by the bucketload was experience. She was 49 by the time she made <em>To Dorothy</em>, and had been working in the film industry for almost 25 years. On her sideboard at home stood the Oscar she and  Sydney had won in 1946 for the screenplay of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu1PHOZ9LGM\" title=\"\"><em>The Seventh Veil</em></a>, a film starring James Mason that was one of the first pictures to take psychiatry seriously. But thrilled though she'd been to receive it, the distinct sense of anti-climax she felt when the statuette arrived from Hollywood in a straw-filled packing case had turned out to be something of a portent. Three years later she directed her first feature, <em>The Lost People</em>, and the reviews were \"foul\". It was, she thought, probably best not to take anything too seriously. If the doldrums could follow hard on the heels of an Academy Award, then a flop could be succeeded just as swiftly by a smash hit.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419081766'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/10/3/1380811810002/muriel-box-at-camera-001.jpg' alt='muriel box at camera' width='180' height='200' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Muriel Box behind the camera during the making of The Truth about Women. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Violette Muriel Baker </strong>was born in 1905, in New Malden, Surrey, the daughter of a railway clerk. It was when war broke out in 1914 that she fell for the movies. With everyone at home preoccupied with food, or rather the lack of it, she lived only for her visits to the cinema: \"It was the heyday of the cliff-hanging serials, the one- and two-reel slapstick comedies, and the flickering newsreels. King Edward VII's funeral was the most impressive spectacle we had ever seen.\" When an old friend of her mother's offered the family free seats for any show they cared to see in the picture house he ran, Muriel took him at his word, presenting herself twice weekly at its door. For a while, this was tolerated. One day, however, she was shown a wooden chair on the stage behind the screen and told that from now on this was where she would watch the film. It wasn't ideal: the whirring of the projector almost drowned out the music from the orchestra pit. But there were advantages: when the show was over she was sometimes allowed to rewind the spools, and if the film had broken the projectionist would let her help him stick it together again. Even better, she was allowed to take home the frames that were \"lost' in the course of this operation.</p><p>Muriel's father thought she should train as a shorthand typist, but she had other ideas. \"I want to go on the films,\" she told her parents. It seemed an impossible dream, but in the summer of 1920, the films unwittingly came to her. On a train to Southsea to visit her grandmother, she fell into conversation with a stranger. He asked if she liked the movies – she had her nose deep in her favourite magazine, <em>Picture Show </em>– and when she told him that yes, she did, he plied her with questions. As the train pulled in, he handed Muriel his card; if ever she wanted to see a film being made, she should give him a ring.</p><p>\"JOSEPH GROSSMAN\", she read. And then the miraculous words: \"STOLL PICTURE PRODUCTIONS\". Muriel knew all about Stoll, where Grossman was studio manager. Its latest film, <em>The Glorious Adventure</em>, a melodrama about the Great Fire of London, was being shot in a new colour process called Prizma and starred Lady Diana Manners, the society beauty. And so it was that six months later she made the first of what would be several visits to Cricklewood, the home of Stoll. Muriel was too shy to broach the subject of a job, and in any case her meagre wardrobe, which consisted only of her school gym tunic, the bridesmaid's dress she had worn at her sister's wedding and one old skirt, would barely have seen her through the week. But eventually Grossman gave her, unprompted, a few days' crowd work.</p><p>Back at home, she eagerly enrolled at the Margaret Barnes School of Dancing in Surbiton, and signed up for classes with Sir Ben Greet, the Shakespearean actor-manager. But there was trouble ahead. Muriel had fallen in love with an associate of her father's, Stanley. He was 14 years her senior and her parents thought him wildly unsuitable. When her mother began censoring her post, Muriel put everything she owned into a bag and headed for Welwyn Garden City, where her sister's mother-in-law had offered her a room. There, she found a position as a secretary at Barclays Corsets.</p><p>Two long years passed. In 1929 Muriel landed a new job at <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/543966/\" title=\"\">British Instructional Films</a>, as a secretary in the Scenario Department: \"Life suddenly became very interesting and unpredictable. Everything was in a state of flux, the company turning over from silent pictures to 'talkies', an operation fraught with anxiety and many pitfalls.\" It was a while before producers realised they would need to hire dramatists to craft dialogue – at first they stuck with the scenarists who'd written the subtitles that accompanied the silent movies – and this gave Muriel an opportunity: directors would sometimes accept her suggestions for improvements to the scripts she typed up. She got another break when the continuity girl on Puffin Asquith's first talkie, a drama about Gallipoli called <em>Tell England</em>, fell ill with appendicitis. Asked to step in until a substitute could be found, Muriel worked on the film for the next three weeks. But no sooner had it wrapped than she found herself back at her desk, and soon after this a third of BIF's staff were laid off, Muriel among them: the silent films the company had on its stocks could not now find distributors, and its debts had piled up.</p><p>For a while she worked as a freelance continuity girl, bluffing her way through her first few films, until, in 1932, she joined Michael Powell's company in Wardour Street (Powell was then directing \"quota quickies\"). Tired of train journeys, she found herself an attic in a house overlooking Regent's Park. The room was not luxurious – water had to be hauled upstairs in a bucket, her underwear washed in a pan on the stove – and she was very lonely. \"The utter blankness which confronts one on trying to be self-sufficient and philosophical,\" she confided to her diary. In an effort to lift herself out of this depression, she auditioned for Rada: her final stab at the big time. But when the day arrived and she launched into Mirabell's speech from Congreve's <em>The Way of the World</em>, her courage ebbed, replaced with \"a suffocating, creeping despair which, three quarters of the way through, literally choked me\". Back in her room, she cried for several hours: \"My last chance! And I had muffed it!\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.britmovie.co.uk/directors/Sydney-Box\" title=\"\">Sydney Box</a> was an aspiring playwright whose roots were even humbler than Muriel's. \"I still shudder at the memory of one period of two weeks when our [childhood] diet consisted solely of porridge, boiled swedes and cocoa,\" he would recall later. Having begun his working life as a cub reporter on the <em>Kentish Times</em>, he was by the early 1930s a Fleet Street freelance. But he lived in Beckenham, his home town, where he wrote and produced plays for the local dramatic society. He was shy, balding, generous, easy-going, flirtatious, a wheeler-dealer, energetic, full of ideas, lame in one leg, and married.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419081767'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380889649147/Muriel-Box-left-with-Shel-001.jpg' alt='Muriel Box, left, with Shelley Winters on the set of To Dorothy a Son, 1954 ' width='460' height='275' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Muriel Box, left, with Shelley Winters on the set of To Dorothy a Son, 1954. Photograph: BFI</figcaption></figure><p>He and Muriel had been involved in a desultory correspondence since the summer of 1932, when his one-act play <em>Murder Trial </em>had won a prize at the Welwyn's drama festival (hearing of its brilliance, Muriel wrote asking if she might have a copy). But in 1933 things changed between them. Sydney was invited to dinner at the attic, where they spent most of the evening exchanging confidences. Muriel told him all about Stanley, and he told her all about his four-year marriage. It had been a mistake; he and his wife had not slept together for years; he was, he insisted, \"released from all obligations\".</p><p>Within a month she and Sydney were sleeping together. By the autumn they had found rooms to rent opposite a fried-fish shop in Bloomsbury. They were well suited, the one an incurable optimist (he), the other an incurable pessimist (she). \"I have a feeling our relationship will prove fruitful,\" she wrote in her diary. She wasn't wrong about this. One day soon afterwards, he arrived home with an even bigger grin than usual on his face. It had occurred to him that while the majority of Britain's amateur actors were women, most of the plays that were written with drama societies in mind had more parts for men, and on a sudden impulse he had walked into Harraps, the publishers, to tell them so. He had walked out again with a contract to produce a book of six one-act plays with all-women casts. In just three months.</p><p>And so it was that he and Muriel began working together – a partnership that would last for the next three decades. Every evening she would work on the first draft of a play they had roughed out over supper. She would then pass it to Sydney to polish. And on and on, until the work was done. The result, <em>Ladies Only</em>, and its follow-up, <em>Petticoat Plays</em>, were an instant success; over the course of the next six years they would publish upwards of 50 such dramas. No West End producer would have known either of their names, but the Boxes were soon the most performed playwrights in Britain.</p><p>For a while, life was good. Sydney and Muriel were married in May, 1935,  and their daughter, Leonora, was born the following year. But with the outbreak of war in 1939, the lights went out at Britain's amateur dramatic societies. Who was going to want their plays now? Again, it was Sydney who had the bright idea. What about a compendium of puzzles, jokes and poems to get families through the long nights ahead? <em>The Black-Out Book</em> was published in November 1939, and was so successful that on the back of its royalties Sydney was able to establish his own documentary company. Within two years Verity Films would be the biggest producer of government-sponsored propaganda in the country.</p><p>For the first months of the war, Muriel stayed in London. But once the bombing began, it was decided that she and Leonora would have to be evacuated. She feared missing out – \"It was obvious,\" she said later, \"that attitudes to everything were changing, mine included\" – and when she arrived in Dumfries after a 14-hour train journey, she felt she'd landed in another world. The only consolation was that she had her sister-in-law, Betty, for company (they occupied two rooms in the home of a shoe salesman): \"A petite, very pretty blonde, with an engaging manner which effectively disguised a remarkably keen brain.\" Hardly surprising, then, that when Sydney suggested Muriel might come to London to help him with a 90-minute documentary, <em>The Soldier's Food </em>– Ralph Richardson was to be seconded from the Fleet Air Arm to star – she did not hesitate. Leaving Leonora with her mother-in-law, she hot-footed it back to London.</p><p>Making this little film about messing committees and hay-box cooking took longer than expected: location work was hampered by the dive-bombing of Messerschmitts. Yet the experience only increased Muriel's determination to work. By this time Sydney had persuaded Betty, a trained commercial artist, to join Verity Films as a production assistant, and now he made his wife the director of a documentary for the British Council, <em>The English Inn</em>, the first of several Ministry of Information films she would make. Only when the ministry decreed that road safety for children was not a suitable project for a woman did this run end – by which time he needed Muriel elsewhere, for Sydney was branching into features, leaving Verity in the capable hands of Betty. In 1943, he acquired a lease on Riverside Studios and he and Muriel began working on the screenplay of their first independent production, an adaptation of the stage comedy <em>29 Acacia Avenue</em>.</p><p>It was surreal to be making films in the Blitz. But it was amazing how work could cause even the most terrible events to fade to grey. In 1944, London was under attack from the V1s, the devastating bombs known as doodlebugs. Muriel was exhausted; it was impossible to sleep. On fire-watch duty she had counted 30 flying bombs in a single evening. In Norwood, two of Sydney's relatives had been killed when a V2 – the doodlebug's successor – landed on their house. And yet, she noted, the greater part of her was preoccupied with <em>29 Acacia Avenue</em>, now wrapped, which J Arthur Rank was refusing to distribute (audience laughter at a screening had convinced him, a strict Methodist, that it was \"immoral\").</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu1PHOZ9LGM\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p><p>The same was true of the shortages. It had been several years since Muriel had been able to get her hands on a pair of stockings, but she couldn't feel too glum. She and Sydney had written a melodrama about a suicidal pianist, <em>The Seventh Veil</em>, and it had gone into production starring Ann Todd and James Mason. On balance, she would probably take the movie over a pair of nylons – a deal that seemed even more of a bargain when <em>The Seventh Veil </em>opened on 22 October 1945 at the Leicester Square Odeon. Everyone loved it. The film would go on to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. It had cost just £92,000 to make. No wonder Arthur Rank now asked Sydney to take charge of production at Gainsborough Studios.</p><p>It was Noël Coward who – following their takeover at Gainsborough – described the Boxes as \"the Brontës of Shepherd's Bush\". But this was not entirely accurate. Betty Box, the member of the family for whom the Gainsborough years would prove to be most successful, worked not in Shepherd's Bush but at the studio's Islington outpost, where Sydney had appointed her the studio head.This was a shrewd move. Rank had contracted him to make 12 pictures a year; Islington's output would need to comprise roughly a quarter of this total if he was to meet these obligations. He needed to be sure its stages were productive, and what better way of doing so than by putting his own sister in charge? Overnight, then, Betty became Britain's leading female film producer – its only female producer – and at the age of 31. \"I quickly learnt what a very different world I was entering,\" she wrote. \"At Verity, I could say to the army, 'I'll need 300 private soldiers with their officers, a dozen tanks, a column of vehicles,' and they were all delivered without any charge (providing, of course, they weren't otherwise occupied dealing with Messrs Hitler and Mussolini). But now came big deals with stars, top technicians, composers, designers for huge sets and for film stars' clothes – a very much tougher proposition.\" Gainsborough's reputation was, famously, for melodrama. But Betty, believing that postwar audiences needed cheering up, now produced hit comedies such as <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/487724/\" title=\"\"><em>Miranda</em></a>, in which a man takes a mermaid to see London disguised as an invalid in a wheelchair.</p><p>In 1949 Arthur Rank announced that he was closing the outmoded studios at Shepherd's Bush and Islington, and moving production to Pinewood in Buckinghamshire. For Betty, who would work at Pinewood for the next two decades, this was \"total luxury\". For Muriel, still marooned in script development, this meant another opportunity. <em>Cockpit</em>, a film Sydney had produced at Gainsborough, came with them to Pinewood, but was not thought fit for release. Rather than leave it on the shelf, he now decided to rewrite sections of the script – set in Germany after the war, it starred Richard Attenborough – and have them reshot in the hope of recouping some of his investment. This was, of course, a gig no well-known director would want. But Muriel was familiar with the material and would not even ask to be paid. The board, ordinarily violently opposed to the idea of a woman director, gave their consent.</p><p>Muriel reshot almost 60% of <em>Cockpit </em>(renamed <em>The Lost People </em>on release). On set with her she kept a Moviola – a miniature projection machine – to check the original footage for continuity against the scenes she was about to shoot. The experience was akin to \"solving an intricate film jigsaw\", and she knew \"it would never add up to much\". But she didn't care. \"Its importance was that it demonstrated to those who mattered that I had the ability to handle artists and dialogue as well as move my camera around.\"</p><p>In 1950 Sydney left Rank and set up his own company, London Independent Producers, his intention to make five pictures a year. The first of these was to be a low-budget adaptation of <em>The Happy Family</em>, a stage play about a grocery store on the proposed site of the Festival of Britain. At the casting stage, so as not to cause alarm, he told agents that he and Muriel would be co-directing (the large cast included Stanley Holloway and Dandy Nichols). But the moment shooting started he left her alone. For Muriel, this changed everything. The film made a substantial profit and picked up good reviews. The studios could now have no objection to her as a director, and she moved swiftly on to her next project: <em>Street Corner</em>, a drama-documentary about women in the police force.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419081768'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380888139221/Brigitte-Bardot-Betty-Box-001.jpg' alt='Brigitte Bardot, Betty Box, Dirk Bogarde and director Ralph Thomas, on the set of Doctor at Large' width='460' height='355' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Brigitte Bardot, Betty Box, Dirk Bogarde and director Ralph Thomas, on the set of Doctor at Large, 1957. Photograph: Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>The movies now came thick and fast. <em>Street Corner</em>, released in 1953, was followed by <em>The Beachcomber </em>and <em>To Dorothy a Son </em>in 1954, and they were followed by <em>Simon and Laura </em>(1955), <em>Eyewitness </em>(1956), <em>The Passionate Stranger </em>and <a href=\"http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/457784/Truth-About-Women-The-Marooned-In-A-Lift.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Truth About Women</em></a><em> </em>(both 1957), <em>This Other Eden</em> and <em>Subway in the Sky</em> (both 1959). Muriel did not have a free hand when it came to the films she made. Budgets were tiny and schedules tight. Nor was she the most creative of directors. Her shots are prosaic, and her films often want for pace. But <em>Street Corner</em>, with its mostly female cast, was a groundbreaking film. So, too, was <em>Simon and Laura</em>,<em> </em>in which Kay Kendall and Peter Finch play married actors whose smug portrayal of a happy couple in a soap opera is in stark contrast to the reality at home. It satirises television, the coming medium, deftly and with&nbsp;great warmth.</p><p>Soon after Betty arrived at Pinewood in 1949, she met the director Ralph Thomas, whose thriller, <em>The Clouded Yellow</em>, she was to produce. This was a relationship that would endure for 30 films, but it wasn't only professional: Betty and Ralph would soon become lovers, too – a situation they managed according to the mores of the day. On location they were a couple. At home they went back to their real lives. Ralph had a wife, Joy, and two children. Betty had her husband, Peter Rogers. (Norman Hudis, the screenwriter, once asked Betty what she thought about having children. \"Oh, I can't be bothered,\" she said.) No one seemed unhappy. Joy was devoted to her young family. Peter had his own films to produce: the <em>Carry On</em> series, which were directed by Ralph's brother Gerald. And however complicated this arrangement, between them these two couples made about 100 movies, films that now read like an index of the varying fortunes of the British film industry from Kenneth More to Roger Moore.</p><p>Somebody in publicity once made the mistake of writing in a press release that Petula Clark would sing a \"little\" song in one of Betty's films. \"I never produce anything little,\" said Betty, putting a line through it. This is not to say that she was grand. In India to make <em>The Wind Cannot Read </em>(1958), she got the wardrobe department to build half a dozen pockets into her poncho, so that that she could hide bottles of whisky in them on India's dry days and keep the crew happy. Like her brother, she never forgot her hardscrabble childhood; she liked being rich and felt no need to apologise for it: \"I already owned five fur coats, so I ordered a white mink, floor length, and wore it with pleasure, even if it did make me look like I was rolling along on casters.\" And she was a famously tough negotiator. When she discovered that in spite of all she'd done for the company – by the mid-50s, her nickname was Betty Box Office – her fees were lower than those of Rank's male producers, she went to see its director, John Davis, and demanded the figures be \"adjusted'. Davis blustered. \"What do you need the money for? Another mink coat? You have a rich husband – you don't need a rise.\" By the time she removed herself from his office, however, her request had been \"amicably granted\".</p><p>In 1959, Sydney Box suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. While he rested, Muriel made only one picture: <em>The Piper's Tune</em>, for the Children's Film Foundation. He and Muriel made their last movie in 1964: <em>Rattle of a Simple Man</em>, a second-rate comedy about a naive young man (Harry H Corbett) who travels to London for the FA Cup, where he unwittingly falls in love with a prostitute. Betty's film career continued a little longer. Her last movie, directed by the stalwart Ralph, was the lamentable <em>Percy's Progress </em>in 1974. A sequel to <em>Percy</em>, it was a comedy about the recipient of the world's first penis transplant.</p><p>The Boxes' time had passed. They were middle-aged at a moment when the middle-aged suddenly seemed very old – a trend that the movies, as ever, ruthlessly exaggerated. First there had come the films of the new wave: <em>Room at the Top</em>, <em>Look Back in Anger</em>. Then London had begun to swing, and the films with it: <em>Georgy Girl</em> and <em>Darling</em>. Their gentle comedies, their plucky British affairs about love and war, were relics to be put away, like antimacassars and the novels of Nevil Shute.</p><p>Betty took this in her stride. She wafted around in a kaftan, and thought about the good times: \"I cherished them: the opportunity I was given to show that a woman could do the job as well as any man.\" For Muriel, things were more difficult. On 30 October 1964 the telephone rang, and though she somehow managed to stand at her hall table long enough to take a message, she felt as though she was falling. Sydney, it seemed, was having an affair. The flat in town he had been keeping as a writing den was a love nest, shared with a woman called Sylvia Knowles. Half mad with grief, she began to think. This man she had loved for so long: hadn't he always been disappearing to Brighton to hole up in a hotel while he rewrote his latest script? It was as if she'd been blind, and now she could see.</p><p>For a time she rallied. But over dinner at Maxim's in Paris in 1965, it only took one cool question on her part and several martinis on his for it all to come out. As if he was merely talking her through a casting list, Sydney now told her that he had never been faithful.</p><p>In 1966 Sydney suffered a heart attack. By now, Muriel was reduced to hounding her husband and Sylvia from afar. In 1967 they escaped her by moving to Australia, Two years later, Muriel and Sydney were divorced.</p><p>In 1992 Betty Box received the first UK Women in Film lifetime achievement award. She died of cancer at her home in Gerrard's Cross on 15 January 1999. After her divorce, Muriel Box co-founded Femina, Britain's first feminist publishing house, and became a campaigner for women's rights, working with her friend, Edith Summerskill, the Labour politician, to reform Britain's divorce laws. In 1970 she married Gerald Gardiner, the Lord Chancellor. She died on 18 May 1991.</p><p>In 2012 <em>To Dorothy a Son </em>was, unaccountably, released on DVD.</p><p><em>© Rachel Cooke 2013</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418962817|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|281261806e67175a6ad949305ed2caa256259e09 -->",

        "headline":"Benedict Cumberbatch: the next great British export?",
        "body":"<p>Is Benedict Cumberbatch a charming and handsome megastar-to-be? Or a pretentious and overbearing snot? Pardon the sharp contrast, but these are essentially the only categories we Americans have when welcoming new actors from across the pond.</p><p>The talented Cumberbatch made his US splash as the fearsome bad guy in Star Trek Into Darkness. He's garnering Oscar buzz for his upcoming portrayal of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate, and if you're more of a fanboy geek, you've already watched the new Hobbit trailer 700 times to hear Cumberbatch's voice as the dragon, Smaug. And did I mention that his TV series Sherlock is available on Netflix? Wanting for interesting roles, he is not.</p><p>But does all this translate to bonafide stardom in the states? I wouldn't be so sure. Americans like British men in certain leading roles: namely James Bond and wizards. Pierce Brosnan was beloved as 007, but not much else. The Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings films have earned Orlando Bloom some nice paychecks, but you don't see him on the big screen without a pirate ship or elf ears. Colin Firth won an Oscar for his role in The King's Speech, and then predictably evaporated from the collective consciousness of America. </p><p>Here's the problem, Britain: these men all possess debonair charm, refined good looks, and the ability to deliver intelligent, nuanced performances. This is a laundry list of the very things Americans find insufferable. We're a simple, insecure populace. We don't like people who are better than us. We like hunky morons like Mark Wahlberg. The closest thing to a hunky moron Britain's ever sent us is Robert Pattinson, and I'm pretty sure he's faking it.</p><p>And while it's been over 200 years since we lived under colonial rule, there's something about that quintessential English affect that we still find abrasively superior. Even amongst our own. Observe the widespread animosity towards actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne Hathaway. Talented and beautiful, sure, but also perceived as uptight, erudite, perhaps even royal in their dispositions. They just seem British, right down to their names. That doesn't bode well for Mr Cumberbatch, presumably named after a Hogwarts math teacher.</p><p>Now the Australians? We've been making megastars out of them for years. Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, the Hemsworth brothers ... they're everything Americans idealize about manhood. Rugged, short-tempered frontiersman, ready to conquer the plains with a John Wayne-esque machismo. And – take note, Cumberbatch – not too proud to completely sterilize their native accents.</p><p>Americans don't have passports, we don't meet many foreigners, and we think proper English diction is an indicator of condescension or homosexuality. Sadly, you can see it in our politics as well: we just tend to trust cowboys more than intellectuals. Hell, we gave Paul Hogan his own Crocodile Dundee trilogy. For the past two decades, Aussie actors have ruled our megaplexes and made billions of dollars by embodying the classical attributes of American masculinity.</p><p>When Brits have succeeded here in the states, it's when they have done the same. Batman star Christian Bale exemplifies the guy who we'll trust in a dramatic role because we also know he can beat our brains in ... without being a snob about it. Sean Connery may have been a cultured spy in the Bond films, but he also could slum it as a lunchpail tough guy in films like The Untouchables. Fellow Scotsman Daniel Craig, the most blue-collar of all the Bonds, seems to be on the same track. Even the immortal Daniel Day-Lewis needed bare-knuckle roles in Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood before Americans would ever have accepted him as Lincoln.</p><p>If you want success beyond the stereotypical British roles, you must have the charisma to kick ass without the martini drinking pretense or Oscar Wilde snark. The only other route to British success at the American box office is with humor, a la Hugh Grant or Russell Brand, and even in these cases, success was short lived. Again, it's because we don't relate to these guys. We're laughing at them, not with them. That Adam Sandler has dominated the American comedy market for 20 years tells you all you need to know about our appreciation for nuanced performance versus brute stupidity.</p><p>Does Benedict Cumberbatch have what it takes to become a megastar in the US? Well, he's smart, attractive, and incredibly talented, so history says no. Just ask Jude Law. Then again, as I look around and see a generation of waifish, anti-meathead hipsters slowly taking over the cultural landscape, with their curly mustaches and effeminate skinny jeans, I can't help but wonder if perhaps America is ready to ditch the macho stereotypes and create a true British megastar for the modern era. Sadly, portraying Julian Assange, whom America's media has vilified as no less than a foreign terrorist, may not be a step in the right direction.</p><p>On the other hand, Assange is Australian. So maybe there's a chance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419012702|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|f8db6893ce4600656e08d640c83885d7a951cde4 -->",

        "headline":"Jay Z – review",
        "body":"<p>It's hard to shake the feeling that something might be missing at the first night of Jay Z's Magna Carter world tour. It's not wordplay, of course. The Magna Carter tour makes plain the pun on Jay's surname (Carter), merely latent on his most recent album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/07/jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail-review\" title=\"\"><em>Magna Carta Holy Grail</em></a>. \"Minglin' in England\", runs the legend on a hoodie at the merch stall. During a show that runs nearly two hours, there is no shortage of versifying, drawing on <em>MCHG</em> and Jay Z's muscular corpus of past works.</p><p>We get Tom Ford, <em>MCHG</em>'s designer-praising standout cut, in which the rapper has \"spent all his euros on tuxes and weird clothes\". We also get <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/may/18/jay-z-dead-presidents\" title=\"\">Dead Presidents II</a>, from Jay Z's 1996 debut, <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, in which Carter's dollar gross \"at the end of the fiscal year\" was, at the time of writing, more of an aspiration than the fact it is now <a href=\"http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/rappers/jay-z-net-worth/\" title=\"\">$500m</a> (estimated last year). Apparently, Beyoncé and <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/jay-z/72987\" title=\"\">Blue Ivy</a>™ are backstage.</p><p>News outlets widely reported that Timbaland – the producer Tim Mosley, whose work with Jay Z, Missy Elliott, Justin Timberlake et al sculpted the imperial phase of US pop&nbsp;of the late 90s and early 00s – would be<a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/jay-z--3/72786\" title=\"\"> supporting Jay in Europe</a>. Instead, the flow of fans into the not-quite-sold-out arena is accompanied by faceless DJing. When Timbaland does appear, the super producer is one &nbsp;of three live band members manning small industrial units of sound gear during Jay Z's set. (A drummer at the top of a high-rise geometric set completes the backing&nbsp;group.)</p><p>\"DJ Timmy Tim\", as Jay fondly refers to him, is here in part because Jay's <em>Magna Carta…  </em>is as much his historic document as it is Jay's. You could argue that Mosley's stark, restless beats are one of the best things about <em>MCHG</em>, controversially released via a smartphone in July. Jay's verses occasionally tread water – water that is, admittedly, very high; Mosley's beats end a period in the semi-wilderness for the producer that peaked with a falling out with American music's premier mogul-poet. FuckWithMeYouknowIGotIt is one of <em>MCHG</em>'s best grandstanding moments. But its cockiness could apply equally to Tim's beat as it does to Jay's verse, laden with mafia-themed Italian.</p><p>When Jay goes off for a short shirt-swapping break, Timbaland shows off how he builds a track, beat-boxing, layering digitals. It turns into an Aaliyah song. This is interlude heaven for the nerds. Others make for the loos. As expected, though, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va94E4Yetk\" title=\"\">Big&nbsp;Pimpin'</a> &nbsp;(a hit for Jay in 2000) is one of the night's high points. Having the man who minted the nagging Middle Eastern hook on stage just ices the cake.</p><p>What's missing here is the frisson that a real sparring partner brings. The last time Jay toured the UK's arenas, he was in the company of Kanye West, triumphantly showing off the pair's 2011 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/14/jay-z-kanye-throne-review\" title=\"\"><em>Watch the Throne</em></a><em> </em>album. The two rappers battled from the top of huge hydraulic pillars, with footage of sharks, assailants and explosions projected on to them. Last summer, Jay circled the US (with a pit stop in London) in the company of Justin Timberlake – two very different showmen, united by their ability to look good in suits (and sound good on Timbaland beats). More recently, Jay's guest spot on Timberlake's recent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCw50Loy7O4\" title=\"\">Murder</a> track ignited a minor furore when Carter took the name of <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/09/yoko-ono-doesnt-care-that-jay-z-dissed-her/69859/\" title=\"\">Yoko Ono</a> in vain.</p><p>However masterful a rapper Jay Z remains – and he is particularly electrifying on the third quarter of the set – Jay on his own feels like a slight comedown from these recent extravaganzas. The pauses between tracks stretch a little uncomfortably, too, probably due to first-night adjustments. West would have said something outrageous by now; Jay resorts to the time-honoured \"Manchester make some noise!\"</p><p>The visual spectacle is some compensation. Where Jay Z was an early evolver from the turntables-and-microphone era of rap, tonight's visuals are a considerable further step up from previous solo tours. Nervous projections use surveillance camera footage and explosions (viewed remotely) to engender a sense&nbsp;of fraughtness; one not undercut by what&nbsp;might be footage of the underside of a washing machine being&nbsp;photocopied.</p><p>It is probably unfair to expect something more than an arena show of an arena show. But you long for something extraordinary from Jay Z. In July, he performed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6WpZeo93qQ\" title=\"\">Picasso Baby for &nbsp;six hours in New York's Pace Gallery</a>, sending at least one art critic&nbsp;into <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/jerry-saltz-face-to-face-with-jay-z.html\" title=\"\">raptures</a>. That performance was, admittedly, a riff on a piece by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/jul/31/jonathan-jones-blog-marina-abramovic\" title=\"\">Marina Abramovic</a> (with their rampant ancestor-worship, rappers know all about quoting other artists). It was criticised by <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2013/07/jay-z-this-charming-man.html\" title=\"\">some</a> as being an elitist gimmick, but the intensity with&nbsp;which Jay Z reportedly&nbsp;embraced the performance, his willingness to go eyeball to eyeball with strangers for so many hours, served to underline why this rapper is just so much more than the sum of his many business interests (to which he has recently added: sports agent). Tonight, Jay Z is never less than fully committed to every word. But when he asks us to throw our diamonds in the air for the umpteenth time, this routine could use a little buffing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419083051|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|bdab815dec9f2f15fbc0432b58453941f122a3fc -->",
