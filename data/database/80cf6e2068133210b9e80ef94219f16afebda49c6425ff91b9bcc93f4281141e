It's still a family firm, run from its Milan workshop by Ugo's sons Danilo, Doriano and Cristiano.</p><p>De Rosa is one of the few bike builders which offers frames in a&nbsp;choice of steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon. Debating the pros and cons of each of these materials is the kind of thing that keeps passionate cyclists awake at night – that and their saddle sores. Dip into any bike website and the word \"stiffness\" occurs with such alarming regularity you'll be clearing your search history. Either way, \"structural rigidity\" is essential – a&nbsp;stiffer frame yields a better power transfer with each stroke (phnaar).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">The Idol</a>, made of Super Hi-Modul carbon fibre, is both rigid and virtually weightless – the holy grail of bike building. Lift it with your finger and it's more hologram than bike. The mix of tube shapes blends aerodynamics with power and good looks with comfort. The slim rear stays feed into the top tube like the straining tendons of an athlete's neck. The gear and brake cables are all internally routed, which keeps the lines clean and uncluttered. The Idol comes with an 11-speed <a href=\"http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Campagnolo</a> Athena groupset. \"Oh, a Campag…\" muttered my neighbour reverentially. \"So mechanical…\"</p><p>I tested the Idol on the Surrey hills in last Sunday's London Cycle Sportive.

On the hills it turned me into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/mar/07/cycling.features\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>… Well, you've got to have an \"idol\".  But best of all, it was so comfortable. It's not often you climb off a bike after 100 miles with a bottom that isn't the bright pink of the Maglia Rosa.

Photograph: Matt Alexander</figcaption></figure><p>Keen cyclists from the mean streets of south London are a familiar sight on the leafy hills of Surrey, but last Sunday's second annual <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/london-cycle-sportive\" title=\"\">FT London Cycle Sportive</a> turned the quite lanes into a busy cycle track. Torrential rain and gale-force winds threatened to de-rail the ride, I even checked the website before I left home in the vain hope that the event would be cancelled. But cyclists are a hardy bunch and it was clearly going to take more than rain and 30mph gusts to send us back to bed. In the end almost 2,300 turned out to tackle either the 48km, 100km or 100-mile distances of the sold-out sportive organised by Human Race in support of Access Sport. As I was on the De Rosa (reviewed above) it seemed the least I could do was to tackle the longer loop. We started at 7.30am in Dulwich Park, puzzled dog walkers wondering what was going on as hundreds whirred out of the gates, before climbing up towards Crystal Palace and then along the edge of the North Downs with amazing views over Kent and Surrey. As always it is a surprise just how quickly London goes green when you are on two wheels whisking along empty Sunday-morning roads. Eventually we returned through the suburbs and were rewarded with a victory lap of the Herne Hill velodrome – the one used in the 1948 London Olympics and now being restored by the <a href=\"http://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/friends/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. It was a great and testing day – competitive yet filled with camaraderie. The London Cycle Sportive is part of the Human Race Sportive Series. The next event is the Chiltern 100 on 1 June.

Called <em>Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist</em>, it explores the startling truth behind his remarkable descent from being among the finest athletes on earth to his tragic end in a sport riven by intrigue. Based on two years of extensive research and inspired by Matt Rendell's excellent book <em>The Death of Marco Pantani</em>, the film combines scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani's friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. Known as Il Pirata thanks to his head scarf and gold hoop earrings, the film celebrates the rise of a man born in 1970 to a humble family in Cesanatico in northern Italy to become the most successful, flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era.&nbsp;In 1998, he won both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia – he was the last man to accomplish the titanic feat. Yet, less than six years later, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room – destroyed by the sport to which he had given so much. It's a sad, humbling film which shines a light on the extraordinary pressures the riders faced at the height of the doping scandals.

Its models are called things like The Simple One, The Versatile One, The Hot Modder. The names refer to the nature of the various bikes but also read like a&nbsp;personality assessment of the future owner. This one is The Basic One. It's well made and durable, with some classy details – the chrome handles, the moulded grips and the off-centre quick release all have a quality feel to them. It has a seven-speed Shimano gear and sturdy aluminium fame, which means it will serve you well as a race-for-the-train job. As it's on the heavy side, you will start to feel it in your legs on a&nbsp;journey of more than several miles or if you live on a hill. But at this price, it's great value (<a href=\"http://www.evanscycles.com/\" title=\"\">evanscycles.com</a>).</p><h2><strong>Dahon Jifo</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £479</strong><br /><strong>Weight 9.4kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 7 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773338'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402060871792/Dahon-Jifo-009.jpg' alt='Dahon Jifo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The LA-based firm's pioneering solution to taking a&nbsp;rigid bike and sawing it in half so it can swivel into something you can carry in one hand has been credited with kick-starting the interest in folding bikes. Since 1982, Dahon has sold more than 2m bicycles and is now the undisputed world leader. All that expertise means the Jifo really does collapse in jiffy: it's just seven seconds from bike to bag. The bike is ultra-compact and very light, which makes it easy to carry once folded. It has a&nbsp;single gear, so it's only really suited for short hops around town, but the upright riding position combined with the tiny 16in wheels make it incredibly responsive to ride. A touch on the pedals and you are flying away from the lights. And don't let its small size put you off – it's as sturdy as a Shetland pony and will take riders up to 105kg in weight (<a href=\"http://wiggle.co.uk\" title=\"\">wiggle.co.uk</a>).</p><h2><strong>Brompton S2L</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £890</strong><br /><strong>Weight 10.9kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 15 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773339'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402062162895/Brompton-S2L-009.jpg' alt='Brompton S2L' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In the opening scene of W1A, Ian Fletcher (brilliantly played by Hugh Bonneville) fresh from delivering the Olympics in Twenty Twelve, is still struggling to fold his Brompton. The bike is now a metaphor for the new nightmare he faces as the BBC's head of values. A&nbsp;YouTube tutorial would have put him right – with the bike if not the Beeb. To ride, the Brompton is an instant hit. Light, agile and strangely addictive, the bike's upright position, long steering stem and super-high seat column means that as you hover above the tiny wheels you feel like a trick cyclist pulling off a clever manoeuvre. Once you have cracked the technique, it folds easily and more neatly than any other bike. In fact the folding becomes a pleasure in itself. Brompton is Britain's largest bike builder. It's as British as the BBC (<a href=\"http://brompton.com\" title=\"\">brompton.com</a>).</p><h2><strong>Airnimal Chameleon </strong></h2><p><strong>Price £1,999</strong><br /><strong>Weight 10kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 45 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773340'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402078696047/Airnimal-Chameleon-009.jpg' alt='Airnimal Chameleon' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The tiny wheels and shopper-style handlebars of the folding bike mean you have to ride upright, which more or less destroys any sense of aerodynamics. But Airnimal likes to think differently. It makes three models: the all-round Joey, the all-terrain Rhino and this one, the Chameleon. It is an extraordinary hybrid of race styling and folding technology. It has traditional drop handlebars, a 20-speed Shimano 105 groupset and carbon forks. It has skinny tyres and a pain-in-the-ass saddle. It weighs very little and you can ride it like an all-out race bike. Yet it will still fold neatly into the boot of your car. It's expensive and is aimed at serious cyclists. But if you travel for work and long to stretch your legs on unfamiliar roads after endless meetings, this would be an inspired solution (<a href=\"http://airnimal.eu\" title=\"\">airnimal.eu</a>).</p><h2><strong>Mando Footloose</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £3,349</strong><br /><strong>Weight 21.7kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 3 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773341'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402078610734/Mando-Footloose-009.jpg' alt='Mando Footloose' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Mando Footloose is the world's first chainless electric folding bike. It may also be the world's only chainless electric folding bike. It looks like a cross between an exercise bike and an exhibit from an art gallery. There are no gears and there is virtually no resistance on the pedals, as if you are permanently cycling downhill. Pedalling doesn't drive the bike forward – it replenishes a battery through a&nbsp;tiny alternator which then generates electricity to power the automatically geared motor which is hidden inside the sculpted aluminium frame. It takes a while to get used to riding it – and it will take longer to get used to the baffled looks of passersby. Once you do, you'll be happy to sit back and let the bike do the work – it'll cruise at 15mph. But it's as heavy as a bag of golf clubs, so it'll take a strong back to heft it into the boot (<a href=\"http://justebikes.co.uk\" title=\"\">justebikes.co.uk</a>).</p><h2>Ninety years of Harley</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773336'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401894395676/Harleys-on-the-Kings-Road-009.jpg' alt='Harleys on the King's Road' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Happy birthday Harley: 90 years old.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you forgot about the other type of two-wheeler… Europe's oldest and best-known Harley-Davidson dealership has just celebrated its 90th anniversary. It threw open the doors of its iconic King's Road showroom to passionate riders, vintage bike fans and customisation enthusiasts from across the country.</p><p>In 1924 FJ Warr opened his motor bicycle repair shop on London's&nbsp;King's Road. That same year he became an agent for the Harley-Davidson Motor Co of Milwaukee, USA, and Warr's Harley-Davidson was born. At that time the flagship of the Harley range was the Silent Gray Fellow, which would have cost a princely £85. Now, with a collection worth more than £2m, the Warr's Museum displays the largest number of historic Harleys this side of America. From the Second World War WL models which inspired the Harley used in 2011 movie <em>Captain America</em> to the Model K that shot to fame in the 50s when a young Elvis Presley posed for the May 1956 cover of The Enthusiast magazine, and later for his <em>Return of The Rocker</em> album cover, they are all here. For the first time Warr's has also revealed some of the unique and innovative custom bikes that have been designed and built by their in-house experts, Kings Road Customs.

Located at One Canada Square and Canada Square Park in Canary Wharf, London's prestigious business and leisure district will be transformed into an indoor and outdoor exhibition space, with organisers expecting more than 400,000 visitors. Motorexpo conveniently provides all those working in, living near and visiting Canary Wharf, plus car enthusiasts from further afield, a chance to see, touch and in many cases, test drive the cars on display. Now in its 19th year, the 2014 line-up includes a mouthwatering collection of high-end cars: the Porsche Cayman GTS, Lotus Evora Sports Racer, McLarens 650s and Aston Martin Vanquish Volante will all be on show as well as Bentley's new Continental GTV8 S. If that is not enough, there will be two F1 cars as well as electric cars and bikes. There's even the launch of the Luxury Mobile Office Company, a novel idea which makes it possible to work in style and comfort when travelling by car. Motorexpo is open daily between 10am and 6pm (11am to 5pm on Sunday 15 June) and it's free to enter.

They'll cope with tracks and trails, but not the wild. But, honestly, do you really need to?</p><p>The champion in this class is Nissan's Qashqai – Britain's bestselling car. To be a contender Suzuki knew it had to bring its A game. So, did it? Well, on first impression it's not much to look at. It's not particularly chunky or sporty.

The SX4 is £2,500 cheaper than the Qashqai. It's available in a choice of four specifications: SZ3, SZ4, SZ-T and SZ5. It has a smooth DDiS 6-speed manual gearbox and can be in fuel-saving permanent 2WD or Allgrip four-wheel drive. There's also  a choice of sprightly petrol or frugal diesel engines. Step inside and you'll find a neatly styled, no-nonsense cabin. The simple dash is easy to use and the touchscreen infotainment and satnav are refreshingly straightforward.

The first, and probably the most important, lesson we all learn as drivers is that no good can come from letting your attention wander. All we have to do is stare at the onrushing grey ribbon with a&nbsp;fixed, unwavering focus… but gosh, it can be hard can't it? And this new <a href=\"http://www.citroen.co.uk/new-cars/car-range/citroen-grand-c4-picasso/?campaignid=PPC_NCS&amp;advertiserid=google&amp;bannerid=grand_c4_picasso#/new-cars/car-range/citroen-grand-c4-picasso/\" title=\"\">C4 Grand Picasso</a> is so packed with digital thingumajigs and flashing screens and rubbery buttons, all encased in a vast wraparound panorama of glass, that looking at the car in front is almost the last thing on your mind.</p><p>A survey of 1,500 drivers from the <a href=\"http://www.iam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Advanced Motorists</a> (and these are people who take their driving seriously) found that a&nbsp;third said children were the biggest distraction to their driving. Close on the heels of those pesky kids were mobile phones (er, that's illegal, guys), changing radio stations, back-seat drivers, fiddling with the satnav, smoking, cuddling or kissing by a&nbsp;passenger (that would be distracting) and, <em>lastly</em>, attractive pedestrians… Just 14% of respondees admitted that, yes, very occasionally an attractive pedestrian had indeed caused their gaze to be dragged from the bumper of the car ahead.</p><p>Well, that's a straight lie, isn't it – 14%? Come on, must be closer to 100%. And how come no one mentioned arguing? The greatest  rows my wife and I have always seem to take place in the car.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336915'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400603570646/Citroen-interior-011.jpg' alt='Citroen interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: a view of driver's area, note the two large digital screens. </figcaption></figure><p>Anyway, if you <em>are</em> easily distracted, you are going to find Citroën's new MPV a nightmare. The Grand is the bigger, seven-seat version of the five-seat model which arrived on these shores at the end of last year, and there are signs of sibling rivalry bubbling up. Despite the fact that the Grand has just put rubber on British roads, it has already collected more awards than its little sister…</p><p>This new C4 Picasso is lighter, roomier and quicker than the outgoing version. It has much-enhanced aerodynamics and an optimised range of engines that, at the extreme end, will deliver CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of just 98g/km and a class-leading combined fuel economy of up to 74.3mpg. The drive is assured and engaging. For such a large vehicle, it feels supple, almost athletic.</p><p>If MPV means boring to you, this car will make you think again. It is bold and modern and quite unlike any other car you will sit in this year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336916'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400603982710/citroen-interior-2-011.jpg' alt='citroen interior 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Room in the back: the huge seating area of the Grand Picasso has been designed inspired by 'loft living'.</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside, handsome flowing lines work hard to disguise the box-on-wheels approach of most people carriers. It has unusual squinting headlamps which sit beneath glinting running lights and a futuristic grille which cleverly incorporates Citroën's double- chevron logo. The short bonnet steps up to a huge curving windscreen that sweeps over your head. I've visited aquariums with less glass.</p><p>Inside, the step-change in design continues. Citroën claims it was inspired by \"loft living\". That doesn't mean exposed brick and a steel beam through the centre. What it means… well, let's be honest – it doesn't really mean anything, does it? But, strangely, a loft really is what it feels like: you sit up high, surrounded by glass and nice design touches. There's a huge flat floorspace on which the three rows of large, comfortable seats can slide around. The dashboard is an appealing mixture of curves and angles, and there's a clever centrally mounted instrument binnacle. The digital screen can be configured any way you like – you choose from a&nbsp;range of themes and profiles. You can even upload your own picture as a sort of automotive desk top.</p><p>Spacious, versatile, efficient and with plenty of pizzazz… More than enough to concentrate the mind.</p><h2>Purple Harry cleans up</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400605104415/Alistair-and-Jonathon-Bro-003.jpg' alt='Alistair and Jonathon Brownlee' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Clean bikes go quicker: Jonny and Alistair Brownlee training near their home. Photograph: Levon Biss for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>It may sound like the kind of game Prince Harry plays late at night in his hotel room, but <a href=\"http://www.purpleharry.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Purple Harry</a> is in fact a new brand of bike cleaning accessories, scrubs, lubes and washes. Set up by Richard Hargreaves and Dean Perry in Derby three years ago, the pair appealed for investment using the website <a href=\"http://www.crowdcube.com/\" title=\"\">CrowdCube</a>. The final investors were none other than Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, the Olympic gold and bronze medal winning triathletes. The brothers had become interested in Purple Harry after trialling the products during their bike training, and they liked them so much they decided to support the business directly by becoming shareholders. Another chapter in the book of \"I liked the product so much I bought the company\" stories. Before starting up Purple Harry, Perry and Hargreaves worked in the logistics sector but spent much of their spare time cycling in Derbyshire dales. Witnessing the boom in popularity of cycling and the vast increase in people taking up the sport to keep fit, race and commute, the two decided to enter the cycling industry after finding a solution to an age old problem. How to reach the most inaccessible but crucial components of a bike, especially the rear cassette and drive train? After searching in vain for industrial grade dental floss the Eureka moment came when Perry was helping his daughter on a school project using pipe cleaners, and realised that a modified version could be ideal. They began working with a pipe cleaner manufacturer in Yorkshire which was keen to explore new ventures and 'Bike Floss' was born. The product sold well, so Purple Harry began branching out with a complementary range of non- aerosol cleaning sprays and chain lubricants, plus another simple but unique creation – a microfibre Wash and Polish Mitt. The products are all affordable and well made. Give them a shot.

It's still a family firm, run from its Milan workshop by Ugo's sons Danilo, Doriano and Cristiano.</p><p>De Rosa is one of the few bike builders which offers frames in a&nbsp;choice of steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon. Debating the pros and cons of each of these materials is the kind of thing that keeps passionate cyclists awake at night – that and their saddle sores. Dip into any bike website and the word \"stiffness\" occurs with such alarming regularity you'll be clearing your search history.

Lift it with your finger and it's more hologram than bike. The mix of tube shapes blends aerodynamics with power and good looks with comfort. The slim rear stays feed into the top tube like the straining tendons of an athlete's neck. The gear and brake cables are all internally routed, which keeps the lines clean and uncluttered. The Idol comes with an 11-speed <a href=\"http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Campagnolo</a> Athena groupset. \"Oh, a Campag…\" muttered my neighbour reverentially. \"So mechanical…\"</p><p>I tested the Idol on the Surrey hills in last Sunday's London Cycle Sportive.

On the hills it turned me into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/mar/07/cycling.features\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>… Well, you've got to have an \"idol\".  But best of all, it was so comfortable. It's not often you climb off a bike after 100 miles with a bottom that isn't the bright pink of the Maglia Rosa.

Photograph: Matt Alexander</figcaption></figure><p>Keen cyclists from the mean streets of south London are a familiar sight on the leafy hills of Surrey, but last Sunday's second annual <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/london-cycle-sportive\" title=\"\">FT London Cycle Sportive</a> turned the quite lanes into a busy cycle track. Torrential rain and gale-force winds threatened to de-rail the ride, I even checked the website before I left home in the vain hope that the event would be cancelled. But cyclists are a hardy bunch and it was clearly going to take more than rain and 30mph gusts to send us back to bed. In the end almost 2,300 turned out to tackle either the 48km, 100km or 100-mile distances of the sold-out sportive organised by Human Race in support of Access Sport. As I was on the De Rosa (reviewed above) it seemed the least I could do was to tackle the longer loop. We started at 7.30am in Dulwich Park, puzzled dog walkers wondering what was going on as hundreds whirred out of the gates, before climbing up towards Crystal Palace and then along the edge of the North Downs with amazing views over Kent and Surrey. As always it is a surprise just how quickly London goes green when you are on two wheels whisking along empty Sunday-morning roads. Eventually we returned through the suburbs and were rewarded with a victory lap of the Herne Hill velodrome – the one used in the 1948 London Olympics and now being restored by the <a href=\"http://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/friends/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. It was a great and testing day – competitive yet filled with camaraderie. The London Cycle Sportive is part of the Human Race Sportive Series. The next event is the Chiltern 100 on 1 June.

Called <em>Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist</em>, it explores the startling truth behind his remarkable descent from being among the finest athletes on earth to his tragic end in a sport riven by intrigue. Based on two years of extensive research and inspired by Matt Rendell's excellent book <em>The Death of Marco Pantani</em>, the film combines scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani's friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. Known as Il Pirata thanks to his head scarf and gold hoop earrings, the film celebrates the rise of a man born in 1970 to a humble family in Cesanatico in northern Italy to become the most successful, flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era.&nbsp;In 1998, he won both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia – he was the last man to accomplish the titanic feat. Yet, less than six years later, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room – destroyed by the sport to which he had given so much. It's a sad, humbling film which shines a light on the extraordinary pressures the riders faced at the height of the doping scandals.

You know, we should chew our food thoughtfully, gaze meditatively at tree blossom, appreciate the beauty and intricacy of human connection… Yadda yadda. Of course, in the way of most modern fads, it is simply a re-application of an ancient wisdom – in this case the Buddhist teaching of <em>sammã-sati</em> –   the attentive awareness of the present moment. So, is there anything the Buddha can teach us about driving?</p><p>Like many things we do every day, it's easy to take cars for granted. When was the last time you really thought about the act of driving? The power at your disposal, the almost surreal ability to change your surroundings with a blip of your right foot, the transcendental experience of being at one with a mechanical masterpiece? Probably not for a while, right?</p><p>Well, I've just spent 24 hours giving myself a full-throttle lesson in <em>sammã-sati</em> courtesy of Lotus's relaunched<a href=\"http://www.lotuscars.com/gb/our-cars/current-range/evora-sports-racer\" title=\"\"> Evora Sports Racer</a> – and there can be few vehicles better equipped to help you hurtle along the path to enlightenment. Lotus has a reputation as a maker of drivers' cars and for more than 60 years it has been a class-leading manufacturer of sports cars. The old maxim that its vehicles were Lots Of Trouble Usually Serious is now dead and buried.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435676555'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398855851907/Lotus-evora-interior-011.jpg' alt='Lotus evora interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the racing cockpit of the Evora.</figcaption></figure><p>Today, its vehicles put the divine act of driving front and centre, and in the Evora S that is almost to the exclusion of everything else. Rear visibility – none; rear seats – suitable for flatpacked children only; boot – baguette sized… But this mid-engined 3.5-litre V6 supercharged 2 plus 2 sports car delivers a phenomenal, memorable driving experience.</p><p>Slide into the bucket seat and wrap your fingers around the chunky steering wheel, gaze down its wide bonnet between the twin arches of the front wheels, fire up the engine, slot the gearstick into first, feel your foot pressure the throttle… When you are in the grip of a Lotus it's hard to think about anything else.</p><p>I drove it 560 miles up the spine of England and across the winding roads of Cumbria, past old hay barns and crumbling Wesleyan chapels, along sweeping lanes beneath menacing hills, and the live-in-the-moment joy of driving never ceased.</p><p>The Evora was unveiled at the 2008 British Motor Show and almost instantly became the benchmark for ride and handling. There were teething problems, however – build quality was erratic and there were complaints about the naturally aspirated V6 engine and clunky six-speed gearbox. Since then Lotus has dealt with its snagging list and now the Evora is a genuine contender to undercut a basic Porsche 911. It's as fast, as aggressive and as exhilarating to drive. If you were able to let rip on a track you'd also be able to sample the Evora's DPM (Dynamic Performance Management) traction and stability systems.</p><p>There are still a few irritants. The tiny back window coupled with the wide arches over the rear wheels, its \"love handles\", make this as hard  a car to park as you'll find. And flush, brushed-steel buttons on the dash are almost impossible to see while driving. But all these are quickly forgiven the moment you take to  the road and lose yourself in the everyday brilliance of mindful driving.

After a few weeks, something strange started happening to the fuel gauge. She took it to a specialist who diagnosed the problem and told her the car needed a host of urgent repairs. The quote was £3,500.</p><p>Had Lucy had access to all of the vehicle's history, it might well have flagged some urgent repairs advised to the previous owner that had not been addressed. Annoyingly, that information is \"out there\" somewhere – sitting redundant on a variety of dealer databases and garage records or as paperwork languishing in previous owners' drawers.</p><p>The experience led her to launch <a href=\"https://www.motoriety.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Motoriety.co.uk</a> – a \"digital glove compartment\" for anyone who owns a car. It enables them to document the full service history of their cars – adding an estimated 26% in value when they sell it. It has all sorts of administrative features to make life easier for motorists. There's a clever two-way rating and review service for garages and it alerts users to key dates – like when their car insurance and car tax needs renewing while saving them cash on insurance, servicing and repairs.</p><p>In order to launch Motoriety Lucy wound down a successful marketing agency she started and ran for 12 years, which represented luxury global food and drink brands such as Grey Goose vodka. Now, instead of going to dinners with Sir Elton John, she's attending automotive conferences across the UK and talking tech and API integration!</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow himn on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","headline":"Lotus Evora: car review","trailText":"<p>A car for people who love to drive, the Lotus Evora has more in common with Buddhism than you would believe, says <strong>Martin Love</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"57","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398855595531/Lotus-evora-004.jpg","wordcount":"814","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"435674177","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8909161","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Love","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-04T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2084570","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-07T09:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/lotus-evora-car-review-martin-love","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/may/04/lotus-evora-car-review-martin-love","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

The brand is so synonymous with smouldering Italian sexuality, with unhinged speed, with head-swivelling performance and with being a bit, er, suspect that it is impossible to even say the word without a frisson of expectation running through you. When it comes to passion, Lotharios always have a streak of unreliability running through them. And over the decades, Maserati has certainly had that.</p><p>The iconic brand celebrates its centenary this year and has launched bold plans for world domination. Two signings have been added to its team sheet: this Ghibli and next year the Levante, a luxury SUV. These are the cars which the Italians hope the Chinese and the Americans will be queuing up to buy. Maserati plans to sell 50,000 cars by 2015, which sounds unlikely when you consider last year's global sales of just 6,200.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.maserati.co.uk/maserati/uk/en/index/models/ghibli/ghibli-diesel.html\" title=\"\">Ghibli</a> is a four-door, five-seat sports car which Maserati hopes will barge aside top-end Audis, BMWs, Jags and Mercs. History and myth-making are so much a part of Maserati's appeal that it's worth noting this is the third Ghibli – there was a stunning two-door coupé in the 60s and a pig-ugly saloon in the 90s. (The <a href=\"http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wind/The-Ghibli.htm\" title=\"\">Ghibli</a> itself is a hot, dry wind in north Africa.) This third Ghibli boasts Maserati's first ever diesel engine. That tells you something: after 100 years, it has finally decided to offer a powerplant that doesn't drink like George Best on a bender. Join the party, guys! Rather incredibly for such a large and heavy car, the 3-litre turbocharged V6 will do 47.9 mpg and puts up a decent fight against emissions with just 158g of CO<sub>2 </sub>per km – not so much hot dry air as its namesake.

A&nbsp;<em>Towie</em> tan and nails to match would be in order, too, to accessorise the blood-red leather interior. The car exudes presence, its gaping grill is ready to suck air in like a sprinter, the triple vents on each flank harking back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/17/maserati-250f-perfect-racing-machine\" title=\"\">its Fangio days</a> and racing pedigree. Passers-by gawp, other road users let you sweep ahead of them – this must be what Sophia Loren felt like as she marched across thronged piazzas. Some motorists weren't on message and saluted me with their middle finger. What did I care? I was a Maserati man for the week.</p><p>So: great looks, a lavish cabin and a fearsome engine roar. But there were a few things I wasn't prepared for. First, the price. It isn't crazy; it's less than 50 grand. Second, the drive. It isn't great. The automatic box – a&nbsp;much-praised eight-speed – was lumpy and unpredictable. I found it hard to engage drive and reverse. And the engine, though it responds to a heavy foot and makes mincemeat of the oppo if you drive as if you are fleeing the law, was worryingly shuddery at low speeds. The handling I found wearying if I did anything other than drive in a straight line.</p><p>A shame, really, as it's a great-looking car, though the allure of saying \"I drive a Maserati\" might fade faster than you think.</p><h2>Fancy go-karting?</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435313180'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398263255354/go-karting-006.jpg' alt='go-karting' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the hot seat: a teenage Michael Schumacher finds his kart a little uncomfortable (circa 1986). Photograph: Sutton</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.team-sport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">TeamSport</a>, Europe's biggest and most successful indoor go-kart operator has revamped a state-of-the-art track for London. The circuit, formerly known as the Raceway Docklands, now offers the finest indoor racing facilities for adrenaline junkies of all ages. This spectacular venue, only one tube stop from Canary Wharf, is set to follow in the footsteps of other TeamSport circuits which regularly attract celebrities such as One Direction, Simon Cowell, Ellie Goulding, Jamie Cullum, Liam Gallagher and diver Tom Daley. The track is 800m long, with exhilarating straights, plus challenging hairpin bends and banked turns. A brand new fleet of high-spec 270cc LPG karts can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, but at just two inches off the floor can feel like twice that! Every lap is recorded to an accuracy of 1/1000th of a second, with large screens and print-outs allowing drivers to compare their results against rivals – and check out technique.  Smart new racing suits and helmets are also part of the deal.  Friends, family and colleagues can take in the action from the bar or restaurant as they overlook the track. TeamSport is not just for fearless grown-ups. Little Lewis Hamiltons can also show off their racing skills in specially designed top-of-the-range 'cadet' karts. TeamSport now has 12 tracks across the UK and is set to double in size in the next three years.

One of my favourites is from the 1930s. It shows an old lady wearing a flowery hat, white gloves and a bemused expression. She's gripping a steering wheel as if her life depends on it. The caption says: \"And do I have to keep hold of this thing?\"</p><p>I had the same feeling while driving <a href=\"http://www.infiniti.eu/\" title=\"\">Infiniti's</a> hyper-sophisticated new hybrid saloon, the Q50. Even the name sounds space-agey, as if it isn't a car at all but some dark star from a fathomless galaxy. It also has an extraordinary secret up its sleeve: it is the first car in the world to do away with the steering column. That round thing in your hands, formerly known as a steering wheel, now transfers your movements electronically to a high-response actuator which connects to the steering rack and thus causes your wheels to turn… that's the theory anyway.</p><p>It's not unheard of – aeronautics have used fly-by-wire technology for years. But drive-by-wire cars, in which mechanical linkages are replaced by electro-magnetic hocus-pocus, are pretty newfangled. And to sit gripping the steering wheel, knowing a little black box is going to interpret my wishes and pass them on to another black box, is unnerving. It's all too easy to imagine plunging down a country lane, eyes bulging, teeth bared, the limp steering wheel lying in your lap, your screams muted by the Q50's suede interior, like some video game gone rogue…</p><p>The technology is called <a href=\"http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/OVERVIEW/direct_adaptive_steering.html\" title=\"\">Direct Adaptive Steering</a> and the idea is that the digitally enhanced steering connection allows for better, sharper handling as it filters out all unwanted vibration. And it really works. Steering can hardly ever have felt lighter or more responsive. It does also raise the question, could the wheel be replaced with something else altogether? A&nbsp;banana-shaped joystick, maybe? Could you sit in the back and steer? Back-seat driving becomes a reality…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434015930'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396956523633/Q50-interior-007.jpg' alt='Q50 interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The futuristic cockpit of the Q50.</figcaption></figure><p>So much for the steering, what about the rest of the vehicle? Infiniti is the posh arm of Nissan, in the same way that Lexus is Chelsea to Toyota's Essex. The firm was only set up in 1989 and it makes just six high-performance yet discreet vehicles. The Q50 is the cheapest, starting at £29,000, while the QX70 is the most expensive, going for over £54,000.</p><p>The Q50 seems to be on a quest to be different – both inside and out it stands out from the crowd. Inside there are <em>three</em> touchscreens with a&nbsp;bewildering display of information and driver aids. The entertainment and online package looks more like the welcome screen of an iPad than anything you'd normally find in a&nbsp;car. Outside every panel is creased and pillowed, bulged  and curled with almost wilful disregard for the norm. It's as if the designers have looked elsewhere  and thought: \"If they curve that way, we'll go the other.\"</p><p>It is powered by a great surging 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine and an electric motor via a seven-speed automatic box. With its featherlight controls joyfully harnessing the heavyweight powerplant, it all feels dizzyingly effortless – as if it's found an antidote to gravity. Sitting in the futuristic cockpit, surrounded by blinking screens and holding your unchained steering wheel, it's easy to imagine you are in some sort of space fantasy… Is that George Clooney floating past the window?</p><h2>The Tweed Run</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434015927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396962958774/Tweed-run-009.jpg' alt='Tweed run' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Tweed Run: where style meets cycling.</figcaption></figure><p><br />On Saturday 17 May people dressed in tweed and riding lovely old bicycles will be spreading their particular brand of charm and eccentricity through the streets of London as they take part in the 6th annual <a href=\"http://tweedrun.com\" title=\"\">Tweed Run</a>.

for trails and muddy fields, the cyclocross bike is finding a new lease of life coping with the city's mean streets","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T09:01:34Z","body":"<p><strong>Price</strong> £999<br /><strong>Gears</strong> Shimano 105<br /><strong>Frame</strong> Aluminium</p><p>Ooooooffff… The bike's wheel drops into a gaping hole then ricochets upwards, driving the hard saddle into my cowering rump. The thump travels through my shoulders, making my mouth snap shut and my head yank backwards… Ask any urban cyclist about the perils they face on the road and they'll list everything from homicidal taxi drivers to Boris-bike bozos and zoned-out pedestrians. But the number-one menace is the pothole.</p><p>The tarmac along stretches of my pock-marked commute looks like it is in the grip of some hellish Victorian contagion – it is scarred, ravaged, pustulant. It's so pitted, in fact, that as I rallycross over it, I no longer feel safe on my skinny-tyred road bike. The poor thing bucks around like a&nbsp;two-wheeled bronco, shaking the fillings from my teeth. These mean streets call for something much tougher.</p><p>For years, the only frames built to really cope with this sort of punishment are mountain bikes. In the wilds of Wales, fine, but you feel ridiculous pedalling around town on a ride with full suspension, jelly-mould tyres and handlebars as wide as steer horns. There is, however, another way: step forward the cyclocross bike, or \"gravel racer\". Developed as a rugged, off-road alternative, it is, depending on your point of view, either a pumped-up, redneck road bike or a slimmed-down, urbane mountain bike.</p><p>The sport of cyclocross, or CX, is aimed at adrenalin addicts who like to spend time with their hearts in their mouths – and their stomachs in their pants. Racers hurtle down terrifyingly narrow tracks, haul their bikes up hills and through streams. They scramble across boggy fields. Mud, in fact, is mandatory. It's tough stuff and CX bikes are unbreakable. They boast a rough-riding, take-no-prisoners geometry and that makes them ideal for urban badlands, so this new Lombard from Marin is all set to put the CX into the city. Oh, come on, that was hilarious…</p><p>Established in California in 1986, Marin is a brand that's long been synonymous with off-road biking. It's also long been synonymous with bearded hippies wearing bandanas who spent their days blasting down trails on home-modified bikes. But without those deranged pioneers off-roading wouldn't be what it is today.</p><p>The Lombard's frame is double-butted aluminium. It only comes in black, but a reflective strip along the top bar gives it depth and texture. It isn't lightweight, but that's not what you want here. Straddle the bike and it feels so grounded it's like sitting on a small heffer (I imagine). It's so well planted, in fact, that when you lift your feet you're surprised when it starts to tilt. The tapered carbon forks make it agile, and you get stout mixed-tread tyres to provide plenty of grip and comfort. Those tyres soak up potholes with relish. The drivetrain is a dependable Shimano 105, which switches from gear to gear with a neat, accurate click. The brakes are hydraulic discs which give you mighty stopping power whatever the terrain or the conditions.</p><p>Applied to the chronic impetigo of the capital's distressed roads, the Lombard is a&nbsp;soothing balm.</p><h2>Win tickets to the British Superbiking Championship with <br />I, Superbiker 4: The War for Four</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433688932'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/3/1396543156399/I-Superbike-009.jpg' alt='I Superbike' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Grabbing some air: Josh leaves the world behind.</figcaption></figure><p><br />The 2014 MCE Insurance <a href=\"http://www.britishsuperbike.com/\" title=\"\">British Superbiking Championship</a> kicks off at Brands Hatch on 18 April followed by 11 electrifying rounds across the nation over the next six months.

The <a href=\"http://www.haynesmotormuseum.com/\" title=\"\">Haynes International Motor Museum</a> officially relaunches on 16 April following a £5m investment, more than two years of work (and many more of planning). The new museum will be home to over 400 of the greatest cars from around the world, dating from 1885 to the present, among them you'll find Bentleys and Rolls-Royces from the 50s, a Ferrari 360, a huge variety of veteran, vintage and pre-war classics, motorsport cars through the ages, a $10m Duesenberg and many more, as well as brilliant collection of motorbikes. The Museum was first established in a sawmill in Sparkford (just outside Yeovil) in 1985 by John Haynes OBE with 33 cars. This new, rather more impressive, building boasts a long s-shaped glass double storey entry foyer and showcase. There are three new exhibition halls, two modernised halls, interactive displays and virtual reality interpretation. There is also the Haynes Motorland children's adventure play zone, a suite of function rooms, a café and museum shop. It makes for a great day out!

And now it has its very own cycling festival. For the second year running, <a href=\"http://pedalnorfolk.co.uk\" title=\"\">Pedal Norfolk</a> will be taking place on 3-5 May at Holkham Hall. The historic house and its stunning 25,000-acre estate make a perfect place to camp and cycle. The Olympic medallist Emma Pooley will be there to get riders under starter's orders and will be riding alongside participants of the eight sportives, before sharing insights into her career at a Q&amp;A on Saturday evening. You can choose between 20, 50 and 100-mile races and even a time trial. Do them all and you will clock up 250 miles over the weekend. There is also a host of entertainment for all ages with a new cyclocross and off-road trail, fantastic displays by Team Extreme's Zero Gravity BMX team, fun and games with Doctor Spinoff and his 22 whacky bicycle inventions and Highline Adventures's climbing wall, plus lots of \"have-a-go\" activities. With great food from Norfolk's Feast on the Street and many of the leading bike brands including Merida, SRAM, Cinelli and Shimano exhibiting, Pedal Norfolk is a great opportunity to see and test the latest equipment and meet their teams. More than that it is a great chance to get on your bike and spend a long weekend among like-minded cyclists.

your car a let down at the pumps? There's a simple reason why fuel- efficiency figures are always way out…","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T08:40:55Z","body":"<p><strong>Price £48,670</strong><br /><strong>MPG 155.2</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 143mph</strong></p><p>My youngest daughter used to struggle with what was \"real\" and what was \"made up\". Books and films were real, but the stories in them were made up. Cartoon characters were made up, of course, but one day we met an 8ft Percy Pig in Hyde Park. That really messed with her little blonde head.</p><p>That same sense of bafflement occurs in motorists when they consider the \"made-up\" mile-per- gallon figures published in glossy brochures about their new car's fuel consumption and the \"real\" figure they achieve out on the road, you know, when they are actually driving. The literature says 45mpg and you get half that, which is not so much \"made up\" as flamboyant fantasy.</p><p>By law, fuel economy is measured under controlled conditions using a&nbsp;standardised test. A vehicle's drive wheels are placed on a machine called a dynamometer that simulates the driving environment. It's a sort of hamster wheel for cars. Fuel burned and emissions produced are recorded under the watchful eye of the Vehicle Certification Agency. For years there have been dark tales of collusion between manufacturers and testers, of cars stripped of seats to make them lighter, of door seals taped shut for better aerodynamics. But the truth is far more mundane…  In the quest to find an affordable and repeatable tool to measure a car's thirst and provide a&nbsp;useful comparison across all models, almost every single real-world variable has been removed from the driving experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485138'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841025547/Volvo-V60-inside-011.jpg' alt='Volvo V60 inside' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the lavish interior of the new Volvo V60.</figcaption></figure><p>In reality, everything from road surface to wind resistance and even the weight of your passenger will make a difference. Then there's the optimum operating temperature of the engine and whether you are consuming extra energy by having the aircon on full blast. But the single greatest variable – and the one that is impossible to test for – is your driving style. It's estimated that this alters your car's efficiency by at least 50%.</p><p>The only consistent variable seems to be that none of the manufacturers' figures are accurate. Last year <em>What Car?</em> tested 240 different vehicles to find their \"True MPG\". Only three of those 240 met their official combined consumption figure – the Porsche Boxster, BMW's 320d and Suzuki's Swift. The worst was Porsche's  Cayenne GTS.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485139'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841524457/Volvo-rear-view-009.jpg' alt='Volvo rear view' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Keep up if you can: the new Volvo is one of the most fuel-efficient cars you can buy.</figcaption></figure><p>The car with the highest \"claimed\" figure is Volvo's V60 Plug-in Diesel Hybrid. Official testers signed off on a&nbsp;scarcely believable 155.2 miles to a single gallon of fuel. More astonishingly, it will do that while emitting just 49g of CO<sub>2</sub> per km. It's a&nbsp;proper luxury estate, too. Despite all its eco credentials it can be driven hard and fast. It'll hit 62mph in a&nbsp;shade under 7 seconds and tops out at 143mph. The V60 achieves all this by having two motors: a D5 2.4-litre diesel up front and a 69bhp electric motor mounted on the rear axle. It's much like a&nbsp;normal hybrid but this one can be plugged into the mains. When fully charged, which takes 4.5 hours on a standard plug, you can drive it as a purely electric car at up to 60mph for a range of 30 miles. There's no range anxiety as when the batteries are exhausted the diesel kicks in until you can next plug it in.</p><p>All this incredible technology comes at a whopping price – almost 50 grand. For half that you could buy an identical-looking V60 diesel which would still do a claimed 74mpg.</p><p>What was my mileage? I&nbsp;drove 400 miles and averaged close to 75mpg. Impressive, but hardly the promised 150. That's the real world for you.</p><h2>Calling all bikers</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485140'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841833541/Easy-riding-011.jpg' alt='Easy riding' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>On the road: spring is here!

Just don't get too excited…","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T07:50:44Z","body":"<p><strong>Price £16,474</strong><br /><strong>MPG 76.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 127mph</strong></p><p>On Valentine's Day, my father broke his heart. Literally. Sixteen years after undergoing a triple bypass one of the arterial grafts had failed. The surgeon had told him the operation had been inevitable as he'd had three of the major risk factors – he'd been overweight, a smoker and from Glasgow. He now had to undergo a&nbsp;percutaneous coronary intervention. It sounded gruesome, but the brilliantly named Dr Savage said it would take two hours and he'd be out by the end of the day. My job was simply to chauffeur him in and out of <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bhi/\" title=\"\">Bristol's Heart Institute</a>. It was a surreal day. Rain and sunshine, fear and laughter, coffee and cake…</p><p>Then it got stranger. While waiting to pay in the carpark on the way home, the young woman in front of us said: \"Is that your car? That's my favourite Vauxhall. It's the new model, right?\" I gawped. Really? Do people have favourite Vauxhalls? It seemed bizarre. The car she was admiring was indeed the new model – it's the second-generation <a href=\"http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/new-insignia-range/index.html\" title=\"\">Insignia</a>, a big, five-seat family car which goes up against the likes of Ford's Mondeo and Mazda's 6. It's a loyal, workmanlike slogger, a Monday to Friday car. It's not a Saturday special. But before I could ask why she liked it, she drove off – in an ancient Astra.</p><p>I looked at the Insignia with new eyes and, yes, maybe she was on to something; there is much to admire in an understated way. It has a lovely silhouette – all long lines and grown-up curves. It's exactly the sort of vehicle you'd want to be ferried to hospital in: it feels safe and reliable. The car does have a few surprises up its sleeve, though. It is the most aerodynamic car in its class. Thanks to clever changes to the body design, the engineers have reduced the drag coefficient and boosted the car's slipperiness. There's even an active front air shutter that shunts air below the vehicle and causes less turbulence from its bottom. Maybe my dad could have one of those fitted, too…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431881920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394621307171/Vauxhall-interior-011.jpg' alt='Vauxhall interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the handsome interior with new infotainment system.</figcaption></figure><p>The Insignia is available as a&nbsp;hatchback, a saloon or an estate. If you opt for the full eco package and go for the 2-litre CDTi ecoFLEX diesel you'll also get class-leading CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 99g/km and a whopping 76.3mpg on the combined cycle. Dipping below the magic 100 barrier means no road tax and no congestion charge. For a car of this size, that seems almost nonsensical. The clever people in Vauxhall's PR department have calculated that the average UK driver covers 8,200 miles – this means you'd only have to visit the garage for a refill seven times a year.</p><p>Inside, everything has been made a lot simpler. The rash of buttons that used to spread across the old Insignia's central console like shingles has been replaced with a&nbsp;smart 8in infotainment display  and re-designed instrument cluster.</p><p>The diesel handles well, though it does sound a bit gruff at low speeds – but to achieve such a high economy sacrifices have to be made. The ride is firm and steady. It eats motorway miles with the same quiet determination a teenage boy demolishes a mountain of pasta.</p><p>The all-round frugality means the Insignia will find its way on to many a&nbsp;fleet manager's list. Will this Vauxhall find its way on to your dream wish list? No, but after a heart operation it offers all the excitement my father could cope with…</p><h2>Bournemouth revs up for a new Wheels Festival</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431881917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394622374122/Monster-truck-009.jpg' alt='Monster truck' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sun, sea and monster trucks: are you ready for Bournemouth's new Wheels Festival?</figcaption></figure><p>The seaside town's airshow is one of the best in the world, now it's hoping to do the same with a new Wheels show.

They're the six-cylinder seawall we erect to shore up our mounting insecurities. And nothing does that better than a big-engined convertible. The mighty rumble from its exhausts tells the world we are solvent, virile and, yes, awesome. We park next to miserable mid-size saloons in company carparks and watch the oppo limp away… pulverised. <em>Booyakasha</em>! So how come I always feel like a knob when I&nbsp;drop the top?</p><p>The reason, I think, is that people who purchase convertibles are overly concerned with their image. They buy ludicrous red sports cars made by Italians; they wear sunglasses in the shade; they put too much gel on their thinning hair. But one thing they don't do is buy <a href=\"https://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/cascada/overview.html\" title=\"\">Vauxhalls. So this Cascada</a>, a&nbsp;new convertible from the Luton-based company (which last year celebrated its 110th anniversary), comes prejudice-free. No one will think you're a&nbsp;right tool in the grip of an existential crisis. Leaving you free to savour the enduring joy of driving an unpretentious car with the roof down. I am convinced this pleasure goes right back to the days when our hairy-faced ancestors roared about in open chariots. Even then, though, there must have been jumped-up poseurs with chrome wagon wheels, flashing a thigh in a short leather tunic. Maybe in white, with tassels…</p><p>So, for those of you looking for an unassuming&nbsp;convertible, you'll find the Cascada is more than up to the job. It's a well-made and thoughtfully designed car. With the roof folded neatly away, it has all the clean functionality of an elegant yacht's tender. The roof is fabric – those folding hard-tops are so last year – and this softens and feminises the car. You can also have it in a stylishly contrasting colour. My test vehicle had a chocolate hood on a pale sapphire body – gorgeous.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430122849'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392742955670/cascada-drop-top-011.jpg' alt='cascada drop top' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Open Sesame!: the fabric folding top in action.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside, the dash is wrapped in stitched leather, the seats are deep and the controls are nibbed in quality rubbers. The only oversight is the crappy red dot-matrix display between the dials, which looks like it was nicked from a 70s microwave.</p><p>You could be forgiven for guessing the Cascada is nothing more than a roofless Insignia, but it has been designed from the chassis up and doesn't share a single panel with any other Vauxhall. The car comes in two trim levels, SE and Elite, and there's a range of engines to choose from. The two bestsellers will be the 1.4-litre petrol, which is slowish yet refined and pleasant, and the gutsier 168bhp 2-litre diesel. Vauxhall claims 44.8mpg for the former, which would be miraculous for a petrol engine, while the latter will do a more plausible 50-plus miles to the gallon.</p><p>As with almost all convertibles the boot is fairly cramped, but the car does have four decent full-size seats – you don't have to be a yoga guru to tuck yourself into the back.

swift and silent, VW's first electric vehicle makes sense in every way except one – its hefty price","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-03T06:00:54Z","body":"<p><strong>Price: £19,250 (after £5,000 government plug-in grant)</strong><br /><strong>Top speed: 81mph</strong><br /><strong>Maximum range: 99 miles</strong></p><p>Over the past few years, the likes of Nissan, Renault and Tesla have pioneered the electric car as a viable alternative to the Ice car. (That's internal combustion engine, OK!) Now VW has put a toe in the water to test the temperature of consumer demand by launching its own purely electric car. It's a&nbsp;modified version of the all conquering Up – the supermini which drove off with the World Car of the Year title in 2012. The electrified <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/e-up-nf/home\" title=\"\">Up is called the e-Up</a> (said in a Yorkshire accent it sounds even better. Let's hope the next model is the e-Bah-gum).</p><p>Last week I travelled to Volkswagen's test centre in Milton Keynes to have a go in their smart little car. But before I tell you about it, we need to address the elephant in the room – The Price. This titchy car costs a staggering £24,250. The standard Up costs £8,265. There is a £5,000 \"incentive\" that the government will slip into your pocket if you buy any electric car, but even so you are still talking almost 20 grand. You'd have to spend more than £11,000 on fuel before you broke even. The e-Up's battery is guaranteed for eight years or 99,360 miles, but no one knows what sort of state the battery will even be in by then. Ergo, there is no possible economic case that would justify you splashing out on an e-Up! Which is a real shame as it's a terrific car. For comfort, economy, practicality and sheer joie de vivre it's one of the most forward-looking and transformative cars you'll see on the road.</p><p>Right, on with the drive. From the outside, the e-Up is identical to its non-electric sister. The difference is all in the drivetrain. Up front you now find a 81bhp electric motor, while the 230kg battery is cleverly built into the entire floor. This means there is no loss of space – you still have a usable boot and four good-sized seats. The extra weight also gives the car a&nbsp;lower centre of gravity which improves its handling – titchy cars can sometimes feel a bit skittery.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429559970'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/12/1392208746423/interior-of-VW-e-up-011.jpg' alt='interior of VW e up' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the interior of the car is almost identical to the standard Up.</figcaption></figure><p>Turn the key and the Up powers up. There's no sound, of course. Press the throttle and… hey, it drives just like your own car. Despite all its futuristic technology it is so intuitive and so much a member of the VW family that you feel instantly at home. By the time I'd hit the first of Milton Keynes's millions of roundabouts  – about 200 yards – I'd forgotten what was powering me. This chirpy little motor is smooth, unhesitating and effortless. It's swift, too. You'll soon be cruising on the motorway with the best of them – just not for very far. And that's the other but…</p><p>After The Price comes The Range. It's such an issue that it has spawned its own sub-category of anguish: \"range anxiety\". The Up has a range of 99 miles. It takes all night to fully charge and that 99 miles will cost you £2.80. Of course range is totally influenced by your driving style. On the open road I floored it and saw the needle shoot into the red faster than a&nbsp;teenager's bank account…</p><p>VW obviously wants its e-Up to be a massive sales hit. It won't be. I&nbsp;wouldn't be surprised if they don't shift a single unit, but that doesn't mean it isn't a success. For today's motorists, worried about the petrol running out, the e-Up is a harbinger of a carbon-free future.</p><h2>Launch of Auto Trader Magazine</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.autotrader.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Auto Trader</a>, the UK's biggest motoring destination, has announced the return of <em>Auto Trader Magazine</em>, re-imagined for the digital era.

After all Kia is the headline sponsor of the <a href=\"http://www.kiaoval.com/\" title=\"\">Oval</a> and English cricket was on a bounce having just won the Ashes (was that a dream?). So Surrey's finest players donned pads and gloves and walked out on to the immaculate wicket to see how many could fit into Kia's mid-size seven-seat vehicle. The result was an impressive 13. But in the light of the drubbing we received Down Under last month, 13 now sounds like a typically miserable score.</p><p>Kia has never taken its eye off the ball, though. Last year it sold 72,090 new vehicles in the UK, up 10% on the year before, and one of its star performers is the Carens. Its tagline is: \"Putting the fun into functional\", which describes exactly what the new Carens is all about. When you boil it down, this MPV is a van-with-windows into which has been shoe-horned a choice of reassuringly responsive and economical engines <em>and</em> seven seats. Yet Carens has managed its transition from van to car brilliantly. Most car impersonators can't disguise those giveaways – the slab sides, the heavy-set bumpers, the unrefined drive – but Carens is properly convincing.</p><p>This is the third generation and it not only replaces Carens No 2 but also Kia's ponderous Sedona. The new model is smaller outside yet somehow bigger inside. This, it seems, is the opposite of what happens to us as we get older: we feel less significant yet we get bigger and bigger with each passing lunch.</p><p>The Carens is a likable-looking car. Kia's head designer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schreyer\" title=\"\">Peter Schreyer</a>, has now rolled his distinctive \"<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-13/reinventions-how-kia-got-its-tiger-nose\" title=\"\">tiger's nose\" grill</a> out across the whole Kia fleet. There is nothing of the big cat about the Carens but, to me, it's just the right side of unassuming. It won't catch your eye at first, but look again and you'll notice the sculpted headlamps, its understated panelling and a sparing accent of chrome.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428962707'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391600628865/Kia-Carens-interior-011.jpg' alt='Kia Carens interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the light-filled interior of the third-generation Kia Carens.</figcaption></figure><p>It's certainly roomy, and though the 6th and 7th seats in the boot would be a little too snug in the long haul, they're just the job for a&nbsp;\"nominated driver\" ferrying friends safely home. There's plenty of fun and functionality to be found. The panoramic sun roof lets your passengers soak up the winter rays, while electric seats and mirrors, privacy glass, dynamic headlamps, automatic wipers and cruise control all make life more bearable. The passenger seat folds flat, as do the second and third rows, meaning the driver can sit in solitary splendour with the deck of a mini aircraft carrier stretched around them. The glove compartment is also a cool box and there's even a detachable torch for when you lose your keys in one of those dark, carpeted recesses that cars specialise in.</p><p>The car comes in three trim levels and a choice of either a 1.6-litre petrol or two versions of a 1.7-litre diesel. All three do their job with uncomplaining competence, but the lower-powered diesel offers the best compromise of power and efficiency.</p><p>Is it a driver's car? No. Why would it be? It's a family car and, as such, it knows exactly what it's doing. Which is more than can be said about English cricket.

Q5 proves size doesn't matter  in SUVs.

He had stopped next to me as I crouched to examine the long, pale graze that ran the length of the&nbsp;brand new <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/q7.html\" title=\"\">Audi Q7</a>. Water still dripped from its bumpers on to the clean concrete floor and, as far as I could tell, the wound to its polished flank was sickeningly fresh. The poor owner – what a&nbsp;nightmare, I&nbsp;thought. You nip to the shops and this happens. It would have wrecked my Christmas. My fellow shopper studied me for a while then bleeped open the door and I&nbsp;suddenly realised it was his car and not mine. He didn't seem bothered in the least. \"I did it on the way in,\" he said, rolling his eyes and puffing out his cheeks like Billy Bunter. \"Bloody hate shopping…\"</p><p>Poor Billy, I thought, in more ways than one. I also thought what a&nbsp;trial multistorey car parks are. Their malicious sharp-edged columns, knee-high kerbs and miserly turning circles must account for more scrapes and gouges, dings and dents on our cars than any other buildings in the land. Our cars probably wince as we turn their wheels on to the approach ramp.</p><p>In his colossal Audi, Billy would have had no chance. The reason I'd been inspecting his car, other than general empathy,  was that I&nbsp;had initially thought it was mine that had been \"striped\" and I'd panicked. I was driving the identically coloured Audi SUV parked in the next bay. But mine was a <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/q5.html\" title=\"\">Q5</a>, the petite sister to Billy's big-boned Q7. To my mind it offers everything the top-of-the-range Q7 offers without the drawback of its size. In the Q7 you are always the fat man in Speedos squeezing up to the poolside bar, love handles bulging out. In a&nbsp;Q5 you are that same man after his gastric band has been fitted…</p><p>Audi has long excelled at sniffing out niches in the motoring market and have a suitable vehicle for every eventuality. But when it proposed the midsize SUV in 2008 it could not have known it would go on to become the brand's bestselling vehicle in America and the car leading the charge in China. A remodelled version is due to be launched at the end of this year to go on sale in 2015, but in the meantime there is still plenty of life left in this refreshed 2014 edition.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427936251'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390566972805/Inside-the-Audi-Q5-011.jpg' alt='Inside the Audi Q5' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the refined interior of the new Audi Q5</figcaption></figure><p>In the flesh it's extremely well proportioned. Big enough to swallow my family of five plus dog and all Santa's presents for the Christmas journey home (the sliding rear benchseat is a neat touch), but also small enough to cope with city streets and, of course, multistoreys. The lack of stature means it drives much more like a car than many of its SUV rivals, but it still gives you that in-demand \"command\" position that today's drivers can't get enough of.</p><p>There is a range of engines to choose from, but the entry-level 2.0-litre TDI provides the ideal compromise between performance and economy. For my money, I'd stretch for the 3.0-litre SQ5 diesel which with Audi's legendary Quattro four-wheel-drive system (fitted to every model in the line up) develops 650Nm of torque, will do 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds yet has an official average fuel consumption of 41.5mpg and emissions of 179g/km. Cake? Eat it!</p><p>It's not often you get a chance to truly test a car's capabilities, but the appalling weather of early January meant the Audi and I faced floods, 80mph winds, lanes overwhelmed with mud, a vomiting dog (she ate the Christmas pudding) and that multistorey.

He may have had a style bypass, but he was strong, eager and looking for work. He's the fourth in his family to arrive on these shores and judging by how his siblings Duster, Sandero and Sandero Stepway have got on, Logan could well be here for the long haul.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/vehicles/logan-mcv/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=logan%20mcv&amp;utm_campaign=Logan+MCV+-+Main&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;ORIGIN=cpc&amp;CAMPAIGN=google_Logan+MCV+-+Main&amp;gclid=CIDKyOu77rsCFY3LtAodIT0AIg\" title=\"\">Logan MCV</a> (Maximum Capacity Vehicle or, as we say over here, an \"estate\") is from Romania and is made by <a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dacia</a> – the unpretentious and workmanlike manufacturer that for the past dozen years has been Renault's ever-growing budget arm, playing the same role <a href=\"http://www.skoda.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Skoda</a> does for <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Volkswagen</a>. The problem is that Skodas have started to go up in the world. They're still cheap and colossally good value, but you could not rightly describe them as budget any more than you'd call <em>Made in Chelsea </em>a gritty reality show. This  has left the door open to <a href=\"http://www.renault.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Renault</a> which has sniffed out a rung at the bottom of the motoring ladder, so drivers who prioritise low-cost motoring over, say, performance, or handling, or a <em>radio</em>, have found a&nbsp;new champion.</p><p>Already a hit in mainland Europe, Romania's runaway success has finally arrived in the UK, so pennywise Brits now have the chance to both drive <em>and</em> save money.</p><p>The Logan MCV is the least expensive new estate car on the road. In its entry-level \"Access\" trim, you can drive one away for £6,995. I poshed up and opted for the range-topping \"Laureate\", which at £10,795 is still more than three grand cheaper than the equivalent vehicle from Skoda or Seat. It comes with a touchscreen satnav, air-con, electric mirrors, Bluetooth and cruise control.</p><p>But don't let this soft packaging sucker you into thinking you are driving anything other than a&nbsp;utilitarian toiler. It's so basic, the plastics so tough, the panelling so unrefined, that it feels indestructible – it will elicit a grudging respect from you in the way a Greggs' sarnie does. The car's two other selling points are its colossal rear (only <a href=\"http://www.volvocars.com/uk/All-Cars/Volvo-V70/pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Volvo's V70</a> has a&nbsp;bigger loading bay) and its fuel-saving consumption (the 1.5-litre diesel does a claimed 74.3mpg.)</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426584911'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389181486317/dacia-interior-008.jpg' alt='dacia interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Keep it simple: the basic but user-friendly interior.</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside the car is fairly anonymous. You could probably park it anywhere as the wardens wouldn't notice it. You will also be immune from road rage. When my wife \"accidentally\" jumped a long queue no one batted an eyelid. As a&nbsp;Dacia driver she was clearly one of the people. Had she been in a Porsche there would have been an outcry.</p><p>Inside it's fine. It's a Travelodge on wheels. You know it's cheap, but it never pretended it wasn't. There's no central locking for the boot. The drive is straight out of the 70s. It pitches and rolls on corners, the acceleration is feeble, the engine rattles and the thin gearstick offers as much feedback as a spirtle in a pan of semi-set porridge. But what did you expect for less than seven grand?</p><p>I&nbsp;wasn't heartbroken to give the Logan back. But I am sure its keen price and its honest diligence means it'll find plenty of work over here.</p><h2>Cars in the sun</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426584909'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389192844180/Madeira-cars-008.jpg' alt='Madeira cars' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Streets lined with cars: last year's classic at Madeira.</figcaption></figure><p>If looking at lovely old cars and staying in a beautiful hotel is your idea of fun, you might want to check out <a href=\"http://www.reidspalace.com\" title=\"\">Reid's Palace</a> in Madeira which is hosting its third annual Classic Auto Show from 10–11 May 2014.

I asked her not because I thought she'd say something insightful, but because we were waiting for our teenage daughter to get ready so I knew we had time to fill. \"Um…\" Juliet said. \"Well, I'd say I&nbsp;feel nothing. Actually that's not true, I&nbsp;feel bored because I suspect you are about to start blathering on about the minutiae of its design or its engine or something.\" She's right, I was. But her answer is also interesting because it tallies perfectly with some research conducted by Volvo into the way we feel about cars.</p><p>By wiring up a few hapless human guinea pigs and monitoring brainwave activity in the pre-frontal cortex while they gazed at cars, Volvo's scientists found that men experienced more emotion while looking at a beautiful car than they did looking at an image of a crying child. Brilliant! Well done, guys. You knew that was coming, didn't you, but it still takes my breath away that men really are from Mars – or at least some distant place where cars and football and beer and cars matter more than bawling infants. Women, of course, the balanced emotive sensitive beings that they are, felt the opposite. Though I didn't tell Juliet. I punished her with some interesting chat about the 308's new emergency collision braking system.</p><p>A parallel survey revealed that men found the car's \"face\" to be its most appealing feature. While women – those who responded at all – were drawn to how the rear of a car looked. Go figure!</p><p>I didn't have wires sprouting from my scalp, but I can tell you I&nbsp;felt sensations of pleasure when I looked at the new Peugeot 308 outside our house. It's a great looker – from both back and front. It has taken inspiration from the elegant 208, although this is much more than a pumped-up supermini. Tapering LED headlamps swirl from the aerodynamic face round to its muscular flanks. The rear end is more upright than before and the back panels feature a triple wave which flows down from the back door over the enhanced wheel arch. I felt \"happy to very happy\" when I looked at these.</p><p>The new 308 is the first model in the company's history to retain the name of its predecessor. Usually each new Peugeot has its number bumped up. So in theory this should be the 309. I suppose it had to stop somewhere, but there is no sense that this new car is standing still. It's bigger, safer, smoother and more efficient than the outgoing 308. And, more importantly, it shows the direction Peugeot sees itself going – upmarket. It's taking on the Germans. VW's Golf and Audi's A3 have set the standard for this group for years, but the 308 wants a bit of the action and has been designed to be if not class-leading then definitely up there on the swots' table.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426132637'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388666305608/Peugeot-308-interior-008.jpg' alt='Peugeot 308 interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the refined cockpit with panoramic windscreen.

Much of this comes from the new i-Cockpit which features a compact integrated steering wheel, a head-up instrument panel and a large 9.7in touch screen. Scroll from menu to menu and the unit makes a barely audible whooshing sound which adds to the sense of hi-tech. The console has numerous connected services, too. It'll tell you where nearby parking spaces are or fuel prices at the nearest station.</p><p>The car is 140kg lighter than the old 308, and a range of eight engines are on offer. The highlight will be the diesel 1.6 HDi (which arrives this summer). It'll churn out 120bhp and just 82g/km CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Finally, our daughter arrived. \"What do you feel about this car?\" I&nbsp;asked. \"Eh?

No other two letters conjure up so immediately an image of fun, affordable, sporty motoring. Still based in Longbridge, but now owned by the massive <a href=\"http://www.saicmotor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chinese manufacturer SAIC</a>, the marque tentatively made its reappearance on British roads last year with the unspeakably dull <a href=\"http://mg.co.uk/mg6/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=MG6&amp;utm_term=mg6%20-e&amp;atlassearch=paid\" title=\"\">MG6</a> – a bargain-basement Mondeo wannabe which managed to sell a paltry 300 motors. Where's the fun in that? Now we have the more promising <a href=\"http://mg.co.uk/mg3/\" title=\"\">MG3</a> – which is half the size but at least twice as good.</p><p>With images of sportsters, scarves and blonde hair floating before my eyes I ring my friend Guy to tell him MG's news (I did have other things to say to him, too, <em>actually</em>). He was once the proud owner of an MG roadster back in the 80s. It was an unhealthy sludge colour with brown seats and a beige fabric roof, but we all loved it. For a couple of summers it was our trump card in the dating game. Who am I kidding? It was our only card.</p><p>\"Oh no,\" Guy groans. \"That car was a pile of rusting crap that cost me a&nbsp;fortune.\" Would he like to come for a test drive in MG's new entry-level hatchback? There's a pause. And then: \"No, of course not.\"</p><p>So I'm on my own. But the MG3 still wants to have fun. It's not glamorous in the way you remember an MG being, and to the young motorist who it's aimed at, the letters now mean something quite different from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars\" title=\"\">Morris Garages</a>. My teenage son informs me they now stand for Morning Glory. As in: \"Bruv, man's mum came in and almost saw the MG – it was peak!\" Nevertheless, the  MG3 is a sharp-looking car. It's mostly built in China, with the final assembly taking place in the UK, but it is styled and designed in Longbridge, where the company employs about 400 engineers. You can still fly the flag if you want to.</p><p>The car has clean lines and a&nbsp;pleasing, bold face. But it's hard for a vehicle to stand out in the super-competitive supermini class. Squint and it looks a bit Fabia, or maybe a bit Yaris, oh and definitely a&nbsp;bit Fiesta. MG has got round this by offering more personalisation options than really make sense. They claim the car has over a million possible permutations. The graphic packs cost up to £225 and you can put emoticon stickers on the roof, or a&nbsp;decal that looks like a tyre burnout. My test car seemed to be covered in fake fallen leaves – which drove me mad, as it was covered in real ones, too, being winter, and I kept trying to pick them off. Did it look cool? I'm not its 20-something target, but I think not.  I asked the boy again: \"Nah, it just makes you look like a real beg.\"</p><p>The base car starts at an amazingly cheap £8,399. Even if you go for the top-spec model, which includes an iPod connection, DAB radio, aircon, Bluetooth, parking sensor, airbags, LED running lights, cruise control and steering wheel audio controls, you still get a pound change from 10 grand.</p><p>The car handles well, but it's let down by the engine. It's a 1.5-litre petrol, which for this size of car is far too big. You could live with that, but this one whines and wheezes and you have to rev it hard to make any headway. The large engine means emissions are high, though consumption is reasonable. But no one in a car this size wants to pay £140 road tax when far bigger cars attract close to nothing.</p><p>This MG could be up there with the best cheap cars – but not until it gets a new engine. Either way, it's great to see MG rising again…</p><h2>Life-sized Scalextric on the streets of London</h2><p><br />Scalextric (owned by Hornby Hobbies) has been working with Scorch London and Renault UK to produce their latest stunt video, showing two electric cars racing on a giant Scalextric track in London.

They go up, I go down – and what's that strange droning I hear, like a&nbsp;punctured bagpipe but less melodic? Ah yes, of course, it's me – singing. People often say they can't hold a tune, but I am properly rubbish. My own children used to ask me to stop when I&nbsp;sang them a&nbsp;lullaby. Don't believe me? Ask the music teacher at my school. I was the only pupil he actually asked to leave the choir: \"I think we'll manage without you, Love.\"</p><p>Anyway, that's the feeling I've had this past week. I've been driving <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/uk/models/cayenne/cayenne-s-diesel/\" title=\"\">Porsche's Cayenne S Diesel</a>. A high-performance V8 engine has been hefted into the German marque's bestseller with the intention of generating prodigious power at more palatable levels of fuel consumption. Porsche has succeeded in both: the hulking 2.3-tonner hits 62mph in 5.7 seconds (imagine an elephant in running blades and you'll get some idea as to how unnerving it is to be in vehicle that's so heavy and yet so fast); and yet it still does 34 miles to the gallon. The manufacturers claim a range of 700 miles – which is impressive, but to brim the 100-litre tank will cost you up to £150, so it's hardly cheap motoring. Palatable, but only in a bush-tucker trial way.</p><p>This Porsche SUV has sent the motoring press into a frenzy of delight. <em>Top Gear</em> advises: \"Sell the hot hatch, the big estate and the 4x4 wagon. This one will do all that and more…\" While MSN Cars lists 16 reasons, with all the breathless panic of an asthmatic, as to why the Cayenne S Diesel is the ultimate family car. But I must have been out&nbsp;of tune with the choir (again), as I&nbsp;couldn't stand it.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425281595'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/12/16/1387195419354/Porsche-interior-008.jpg' alt='Porsche interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the luxurious interior of the Cayenne.</figcaption></figure><p>It is indubitably a wondrous feat of technical brilliance, the pinnacle of sophisticated super-luxe motoring. But it doesn't half make you feel sick, and the drive is as lumpy as hospital custard. The nausea starts when you first see the car. I've never been a&nbsp;fan of its bulging aesthetics, but the test model I drove in ice white with black trim and smoked alloys would have felt more at home in a <em>Star Wars</em> tribute night in Chelmsford. The huge grill is as widely spaced as a cattle grid, while its foot-thick wheels and aggressive stance seem tiresomely 80s. Greed doesn't seem quite so good in these post-red-braces-and-a-magnum-of-fizz days, no matter what Boris says.</p><p>Clamber in and everything feels heavy and lumbering. Even the door is too heavy. My wife (who is admittedly pretty feeble) parked the car facing up the hill we live on and claimed she couldn't prop the door open with her leg.</p><p>The interior is as you would expect: a symphony of stitched leather, chrome and glossy piano plastics. But for a car with such a&nbsp;gigantic footprint it feels cramped. A Range Rover aspires to feel light and airy, but the Cayenne wraps itself around you like a dark, furtive glove.</p><p>And what about the engine that had so many hacks drooling? I found that heavy, too. The engines I love lift a car and send you skittering across the tarmac, weightless and agile. This one is a grinder. It shoves you along with all the brutal finesse of an ice breaker. Once up to speed it was impressive, but today driving is rarely about bounding along open roads.</p><p>For me, this Cayenne was a dirge, and I was expecting an aria.</p><h2>Race2Recovery rally team</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.dakar.com/dakar/2014/us/history.html\" title=\"\">Dakar rally</a> began back in 1977, when Thierry Sabine got lost on his motorbike in the Libyan desert during the Abidjan-Nice rally. Saved from the sands in extremis, he returned to France still in thrall to this landscape and promising himself he would share his fascination with as many people as possible. He proceeded to come up with a route starting in Europe, continuing to Algiers and crossing Agadez before eventually finishing at Dakar. The founder coined a motto for his inspiration: \"A challenge for those who go. A dream for those who stay behind.\" Courtesy of his great conviction and that modicum of madness peculiar to all great ideas, the plan quickly became a reality. Since then, the Paris-Dakar, a unique event sparked by the spirit of adventure, open to all riders and carrying a message of friendship between all people, has never failed to challenge, surprise and excite. Over the course of almost 30 years, it has generated innumerable sporting and human stories. And one of the most remarkable is that of the <a href=\"http://www.race2recovery.com/\" title=\"\">Race2Recovery</a> rally team – the only disabled rally race team in the world.

And their records are great because you just add up the numbers and… boff… there's your champion. So, surely, there is a clear-cut answer to the question: what's the world's best-selling car? Well no, not exactly. <a href=\"http://www.ford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ford</a> and Toyota both claim the title.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.toyota.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Toyota</a> stated that their Corolla was the undisputed champion, but then Ford got up in their faces by talking up their boy Focus as the winner. Bragging rights count in this game as both are vying for sales in developing markets, and being able to announce to a&nbsp;benighted market ignorant of your charms that you make the \"world's best-selling car\" has all the persuasive impact of being belted about the head by Freddie Flintstone's club. Who wants nuance when you can have clout?</p><p>So what <em>are</em> the facts? Last year, Ford sold 1,020,000 Focuses, while Toyota sold 1,160,000 Corollas. So, it's Toyota… Whoa, this is where it gets a little hairsplitty, as not all Corollas are Corollas, some are Aurises. Eh? Same car, same maker, different name. But Ford's Focus is called  a Focus everywhere. Therefore, figures adjusted, Ford sneaks the nameplate title on a technicality!</p><p>Anyway… both are phenomenally competent world-beating motors and you'll be very happy with either. This week, however, I have been driving just one of the million-plus <a href=\"http://www.ford.co.uk/Cars/Focus\" title=\"\">Focuses</a> that have rolled out of a dealership somewhere on earth this year. The car has been a&nbsp;relentless, massive sales hit ever since the original Mk1 appeared in showrooms in 1998 – and this is now the third generation.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424103427'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/12/3/1386072165179/Ford-Focus-interior-008.jpg' alt='Ford Focus interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside job: the clearly laid-out interior.</figcaption></figure><p>Why it works so well for customers is no secret. It's well-made, efficient and reliable; it's arguably the best driving car in its class; it looks great; it's roomy; it's packed with hi-tech gadgetry and safety systems and… what else? Oh, yes, the clincher, it's cheap. The vast economies of scale that both Toyota and Ford bring to their prize fighters have pretty much closed the shop when it comes to the family saloon (except, of course, for VW's contender, the Golf).</p><p>For a car with such universal appeal, the Focus has a remarkably distinctive shape. Often such global players sink beneath the waves of anodyne compromise, but this new model has dramatic triangular air-intakes at the front alongside bug-eyed spotlights. The side panels are both creased and scooped and the rear features sculptural tail lights and a flying lip on the roof. It has real presence, especially if you get it in Candy Red or Burnished Glow.</p><p>The Focus wears its gadgetry lightly. The list of active and passive driver aids would soothe the brow of even the most anxious mother (Active City Stop, Lane Keeping Aid, Driver Alert and Forward Alert have all received the highest Euro NCAP awards). If you manage to crash a&nbsp;Focus you have exceeded the lowest expectations of Ford's safety officers.</p><p>As you would expect there is a&nbsp;host of engine options to choose from, ranged to suit the driving styles of the languid (1.6-litre petrol) to the lairy (the 247bhp ST). The best of the new crop is the award-winning 1-litre EcoBoost turbo petrol, which is economical and brilliant fun to drive. For ultimate efficiency go for the ECOnetic model – which looks and drives like any other Focus, but delivers more than 80mpg and just 88g/km CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>If you like backing winners, should you buy a Ford or a Toyota? Might be easier to start collecting Barbies…</p><h2>Pagani Huayra: art, emotion, technology<br /></h2><p>Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/XCARFilms\" title=\"\">XCar</a>'s incredible tribute to the one of the most amazing Italian sports cars on the road.

it over,\" says the taxi driver as we pull up outside the vast complex that is <a href=\"http://www.mini-production-triangle.com/\" title=\"\">Plant Oxford</a>. It is 100 years since William Morris converted an old military college into a car factory – and no one could have foreseen that it would develop into one of the world's most technologically sophisticated automotive manufacturers. Now lines of laser-guided robots work together in a perfectly sequenced choreography to churn out a new car every 68 seconds – a total of 900 a day. One in every six cars built by BMW is a&nbsp;Mini, and 40% of all UK car exports are Minis. It is impossible to overstate how important Mr Bean's little car is to this country's stuttering economy.</p><p>And that is why the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin, secretary of state for transport, has joined many of BMW's top brass on a miserably wet November morning in Cowley for the launch of the new <a href=\"http://www.mini.co.uk/\" title=\"\">New Mini</a>. After coffee and a few moments to learn some startling facts about one of the world's most recognisable cars – did you know that each one is brushed with ostrich feathers to remove dust in the paint shop, or that the great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Issigonis\" title=\"\">Alec Issigonis</a> once designed an amphibious wheelbarrow? – we were&nbsp;ushered into a huge darkened hall to meet and greet the third generation of BMW's baby boomer.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-423502708'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/27/1385552236445/Mini-interior-008.jpg' alt='Mini interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the latest Mini is the most 'connected' to date. </figcaption></figure><p>The honour of introducing the car was given to the historian <a href=\"http://www.dominicsandbrook.com/\" title=\"\">Dominic Sandbrook</a>, who arrived on stage in one of Sir Alec's original Minis accompanied by Spike the bulldog. (Spike is the star of the new Mini's ad campaign. \"Spike\" is just his stage name. He's actually called Turbo. Isn't that better? For a car star?) Journalists fiddled with their multilingual headsets. The chap next to me was from Moscow. On the other side, it was a bloke from… Cowley. Oh well. Dominic said Spike was a symbol of Britishness. He slobbered a bit and licked his testicles – Spike, that is. Dominic said the Mini was also a symbol of Britishness – lovable, cheeky, reliable, robust. A&nbsp;small car with big clout.</p><p>The old Mini revved off the stage to make way for its latest incarnation. Lights flashed, engines roared, and three new Minis spurted on to the stage from the shadows. They looked nearly the same as the ones we've got used to over the past 12 years, since BMW reinvented the car and began this remarkable renaissance. Out stepped Harald Krüger and Peter Schwarzenbauer, two of BMW's most senior figures – both slim, suave, grey-haired, immaculate. These industrialists run an ¤8bn a&nbsp;year company. Success seems to do wonders for your complexion. They stood on either side of the new car. More cameras flashed; we applauded. It was a rock-star moment.</p><p>Not so long ago a launch like this would have been accompanied by a host of beautiful women wearing skirts slit to the thigh; now it was well-groomed men in suits. One said: \"Mini is a way of life, a friend. It holds a special place in our hearts.\" We all cheered. Car launches are always interesting and often star-studded, but I&nbsp;can't remember one where we all felt so proud, or so emotional.</p><p>This new Mini is a perfect blend of heritage and innovation. It's quicker, cleaner and safer than the last one. It looks tidy. It comes with a choice of ground-breaking three-cylinder engines. It's more interactive and smarter than ever. Production officially started last Thursday – which would have been Sir Alec Issigonis's 107th birthday. He'd have been proud, too.

There are not many supercars with room for two little elfs in the back and, despite being so low-slung, my elderly neighbour managed to clamber in and out. It's biddable in town and even surprisingly frugal with the fuel. But all 911s, given half a&nbsp;chance, are flyers with the potential to let rip on the track. And to have such a limitless supply of power, grace and ability on tap is something that always improves your mood.</p><p>This all-wheel-drive car is powered by a phenomenal 3.8-litre six-cylinder 400bhp engine – which I, of course, spent the week driving responsibly. It's also fitted with a new seven-speed manual gearbox. It's the world's only seven-speed manual and it's easy to see why – it's a complete pain. You never seem to know what gear you are in, or should be in. My father's first car only had three gears and that served him well enough.</p><p>I rarely drive on my own. But late last Sunday I headed out to the quiet, dark lanes of Kent for one last go before the car was collected the next morning. I drove 50 miles in 50 minutes – Porsche would like that. No music, just the engine's mesmerising buzz. Fast, slow, straight, cornering… and grinning.</p><h2>Time to start the Christmas shopping</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422980407'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/20/1384967926114/Pedal-car-008.jpg' alt='Pedal car' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Step on it: a lovely classic pedal car from the RAC's online shop.</figcaption></figure><p><br />It can be hard buying for the car-lover in your life.

It was a&nbsp;typical rush-hour commute on busy roads. So far so very normal. But there was one crucial difference – the big Merc \"drove\" itself. The \"driver\" simply sat with his arms folded watching the countryside flash by. Safe, accurate, autonomous – it's one of the first in a&nbsp;new generation of \"robocars\".</p><p>Vehicles that pilot themselves have long featured on the further shore of our motoring fantasies, but it is now a certainty that in the near future affordable, intelligent cars that can think, navigate and problem-solve will be parking themselves on our driveways. And we as drivers will become passengers.</p><p>Google has been a major trailblazer with this technology. Its fleet of modified Toyota Priuses has so far covered more than 300,000 miles on public roads and, last year, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/self-driving-car-test-steve-mahan.html\" title=\"\">blind man named Steve Mahan</a> even \"drove\" one home.

It's the cheapest and smallest of the current Volvo line-up, every member of which has been revamped in the past 12 months, yet it boasts a formidable arsenal of driver aids. All of which make driving easier, safer and far more relaxing.

And now we're on the open road. What speed do you want to cruise at? 70mph! Well, I'd say that was a bit quick for these conditions, but I'll keep a&nbsp;safe distance from the bloke in front and my lane-keeping device will stop you swerving all over the white lines like you did yesterday. Hang on, are you feeling sleepy? Your head's wobbling. I'll vibrate your seat, ha, that gave you a surprise didn't it? Wake up!

Laughter comes from inside the darkened car. She steps out then leans in to say something which causes more hilarity. As she talks she steps into her shoes and wriggles her wrinkled skirt down over her bottom. She rebuttons her blouse, runs her hands through her hair and hops back in. The door slams and the engine starts…</p><p>I'd been walking my dog (honestly), and I wondered if the couple had been having sex. Think about it: laughter, darkness, a secluded lay-by, that rumpled skirt and – the clincher – a Fiesta. According to a recent poll by <a href=\"http://www.bba-reman.com/uk\" title=\"\">BBA Reman</a> of more than 2,000 drivers, the car most people have had sex in is a Ford Fiesta. Does this tell us more about Fiestas or the people who tend to own Fiestas? I'm not sure.</p><p>I pondered this as I loaded the dog into the back of the palatial <a href=\"http://www.honda.co.uk/cars/cr-v/\" title=\"\">Honda CR-V</a> I was test-driving. The boot is colossal – there's 1,669 litres of loadspace (odd how manufacturers measure space in litres, but what else would you use? A quick Wiki yields 94 different units of volume, including firkins, rundlets and hogsheads). If you fold down the back seat, which you can do in seconds by pulling a single easy-grip handle, there's room in the back of the CR-V for, oh, six and a bit hogsheads. Certainly there'd be room for a copulating couple. They'd be more than comfortable and the little sidelights would be quite romantic…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421939261'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383737175794/Interior-CR-V-008.jpg' alt='Interior CR-V' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the interior of the CR-V.</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, despite selling more than five million vehicles since it was first launched in 1995, the CR-V is not known for setting your pulse racing. It's a quietly sedate, brilliantly functional \"soft\" roader. But still waters run deep and this new model has something to boast about. Honda has put the ultrafrugal, superlight, downsized diesel engine it developed for its Civic into the SUV. This new engine is named Earth Dreams; it is 1,598cc and only powers the front wheels, so this 4x4 is only really a&nbsp;2x4. But that saving means this CR-V is more economical and eco-friendly than almost any other family off-roader on the, er, road. The loss of full \"green-lane\" capability is more than offset by the fact that fuel economy reaches unscaled heights for such a&nbsp;large car. Honda claims a coquettishly optimistic figure of 62.8mpg – maybe, if you're driving on the moon. But in mixed conditions and with a loaded car I still did average a none-too-shabby 54mpg. The remarkable engines will be built at Honda's UK manufacturing base in Swindon and they will churn out up to 500 units a day.</p><p>Does a small engine in a big car work? Thanks to a raft of technologies and weight-saving strategies, the answer is yes, incredibly well. The car flows nicely on the motorway and never feels underpowered, yet the diesel still sounds agricultural enough to convince you that you're at the wheel of something fruitier at low speeds.</p><p>Inside, the CR-V is comfortable, conservative, rewarding, grown-up. Nothing is showy, yet there is no sense of being short-changed either.</p><p>It doesn't feel like a car people will have sex in. But if they do, I'm sure it will be comfortable, conservative, rewarding and grown-up.</p><h2>Lost in translation: a sat-nav love story</h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.birdinabox.tv/\" title=\"\"><em>Bird in a Box</em></a> is a surreal short comedy about a lonely man whose first proper date in years is sabotaged by the unattainable love of his life, who proves to have as much control over his heart as she does over his route.

Now the human-as-dog naming trend has gone into reverse with half the dogs in my local park answering to human names. My own dog, Minty (what? She's white) enjoys romping around with Gary the Labrador and Adrian the Staffie. Whatever next? Are we going to start giving human names to cars? Exactly. Meet <a href=\"http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/adam/overview.html?ppc=gb_adam_adam\" title=\"\">Adam the Vauxhall</a>.</p><p>Adam follows in the footsteps of a new breed of premium superminis that have put hipster design at the core of their being – the Fiat 500, Citroën's DS3, Audi's A1 and, of course, the Mini. But there's nothing retro about Adam. He's a&nbsp;teen dream of puppy-like playfulness; a riot of endless options and choices. The online \"configurator\" offers up to 30,000 variations in everything from wheels to mirror covers. You can even order internal ambient lighting which rotates through seven shades.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420945224'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382529820002/Vauxhall-Adam-interior-008.jpg' alt='Vauxhall Adam interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mellow yellow: the new Adam can be modified in up to 30,000 different ways.</figcaption></figure><p>Based on Vauxhall's bestselling Corsa, Adam is a little shorter and a&nbsp;little wider – he's wider physically and socially. From here it all starts to get a bit wacky. The three different trim levels are called Adam Jam, Adam Glam or Adam Slam. The first is for the \"funky and fashionable\", the second for \"turning heads\" and the third is if you are \"born to be wild\". If you are, say, \"nice\" or \"morbidly shy\" then, sorry, Adam doesn't want to know you.<br /><br />Once you've selected your trim level, the party really kicks off. Take colour, for instance. You can't simply opt for white because that is called Saturday White Fever. Grey! Surely you mean The Greyfather? Yellow! That'll be James Blonde, and the worst (or best if you are Mr Fun) is orange, which is called Papa Don't Peach. It's exhausting, but it works. I&nbsp;have never before scrolled along the entire length of a&nbsp;manufacturer's colour bar to see what every shade was called – has anyone? And the relentless upbeatness is, finally, cheering. You just have to go with it…</p><p>Inside, Adam is roomier than you'd think; he has a&nbsp;decent back seat. His boot is deep and narrow, perfect for an upright suitcase, but irritating for just about everything else. He comes with a&nbsp;choice of engines (of course he does), but the 1.2 petrol I tested was right for the job. Zippy and economical, it more than held its own around town, which is what Adam is all about. On the open road Adam coped, but you'd think twice before a long trip.

The launch of a new model is always a special occasion, but <a href=\"http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/\" title=\"\">Rolls-Royce</a> clearly decided something extraordinary was needed for its <a href=\"http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/wraith/\" title=\"\">Wraith</a>.</p><p>We are led along a corridor of trees which reach 40ft up to the curve of the ancient barrel ceiling. It's like a&nbsp;hammy production of <em>Macbeth.</em></p><p>And then there it is, the mighty Wraith glowering in the half light. What an entrance this vehicle makes. It is a statement car; the ultimate get-me for the look-at-me generation. But whether you like it or not is another question. Its very singular style (not to mention its colossal price tag) means there will be as many who think it's foul as fair. To the haters those pinched eyes, slab sides and brutal architecture conjure up nothing more than an Insignia on steroids; to fans it's a contemporary interpretation of the 1938 original – bold, purposeful and unique.</p><p>In essence the Wraith is a two-door, four-seat coupé version of its bigger and squarer sister, the Ghost. Its whopping 6.6-litre V12 engine makes it the most potent and technologically advanced Rolls-Royce ever. It weighs in at an elephantine 2.4 tonnes yet it will still top 62mph in five seconds.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420121400'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381918360570/rolls-royce-wraith-interi-008.jpg' alt='rolls royce wraith interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Star performer: the roof of the Wraith can be studded with twinkling lights. Photograph: Mark Bramley</figcaption></figure><p>So much speed in such a stately body is perplexing – like a granny hoiking up her skirts and giving Usain Bolt a&nbsp;run for his money. Surely the point of a&nbsp;Rolls-Royce is to waft, to glide from one banquet to the next, rather than thrashing down the autobahn like some jumped-up member of the vulgar classes.</p><p>But this paradox is exactly what Rolls has in mind, and it's a duality that goes back to the marque's two founding fathers: goody-two-shoes Henry Royce, the perfectionist engineer, and Charles Rolls, the boy racer of his day. The choice of the word Wraith hints at this. Rolls-Royce likes to recycle names from its family tree, it gives a sense of continuity and perseverance (and alongside Phantom and Ghost, it maintains the current spectral theme), but a&nbsp;\"wraith\" has an edge of wickedness, a dark side, and that's what this car has, too – a&nbsp;streak of naughtiness.</p><p>You won't initially notice the endless ornate detail as the awesomeness of the first impression sweeps over you. The absent B-pillar, the recessed grille which references the mouth of a&nbsp;jet turbine, the rear-opening coach doors, the self-righting centres of the huge wheels…</p><p>Inside, it manages to be both grand and naff all at once. The carpets are inch-thick sheepskin, the seats look like they've been stolen from a&nbsp;gentleman's club and the doors close themselves. But the open-pore wood veneer would be more at home in a 70s sauna and the light-studded \"star\" ceiling is pure <em>X Factor</em>.</p><p>Technologically it is a&nbsp;masterpiece: wireless hotspot, touchpad multimedia, voice-activated controls. It boasts Satellite Aided Transmission, which uses GPS to scan your route and engage the right gear to ensure a&nbsp;\"magic carpet\" ride. It's like a&nbsp;butler leaning over and whispering: \"Sir, I've selected 7th for the corner ahead.\"</p><p>Overwhelming and unignorable, the Wraith conjures up a real sense of show time.

Holidays and hospitals, births, weddings, funerals… the car is always there, playing its supporting role.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419716892'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/8/1381248159523/Inside-the-BMW-320d-Touri-008.jpg' alt='Inside the BMW 320d Touring' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A grand family wagon with the daintiest of footprints: inside the BMW 320d Touring.</figcaption></figure><p>The car that had witnessed this particular milestone was <a href=\"http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/3/touring/2012/start.html\" title=\"\">BMW's 320d Touring</a> – the posh word for an estate. It's a car that can be all things. It is versatile, innovative, sexy and practical. Over the years it is a car that has eagerly made itself one of the gang in a host of very diverse families, bearing silent witness to all their life dramas. If cars could talk, the 3 Series would… well, have a&nbsp;series to itself.</p><p>For my money, the Touring is the most complete car on the road. It's a&nbsp;family car that handles like a sports car; an estate that drives like a saloon; it has a&nbsp;beautiful performance engine that is also incredibly economical. It proves that mutually exclusive concepts can sometimes coexist.</p><p>BMW makes two estate cars: a&nbsp;larger version for its 5 Series range and this neater, more compact model for the 3 Series line-up. This sixth-generation model is more spacious, more powerful and more economical than the outgoing one. From the front you wouldn't notice much of a&nbsp;difference, but from the waist back BMW has been very clever. It has added a long crease running the length of the body, a huge swoosh, and raked the rear screen. This somehow creates the impression you are sitting in a grand family wagon, yet the car still only has the daintiest of footprints. This makes it brilliant for ducking and diving in the city as well as stretching out on a long run.</p><p>As a premium motor, it has all kinds of goodies and gadgets to make you feel special. Take the boot, for example. It can be opened by hand, by pressing the fob or by waving your foot under the valance. The glass is also separately hinged and can be opened on its own. Or the headlights – these are self-activating, self-dipping and directional. They will smartly illuminate the entire road ahead yet somehow cast a shadow only over the car in front so as not to dazzle them. With so much thought going into the lights alone, it's reassuring to imagine the endeavour and ambition applied to the rest of the car's workings.</p><p>Several engines are available. I&nbsp;drove the one that will be the bestseller – a&nbsp;184bhp, 2-litre turbodiesel giving a&nbsp;top speed of 143mph, 0-62mph in 7.7 seconds, fuel consumption of 60.1 mpg and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of just 124g/km.</p><p>To drive it's smooth, grown-up, embracing, responsive – a total joy. Motoring home last Sunday night, feeling – admittedly – a little emotional, the car almost felt caring, solicitous, a rock in a changing world.</p><p>And here's the thing about that trapeze: it soon swings them back.</p><h2>BMW roadsters: 1929-2013</h2><p><br />BMW entered the world of cars in 1929 and quickly became known as one of the best manufacturers of luxury motor vehicles. Some of its most notable early cars were the roadsters, exciting and attractive roofless toys that tore up the European roads and racetracks. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/XCARFilms\" title=\"\">XCAR</a> explores the earliest roadsters from BMW, from the 315/1 and 319/1 to the amazing 328 and look at the post war beauty that was the 507 as well as leaping forward in time to the latest generation of roadsters, the Z series.</p><h2>Nuts about cars</h2><p>In its annual survey of the top motors that premiership footballers are driving, <a href=\"http://www.nuts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nuts magazine</a> has revealed that the Range Rover Sport is the car most likely to be seen parked at the training ground. Second and third on the list are the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7. Here's the full list:</p><p><strong>1. Range Rover Sport</strong> This year has seen universal love for the daddy of all SUVs. It's fast, it's full of tricks, it looks awesome – and it was made here in Blighty. A worthy winner! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Jon Obi Mikel, John Terry (both Chelsea); Scott Parker (Fulham); Luis Suarez (Liverpool); Ryan Giggs, Javier Hernandez, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City); Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>2. Porsche Cayenne </strong>For the second year, the surly SUV pips its road-hogging rival to second spot. Could it be the speed of the turbo that the prem stars love? Whatever it is, it's still the most popular Porsche ever! Drivers include: Scott Parker (Fulham); Steven Gerrard, Kolo Touré (both Liverpool); Yaya Touré (Man City); Tom Cleverley, Patrice Evra, Robin van Persie, Chris Smalling (all Man United); Younes Kaboul (Tottenham Hotspur); Carlos Cuéllar (Sunderland)</p><p><strong>3 Audi Q7 </strong>The sporty R8 got a sound showing further up the top 10, but if it's German muscle the prem's finest are after, the Q7 wins it. Drivers include: Kieran Gibbs, Bacary Sagna (both Arsenal); Fernando Torres (Chelsea); Luis Nani, Rio Ferdinand (both Man United); Steve Nzonzi (Stoke City); Phil Bardsley (Sunderland); Mousa Dembele, Emmanuel Adebayor (both Tottenham Hotspur) Chris Brunt (West Brom)</p><p><strong>4. Aston Martin DB9</strong> Since its inception in 2004, this British beast has become a bona fide favourite with the famous football-playing folk. Very cool, very fast, very nice all round! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Frank Lampard, Juan Mata, Fernando Torres (all Chelsea); Gareth Barry (Everton); Glen Johnson (Liverpool); James Milner (Man City); Peter Crouch, Matthew Etherington (both Stoke City); Jake Livermore (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>5. Bentley Continental</strong> No round-up of top-flight players' preferred wheels would be complete without the GT – the <em>Downton Abbey</em> of the nation's training ground car parks. Drivers include: Samuel Eto'o, (Chelsea); Glen Johnson, Victor Moses, Martin Skrtel (all Liverpool); Gael Clichy, David Silva (both Man City); Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young (both Man United); Wes Brown (Sunderland); Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>6. Porsche Panamera</strong> All the flash of a rubber-burning motor, but with the added bonus of a couple of rear doors. Handy for a queue-busting impromptu outing to Nando's after training. Drivers include: Thomas Vermaelen (Arsenal); Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea); Steven Pienaar (Everton); Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool); Edin Dzeko, Vincent Kompany, Samir Nasri (both Man City); Guly Do Prado (Southampton); Robert Huth (Stoke City)</p><p><strong>7. Ferrari 458 </strong>It's a warm welcome to this Italian bad-boy – new to 2013's top 10. The boffins at Ferrari have worked their stylish behinds off to create their most aero efficient motor ever with the 458 Speciale. Drivers include: Mathieu Flamini, Mesut özil, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshire (all Arsenal); Frank Lampard, John Terry (both Chelsea); Micah Richards (Man City); Luis Nani (Man United)</p><p><strong>8. Lamborghini Gallardo </strong>A slightly better showing for the Italian stallion this year, grunting its way two places up the lead-footed league in style. Nice! Drivers include:Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa); Ashley Cole (Chelsea); Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, David de Gea, Luis Nani, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Stephen Ireland (Stoke City)</p><p><strong>9. Audi R8 </strong>The slick style and super six-speed gearbox means it still makes all the right (gleefully grunty) noises for the boys. Drivers include: Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Cleverley (Man United); José Fonte (Southampton); Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott (both Arsenal); Micah Richards, David Silva (both Man City); Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>10. Chevrolet Camaro</strong> The General Motors-built beast brings a touch of the NFL to the English Prem. Drivers include: Joe Allen (Liverpool); Alex Buttner, Luis Nani (both Man United); Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Huddlestone (Hull City); Cheick Tioté (Newcastle)</p><h2>From the GT40 to the Veyron</h2><p>And finally, a brilliant infographic of the <a href=\"http://www.buyagift.co.uk/content/supercar\">evolution of the supercar</a>.

Cute isn't it? Mmmm… OK, wake up. It's the adorable city car that revolutionised urban motoring with its unmatched combination of retro chic, metrosexual attention to dinky detailing and honest practicality. By updating its classic Cinquecento – that miniature darling of the 50s – so brilliantly, a&nbsp;relieved Fiat found itself with a mighty bestseller on its hands. Its first in years, decades even.</p><p>But in the time since the 500 first arrived, the trendy urbanites who bought it have grown up and started families (their ironic facial hair is now grey and their thick-rimmed glasses no longer merely for fashion). This means they need something bigger to scoot the brood around town. Hold on a&nbsp;moment, thought Fiat's designers, we know just what's needed: a bigger small car. They took their diminutive masterpiece and \"larged\" it. So, in an act of automotive torture, they took the innocent 500 and stretched it and pulled it and inflated it and distended it until, finally, their lumbering, bloated mutant hobbled off the production line like one of Cinderella's ugly sisters. From the brightest of templates Fiat had managed to create a Frankencar.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418228870'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380105266023/Fiat-500-L-interior-008.jpg' alt='Fiat 500 L interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside job: the cheerful interior of the 500L.</figcaption></figure><p>The bulging <a href=\"http://www.fiat.co.uk/uk/fiat-500l/discover?campaignid=PPC46416&amp;gclid=CPLV4f6q5rkCFc7C3goduEwAFA\" title=\"\">500 gained an L </a>(standing for Large and Loathsome) and lost almost everything else that was charming about it. Beyond the badge on the bonnet there seems to be no genetic link.</p><p>But here is the thing: Fiat has great form when it comes to designing plug-ugly cars. The original <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/stuartbailie/2009/09/lets_do_multipla.shtml\" title=\"\">Multipla</a> was so hideous it was described by one critic as a&nbsp;\"strangulated hernia  on wheels\" when it first slithered on to the street, but its unorthodox 3-plus-3 seating plan, high driving position and short, wide body made it a slow-burning hit and one of my favourite cars of all time. There's  a Y-reg for sale at the end of my street at the moment for £1,100 and I am sorely tempted to buy it.</p><p>Over the course of the week I&nbsp;spent with the 500L (we nicknamed her Ugly Betty), I began to wonder if Fiat was on to something: had it deliberately made its car stand-out goofy? In a&nbsp;world of anodyne anonymity, there is definitely a place for the unlovely, the teeth-grindingly gruesome. If you don't believe me you clearly haven't seen the line-up for the world's ugliest dog title for 2013.</p><p>Sitting inside the compact MPV persuaded me that perhaps Fiat does know what it's up to. It feels like you are at the wheel of a tiny, trendy bus. There is usable space and innovation everywhere: the rear seats slide, hinge and flip down; the passenger seat folds flat to complete a single-bed of a loading bay; the double-shelved boot is massive and can be fitted with two extra seats; the dashboard features a Uconnect \"infotainment\" system including  a Dr&nbsp;Dre Beats Audio stereo system; and there is even a built-in Lavazza coffee machine (really) if you so wish. The fascia can be given a soft-touch surface or finished in suede.</p><p>Various engines are available. I&nbsp;drove the biggest of the lot, a&nbsp;105bhp 1.6-litre turbodiesel. It's noisy, unapologetic and crazily economical. Fiat isn't taking itself seriously, and neither should we. Betty is chubby, fun and up-for-it.

But that doesn't mean it's a bargain…","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:41:32Z","body":"<p><strong>Price £5,995</strong><br /><strong>MPG 47.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 97mph</strong></p><p>Two questions motoring journalists are often asked: \"What's the best car you've driven?\" and \"What's the worst?\" The first is hard, as the \"best\" is always the car doing the job you need doing. An economical estate to take you to Scotland – step forward the Skoda Octavia; a hair-raising spin through the tree-canopied lanes of Kent – that'll be the McLaren 12C; a show-boater for the streets of Chelsea – how about a gullwinged Mercedes SLS? The second is almost impossible because, as the cliché goes, they don't really make crap cars any more – until now. Let me introduce you to the <a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/vehicles/sandero/\" title=\"\">Dacia Sandero</a> – the worst car I have ever driven.</p><p>Like all black-and-white statements, that rather simplifies the point, because the Sandero is also the cheapest new car in Britain. Not just cheap, but arse-out, rock-bottom cheap. It costs £5,995, which is £10,000 cheaper than the average price for a new car. So, when viewing it through this prism of \"shocking affordability\", one is forced to reevaluate. The Sandero has no fancy extras – in fact, it has no extras; it's barely got the basics. It has wind-up windows, no radio, squidgy seats, no&nbsp;central locking, no spare wheel. The unforgiving plastic dashboard is&nbsp;bereft of buttons, dials, read-outs – the car does nothing, so there is nothing to control. It doesn't so much seem basic as brutally regressive. It&nbsp;feels like the car your dad used to moan about driving 20 years ago, unlocking his door with a key, then leaning over to pull up the buttons on&nbsp;the three other doors.</p><p>Dacia says it is able to offer cars at these prices by stripping its production of waste and \"making an enemy of the unnecessary\". I'd disagree with them on what is unnecessary.</p><p>Dacia (pronounced Da-chi-a) hails from Romania and has a history going back to pre-Iron Curtain motoring – a&nbsp;low point for any product, not just&nbsp;cars. In 1999 Renault bought the firm&nbsp;and began turning Dacia into its own in-house budget brand – in the same way that VW has made Skoda its secret weapon of mass manufacturing. The great surprise has been how unanimously Europe has taken the skin-flint Sandero to its heart – the Romanian brand has been the fastest-growing on the continent for the past eight years and last year sold 350,000 vehicles. Now it's our turn to get on board.<br /><br />The 1.2-litre petrol engine is loud and high-revving, but eager enough. The car has done remarkably well in reliability tests, and Dacia clearly believes in its product, as it comes with a five-year warranty.</p><p>From the outside the Sandero looks anonymous, but if you are paying less than six grand maybe that's a blessing. Inside it's bunker basic, but in a way its honest simplicity and rustic finishing is curiously likable. It's been built for the roughest roads of Europe, so it will be able to cope with ours here, and it handles better than you might expect on the motorway – though you won't be able to hear yourself think, let alone the nonexistent radio. It's also usefully roomy – most cheap cars are small. On closer inspection, you'll notice Dacia has been good enough to include power steering, airbags and ABS brakes. So there are some niceties.</p><p>The worst car I have ever driven, yes, but also the best car I have ever driven that costs less than £6,000.</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></p>","headline":"Dacia Sandero: car review","trailText":"<p>A new Dacia Sandero costs less than £6,000.

But the technology in VW's showstopper is coming to a Golf near you soon","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T04:20:47Z","body":"<p><strong>Price</strong> £95,000 <br /><strong>MPG</strong> 313<br /><strong>Top speed </strong>99mph<br /><br />A supercar on the streets of Chelsea barely gets a second look these days, but the two young men in front of us in red jeans, sockless loafers and surprisingly tight Hawaiian shirts are standing slack jawed on the pavement. \"Hugo, what the hell is that?\" one bellows at the other. Hugo has no idea and sticks his  head in the window. \"What's this, buddy?\" he asks of Peter Wouda,  one of VW's brightest talents, who is over from the firm's design HQ in Potsdam to show off his new baby. \"It's the <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/xl1?gclid=CL3Atda-kbkCFS3HtAodNWAAUg\" title=\"\">XL1</a>,\" Peter replies in flawless English. Hugo looks impressed and then asks what it runs on, pushing his floppy fringe off his face. But before Peter can reply he guffaws: \"Cham-bloody-pagne!\"</p><p>We are driving the world's cleanest and most fuel-efficient production car. It's a miracle of super-lightweight performance engineering. Its diesel-electric hybrid engines give it a fuel consumption of 313 miles per gallon – that's 10 times the figure an average car achieves. While hitting this astronomical target it emits a piffling 21g of carbon per km. Ironically, that is the same amount generated by a cyclist.</p><p>The ultra-frugal XL1 looks like a&nbsp;vision of the future, but it is already in limited production. So far 50 have been manufactured in Volkswagen's Osnabrück factory (which also produces the Golf Cabriolet and the Porsche Boxster) and there are immediate plans to make 200, though that could soon rise to 5,000. Peter explains: \"They will be made to be sold and driven – they are not for collectors. But the XL1 is mostly about technology that will make its way down into our regular cars.\"</p><p>The body is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer and is created from a single monocoque mould. This one-piece construction, a&nbsp;sort of exoskeleton, makes the car stronger and lighter as it supports loads through its skin – like a table-tennis ball. The drivetrain melds a two-cylinder 800cc diesel with a tiny electric motor.</p><p>The twin forces which shaped this car are weight and aerodynamics. Everything possible has been done to optimise these two. It doesn't have electric windows, for instance, as hand winders weigh less. There are no wing mirrors as these create drag. Instead, tiny rear-facing cameras transmit an image on to a screen on the door panels. The car has fared-in wheels, skinny tyres and an entirely flat bottom. The extreme tear-drop shape makes it incredibly \"slippery\". If the tail had been followed to a tapered tip it would have been 7m long – a perfect sperm-like shape, agrees Peter. The entire car, including two engines, crash protection, sat nav, radio, etc, weighs in at less than 800kg. That's featherweight.</p><p>Inside, the XL1 looks remarkably normal. The car is so radical and challenging that Peter and his team wanted the interior to be familiar, calm and uncluttered. Much of the kit is the same as you'd find in a Golf.</p><p>To drive it doesn't feel alien or peculiar. It zips along, it's easy to manoeuvre, it's fun. When the diesel kicks in it barks like a&nbsp;\"little terrier in the boot\". It sounds odd to say this, but this most ultramodern, dynamic, game-changing, avant-garde, frugal Dougal of a vehicle – a&nbsp;time traveller into the future of motoring – feels instantly familiar and congenial.  And, somehow, that is very comforting. Champagne all round!</p><p></p><p><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z9kuCvRDc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile?

Slovenian Tomos is cheap, robust and a retro classic  – and when you ride it everyone wants to be your new best

can't explain  a joke to someone without a sense of humour, so you can't describe the appeal of a tiny <a href=\"http://www.tomosgb.com/index.html\" title=\"\">Tomos</a> to anyone who takes life too seriously. It's  a beyond-basic moped from Slovenia which hasn't changed much in 60 years. It should probably have been parked years ago in the bay marked: Noisy, Dangerous and Stoopid. But this chortling, splurting, juddering little moped has been winning over our hearts (and wallets – it costs just £1,395) for decades. And now, after a gap of more than 30 years, you can once again buy the timorous wee beastie in Britain.</p><p>One of the many reasons why children have more fun than adults is that they can truly live in the moment. They are happy because they are on that trampoline and how high they're bouncing is all they can think about. Adults, however, would be bouncing but they'd also be thinking about pelvic floors, failing pensions and, oh, that guttering looks full from up here. But a Tomos has the gift of making it impossible to think about anything else. When you feel its feisty 49cc air-cooled two-stoke engine putter into life beneath your buttocks, its chopperlike handlebars start to vibrate violently in your hands and you surge out into the traffic… Certain death seem so imminent that savouring your last few moments of life on a Tomos becomes all consuming.</p><p>To add to this sense of merriment, Tomos UK is importing baby blue mopeds and minty green ones (it will do a \"shadow black\", but I'd say that would only be for people who refuse to wear paper hats at Christmas).</p><p>There is no ignition, the bike doesn't have a battery and starts with a push of its pedals – you can actually ride it very slowly as a bicycle using the pedals. In theory you might need to add some leg power to aid the trifling engine up the steepest of hills, but I rode up Crystal Palace hill in south London and it put in a heroic Chris Froome-like performance. It's an automatic and has two gears with a top speed of about 28mph – which feels fast enough. It weighs in at 57kg and it'll do more than 100 miles to the gallon. I filled it up and it cost a whopping £2.40 at the pump. It's congestion-free and the road tax is £17. You can ride it on a driver's licence if you passed before 2001 – otherwise you will need to pass your CBT and be over 16. It's sturdily built, as if it has every intention of being here in another 60 years. It's Tomos the tank engine.</p><p>I have never been on a vehicle that has provoked such goodwill from my fellow road users. It turned my seven-mile commute into a sea of waves, grins, thumbs-up signs and marriage proposals… not quite, but you get the picture. When I got home I&nbsp;thought I'd better wheel it through to the back garden for its own security, but then – brimming with <em>joie de vivre</em> – I&nbsp;decided to ride it through the house, round the kitchen, down the back steps on to the patio and across the garden. Yee-haaing all the way.  Adult behaviour? No, it must have been the Tomos factor.</p><p>For more information, go to <a href=\"http://www.tomosgb.com/index.html\" title=\"\">tomosgb.com</a></p><h2>Thinking outside the box</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416504829'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/4/1378295809698/Mini-campers-008.jpg' alt='Mini campers' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Happy campers: Mini's unusual take on camping.</figcaption></figure><p><br />Earlier this summer, Mini unveiled three unique camping concepts which are designed to appeal to people who enjoy the outdoors, from festival goers to campers alike. There's the Clubvan Camper, the Cowley and the Countryman ALL4 Camp and each highlight Mini's creative use of space in their own way and all three have their own distinct Mini touches. The Clubvan Camper is the world's smallest luxury camper van; the Cowley is a compact yet comfortable caravan for two people, equipped with a twin-ring gas stove, fridge and sink; and the Countryman ALL4 Camp with its innovative roof-top tent is the getaway car for an adventurous couple. All are just concepts at the moment, but as you can see from this picture, they'd be a brilliant addition to the Mini line-up.</p><h2>Thoughts on the E-Type Jaguar</h2><p>Last week I reviewed the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/01/jaguar-f-type-car-review\" title=\"\">F-Type from Jaguar</a>, but almost all the emails I received were from people very happy to linger a little longer on the legendary E-Type. Here's one typical letter from Mark Styring, which sums up how we all felt about the old car:</p><p>Hello Martin, I enjoyed your article on the F-Type, but I really do feel you should have compared it with the competition, rather than with the incomparable E-Type. The cars were, after all, conceived 50 years apart.</p><p>Most of the other automotive press say that the \"F\" is there or thereabouts compared with the current offerings from the usual suspects. I'm glad everyone seems to like it, and I would sign up myself if I had a spare 60K+ burning a hole in my pocket. However, I bought a Toyota GT86 this year, and am looking forward to a long-term relationship with it.</p><p>In 1961, though, the E-Type was so far ahead of anything else in the world, that, if the competition weren't embarrassed, they should have been. I can just imagine in my mind's eye Enzo Ferrari kicking his engineers in the culo all the way up and down Modena High Street when he came home from that year's Geneva Motor Show. Still, he was spot-on about the E-Type's aesthetics.</p><p>There were road cars which were about as fast, but they were three times more expensive to buy, were far more temperamental, and drank rather more fuel.</p><p>There were touring cars which were as comfortable, but they struggled to get past 100 mph.</p><p>There were American cars which could get to 60mph faster in a straight line: just don't ask them to stop any time soon, or get round a bend without the tyres squealing.</p><p>There were cars with neater roadholding and handling, but the E would catapult past them on the straights.</p><p>I guess I am getting towards old fartdom, with which you associate traditional Jag. fans in your article, but I've thus far managed to avoid the angina pills. If you want an E with a thoroughbred exhaust note, just fit it with a two-inch straight-through system. Everything else with multiples of six sound like coffee grinders. The founder of Jaguar wouldn't have anything to do with V8s, as they are inherently unbalanced and unrefined. Same goes for V6s. The reason they are using them now has more to do with cost than engineering. As for diesel, it's one of the few things I agree with Jeremy Clarkson on. The fuel of Satan.</p><p>My dream moment of the sixties which I never lived ?

But then everything about <a href=\"http://www.jaguar.co.uk/f-type/\" title=\"\">Jaguar's new F-Type</a> is quick – except its genesis. It's taken years to arrive. If you were drumming your fingers waiting for Andy Murray's Wimbledon win or were irritated by Prince George's tardy entry, you'll be spitting biscuit crumbs over the F-Type's 39-year gestation.</p><p>The gorgeous new roadster is the alphabetic successor to the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type\" title=\"\">E-Type </a>– the car once described by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Ferrari\" title=\"\">Enzo Ferrari</a> as the \"most beautiful ever made\".

But what a buildup. The first time many of us saw the car was earlier this summer when Jaguar released a 13-minute <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trlv9UdIheM\" title=\"\">\"advert\" starring Damien Lewis and the F-Type</a>. It was shot by Ridley Scott Associates in Peru's Atacama desert – a car-heist with <em>Homeland</em> overtones – that also featured a soundtrack of throbbing exhausts and a lot of sighing. It was so knowingly trendy it had many Jag fans reaching for their angina pills. It also sent a clear message: Jaguar is cool, sexy and young. Pringle is dead! Long live Alexander McQueen!</p><p>So, has Jaguar delivered on its promise? If you were hoping for some rehashed, heated-up simulacrum of the E-Type, you'll be gutted. If you've been waiting, credit card in hand, for a modern, muscular, dynamic driving machine, you'll be fist-pumpingly delighted.</p><p>The 60s icon was all about grace and chappish Englishness, today's stocky F-Type has a much more forceful personality. Its hefty flanks bulge; its thin rear lights squint out of a&nbsp;chopped tail; its front lights scream back from a gaping Munch-like grille. It comes with a choice of three engines – a&nbsp;pair of 3-litre V6s with 340 or 380bhp and a 5-litre V8 \"big daddy\" with 495bhp. All are supercharged. Sports-car purists love a manual gear change, the F-Type only comes as an automatic, but they'll be happy with the crispness of the car's \"Quickshift\" eight-speed which leaves you to blip up and down the gears with your fingers on the steering-wheel paddles.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416527681'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/4/1378311290601/Martin-and-Kitty-008.jpg' alt='Martin and Kitty' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sunshine motoring: Martin and Kitty, his young co-pilot.

It also boasts a few \"surprise and delight\" details: copper is used for some of the buttons, instead of boring old chrome, and the air vents rise up out of the dashboard when you start the ignition, as if the car is coming alive. This same impression begins before you even get into the car. From a distance, press \"open\" on the fob and the door handles ease out from where they've been hiding, flush to the flanks. It's an Alice in Wonderland moment, as if the car is saying: \"Open me.\" You climb in and there's a copper-coloured button saying: \"Start me.\" Press it and… oooph… the… noise… it is <em>so</em> loud. Crackling, burbling, moaning, snapping – maybe you should call for an exorcist. Pull the gear lever into D and the F is <em>off!</em></p><p>Will the Jaguar cope with the pressure of expectation?

Either way it is clearly an issue for today's motorists – and a source of friction among many couples. My neighbour walks away from the car when his wife is at the wheel. \"She says she can't do it  if I am watching,\" he sighs – as if she is going to the loo. Perhaps because  of this manufacturers have spent  a fortune over the past decade on  a plethora of \"parking aids\" (marital aids might have been a better name). There are front and rear proximity sensors; rear, front and even side-view cameras (my children love gurning under the number plate so I can see their contorted faces on the dashboard); bird's-eye positioning graphics; and technology which means you just let go of the steering wheel and the vehicle will parallel park itself.</p><p>Yet these devices are missing the point. The real issue with parking is spaces – or lack of them. <a href=\"https://www.parkatmyhouse.com/\" title=\"\">ParkatmyHouse</a>, a company that lets drivers park in private spaces at homes, schools and elsewhere, has estimated that the average city motorist spends six minutes and 45 seconds looking for a space, which adds up to a colossal 2,500 hours over a lifetime.

Mention Lexus to most people and they will tell you one of two things: first, that it stands for Luxury Exports to the US – the acronym Toyota apparently used when developing the range for the American market; and second that David Cameron and Alan Partridge were both owners. If you can stand the stigma of driving the motoring equivalent of posh smugness or hilarious offensiveness (you decide which is which), your Lexus will repay you handsomely.<br /><br />What is crucial about this GS 450 is the h and the F – it is both a hybrid and a graduate of the marque's Mount Fuji race-tuning programme. Lexus claims that its new GS is \"the most technologically advanced production vehicle in the world\". Even allowing for unseemly aggrandisement that's quite a boast. But they're not far off the mark. The GS is a V6-powered luxury saloon as quick to 60mph as the top flight of performance Audis, BMWs, Mercedes and Porsches, yet thanks to its eco-technology it is as clean and efficient as many cars  half its size. In many ways this is what the future of performance four-door motoring will look like. The petrol engine is harnessed to two electric engines: one functions as a generator and starter, the other provides the oomph needed to take  a hybrid to 155mph.</p><p>To drive the GS is whisper quiet, effortless and nimble. Choose between the eco and comfort setting for around town and the sport and sport plus (possibly an unnecessary 11 on volume) for Huhne-ing down the motorway. Floor it and you get an almighty shove in the behind, like your porch rocker has been lassoed by a galloping cowboy.</p><p>Inside, the car is comfortable but surprisingly basic. Yes, there's leather and chrome, and a clever finger-light remote-touch mouse makes navigating the satnav a doddle, but for a car of this price it doesn't have that sense of privilege: we want more Bullingdon and less Butlins. Outside, the car looks quiet, almost apologetic. It's both a sports car and a saloon, a cruiser and an eco wagon – a true hybrid, and as such Lexus could do with shouting about it. And if you  do happen to find a place in front of your house, you want the neighbours to know about it...</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/martinlove\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/martinlove</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>","headline":"Lexus GS 450h F-Sport: car review","trailText":"<p>The new Lexus is not only eco-friendly and quiet, its power would please Alan Partridge, <strong>says Martin Love</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"47","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376481351178/Lexus-003.jpg","wordcount":"648","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"415004268","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7897501","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Love","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-08-18T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1950619","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-21T09:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/lexus-gs-450h-f-sport-car-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/aug/18/lexus-gs-450h-f-sport-car-review","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

It should be slow, deliberate, teasing… which is why cars make such lousy strippers. They can't wait to get their tops off. The Mercedes-Benz SL can do it in 16 seconds, Audi's A5 drops its top in 15, VW's Golf takes nine, while Mazda claims just five seconds to let it all hang out. The early folding-roofed cabriolets also had to be parked up with the handbrake on before they started unbuttoning. These days they can do it on the hoof – travelling at 15, 20 even 25mph. But Citroën's DS3 cabriolet sets a new record – it can wriggle out of its top at 70mph. And at the first sign of modesty or when the rain starts, it can pull it back on without ever slowing down.</p><p>Blasting along the A3, my wife had had enough of being lashed with her own hair and decided to close the roof. She held the button down and the canvas canopy started moving from the back of the car towards the windscreen. As the wind roared overhead I fully expected it to act as a cloth wing and for us to take off, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang style. Rather prosaically, it merely clicked shut, and we drove sedately on…</p><p>You'd think people who buy convertibles would be natural show-offs, but many have a morbid fear of being stuck at a red light while their roof completes its 18-step closing routine. It's quite a bonus to be able to do it on the move, but 70mph is definitely overkill.</p><p>The DS3 cabriolet – the cloth-top version of the award-winning Citroën supermini – isn't actually a full-blown convertible as its trademark shark-fin side pillars don't retract (ie. dip below the surface). The car harks back to the old sardine tin roll-back roofs of the 2CV and the C3 Pluriel. Some people have been snitty about this, but sitting in a fully exposed convertible on a sunny day in the city can be an intimidating experience. By keeping the sides you get that sense of being outside but not right under the noses of those prying pedestrians on the pavement.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-414473248'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/8/6/1375810581890/Citroen-DS3-cabriolet-wit-004.jpg' alt='Citroen DS3 cabriolet with the roof open' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside out: the DS3 cabriolet's high sides when the roof is open.</figcaption></figure><p>The main opposition facing the DS3 is the Mini and Fiat 500 convertibles. But the DS3 has an ace up its sleeve: it's the only one of the three that can seat five people – the others are four-seaters. It also has the largest boot but, to accommodate the concertinaed roof, the aperture has been designed like a large letter box – a hopeless solution. Over the week I was testing the car I found myself loading the back seat with shopping through the open roof rather than trying to post the bags into the boot.</p><p>The Citroën comes with a choice  of three petrol engines (an 80bhp three-cylinder 1.2, a 118bhp 1.6 and  a 154bhp 1.6 turbo – a 1.6 diesel is set to follow). I drove the range-topping petrol version which with the roof down produces a really satisfying sporty exhaust note, but it offered more power than the car needed. The 118bhp would be more than enough.</p><p>Handling isn't as immediate as the 500 or the Mini, but then this car  is a little bigger and I would trade  go-kart handling for the extra head and leg room any day. Rear visibility with the roof stowed is almost nonexistent, but all models come  with parking sensors.</p><p>It's posh and stylish and relatively modest – al fresco motoring for the body-conscious.</p>","headline":"DS3 Cabriolet: car review","trailText":"<p>If you are a little shy about taking your top off, the rolled canvas roof of Citroën's DS3 cabriolet is just the thing, writes <strong>Martin Love</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"50","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Observer","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/8/6/1375810368717/Citroen-DS3-cabriolet-003.jpg","wordcount":"584","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"414471447","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7897382","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Love","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-08-11T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1947165","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-14T09:30:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/11/ds3-cabriolet-car-review","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/aug/11/ds3-cabriolet-car-review","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

This year's ultimate car challenge came on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlSkr-YV7_s\" title=\"\">Dutch Corner on the Alpe d'Huez</a>, when a van was brought to a standstill by drunk fans&nbsp;dressed as carrots who \"surfed\" on the roof, while others rocked the vehicle to provide the \"waves\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.teamsky.com/\" title=\"\">Team Sky</a>'s car supplier <a href=\"http://www.jaguar.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jaguar</a> also found that the Tour throws up unlikely surprises. Theirs was an issue that could have proved costly. All teams carry massive coolboxes in the boot to keep their cyclists' drinking bottles cool. But when the valve at the bottom of Team Sky's box failed, the boot was flooded. This fused the battery, which disabled the car. The upshot was that on the Tour's toughest climb, <a href=\"http://www.chris-froome.com/\" title=\"\">Chris Froome</a> didn't get&nbsp;fed and ended up with hypoglycaemia.</p><p>This year's test for the new <a href=\"http://www.skoda.co.uk/models/new-octavia-estate\" title=\"\">Skoda Octavia</a>, which I drove, was rather more mundane. The day after the race ended the key went missing. Eventually I found it in the mountain of washing that always has to be done on returning home after three weeks on the road. But I can conclusively reveal that Skoda's electronic fob can survive total immersion among sweaty journalistic undies – a full cycle after watching Froome cycle.</p><p>I first drove an Octavia on the Tour back in 2004, when Skoda began sponsoring the race. Then, I&nbsp;wrote, both Skoda and the Tour faced a challenge updating their respective pasts, the Tour trying to escape doping, Skoda looking to get away from those old jokes. Ten Tours later and Skoda wisecracks are a&nbsp;thing of the past; sadly for Froome, who faced continual questions over doping, the Tour has struggled to move on as&nbsp;rapidly in that area.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-414052380'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/31/1375279610811/skoda-octavia-008.jpg' alt='skoda octavia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Race leader: the lean, clean lines of the new Skoda Octavia estate. Photograph: Observer</figcaption></figure><p>I also mentioned in 2004 that the Skoda was the \"equivalent of Lance Armstrong\" in its leanness and economy. This doesn't seem like the compliment it did back then, although it has to be said the 2013 Octavia remains a lean machine. Rather than dwell on miles per gallon, I prefer to look at it this way: a single tank of diesel took me from Burgundy to Bracknell. The latter may not be your first-choice destination but it's far enough to feel you haven't been cheated.<br /><br />This year's model has a more sophisticated feel. The automatic gearbox does some complex stuff that means, for economy reasons, it coasts out of gear on downgrades. This might get a bit terrifying descending the hairpins of Alpe d'Huez were it not for a clever device that means a&nbsp;dab on the footbrake tells the engine to get itself into gear and help with the braking.</p><p>The boot net to hold bottles of free wine has gone since 2004, sad to say, but it has been replaced by a secret underfloor compartment to fill up with gifts. Très James Bond. The rear cargo space is big enough for a&nbsp;racing bike, with the wheels out. One expects nothing less from the Tour's official car supplier.</p><p>There are some slightly fussy touches: the dashboard alert that tells you a&nbsp;passenger in the back seat has taken off their belt is a tad Big Brother, while the reminder to take your mobile phone with you is pure Aunty Mabel. After all, it's not like a Tour de France journalist to lose anything, is it? The key, lest we forget, is completely washproof.</p>","headline":"Skoda Octavia: car review","trailText":"<p>For 10 years, Skoda has been supplying the Tour de France with new cars.

Just like all those Matchboxers, it too is scorchingly fast and can pull itself through the most amazing bends. It even makes its own soft yowling and growling sounds. And, just like those pocket rockets, it's totally impractical. The boot actually is matchbox-sized. But worrying about such boring pragmata is to miss the point of the Z4 – it's not about transport, it's all about driving.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412956117'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/16/1373992094060/BMW-4-cockpit-008.jpg' alt='BMW 4 cockpit' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The driver-centric cockpit Photograph: Tom Kirkpatrick</figcaption></figure><p>The Z4 is a two-seat, front-engined, rear-drive roadster that traces its genes back to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z1\" title=\"\"> crazy Z1</a> of 25 years ago – most famous for its bizarre drop-down doors which folded into the sills. You could drive roof down and doors folded for a full \"open car\" experience. This Z4 has regular doors. But slip into the low-slung bucket seat and pop open the roof and you'll be transported back in time. The driving position is extreme. Your eyes are virtually on a level with the long, vented bonnet and the interplay of forces from the rear axle at your back and the humming engine in front of you is exhilarating. The immediate, gravity-defying handling makes it easy to imagine some great hand is careening you across the kitchen floor.</p><p>Look down into the open Z4 from the pavement and you'll see that more than half its length is given over to the engine. Back seats, boot, pah! Beneath its veneer of civility it is that most basic thing – four wheels, two seats and a big engine. The power from the direct-injected 2-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine means you'll hit 60mph in about five seconds. You can opt for the six-speed manual or the eight-speed automatic – either way the top speed is limited to 155mph. That's fast enough, really. Stamp on the throttle and you jump away from the lights like one of those trick waterskiers being jerked off the jetty.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412956118'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/16/1373992245652/matchbox-008.jpg' alt='matchbox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Out of the box: one of the first Matchbox cars made by Jack Odell 60 years ago.

Standing on stage in front of me at the <a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Auto Express</em></a> car awards in the lavish surroundings of London's Connaught hotel is <a href=\"http://www.rickastley.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rick Astley</a>. His trademark 80s quiff is still intact, and a&nbsp;sharp suit ensures he looks as boyish as he did back in 1987. Bouncing around, the Lancashire lad is desperately trying to pump some oxygen into the proceedings. But the&nbsp;massed ranks of suited journalists and motor-industry apparatchiks sit unmoved. Stunned, even. Hadn't he died? He was certainly dying now. Rick abandons the first song and moves on to the next. \"Don't worry,\" he yells, \"my songs all sound the same.\" Then, at last, it is time for his one big hit.&nbsp;Gratefully he launches into \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".</p><p>Later, as the awards are announced, it becomes clear that this is to be <a href=\"http://www.seat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Seat</a>'s night. The Alhambra wins best MPV award; the Leon wins best compact family award. And then Leon's name is pulled from the winner's envelope again: it is the <em>Auto Express</em> Car of the&nbsp;Year. The magazine's editor, Steve Fowler, hands the award to Seat's chairman, Jürgen Stackmann. He only started in the job eight weeks ago. \"We love Leon's style,\" says Steve. \"The way it drives, the quality, the kit. And best of all, you get all this at a&nbsp;bargain price with ultra-low running costs.\" Jürgen grins and states the obvious: \"This new Leon is the <em>best</em> vehicle in Seat's history.\" And he's right: it really is the best they've made.</p><p>It's remarkable, as not so long ago the sickly Spanish manufacturer was languishing in the doldrums. But VW, Seat's owner, hates a failure, so the mighty Volkswagen family has hosted an intervention and given Seat the \"Skoda treatment\". Just as the Czech brand was transformed from joke to class-topping jock, so Seat finds itself in VW's turnaround lounge. In&nbsp;2012 the marque had its most successful year ever. And as Rick sang: \"Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye…\" I couldn't help thinking it sounded like a mission statement from VW to Seat – a sharp riposte to the doubters who believed VW might let one of its limbs wither.</p><p>The new Leon is based on VW's jack-of-all-trades MQB platform (Modularer Querbaukasten, since you ask), which will eventually go on to underpin more than 30 different models from VW's corporate empire. It's a sort of glorified parts-bin from&nbsp;which the various VW siblings will draw their major components. This means the Leon is, to all intents and purposes, a Hispanic version of the Golf, the Audi A3 and the Skoda Octavia. Sharing engineering, construction, parts and expertise with those three big hitters is only ever going to improve your game.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412563810'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/10/1373454596494/seat-leon-interior-008.jpg' alt='seat leon interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Seat Leon's no-nonsense cockpit. Photograph: Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Look at all four and you'll see a&nbsp;family resemblance. But the new Leon has won the looks lottery. The profile is dominated by three horizontal creases set off by the sharp edges of the grille and head lamps. The company calls this its \"arrow-head\" design language. These creases, corners and edges give the car a real presence. It won't appeal to everyone, but character is a good thing in car.</p><p>The interior is well thought out, roomy and just the right side of no-nonsense. One detail that caught my eye was the sharp-cornered wing mirrors. They're \"statement\" wing mirrors – a visual reminder every time you look into them that you're not in some bland also-ran, but a&nbsp;proper contender. The Leon also has all-LED front lights, a first in this class – and another signal of intent. It's powered by a choice of five&nbsp;petrol engines or four diesels – the best option is the 1.6 TDI CR, which creeps beneath the tax-beating 100g barrier. Fast and frugal – in engine terms that's cake you can eat.</p><p>New, improved and visibly  VW-ified, this Seat is an impressive package. Rick struggled to get the party started, but Leon closed the show on a high.</p><h2>Car-hating kids</h2><p><br />Ever wondered what would happen to your car if you let a bunch of kids loose on it?

But is it good enough to call your child after?","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-22T00:10:48Z","body":"<p><strong>Price £18,895</strong><br /><strong>MPG 47.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 143mph</strong></p><p>My youngest daughter came home from school on Friday with news that her friend's little sister had been born. \"She's called <a href=\"http://www.lotuscars.com/gb/our-cars/current-range/elise-range\" title=\"\">Elise</a>, because her dad loves sports cars,\" she explained. I&nbsp;didn't have Elise's dad down as a Lotus man, but as his choice was either Elise, Exige or Evora, I'd say he's definitely picked the best of the line-up. My son then chipped in that his friend Enzo was named after Ferrari, which got me thinking about other \"bonkers monikers\" that must be out there. Is there a&nbsp;VW Sharan in your office? Ever met an Aston Martin? Do you know Su Baru? (Stop, that's enough.) Of course, it's usually the other way round, with cars being named after people. I wonder what Ettore Bugatti, Louis Chevrolet, Walter Chrysler, André-Gustave Citroën, Henry Ford, Soichiro Honda, Ferruccio Lamborghini and Ferdinand Porsche would make of the fact that their names are now global brands?</p><p>This week I am driving a car that carries the family name of Armand Peugeot, the French industrialist who died shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. Peugeot (the brand), of which 25.2% is still family owned, now employs more than 200,000 people – six of whom are Peugeots. A&nbsp;couple of years ago I met one of the fortunate six – Xavier Peugeot. He runs the firm's museum in Sochaux, and I&nbsp;am sure he'll be one of the first to get his hands on the clan's newest member – the <a href=\"http://www.peugeot.co.uk/showroom/208/gti/?campaignid=PPC_NCS&amp;advertiserid=google&amp;bannerid=&amp;gclid=CPveyvyjk7gCFVMRtAodpVMAqw#!\" title=\"\">208 GTi</a>.</p><p>The family firm already has a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;reputation when it comes to hot hatches (which sounds like birdspotter slang for this week's sexiest chicks). Mention the 208's predecessor – the&nbsp;205 GTi – to anyone who started their driving career in the mid-80s and a&nbsp;reverential look will come over their face. Thirty years later that 205 GTi is still lauded as one of the greats of budget performance motoring. Then there followed hot versions of the 206 and 207, but their impact was lukewarm at best. So the question many of us, and Xavier too, are now asking is: will the 208 GTi restore Peugeot's hot-hatch mojo?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412371382'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/3/1372854786755/Peugeot-GTi-interior-008.jpg' alt='Peugeot GTi interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the sporty cockpit. Photograph: Observer</figcaption></figure><p>The heart of big-thrills, small-car motoring is, obviously, the engine – and this 208 is blessed with an excitable 1.6-litre turbocharged unit that produces an amazing 200bhp. It'll whip you from a standstill to 62mph in 6.8 seconds with the sort of zip usually enjoyed by trick waterskiers. So admired is this powerplant that it has just picked up the 2013 award for International Engine of the Year. For the more academic of the piston-fancying community, that's the big one – the Oscars of internal combustion.</p><p>Unleash this award-winning beauty on the road and an appreciative smile will creep across your chops. It's quick, eager and zealous. On the corners, it feels grounded and stable. It gets the bends. But one of its real bonuses is that it's not just a&nbsp;party animal. Drive it in a more sedate fashion and you'll find it is comfortable and surprisingly refined. In country-music parlance, it's a&nbsp;sinner on a Saturday night, a&nbsp;saint on a Sunday morning…</p><p>From the outside, the 208 is a feast of curves, where the 205 was box-cornered. But don't think it's gone too la-di-da – there's still plenty to appeal to your lairy side: 17in alloys, red calliper brakes and chromed twin exhausts. The word Peugeot glints in red lettering from under the bonnet, and the lower edge of the grille is an&nbsp;angry metallic red – squint at it and it looks like it's got a thick lip.</p><p>Inside, red stitching romps across the sports seats and picks out the edges of the dash and door trims. The steering wheel is tiny yet somehow still manages to obscure the instruments. Who cares, you'll only have eyes for that endless grey ribbon.</p><p>Overall it feels and drives like a&nbsp;well-considered, well-made premium product that Peugeot (and I expect Xavier and his cousins) will feel very proud of.</p><h2>Saddle up</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412371383'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/3/1372855033905/Cambrium-saddle-008.jpg' alt='Cambrium saddle' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sitting pretty: Brooks's first ever non-leather saddle.

The WVM is followed closely by the elderly and hard on their tails is the school-run mum. But is there any truth in these stereotypes? To find out Aviva set up a challenge to discover who really is the safest on the road. They found three challengers – a white-van man, a granny and school-run mum – and put them to the test by F1 legend Johnny Herbert before setting off to do 200 miles of driving with the <a href=\"http://www.aviva.co.uk/drive\" title=\"\">Aviva Drive app</a>. And the results were a bit of a surprise: the white-van man is in fact the safest on the road, scoring 9.2 out of 10 on the test – well above the national average of 7.

After all the exam pressure, their summer stretches ahead in a haze of possibilities, and the atmosphere in the car is fizzing. Maisie yells from the back: \"It's like a nightclub in here!\" Her eyes have been caught by the changing mood lights buried in the door lining as they glow purple, blue, green, red and yellow. All this yelling is infectious. \"Can I come to the party, too?\" I&nbsp;shout at Libby. Terrified, she points out that it's not a<em> party</em>, \"just drinks\" – such are the gradations of the modern teenager's social life.</p><p>Either way, the Mini, with its party vibe, has got the night off to a great start. And Mini has played a blinder by creating a vehicle that appeals to this design-conscious, youthful market. The all-new Paceman, which is about as far removed from the original Mini as Andy Murray's forehand is from Boris Johnson's, is the seventh member of the Mini family, following in the tracks of the Hatch, Clubman, Convertible, Countryman, Coupé and Roadster. In some ways it's the most eyecatching – it's certainly the biggest. From the side it looks like a stretched coupé, with long doors sitting under blacked-out pillars to create a \"floating\" roof. Picked out in&nbsp;capitals across its broad rump is the word Paceman – it's the only Mini to be tagged by a rear nameplate; equally it's the only Mini you might not be able to identify.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411762072'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372255195650/Mini-interior-008.jpg' alt='Mini interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The distinctive cockpit of the Mini Paceman.

And with its captain chairs, chrome details and numerous cubbies, it does feel as if its taken its design cues from Cunard.</p><p>Drivewise, the Paceman still boasts Mini's trademark go-kart handling, and that feeling is enhanced if you go for the all-wheel drive option and the lowered sports suspension. There's a&nbsp;choice of four powerful four-cylinder engines, two petrol and two diesel. All come with a purposeful six-speed gearbox: manual is standard, but there is an automatic with Steptronic flip shifters – a&nbsp;pointless waste of your money. I'm not sure how big a car can get before it stops feeling \"go-karty\". This one is on the verge of looking like a man wearing boys' shorts.</p><p>Some cars make you feel grown up – this one makes you feel young… or it should do. With its emphasis on youth, the Paceman merely reminded me that I am <em>not</em> young any more. Sitting at the lights with its silver-rimmed lights, floating roof and \"white glove\" wing mirrors, I felt a bit mutton as lamb and slightly ridiculous. That feeling was confirmed later when I received a&nbsp;text from a friend: \"Saw you stalled outside the library in a new Mini – looking like a twat!\" I wasn't stalled – it was the car's stop/start fuel-saving function, but still.</p><p>Mini has got it all right, except for one thing – the price.

It just might get you to the race on time. INRIX analysed recent traffic patterns around Silverstone including traffic conditions from last year's event to help race fans get to the track in time for the big race.  Unlike the field at Silverstone who will be driving at speeds of up to 200mph, frustrated spectators could find themselves stuck in traffic on the way to the track crawling along at a fraction of the pace. So how to beat the rush? For the quickest journey you should avoid travelling between 9am and 11am if you can help it. Drivers on the A43 leading into the circuit from the M1 J15a at Rothersthorpe will experience the worst delays. If you are coming from the east or northern parts of London, cut across town or take the M25 to join the M40. This information is available on the new INRIX traffic app, available for free on IOS and Android platforms today. The app analyses data from millions of vehicles travelling on our roads every day to provide real-time traffic maps showing the best routes, recommended departure times and expected arrival times.

I had just taken the wheel of the dizzyingly luxurious <a href=\"http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_flying_spur/\" title=\"\">Bentley Flying Spur</a> and my first task was to ease the £140,000 craft out into four lanes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/beijing\" title=\"\">Beijing</a>'s anarchic rush-hour traffic. Surely only a swivel-eyed loon would be so reckless. There probably are rules governing the relentless, bumper-tight flow, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;had no idea what they were. Finally my gung-ho passenger shouted: \"Go, go, go!\" I didn't look – I&nbsp;just hit the gas and swooshed out into the cavalcade, which absorbed us without a ripple. Sitting unruffled in the controlled ambience of the car, it felt as if  the Queen had sneaked out of Buckingham Palace and been swept up in an anarchists' demo…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411124662'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371639539951/Bentley-exterior-008.jpg' alt='Bentley exterior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Outside edge: the new model is smoother, longer and lower than the outgoing Flying Spur. Photograph: Observer</figcaption></figure><p>The Bentley dealership in Beijing sells more of the historic marque's four-door super-sport sedans than any other in the world. Along with French wine, Italian fashion and Scottish whisky, China's <em>nouveaux riches</em> just can't get enough of posh English cars. A salesman explained why: \"We Chinese love old world. We love history. We love these cars because the Queen drives a Bentley.\"</p><p>The feeling is mutual – over the next two years Bentley will open 45&nbsp;dealerships across China and it explains why the British firm chose to launch the car in Beijing. But there are a couple of idiosyncrasies about this brave new market that Bentley has to cope with. The first is that the average age of a Bentley buyer here is mid-30s – a decade and more younger than the rest of the world. The second is that none of these new owners has any intention of actually driving their car. They will be quite happy to sit in the back, thank you. Never mind that the marque has spent the past century fanning the flame of its driving heritage established by thrashing all-comers at Le Mans. The salesman sees no contradiction: \"The 200mph Flying Spur is the fastest non-driver's car you can buy. Which in China is the&nbsp;whole point.\"</p><p>The good news for the handful of&nbsp;Brits who will be buying this new&nbsp;model is that Bentley's racing pedigree runs too deep to change – either that or it cares deeply about the driving experience of Chinese chauffeurs. With its 6-litre twin-turbocharged W12 engine, this Flying&nbsp;Spur is faster than ever before.&nbsp;The power from the colossal engine is 616bhp – enough to hurtle the two-tonne dame from a&nbsp;standstill to 60mph in a fraction over 4&nbsp;seconds. The sense of potential, unquestioning ooooomph at your disposal is delicious. Maybe that's how the Queen feels…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411124663'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371639446982/Bentley-interior-008.jpg' alt='Bentley interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the hyper-luxurious cockpit.

A new Q&amp;A document has been developed to help sufferers know where they stand. Professor John Stradling from the Oxford Sleep Clinic says: \"It is vital that we do not push the problem underground by making it difficult for commercial drivers to admit that they have symptoms.\" Those most at risk of having the condition are overweight middle-aged men and unfortunately, due to the sedentary nature of their job, HGV drivers seem to be at higher risk of OSAS. However, the condition can be treated quickly and easily; when the symptoms are controlled, quality of life can improve considerably. The helpful document can be accessed on following websites: <a href=\"http://www.realsleep.co.uk/driving/\" title=\"\">realsleep.co.uk/driving/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sleep-apnoea-trust.org/driving-and-sleep-apnoea.htm\" title=\"\">sleep-apnoea-trust.org/driving-and-sleep-apnoea</a></p><p></p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/profile/martinlove\" title=\"\">guardian.co.uk/profile/martinlove</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>","headline":"Bentley Flying Spur: car review","trailText":"Chinese millionaires love a Bentley.
