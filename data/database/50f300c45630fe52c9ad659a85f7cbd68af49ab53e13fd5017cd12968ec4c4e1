It's still a family firm, run from its Milan workshop by Ugo's sons Danilo, Doriano and Cristiano.</p><p>De Rosa is one of the few bike builders which offers frames in a&nbsp;choice of steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon. Debating the pros and cons of each of these materials is the kind of thing that keeps passionate cyclists awake at night – that and their saddle sores. Dip into any bike website and the word \"stiffness\" occurs with such alarming regularity you'll be clearing your search history. Either way, \"structural rigidity\" is essential – a&nbsp;stiffer frame yields a better power transfer with each stroke (phnaar).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">The Idol</a>, made of Super Hi-Modul carbon fibre, is both rigid and virtually weightless – the holy grail of bike building. Lift it with your finger and it's more hologram than bike. The mix of tube shapes blends aerodynamics with power and good looks with comfort. The slim rear stays feed into the top tube like the straining tendons of an athlete's neck. The gear and brake cables are all internally routed, which keeps the lines clean and uncluttered. The Idol comes with an 11-speed <a href=\"http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Campagnolo</a> Athena groupset. \"Oh, a Campag…\" muttered my neighbour reverentially. \"So mechanical…\"</p><p>I tested the Idol on the Surrey hills in last Sunday's London Cycle Sportive. On the flat it unfurled itself with pace and precision. On the hills it turned me into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/mar/07/cycling.features\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>… Well, you've got to have an \"idol\".  But best of all, it was so comfortable. It's not often you climb off a bike after 100 miles with a bottom that isn't the bright pink of the Maglia Rosa. If I had the money I'd buy this bike in a shot.</p><p>For more information on the De Rosa, go to <a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">i-ride.co.uk</a></p><h2>Capital ride</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-436889175'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400076502328/FT-cycle-ride-011.jpg' alt='FT cycle ride' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Right, bring on Box Hill: a competitor in the London Cycle Sportive.  Photograph: Matt Alexander</figcaption></figure><p>Keen cyclists from the mean streets of south London are a familiar sight on the leafy hills of Surrey, but last Sunday's second annual <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/london-cycle-sportive\" title=\"\">FT London Cycle Sportive</a> turned the quite lanes into a busy cycle track. Torrential rain and gale-force winds threatened to de-rail the ride, I even checked the website before I left home in the vain hope that the event would be cancelled. But cyclists are a hardy bunch and it was clearly going to take more than rain and 30mph gusts to send us back to bed. In the end almost 2,300 turned out to tackle either the 48km, 100km or 100-mile distances of the sold-out sportive organised by Human Race in support of Access Sport. As I was on the De Rosa (reviewed above) it seemed the least I could do was to tackle the longer loop. We started at 7.30am in Dulwich Park, puzzled dog walkers wondering what was going on as hundreds whirred out of the gates, before climbing up towards Crystal Palace and then along the edge of the North Downs with amazing views over Kent and Surrey. As always it is a surprise just how quickly London goes green when you are on two wheels whisking along empty Sunday-morning roads. Eventually we returned through the suburbs and were rewarded with a victory lap of the Herne Hill velodrome – the one used in the 1948 London Olympics and now being restored by the <a href=\"http://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/friends/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. It was a great and testing day – competitive yet filled with camaraderie. The London Cycle Sportive is part of the Human Race Sportive Series. The next event is the Chiltern 100 on 1 June.

Called <em>Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist</em>, it explores the startling truth behind his remarkable descent from being among the finest athletes on earth to his tragic end in a sport riven by intrigue. Based on two years of extensive research and inspired by Matt Rendell's excellent book <em>The Death of Marco Pantani</em>, the film combines scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani's friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. Known as Il Pirata thanks to his head scarf and gold hoop earrings, the film celebrates the rise of a man born in 1970 to a humble family in Cesanatico in northern Italy to become the most successful, flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era.&nbsp;In 1998, he won both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia – he was the last man to accomplish the titanic feat. Yet, less than six years later, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room – destroyed by the sport to which he had given so much. It's a sad, humbling film which shines a light on the extraordinary pressures the riders faced at the height of the doping scandals.

Land Rover’s number one <a href=\"http://www.landrover.co.uk/vehicles/new-discovery-sport/index.html\">Discovery Sport</a>, however, is on its way from Merseyside to… New Mexico. Not to some drug cartel (though the car’s agility and strength would come in handy), but to Richard Branson and his <a href=\"http://www.virgingalactic.com/spaceport-america/spaceport/\">desert-based Virgin Galactic team</a>. It makes perfect sense of Land Rover’s over-reaching tagline: “Above and Beyond”.</p> <p>The Discovery Sport I drove only went to Somerset, not very Above or Beyond, but the journey was for a party to celebrate my son’s 18th and the fact that my sweet, curly-headed boy is now a grown-up man did seem slightly out of this world.</p> <p>Anyone familiar with Land Rover’s Discovery knows it’s called a Disco: a laughable nickname as there is very little that’s funky about a Disco. Yes, it’s a superbly engineered slab of technical excellence that’s more able and more resilient than any of us will ever… discover (that was unexpected), but groovy? Uh, no. This new Disco, however, moves in a very different way. I’d better explain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e6232121e51dd43c22b0a2136b4916e43140992\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422449242703/057b46b7-9631-449c-81ed-75361b94a349-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the wonderfully calm and luxurious interior.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the wonderfully calm and luxurious interior.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Land Rover family extends from the rugged, no-nonsense Defender to the super-svelte Range Rover. In the middle hovers the self-consciously trendy Evoque, the original boxy Discovery and the rather dated Freelander. It’s this last model that the new Discovery Sport is replacing on the team. This Disco is actually nothing to do with that Disco… Would it have killed them to think of a new name? No. There’s Jive? Boogie? Salsa? Break? Lap? Or maybe not.</p> <p>The Disco Sport, which went on sale last week, is a seven-seat SUV – the back two berths are tricky to access but once you are in they are surprisingly roomy – even if you are a gangling 18-year-old. At launch it features the reliable 2.2 diesel used in the Evoque, but a super-efficient turbo diesel will also be available later in the year. Both engines are light, quiet, smooth and efficient. There’s the choice of a six-speed manual or a slick nine-speed automatic – my father still remembers fondly the days when cars had three gears. This Disco is also the first to debut a whole bunch of clever Land Rover innovations – including its advanced pedestrian airbag technology, which has just won <em>WhatCar?</em>’s safety award of 2015.</p> <p>Inside, it’s every inch the premium product you’d expect. In terms of usability, the pick of the new features is the touchscreen infotainment system. This interface has been one of Land Rover’s weak points. The old system was fiddly, slow and confusing. This one isn’t. The only question is why did it take them so long?</p> <p>And the drive? Relaxed, responsive, powerful… a genuine joy. You sit high, commanding the road. The steering is silky; that diesel is tenacious and unfaltering. It’s the sort of car that makes you wish your destination was further away.</p> <p>Heading to the party in Somerset, I parked my mundane cares, relaxed my shoulders and let the Disco go to work. We skimmed along winding roads past winter fields. The low sun dazzled and made the wet surface shine like mercury. It was mesmerising. And with the kids singing in the back, my wife dozing next to me and the dog slathering over the back window, I felt, well… Above and Beyond.</p> <h2>A bright idea</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cfc5206d968323d946c585d5e6f08c3da34fb47\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422449333076/26ecb7fa-af4a-49ee-8670-6c6bff6efdee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"I'm going that way: the jacket with built-in indicators\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I’m going that way: the jacket with built-in indicators</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Getting cyclists to use lights is one thing, getting them to indicate is another. But not Halfords has managed to kill two birds with one stone by launching a jacket that will do both. At first the innovative Visijax commuter jacket appears to be a regular waterproof, but using motion-sensor technology, it activates a flashing LED signal to show other road users when the cyclists is making a turn. It’s a patented Intelligent Motion-Activated Signalling System (iMASS), which triggers an amber turning signal when cyclists raise their arm. It lights up for five seconds before self-cancelling. This is complemented by powerful white LED lights on the chest and red lights on the back. On top of that the jacket has sweeping vents to circulate cool air while its Teflon coating repels mud and water. It comes in black and neon yellow and costs £99.99.

Just like Ian Fleming’s novels aimed at grown ups, this adventure story features heroes, villains and gadgets but here the main protagonist is a magical car. Ian Fleming wrote the novel for his son Caspar but did not live to see it published before he died in August 1964. Illustrated by award-winning children’s book illustrator John Burningham, it was originally issued in three volumes by Jonathan Cape and has been fascinating young boys and girls for 50 years. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of the final volume, Queen Anne Press is launching a facsimile of the original – the standard edition of three volumes in a slipcase will be available for £125, while 50 special editions, bound in cloth with gold blocking and accompanied by a portfolio containing two prints signed and numbered by John Burningham, will cost £600 each. Whether you decide to splash out or not, both the book and the brilliant film are well worth another viewing.

/><strong>MPG 67.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 155mph</strong></p> <p>As a driver you only really have two things to look at: that endlessly changing grey ribbon of tarmac that stretches ahead of you and, if you glance down, the instrument cluster on your dashboard. The latter hasn’t changed much since the start of the last century. The first speedo was patented as long ago as 7 October 1902. Before that a dashboard was just the plank which stopped mud being “dashed up” by your galloping horse and ruining your nice breeches.</p> <p>Well, glance down in <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/tt.html\">Audi’s latest TT</a> and you’ll see something very new: a “<a href=\"http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/vorsprung_durch_technik/content/2014/03/audi-virtual-cockpit.html\">virtual cockpit</a>”. This makes it sound like you are sitting in a flight simulator – pony-tailed gamers are probably salivating and rubbing their thighs at the mere thought of it – but it only refers to the instrument panel itself. It’s a real game-changer, though. Where once there were boring old dials and warning indicators you now have a high-resolution, pinsharp LCD display a foot wide and 6in high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"300dce35c4c1e8b7e6ab2d655ca11b7a117d2743\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421236301905/832ac86f-d5cc-44d5-a216-a4d5e7290c58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dial it up: the revolutionary 'virtual cockpit'.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dial it up: the revolutionary ‘virtual cockpit’.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the virtual cockpit opens you still see the classic image of the speedo and rev counter. But switch to infotainment mode and those dials slink away leaving you with the flickering screen of a digital canvas. Using buttons on the steering wheel you can then move between map views, endless media functionality and vehicle settings. It’s the kind of breakthrough that you show every passenger. The navigation mode is particularly startling. Opt for the dynamic 3D setting and you see the background shift seamlessly as your route, marked in blue, snakes off into the distance. The only other car boasting this technology is Lamborghini’s Huracán – but you’ll have to pay £182,000 for that.</p> <p>The TT has been turning heads since it arrived on our streets in 1998 – this is now its third generation. It’s the same size as the outgoing model and only a little lighter, yet it manages to be much more efficient and more powerful, too. The pick of its engines is the 2-litre TDi diesel, which achieves a scarcely credible consumption of 67.3mpg with a CO<sub>2</sub> output of only 110g per km, yet it can also do 62mph in 7.1 seconds and top out at 155mph. These sort of figures, of frugality paired with performance, used to be mutually incompatible; now they happily co-exist in the same vehicle. Handling is smooth and infectiously immediate. Tap the throttle and the acceleration is gloriously punchy. The car has not lost its low-level, engrossing ride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f69bb0125d1bc634e4e1a79f19694ca3ea4bed70\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421236988953/e4ceff5e-28ca-4e6d-b846-c90ad8bb185b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the super plush interior of the TT.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the super plush interior of the TT.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This TT appears to be very similar to its two predecessors. But look carefully and you’ll see it has grown out of some of its curves and sharp creases now dominate. It has shaken off some puppy fat and now seems more grown up, more adult. I can’t decide if that’s a good thing or not – everything in life seems so much more serious these days.</p> <p>The interior is sumptuous and filled with materials and touches that would be at home in a sheikh’s limo. Outside the cabin, 10-spoke alloy wheels, sports suspension, Xenon headlamps with LED running lights and a speed-dependent active rear spoiler all feature as standard. It has a surprisingly big boot, but the rear seats are tiny. For the purposes of a full assessment, I persuaded my wife and her friend to sit in the back. They jammed in OK, and for a short journey were happy to sit with their heads bent at a crazy angle. But getting them out was another matter. I had to open my door and give their bottoms a good shove – like a farmer pushing two frisky heifers out of a trailer. I thought it was very funny. They didn’t… See what I mean about everything being serious these days?</p> <h2>Striving on Strava</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1598d14b565c863416e89e59769e84a2fff49fc3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421237158920/fd3529da-9bb0-4b46-8733-51ec050c948c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ride to live, live to ride: more of us than ever before are cycling.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ride to live, live to ride: more of us than ever before are cycling.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.strava.com\">Strava</a>, the online network for athletes, has released a comprehensive report showing the landscape of UK cycling and running in 2014 based on tens of millions of GPS activity uploads. Cyclists using Strava rode a total of more than 320 million miles last year, while runners covered over 27 million miles. Strava has millions of members with approximately 100,000 new members signing up every week – all gaining support, inspiration and camaraderie from the online community. The data uploaded gives interesting insights into the landscape of cycling and running in Britain. It turns out that the UK’s most popular day of cycling last year was Sunday 8 June, no doubt inspired by temperatures of 24C and the Tour de France coming to Yorkshire. Runners came out in force on Sunday 7 September. The average cycling distance for males was 41km (25 miles), while the female average was 8km shorter at 34km (21 miles). When it came to speed, women were even closer, riding an average speed of 12mph compared to the men’s average of 14mph. The most popular commuter cycling day was Tuesday 22 July, when 50,532 activities were recorded on Strava, and throughout the year the average commuter rode 17km (10 miles) per commute at a speed of 16mph (faster than the overall cycling average). Strava found, however, that not all commuters ride rain or shine, with a 54% drop off in commuter rides between summer and winter.</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9962720","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2223176","internalContentCode":"454589889","internalRevision":"38","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Audi’s much-loved TT has some surprising new touches… Like what have they done with the speedo?

</figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong>Price £999</strong><br /><strong>Gears 2x10 Sram X5</strong><br /><strong>Weight 15.4kg</strong></p> <p>At this time of year the bike racks at work thin out. The dark and drizzle take their toll and only the hardiest cyclists are left. It must be a sign of my age, but in the past month my cycling resolve has wavered. I even considered taking the bus, but I gritted my teeth, pulled on my damp trousers with numb fingers and held firm, because<em> I always cycle to work </em>– and have done for more than 25 years. Unless it’s snowing. It may look pretty and the muffled squeak of rubber on an empty road is compelling, but snow is treacherous and my skinny tyres have as much adhesion as a sizzling frankfurter on a nonstick pan.</p> <p>But then I came across the fat bike. Looking like a cross between an outsize BMX, a moon vehicle and a mountain bike built for Homer Simpson, its cartoon-like balloon wheels give you unimaginable levels of traction on the sort of terrain that normally leaves you whimpering in the corner.</p> <p>Fat bikes took their original inspiration from four-wheel beach buggies to become all-weather, mud, rock, sand and snow superstars. High-end mountain bikes usually rely on juicy front and rear shox to cushion their ride, but fat bikes – like beach buggies – depend on their donut-like tyres to stop them sinking in soft stuff while bouncing over the hard stuff. The high-volume, super-chunky rubber helps you tackle everything from dried-out riverbeds to boulder-strewn hill tracks and muddy meadows, not to mention snow and ice. The idea is that the air cushion helps you cruise over lumps and bumps rather than crash through them. Riders also talk of deflating these enormous tyres further to give even more grip. A normal road cyclist pumps their tyres rock hard, but these fatsos are so soft they are squishy to the touch. It’s a trick similar to drivers who go dune-bashing in their 4x4s. They let the air out and the doughy tyres spread out like a camel’s foot. My cousin, who uses a wheelchair, does the same with his chair. By fitting large, soft tyres he found he could push himself across the beach.</p> <p>I first rode this <a href=\"http://www.on-one.co.uk/i/q/CBOOFATX52/on-one-fatty-fat-bike\">On-One Fatty</a> last summer on the beach at Weymouth. It’s the strangest sensation. When you hit the sand you expect your front wheel to bury itself and flip you over the handlebars. Instead I floated across the sand. The bike is heavy, but the 4in-wide tyres gave me a laughable amount of stability and the low gearing meant I could plod happily up and down the beach. I snaked down dunes, rolled across shingle and even paddled in the shallows. The salt water probably didn’t do the Sram X5 gear set and Avid DB3 hydraulic disc brakes any favours, but my surging out of the surf did give the depressed donkey and its handler something to look at.</p> <p>On-One is part of <a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/\">Planet X</a>, the Sheffield-based firm which, after Brompton, is the second biggest bike assembler in the UK. It was set up by Dave Loughran, and though Planet X is now known for its quality performance road bikes, Dave got started building dirt jump bikes. The Fatty is a return to his roots and will be close to his heart. And if it snows this week, it’ll be close to my heart, too.</p> <h2>Be smart, be seen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab990d9d96d64124d95f79fdbae7469c521baf6d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420634744201/0992cdb9-a742-4e38-ad7f-8f5fa0d19114-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lighting up time: Emily Brooke and her 'Laserlight' bike lights that project a bike symbol onto the road surface to make cars more aware of cycle users around them.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lighting-up time: Emily Brooke and her ‘Laserlight’ bike lights that project a bike symbol onto the road surface to make cars more aware of cycle users around them.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s stating the obvious, but you’d be amzed how many cyclists don’t bother. It’s dark so be safe and invest in some decent lights! To make the process a little easier and a little less painful on your wallet, <a href=\"http://www.halfords.com/\">Halfords</a> is selling bike lights at VAT-free prices for the remainder of winter. The UK’s biggest bike seller has already offered reductions on safety wear. Emma Fox, commercial director for Halfords, said: “We want more people to feel confident cycling on the roads – whatever the time of year and whatever the weather. We started with issuing VAT free prices on high-viz wear and are now proud to offer bike lights at VAT free prices for the rest of winter, helping to make it more affordable to be safe and seen.” If I had my way I would make it illegal to ride in the dark without lights, but until then you have no excuses!</p> <h2>And for those who prefer two wheels with a bit of power!</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2dbc2be1165d5a25ab77e92f2dd22f8835fdfd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420645263596/84c967cb-3ce1-4bb0-b782-04b97cab3044-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Calling motorbike lovers everywhere: Elvis Presley chases Ann Margaret in Viva Las Vegas – en route for London's ExCel!\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calling motorbike lovers everywhere: Elvis Presley chases Ann Margaret in Viva Las Vegas – en route for London’s ExCel!</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2015 <a href=\"http://www.mcnmotorcycleshow.com/\">MCN London Motorcycle Show</a> (13-15 February) will be showcasing a world exclusive collection of motorcycles raced by nine-time MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi. This incredible collection will feature many of Rossi’s most famous machines, including his Aprilia, Honda, Yamaha and Ducati race bike. In addition to this unique display there will be an amazing array of the new 2015 motorcycles from Aprilia, BMW, Ducati, Kawasaki, KTM, Moto Guzzi, Suzuki, Triumph, Piaggio and Yamaha. 2015 looks set to be one of the most exciting years in motorcycling, with an unbelievable line-up of new models coming from the world’s leading manufacturers – and the Carole Nash MCN London Motorcycle Show will allow fans to get up close and personal with them all. Visitors over the three days will get to see new machines, such as the BMW R1200R, Ducati Scrambler, Kawasaki H2, KTM 1290 Super Adventure, Suzuki GSX-S1000, Triumph Street Triple RX and the eagerly anticipated, all-new Yamaha YZF-R1. The show will also play host to a Norton tribute to the golden era of the rotary race bikes and the people who built and raced them. From the prototype RC588 to Steve Hislop’s TT winning NRS588, the rotary Nortons were the icons of a fabulous era in British motorcycle racing history, with machines started up on the Show stage! TV’s James May will be lending us his classic bike collection and this time it will joined by bikes from his Top Gear colleague Richard Hammond. The free live action show sponsored by Michelin will keep the entire family entertained.

gerrof on the fookin’ left!” When it comes to the voice on my satnav, I’ve always been a fan of Birmingham’s most famous son, <a href=\"http://www.ozzy.com/us/home\">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. I did take instruction from Sean Connery for a few years – “Follow thissshh road for shix milesshh!” – but found myself spending too much time imitating him, to the frustration of my passengers. Next, I think I might go for Julian Clary, or maybe Kim Cattrall. Or Mr T. Or Morgan Freeman… Yes, Morgan!</p> <p>The giving (and taking) of directions (in cars, and elsewhere) is an area fraught with difficulty. A simple “I said <em>left</em>!” can trigger a full domestic meltdown. A few weeks ago, for instance, my wife was driving and I told her to leave the roundabout at 2 o’clock. After a pause of total incomprehension, she said: “And what time is it now?”</p> <p>I suspect the true reason those old road atlases that live on our backseats are always so ripped and torn is that clueless map readers have had to use them as shields against drivers enraged by poor navigational prompts. The likes of TomTom and Garmin should be given a medal by Relate for services towards ending road rows between couples.</p> <p>Which brings me to the satnav voice in this <a href=\"http://www.mitsubishi-cars.co.uk/shogun/\">Mitsubishi Shogun</a> – it’s the squeakiest, ugliest, most grating voice I’ve ever heard. It’s so irritating you’d rather be lost than listen to her listless drawl. It’s a missed chance to imbue the 4x4 with an appropriately deep and gravelly persona.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5806d36357245386dc63ee87da7a57d9446d84c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419336397451/3bd503ed-88c0-408a-8011-3802488b92c4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the interior of the Shogun.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the interior of the Shogun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Shogun is one of the big boys of the road. It’s a tough, no-nonsense, authentic SUV. It may not be pretty but it certainly gets the job done. It’s been with us since 1982 and was one of the first large 4x4s to couple on-road pampering with off-road performance.</p> <p>This is now the fourth generation of the enduring SUV and thanks to advances in technology it is stronger, quieter, safer and smarter than before. Yet somehow a part of it still seems to be stuck back in the 1980s. Clamber in and the sheer scale of it hails from another time. The massive doors slam shut like trapdoors and the side-hinged tailgate almost needs two hands to haul it open.</p> <p>Despite its terrifying presence, the Shogun is a friendly Gruffalo of a vehicle. It’s easy to drive and boasts a quick-thinking automatic which emulates your own driving style (that may not be a good thing). Power steering can be done with a fingertip it’s so light, while the hydro-boost braking system is mercifully efficient. In theory, parking should be impossible, but thanks to a raft of reversing sensors, cameras and an amazingly tight turning circle you’ll marvel at the spaces you squeeze into.</p> <p>The 1980s vibe isn’t helped by the hopeless driver interface. Buttons are tiny, the display is an unreadable dot-matrix, and the controls are fiddly and don’t seem to do what you ask. Just like they were 30 years ago. But these are trifling concerns when you give in to the Shogun’s considerable charms. It’s genuinely loved by its owners: 70% of sales are repeat purchases.</p> <p>The Shogun is a dyed-in-the-wool, no-holds-barred workhorse built for those who actually need to load, lug and pull heavy objects. It’s made to slither, climb, wade, plough and clamber over the toughest terrains. It feels unstoppable. The drivetrain, four-wheel independent suspension and traction-control systems mean it could keep going long after your courage has failed you.</p> <p>The 3.2-litre four-cylinder diesel has been revised and primped. It’s still a chugger on the open road but it will pull a trailer though a bog with relish.

<p>Sometimes the word “driving” just isn’t enough to describe the visceral, elemental, sense-tingling, skull-popping overload of… well, driving. But then along comes a truth-seeking missile of a vehicle that reminds you just what an incredible experience driving a car can be. <a href=\"https://4c.alfaromeo.com/\">Alfa Romeo’s exquisite new 4C</a> – a small, two-seat, rear-wheel-drive sports car – puts performance and pleasure front and centre. As it hugs each bend, sweeps down every straight and surges up every rise it reminds you how <em>alive</em> a car can make you feel…</p> <p>In many ways, the 4C is the car Alfa Romeo – and fans of Italian sports cars – have been waiting for. Its voluptuous curves coupled to the promise of pure driving nirvana have the task of knocking the historic brand out of reverse and steering it back to profitability and desirability. It’ll do this by unlocking the cash-rich markets of America and China. And early signs are very promising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e89286899d358239a9220c191aadb7216e451307\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418647093330/3f593dd8-3af0-4c36-b614-a69ebeb09d38-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smooth operator: curves and dramatic air intakes make the 4C a feast for the eyes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smooth operator: curves and dramatic air intakes make the 4C a feast for the eyes.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was unveiled to a drooling public at the 2011 Geneva motor show and went from concept to reality in just 28 months – a process that usually takes at least five years. Inspired by the legendary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_33_Stradale\">1967 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale</a>, the 4C was designed and engineered by Alfa’s in-house team, with the actual building of it is being done by Maserati at its Modena factory. So, it’s a proper Italian job.</p> <p>Considering the heavy lifting expected of it, the 4C is a sprightly bantamweight, tipping the scales at just 895kg. Its mighty engine is positioned right behind you. It sits so close to your back that it feels like it’s breathing down your neck. Turn round and you’ll glimpse it through a narrow lepers’ squint of a window, as if it’s some rare exhibit. The power from this all-aluminium 240hp 1,750cc turbo engine is astonishing. You’ll hit 62mph from a standing start in 4.5 seconds and you can then crack on up to a top speed of 160mph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"772fefeb32d97aa590ca805aaa5efe4829bcb1c7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418647167433/73e17b26-a89f-40bb-9c9e-7201ab0e5fca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the snug cockpit of the 4C.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the snug cockpit of the 4C.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its swirling bodywork and tantalising shell-like air intakes, the 4C is <em>molto bello</em>. But, like those things that require a sophisticated palate to truly appreciate – I’m thinking whisky, Wagner, maybe a little light bondage – your first taste of the 4C might be a bit painful.</p> <p>Its doors are heavy and climbing in is difficult, while getting out is hilarious – I ended up crawling on to the road at one point. If you have a bad back or weigh more than 14st forget it. The materials used inside are borderline crap. That’s not a technical word. The plastics would barely make the grade at the Little Tikes factory. The radio is dismal; rear visibility is nonexistent; the boot is pathetic. And the horn! It sounds like an apologetic parp escaping from an old vicar as you kneel at the altar rail. But… and it’s a huge BUT… turn the key and, boosh, the metamorphosis begins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1923169d16c03f8c31636ed2f2c81744a481f39\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418647292401/a40f0a63-040e-46e4-8c9b-8dee00b55679-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Into the sunset: the rear view of the 4C – what most of your fellow road users will see...\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the sunset: the rear view of the 4C – what most of your fellow road users will see...</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The engine burbles to life. The sound is amazing: a grunting, phlegmy clatter. On top of that the road noise is massive. At times it feels as if you are dragging a wooden dinghy up a shingle beach. Unassisted steering means it’s hard to manoeuvre and almost impossible to park. But who cares, parking is for losers.</p> <p>And so you’re off. Squeeze the throttle, in fact stamp on the throttle, and, bam, you find yourself in another world. The 4C is hungry, responsive, agile, wonderful. The acceleration is electric, the handling all-engrossing. It lives for the open road and the more you drive it the tighter it seems to fit around you. In many ways, it isn’t happy unless you are doing at least 40mph.

Oh my God! It’s a Yeti!” I shout a frantic warning to my 13-year-old daughter. My eyes bulge in a mask of pantomime terror (I’m channelling my best All Black haka performance). The creature is behind her, crouching between the wheelie bin and the neighbour’s Mazda, but she doesn’t bother looking round, just swings her bag over her shoulder and saunters off to school with her friends. Oh well, worth a go I think. I pull my face together and wave at a passing mother. It’s like a scene from <em>Outnumbered</em>, only with even unfunnier jokes.</p> <p>You’ve probably made a Yeti sighting yourself over the past few years. It was first spotted on our roads in 2009, and since then <a href=\"http://www.skoda.co.uk/models/new-yeti\">Skoda</a> has sold more than 30,000 of its award-winning SUVs. It’s one of their monster sellers (I’ll stop now, promise). So popular is the Yeti that Skoda decided to create two versions in its latest makeover. There’s now the Yeti and the Yeti Outdoor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"998684c8941866f4556b43c89c6a380c2318836a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/8/1418041791642/ce587900-f144-4a92-93d2-7ee7496ecc86-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the comfortable and well-laid out interior of the Yeti.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the comfortable and well-laid out interior of the Yeti.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s a Jekyll-and-Hyde split. The regular Yeti (Dr Jekyll) has matching coloured bumpers and body trim, a choice of less-powerful engines and two-wheel drive. It’s aimed at families with metropolitan tastes. The Yeti Outdoor (Mr Hyde) is rugged with lots of chunky plastic mouldings. It has bigger engines, four-wheel drive and protective underbody armour so you can rough play with Mother Nature. It’s aimed at families with agricultural tastes. So far, the model most have bought is the 4x4 Mr Hyde with a 138bhp 2-litre turbo-diesel engine. It’s easy to see why. A polished all-rounder, it will do a frugal 50 miles to a gallon and at the same time has the ooomph to hit 60mph in less than 10 seconds. It’s that hint of wildness behind the eyes that we find so attractive.</p> <p>Of course the true madness of these “country-capable” cars is that they are rarely given a chance to get down and dirty and prove what they’re really made for. Unless, of course, you go looking for it. Driving my teenage son and his mates back from a rain-drenched rugby match in Kent, I decided to throw caution to the wind and abruptly launched off down a muddy and waterlogged lane. I figured the boys were already covered in mud so if we got stuck they could get out and push.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06043cfb9b59cbd22f06c45cce06d59dcd94578\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/8/1418041980391/055b419e-c5ed-4fc7-82c1-cad088ab9885-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Natural environment: the Yeti feels at home on the ice.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natural environment: the Yeti feels at home on the ice.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We followed the narrow, bouncing track for several miles, churning up and down greasy hills, wading through brown water and finally ploughing across a sodden field. It was a doddle and the Outdoor took it all in its stride. It was only when I pulled off the muddy playground, relieved we hadn’t ended up in a ditch, that I noticed I’d forgotten to hit the car’s “off-road” button. It had coped regardless. We cruised home along the M20, the Yeti shaking the mud from its paws and settling into a refined, mile-munching stride.</p> <p>Inside, the two Yeti brothers are identical. Their Varioflex seating system provides you with more than 20 different arrangements – fold the back row flat and the back is van-like in size. The rear seats are mounted higher than the front ones, giving the back row a better view. And the high roof means there is plenty of head and leg room for adults – or 18-year-old rugby players. The standard spec is generous, but move up to the posher trim levels and you also get parking sensors, bi-xenon headlights, heated seats, satnav, a panoramic sunroof and park assist. Nothing, in fact, to be scared of at all…</p> <h2>Are you a record breaker?</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsZl4_pm5OI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLiUYFNOwqQoSgBq7HGYM7VAE3ktDivu2g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Setting the record: 13 great films telling the behind the scenes stories of some of Britain’s landmark records.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A bit of a confession here. For as long as I can remember I have been addicted to the annual <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em>. I’m almost 50 years old now and my mother still wraps one up for me every Christmas. I’ve got quite a collection in the downstairs loo now… Anyway, 2014 has been a big year for GWR as they have been celebrating their 60th birthday. To commemorate the milestone they have released a series of films celebrating some of the most iconic records that have been documented over the past six decades. The series, hosted on the Guinness World Records YouTube Channel, includes never-before-seen contributions from truly great British record holders, such as Andy Green OBE and his fellow land speed racer Richard Noble OBE, Lord Sebastian Coe, Sir Roger Bannister, Sir Richard Branson and Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Have a look for yourself at this link: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiUYFNOwqQoSgBq7HGYM7VAE3ktDivu2g\">youtube.com/playlist</a>. One of the best of the series is Andy Green’s. It tells the twist of fate which led Andy Green to discover the project and ultimately pilot the trailblazing, 100,000hp Thrust SSC, which reached a staggering 763.035 mph (1,227.985 km/h), Mach 1.020, on 15 October 1997. I’m still looking forward to this year’s bumper annual, but these super films will keep me hooked until it arrives.</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9841704","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-14T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2205901","internalContentCode":"453230361","internalRevision":"95","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"It isn’t hairy and it doesn’t have a big footprint, but Skoda’s Yeti comes alive in the muddy wilds of Kent, says <strong>Martin Love</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Skoda Yeti: car review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Love","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-14T06:00:04.920Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/8/1418041672741/Skoda-Yeti-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54859839e4b0e350c699aa9c","newspaperPageNumber":"56","internalStoryPackageCode":"49569","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-17T06:00:07Z","standfirst":"<p>It isn’t hairy and it doesn’t have a big footprint, but Skoda’s Yeti comes alive in the muddy wilds of Kent</p>","linkText":"Skoda Yeti: car review | Martin Love","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-14T06:00:07.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/14/skoda-yeti-car-review-martin-love","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/dec/14/skoda-yeti-car-review-martin-love","sectionName":"Technology","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"love","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

/><strong>MPG 74</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 130mph</strong></p> <p>A nice man from Volvo phoned me up this week and asked if I’d like to go to a film premiere. How glamorous, I thought, my mind a heady whirl of flashbulbs, red carpets and starlets in strapless dresses. Car manufacturers have long used films as a vehicle (sorry) to give their cars some personality. Where would Aston Martin be without Mr Bond? Would Mini be the quirky lovable motor we take it for without the antics of Mr Bean? But who would Volvo be striking up a movie partnership with? Probably some Scandinavian beauty with a lust for adventure set in a frozen landscape.</p> <p>In fact, the film stars a marmalade-munching bear from Darkest Peru – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/paddington-review-bear-hug-family-treat\">Paddington</a>. Mr Brown, his adoptive father, is a risk assessor and drives a Volvo. Of course he does. To be fair, Paddington <em>was</em> created by Mr Bond, Michael Bond, and the new movie is brilliantly funny, warm and touching – though purists may raise an eye at scenes of mild flirtation, transvestism and a bout of light swearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"457ba5b048e15289b88ae8ee457e7974b6cebb7a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417518656801/10a16a80-5ad1-4eed-8e23-d4a902109eb6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Safe as houses: the luxurious interior of the V40.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Safe as houses: the luxurious interior of the V40.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film is a perfect family movie, and what car says family more than Volvo? In 1927 the firm’s founders, Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson, laid out their vision: “Cars are driven by people,” they said, “and so the guiding principle behind everything we make at Volvo is safety.” Now the company’s stated goal is that by 2020 nobody shall ever be seriously injured or killed in a new Volvo.</p> <p>The latest model to join battle to make that ambition a reality is the <a href=\"http://www.volvocars.com/uk/all-cars/volvo-v40-cross-country/pages/default.aspx\">V40 Cross Country</a>. It is a pumped version of the more metropolitan V40. From the outside this means juicier suspension, higher ground clearance, bash plates under its nose and tail, and skid plates down each side. But don’t let its rugged looks and aggressive detailing fool you. The Cross Country is a total wuss when it comes to confrontation. It’s been fitted with a host of smart gadgets and gizmos, which Volvo calls IntelliSafe, to keep you, your passengers and your car out of harm’s way. These technologies don’t just keep you in one piece after a crash – they <em>actively</em> prevent a collision happening in the first place, despite your best efforts. At Volvo they don’t recognise the word “inevitable”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80d03cee4d4d52c3647e3468c23238001a307129\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417518761527/61fa3702-f652-43b1-9512-995b2a80651b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The road ahead: the V40 takes technology to new levels.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road ahead: the V40 takes technology to new levels.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>City Safety works at up to 31mph and slams on the brakes if the car senses a low-speed smash. Electronic Stability Control applies just the right amount of brake and reduces engine power to stop you skidding if the car senses the road is greasy. Collision Warning with Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection (Dog Detection is in the pipeline) takes avoiding action if the car senses… you get the idea. Hats off to you if you actually manage to crash a Volvo. Paddington has a gift for mayhem – maybe he should be unleashed as a Volvo test driver?</p> <p>So far, so safe. Stepping past Volvo’s death fixation, what about the living? Inside you’ll find a ménage of stitched leather, tactile rubber and polished chrome, all topped off with a panoramic roof and seven modes of ambient “theatrical” lighting. The new Sensus Connected Touch programme turns the 7in display screen into an onboard computer – you can stream Spotify and access it with a voice-controlled function: simply say the name of a song, and within seconds it’s playing. Then there’s the engine: the V40 is blessed with the powerfully efficient new D4. Fast and responsive, it offers 187bhp on tap, a 0-62mph time of 7.7 seconds and just 104g/km CO<sub>2</sub>. Round bends, the car feels balanced and agile. On straights, it feels eager and poised. In all, it’s everything you’d expect. And it looks great in marmalade orange.</p> <h2>Ice driving with Bentley</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14e85f9b169300459cf820c2c0224465c687c2dd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417538094584/ea02c5c2-479c-4a88-a47e-3fe122917d96-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Get a grip: a Bentley dancing on ice.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get a grip: a Bentley dancing on ice.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bentley’s flagship and highly exclusive ice-driving experience, <a href=\"http://events.bentleymotors.com/en/power-on-ice/\">Power on Ice</a>, will have two extra participants in 2015, after Bentley donated two spaces as prizes for the very first time to a new international charity, <a href=\"http://www.care2save.co.uk/\">Care2Save</a>. All proceeds from a public competition will provide funds to improve excellence in hospice and palliative care around the world. The competition will run from 1 December 2014 to 8 January 2015, with entries costing just £1. There is no limit to the number of entries possible and they can be made through the website <a href=\"http://www.care2save.co.uk/bentley/\">www.care2save.co.uk/bentley/</a>. Bentley is also donating exclusive gifts for those who buy a number of entries in the charity draw, including a tour of Bentley’s factory in Crewe.</p> <p>Set in the icy north of Finland, Power on Ice elevates the concept of ice driving to the extreme, with the most powerful Bentley line-up yet. Throughout the four-day adventure, the winners will push a range of Bentley cars beyond the limitations of every-day driving, starting with the first ever chance to drive the Continental GT3-R on ice. With expert in-car tuition from Bentley’s ice-driving team and four-time World Rally Champion, Juha Kankkunen, piloting the cars on his personally designed tracks, it is just one part of this amazing event. Hosted at the boutique hotel of Chalet Ruka Peak there are also snowmobile rides, ice-karting and night-time Huskey-sled safari adventures to reindeer farms. Each place normally costs €11,340. Spend a pound or two, raise money for a good cause and maybe end up having the ice-driving experience of a lifetime – sounds like a win win situation...</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9829858","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2202365","internalContentCode":"452930819","internalRevision":"37","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"When Volvo started looking for a star to drive its V40 Cross Country, it had to go all the way to Darkest Peru, says <strong>Martin Love</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Volvo V40 Cross Country: car review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Love","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-07T06:00:03.444Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417518515883/Volvo-V40-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"547d9c27e4b0975df952b43d","newspaperPageNumber":"75","internalStoryPackageCode":"49569","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-10T06:00:06Z","standfirst":"<p>When Volvo started looking for a star to drive its V40 Cross Country, it had to go all the way to Darkest Peru </p>","linkText":"Volvo V40 Cross Country: car review | Martin Love","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-07T06:00:06.000Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/07/volvo-v40-cross-country-car-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/dec/07/volvo-v40-cross-country-car-review","sectionName":"Technology","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"film/paddington","webTitle":"Paddington","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paddington","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/paddington","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"love","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

/><strong>MPG 54.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 112mph</strong><br /></p> <p>“Have you got shit for brains?” shouts a fellow road user. It’s raining hard and the traffic is at a standstill, but the man questioning my neurological make-up clearly thinks I should move forward anyway. He carries on shouting in fluent Anglo-Saxon. I decide to crack my window open an inch or two to give him a bit of my own mind (shit or otherwise) while, of course, staying safely in the locked car. But the one-touch electric window drops open completely, leaving us face to face. It surprises us both. The opening seems huge.</p> <p>He stares at me, raindrops running over the dome of his shaved head. Should he thump me or not? I could almost see his synapses sputtering and misfiring in the wet. He swears some more then trundles back to his car. I press the auto button and the window silently closes. He was frightening and depressing. But it was also ridiculous – being stuck in one of the most technologically sophisticated cars on the road next to a motorist permanently stuck in the dark ages.</p> <p>The car in question is <a href=\"http://www.lexus.co.uk/car-models/nx/nx-300h/index.tmex\">Lexus’s new NX</a>. It’s the luxury Japanese carbuilder’s first foray into the hugely popular compact SUV market. The NX is here to break up the cosy cabal dominated by the likes of <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/new-cars/q3/q3.html\">Audi’s Q3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bmw.co.uk/en_GB/new-vehicles/x/x3/2014/Introduction.html\">BMW’s X3</a> and <a href=\"http://www.landrover.co.uk/vehicles/range-rover-evoque/index.html\">Range Rover’s Evoque</a>. Like the mean girls who run school playgrounds, these vehicles are chic, stylish, popular <em>and</em> ruthless. The NX has its work cut out to break into their sorority.</p> <p>It certainly has the looks to do it. The NX is one of the most eye-catching cars of the year. Its designers seem to have taken their inspiration from Toblerone. From the creased panels to the sculpted lights, it’s triangles, pyramids and pointy angles everywhere. Curves are out; folded-paper corners are in. The front end is dominated by a vast spindle grille which sits between a set of squinting LED headlights and L-shaped daytime running lights. With its tiny eyes and pleated nose, the Lexus looks a bit like a Shar-Pei. When the Evoque landed on our streets it was both ridiculed <em>and</em> revered for its outlandish design. The same fate awaits the NX. But after so many years of boring, homogenous, yawn-making Mogadon motors, it’s brilliant that we are once again getting some distinctive vehicles on the road.</p> <p>The small “h” in the name stands for hybrid – a combination of a 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and a powerful electric motor. The entry-level S version is front-wheel drive only; all the other versions get four-wheel drive. As you’d hope with a hybrid, the NX has the skimpy appetite of a lady who lunches – a gallon of fuel will take you almost 55 miles down the road. No matter how often you sit at the wheel of an electric hybrid, the eerie silence is unnerving. In a big car like this, it seems even weirder. A monastery on wheels. Gently squeeze the throttle and off you waft.</p> <p>Despite all its unforgiving angles, the NX’s interior is a warm, hushed place. A bubble of calm. The beautifully finished cabin is packed with a dizzying array of gizmos and gadgets – adaptive cruise control, LED auto-dipping headlights, bird’s-eye parking camera, lane and blind spot assist, rear-cross traffic alert and a slightly irritating touchpad control for the infotainment screen.</p> <p>It’s a remarkable feat of engineering – its cleverness a tribute to the men and women who build it. Shame they can’t do anything about my fellow drivers…</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9788424","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2199474","internalContentCode":"452653527","internalRevision":"36","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Lexus’s new NX may be the strong silent type.

Airbumps on each door.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know what you’re thinking. “Why has that weird car got Lego stuck all over its doors?” Or: maybe it’s a rubber shower mat or chocolate? In fact it’s thermoplastic polyurethane filled with air capsules. It absorbs impacts, like tough bubblewrap. Citroën calls it Airbump technology. The stuff doesn’t dent and ding. You bash it, it protects your car and then pops right back out. It’s not to everyone’s taste. My wife thought a car with dents and scrapes all over it would still look better than the <a href=\"http://www.citroen.co.uk/new-cars-and-vans/car-range/citroen-c4-cactus\">Citroën Cactus</a> and, she wondered, what exactly is the difference between plastic that protects your car and a “bumper”? Fair point.</p> <p>But for all those narrow-minded grumps, there will be many who’ll take this unusual car to their hipster hearts. So much modern motoring design follows the same tired, dull, play-it-safe template it’s a wonder that we don’t all doze off in traffic jams. Anyone trying something new should be applauded. And the Cactus is certainly something new.</p> <p>Taking its starting point as the already likeable C4, Citroën polled its customers and found they wanted “more useful technology, reduced costs and more design”. And, lo, the Cactus is what they got. It’s techy, good value and it’s got Airbumps…</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d73dd5e02e1fa3c7117b30108719d44bc12c2b7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416393524253/d58906c8-fe6f-4317-9a6b-6932f0dedc32-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the funky interior of the new Cactus.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the funky interior of the new Cactus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The focus for most of its clever tech is the fully digital touchscreen which sits on the dashboard like an iPad casually propped up on its side. Through this device you access all your music, navigation, parking, phone, photo and social needs. The next generation of cars is being designed for a generation of drivers who want to feel connected all the time, and in the Cactus you can browse apps, check out TripAdvisor and plan your next food and fuel stops while doing that other thing you do in cars… you know, drive.</p> <p>With prices starting at under £13,000 for a comfortable five-seater with a decent boot and plenty of driver aids, the Cactus is certainly affordable. Factor in the incredible fuel efficiency offered by the latest-generation of low-revving Euro 6 engines and your bank account soon starts to relax. Spend a couple more grand on the range-topping 1.6 BlueHDi eco car and you’ll get an amazing 83.1 miles to the gallon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b677acd4a01e8cd1adf3bcea1bc9139a2ec76c01\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416393587784/9a4a7918-7c32-46f8-ada5-db92a66647d2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rear view: the sculpted back end.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rear view: the sculpted back end.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s loads of other clever stuff, too. The panoramic sunroof, for instance, has advanced heat protection which keeps warmth in and UV rays out. It means there’s no need for a sun blind, which in turn gives you more headroom, and also does away with the price and weight of an electric motor to open and close it.</p> <p>Then there’s the design. As well as those Airbumps, the car has a host of bold and dynamic flourishes. Inside, everything is conceived around straight edges and square shapes. The instrument panel is a block that looks like a 70s radio, its boxy retro numerals glowing in the dark. The front seats have sharp corners, while the back row is a single bench. Door handles are leather straps and the glove compartment has been replaced with a roomy top box with two horizontal straps, like a posh picnic hamper. It all feels very hip. Maybe it will inspire other manufacturers to be less boring in the future.</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9755777","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-23T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2194799","internalContentCode":"452164380","internalRevision":"19","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Citroën’s quirky new Cactus is packed with technology and sharp design details.

£14,295</strong><br /><strong>MPG 58</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 103mph</strong></p> <p>I have a confession to make. I’ve lied to a priest. Father Dominic recently sent me an email from his church in Italy, in a village near Cortona, asking for advice about a car. I imagined him tapping away in the crypt of the ancient chapel, a guttering candle throwing shadows across the stone floor, the organist practising next door, a wild boar piglet snuffling in the straw at his feet… Anyway, the padre was after a vehicle that was both rugged and reliable at coping with the dreadful rural roads yet small and tidy enough to squeeze along the hill town’s medieval streets. I figured he’d also need something Italian and that Pope Francis would approve of. Bugatti’s Veyron and Maserati’s Ghibli were out on the grounds of frugality and celibacy. There seemed to be only one candidate: Fiat’s Panda 4x4. The problem was that I’d never tested one. Could I really recommend a car I’d never driven – to a priest? I figured God would understand. Weeks later I received an ecstatic email from the padre. He loved it and now wanted me to recommend a car for his mother…</p> <p>So I thought I’d better find out what Father Dom liked so much about the Fiat Panda 4x4. It first appeared in 1983. Back then, as the world’s first small car to have all wheels driven, it was years ahead of its time. It shares the same boxy shape of the standard Panda, but the 4x4 is so much more than just a more agile Panda (if such a creature exists). It comes with steel bash plates to protect its delicate underside, chunky bumpers and high wheel arches to cope with its raised suspension, and a revolutionary electronic rear differential system that means it can roam wherever you want. Don’t think of it as a weedy Land Rover – it’s more a giant quad bike with a roof.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88d1b4725a5cfea60dec7e9ddb931cb6b616cd9d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415723442933/f39beeb8-592c-4b79-bd50-a5a838f89a18-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Fiat's funky and fun but comfortable orange and grey interior\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Funky and fun with comfort: the Fiat Panda’s interior</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This model is the third generation of the car. It’s as fun and funky as ever, but it now also has the quality, comfort and technology of a much more serious vehicle. It’s hard to get your head around just how multi- talented it is: it seats five yet has a tiny road print; it’s short and narrow yet has a high roof, so it feels roomy; its small engine is economical yet it’s powerful enough to tow a caravan; it’s built for rough tracks yet feels very at home on motorways.</p> <p>Under the bonnet there’s a choice of an 875cc TwinAir Turbo or a 1.3-litre MultiJet 2 turbo diesel. Both come with start-stop technology and an indicator which tells you when to change gear in order to achieve the best economy. The car comes with “Dualdrive” electric power steering with a City function which means at slow speeds the steering is much lighter. An option you might want to invest in is a low-speed collision- mitigation system usually found only in much bigger cars. This reads the road ahead and when it detects an obstacle it slams on the brakes automatically. If you don’t think you’ll be needing the four-wheel drive system, the Panda Trekking model is for you: it has the same engines and chunky looks but is 2WD and £1,500 cheaper.</p> <p>Having spent a week with the Panda, I found it reliable when the going got tough, cheap to run and a lot cooler than you might guess… Everything you would hope to find in your local priest.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <h2>Motorhome madness</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50daf0387b8ce5e697de7e9a865e98fcce69054b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902031315/dd98c0b2-7e75-4ac2-8bde-9d8410249831-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"campervans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eight of the best: the motorhome line-up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this summer I test drove the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/05/wellhouse-ford-terrier-campervan-review\">Wellhouse Ford Terrier SE</a> and loved it. But I’m not the only one who has fallen for its charms. <a href=\"http://www.which-motorhome.co.uk\"><em>Which Motorhome</em></a>, the UK’s number one magazine for motorhome testing, has just completed an extensive group test of eight campervans, featuring four VW T5-based campervans and four key non-T5 alternatives. The VW T5 campervans featured were Bilbo’s Space, CMC Reimo Trio Style White Line, Hillside Birchover and the Volkwagen California SE. The other campervans tested were the Auto-Sleeper Wave (based on Mercedes Vito), Hillside Dalbury Action (based on Nissan NV200), Wellhouse Alphard (based on Toyota Alphard) and Wellhouse Terrier SE (based on the Ford Transit Custom). The test team looked at campervans that gave almost equal priority to everyday use as they do to living outdoors. They were looking for compact dimensions and the ability to get under car park height barriers, plus minimal camping facilities including a small cooker, fresh water supply, beds and storage. The winner? Wellhouse’s Ford Terrier SE, of course. Editor, Peter Vaughan said: “The VW T5 has dominated this sector to the degree that many customers simply say that they are looking for a Volkswagen camper. So for the Ford-based Terrier to come out on top speaks volumes about how good this campervan is.” <em>Which Motorhome</em> is available from all good newsagents on the second Thursday of every month.

£8,245</strong><br /><strong>MPG 68.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 99mph</strong></p> <p>Remember your first car? Mine was a Renault 5 with foreign plates. Rust spread like impetigo round its battered grille; moss grew in the window seals. It had no heating, no stereo, one windscreen wiper and, towards the end of its short but joyous life in my hands, no starter motor. We had to jump it every time… But it was wheels and freedom and… I don’t think I’ve ever loved a car as much.</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about first cars this week as I have been driving the <a href=\"http://www.peugeot.co.uk/showroom/108/3-door/\">Peugeot’s new 108 </a>– a small city car aimed firmly at young people. The car was launched this summer and more than 5,000 have already been sold in the UK, almost all to young people who have never owned a Peugeot before. On average the new owners are seven years younger than the people who bought the outgoing 107. Manufacturers value these customers highly because, as car buyers, we are remarkably loyal. The hope is that if you snare a young driver he or she will stay with you for life, slowly working their way up through the various models in the range. (It doesn’t always work like that – I’ve never owned another Renault!)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f38554566e2ab22aa9a59bba43943d6a9b3ae596\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415192442105/0c57a099-8d5c-4aff-88fe-3fe3845cf69c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the 108's funky interior is orientated around its connectivity.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the 108’s funky interior is orientated around its connectivity.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its sharp looks and plush options, including a fully retractable fabric roof, Peugeot’s 108 feels a bit too posh to be aimed solely at youngsters. Learning to rough it with an unreliable rust bucket is an important part of their education. How else are they going to learn an appreciation of the finer aspects of motoring – like not sweating at red lights as you wait for the inevitable stall; the dreadful slow bump of a dying battery.</p> <p>The 108 is a lot more sophisticated than the popular 107 that it replaces. <a href=\"http://www.peugeot.co.uk/news/peugeot-108-design-story/\">Ivo Groën</a>, the car’s designer, was set the goal of giving the 108 a more premium and upmarket feel, as well as differentiating it from Citroën’s C1 (which is cute) and Toyota’s Aygo (trendy). All three models share the same underpinnings and virtually identical interiors, so it is only the exterior dressing and the badge that buyers have to choose between. These cross-brand alliances are quite common and the unusual pairings you stumble across in the motoring world would make even a veteran swinger raise their eyebrows: Renault and Nissan; Fiat and Chrysler; BMW and Toyota… it’s all going on.</p> <p>Groën set about his task by creating a car with a chic “about town” character. At the car’s launch, he explained his thinking: “The 107 had a very cab-forward ‘mono-volume’ silhouette… We wanted to give the 108 more of a nose and the powerful feeling that comes with that. We wanted to reduce the glass and increase the sculpting of the body, and at the same time give it a timeless elegance.” Well, there you are…</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730045a762ffa98d65fcd512f6d3a82277a90e29\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415192537142/ab78e3a9-b3fc-4175-ae67-95d73f98c427-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blue-sky thinking: the 108 has a retractable fabric roof.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue-sky thinking: the 108 has a retractable fabric roof.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nose he developed is dominated by the same “floating grille” as seen on the 108’s bigger sisters the 208, 2008 and 308 – they do say noses run in families. The grille is flanked by a pair of smart bifocal projector headlights, while round the back the group’s “lion claw” lamps provide another link to the rest of the Peugeot range.</p> <p>Two engines are available – a 68PS 1-litre three-cylinder or an 82PS 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol. Both are efficient and economy is up to 74.3mpg. But the 107 was cheap to run, too. The big difference here is that the 108 is a pleasure to drive. The three-cylinder engine means it makes a strange “thrum”, but you soon get used to it. I drove more than 200 miles in a day – taking my daughter back to university, which seemed a fitting journey for a car aimed at young people. It handled the motorway brilliantly and was small enough to dance through Bristol’s gridlocked streets and squeeze into a tiny space outside her student digs.</p> <p>Other than being small, cheap and available in dozens of personalised colour combinations, the most obvious youth-centric aspect of the 108 is its connectivity. In 2005 when the 107 was introduced no one had a smart phone, but, the 108 is all about your phone. A seven-inch touchscreen in the centre of the dash can be linked for all your music, media and maps. It feels like the heart of the car in some ways, as if the 108 is simply a large phone holder. Not so much Motion &amp; Emotion, in Peugeot’s famous tagline, as Motion &amp; Emoticon.</p> <h2>A trip down Lego lane</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027d09a4a119b940df8cf0d2cc6e5414e0fe608d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415205609087/e7c890a9-06b3-422d-b7d0-bcd2de3db6bf-460x276.png\" alt=\"Rush hour: Lego cars take to the capital's streets.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rush hour: Lego cars take to the capital’s streets.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br /></p> <p>Lego and cars comes together once again as the new <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/fuels/ferrari-model-lego-collection.html\">Shell V-Power Lego Collection </a>arrives in petrol stations across the land.

£40,276</strong><br /><strong>MPG 46.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 142mph</strong></p> <p>I have an antique mantel clock which I inherited from my grandmother. It sits in silence on a dusty shelf in our kitchen. My wife finds its resonant tick “depressing – like my life’s slipping away”. I know what she means, but I find that time-embalming tick and answering tock reassuring, soothing even. Either way, it’s not a sound you expect to hear in the cockpit of one of the most dynamic and technology-crammed vehicles on the road.</p> <p>The clock in the centre of the dashboard of <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/uk/models/macan/\">Porsche’s new Macan</a> has a very loud tick. And it’s odd to be put in mind of my old Scottish granny – non-driver, teetotaller, church-goer, giggler – as I contemplate the empty road ahead of me and the totally psyched 3-litre V6 258bhp diesel that’s about to thrust me down it faster than a school boy shovelling stolen sweets. And it’s great having her with me, in spirit, at least. It’s also strangely appropriate, because of all sports-car manufacturers, Porsche is endlessly alive to its history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f94ced6434a9f3ba60a15a09bf137d109a593a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/28/1414518745299/bb55b233-1f6d-46d8-9e40-4b302c928653-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Playing in the sand: the Macan goes through its paces.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing in the sand: the Macan goes through its paces.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Macan is Porsche’s seventh model series and its first to venture into the compact sports utility vehicle segment. The small SUV pitch is already crammed with serious playas – there’s Audi Q3, BMW’s X3 and Range Rover’s Evoque. So Porsche has determined its Macan will set new standards for performance, both on and off the road, not least because its award-winning traction management has produced one of the world’s most powerful drive systems. The Macan champions all that Porsche holds dear: eye-bulging acceleration and jowel-trembling braking coupled with extreme agility and optimum steering precision.</p> <p>For lovers of thrilling, tarmac-skimming roadsters, Porsche’s shameful secret is that its bestseller is the elephantine 4x4 Cayenne – a car so ugly my eyes sting and my nostrils water whenever one barges past me (hey… I didn’t realise how well-named it was). And, yes, at first sight, the Macan does seem to be a shrunken version of its older, uglier sister. But look again. Its neater proportions and broader profile accentuate its sporting elegance. The wraparound bonnet and sculpted haunches all point to an SUV that’s more sports car than 4x4.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc53cfacf62550576f6df9dc017054ba125417b3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/28/1414518968232/a876b577-b2db-41a4-bde2-6c65e46c3797-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the quietly opulent interior.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the quietly opulent interior.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Macan is built at Porsche’s Leipzig factory. The Germans have invested €500m in the plant and established an entirely new production line. They intend to make 50,000 every year. There are four models to tempt you: Macan, S, S Diesel and Turbo. I tested the S Diesel – the economical, long-distance runner of the pack. Its turbocharged engine accelerates to 62mph in 6.3 seconds and then on up to 143mph, yet it will do 46.3mpg. On the road the ease of its throttle matched by the savagery of the response is exhilarating. Standard equipment on all includes the super-smooth seven-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) transmission, ParkAssist, multi-function steering wheel, electronic tailgate, three-year warranty… I’d run out of space to list everything here.</p> <p>The Macan is named after the Indonesian for “tiger”, apparently.

<span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue velvet: the Qashqai now boasts new technology to smooth the ride.</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong>Price £18,265</strong><br /><strong>MPG up to 74.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 118mph</strong></p> <p>Back in 2006, when Nissan first dropped the “crossover” on to an unsuspecting motoring public, we were all snuffling around like misguided moles, happy in the knowledge that a family hatchback was just that: a boring car with four doors and a sensible boot. What fools we were!</p> <p>Nissan saw things very differently. They thought the family hatchback should be chunky and funky. They thought it should look like a 4x4 even though it was just for cities and school runs. They thought it should be elevated, durable, modern… And so they invented the <a href=\"http://www.nissan.co.uk/GB/en/vehicle/crossovers/new-qashqai.html\">Qashqai</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, Nissan also thought their new car had to be edgy, challenging and modern – designspeak for coyote ugly. That high back, the overbite, the unsettling dimensions: it all added up to make the crossover one of the most ungainly body shapes on the road.</p> <p>Despite that, or maybe because of that, the Qashqai has won friends all over the world. So many, in fact, that it’s totally outstripped all Nissan’s hopes and sold at twice the rate they expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ccf1c266be0e03abf2873a1741a6920413d4d2d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/22/1413974610181/c34eae93-9390-4c95-855d-568b2cf37ea7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the well-designed interior of the roomy new Qashqai.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the well-designed interior of the roomy new Qashqai.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Qashqai is an all-British affair. It’s designed in Paddington, its technical centre is in Cranfield, it’s marketed from Rickmansworth and it’s built in Sunderland. Along with the Note and the Juke (another assault on the eyeballs), Nissan Sunderland has now made more than 7m vehicles – 80% of which have been exported to 97 markets around the planet. The Qashqai is, in fact (dad-joke alert), a cashcow!</p> <p>So what’s this second-generation model like? Well, like the outgoing one, it is elevated, durable, modern – and still ugly. It now has a weirdly protruding nose and an assertive stance that makes it look aggressive. If the first was a crossover, then this has truly crossed over. It’s now more SUV than saloon.</p> <p>Qashqai Mk II is longer and wider than Mk I, which results in increased cabin space. But the five-door option with two extra seats in the boot is no longer offered. Power comes from a choice of four engines: 1.2- and 1.6-litre turbo petrols, plus 1.5- and 1.6-litre diesels. The diesel engines come from Nissan’s sister company, Renault. These days motor manufacturers hop in and out of bed with each other faster than suburban swingers. Economy is impressively frugal, especially in the 1.5dCi diesel, which will do an amazing 74.3 miles to the gallon.</p> <p>The Qashqai comes in three trim levels, all of which feature a generous range of smart in-car wizardry. Among the highlights are automatic headlamp-dipping, moving-object detection and low-speed collision avoidance.</p> <p>The car also boasts some very fancy new technology. “Active trace control torque vectoring” is a complicated way of saying the car brakes its wheels individually to help you stay in control around high-speed bends. “Body motion control” means the car constantly dabs the brakes to smooth out movement over bumps and rough roads. Both result in an extremely comfortable, composed and controlled ride.</p> <p>Inside, the Qashqai is a lot plusher than you would expect for a family workhorse. It’s practical and tough, yet has an unmistakable air of no corner having been cut in production. Considering all this, it comes as no surprise that <em>WhatCar?</em> named the Qashqai its car of the year for 2014.</p> <p>And best of all, you don’t have to look at it when you are driving…</p> <h2>Revving up on Regent Street</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7604d27647f0bd04f0bdd3bf29dfa969fb68386\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/22/1413975396140/ff094ce6-54a2-44db-a490-6fa27add89d7-460x276.png\" alt=\"Classic appeal: come and enjoy the vintage motors on Regent Street.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic appeal: come and enjoy the vintage motors on Regent Street.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Saturday 1 November, Regent Street, London W1 will see the return of the annual Regent Street Motor Show, the UK’s largest free-to-view motoring extravaganza. From Piccadilly Circus to Oxford Circus, the capital’s world-famous shopping street will be closed to through traffic, making way for hundreds of display cars that will be on show in the middle of the street, including vintage and performance cars, racing cars, family and eco cars. Featured in the Bonhams Veteran Car Zone, there will also be 100 veteran cars in the EFG International Concours d’Elegance which will all be taking part in the annual Bonhams London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, the next day. Now in its 10th year, the Regent Street Motor Show attracts a large number of manufacturers keen to display their newest products to an audience made up of car fanatics, tourists and shoppers alike. Last year saw a record 400,000 visitors come to the Mile of Style to peruse the huge amount of machinery on display. It’s a fantastic day out, totally free and a lot more fun than Christmas shopping, so why not go along and see for yourself? For more details, go to <a href=\"http://regentstreetmotorshow.com/\">regentstreetmotorshow.com</a></p> <h2>Don’t drink and drive</h2> <p>It’s the party season, it’s dark and the roads can be treacherously slippery – all the more reason therefore to be incredibly careful you don’t drink and drive. On top of that, new evidence suggests that one in five convicted drink drivers are caught the morning after, often due to unintentional drink driving. Just 3-4 drinks the night before could be enough to put you over the limit the next day. An award-winning pocket-sized breathalyser from Alcosense could be a real lifesaver. They are accurate, quick and easy to use and available from <a href=\"http://www.halfords.com/\">Halfords</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/\">Boots</a> nationwide. Disposable single-use tests cost £5.99 for a twin pack, and prices for the reusable kit start at £39.99.

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An ancient woman, bent over two sticks, shuffles up to me in the pretty market square of St-Fort-sur-Gironde, where we are on holiday. “<em>Monsieur, cette voiture est grosse</em>,” she croaks, indicating the giant <a href=\"http://www.jeep.co.uk/grand-cherokee/\">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> next to me. She hasn’t a tooth in her head and, though she seems to be smiling, I’m not sure she is. Maybe she thinks it is <em>gross</em>? I bluff it out: “<em>Oui</em>,” I say in fluent schoolboy-ese. “<em>C’est énorme… comme un éléphant</em>.” I’m very pleased with this, but all I get is more gum and a sour look. She shuffles off, leaving me feeling a little self-conscious.</p> <p>But that’s how I’ve been feeling all week. Compared to the rickety Renaults and crabby Citroëns puttering around these quiet roads, this mighty Jeep has felt rudely, almost defiantly healthy – like a buffed bodybuilder strutting past a bunch of anaemic goths. With its military-grade wheels, glinting seven-bar grille and imperious sneer, it’s been a tank parked on France’s prettiest lawns.</p> <p>On the plus side, it made mincemeat of the day-long drive slicing down France from top to bottom. The Jeep may have been designed for giving Mother Nature a good thrashing, but on France’s long A-roads, the SUV was a revelation. A host of driver aids meant I could flick on the adaptive cruise control and let the car take the strain. At one point the laser-activated speed system allowed me to cover more than 100 miles without touching either the brake or the throttle. The only problem was that half of Britain also seemed to be on the road. The French radio bleated the traffic news with worrying words like “<em>embouteillage</em>” and “<em>malheureusement</em>” jumping out at us. In the end we drove 650 miles in 12 hours, doing 30.1 miles to the gallon at an average speed of 54mph. Long journeys always turn me into a stats geek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c12c7cc6119b44fca6df7382a4238a88fdefbf92\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413382506852/e128e187-3eaa-4fac-b5fa-8a3c0f76fdce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: the comfortable interior – perfect for long journeys.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the comfortable interior – perfect for long journeys.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Grand Cherokee has been in production for 21 years and this is an update of the fourth-generation model. It now boasts an incredibly generous standard kit list and a slightly cleaner and leaner diesel engine. Climb inside and the Jeep has a functional layout that’s very easy to live with. There are silvery finishes to buttons and dials, and leather seats that wouldn’t be out of place in a gentlemen’s club. The dashboard is now digital and you can choose the info you want to display – for instance switching the speedo to kph when in France. Although, worryingly, the satnav still seemed to think we were in the UK and kept telling me to go the wrong way at roundabouts.</p> <p>Jeeps have a proud offroad heritage and there’s a rotary dial to adjust the suspension according to the terrain you encounter: the Selec-Terrain offers a choice of auto, snow, sport, sand/mud and rock. There’s an all-new eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox to replace the clunkier five-speed box and changes now are pretty slick and smooth. The posher models also come with air-suspension so the ride matches the velvety gear change.</p> <p>There are a couple of niggles. There are few storage cubbies up front and the door pockets are so narrow you skin your knuckles trying to retrieve your <em>péage</em> tickets. There is no left foot rest – irritating in an automatic. And the foot-operated parking brake rubs the side of your shin (a small detail, but these little things build up when you’re in the car for 12 hours straight).</p> <p>One sweet touch that caught my eye was the tiny image of an original 1945 Willys Jeep hidden in the lens of the front lights. Jeep really has covered a lot of miles since then…</p> <h2>Put Britain back in the driving seat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33e2096ddcb8c9cf72bec58d8207ef66ba0f8026\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413387512684/1187fa70-560c-4cf5-9035-858bc7526ad2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lorries on the A2 in Kent.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorries on the A2 in Kent. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain desperately needs more<a href=\"http://www.easyashgv.co.uk/britain-needs-hgv-drivers/\"> lorry drivers</a>. It has been publicised recently that the UK logistics industry is facing a major skills gap, leaving an estimated 30,000 driver vacancies to be filled. Although there are 285,000 HGV drivers in the UK, there are now more Polish registered vehicles going to mainland Europe from the UK, than there are UK registered vehicles. And yet, there are thousands of HGV driver jobs being advertised in the UK. Becoming an HGV driver is a fairly straightforward process and HGV training is available at locations across the UK. So, for those looking for work or fancying a career change, why not fill one of these vacancies and help the industry put the UK back in the driver’s seat.</p> <h2>Keeping cyclists safe</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da11608647f194ee857c431a81a4aa5bbb84b2a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/15/1413387302008/20a598ad-faf9-4c3a-98f3-274d2ea5aa8d-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"The evolution of cycling\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The evolution of cycling.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The RAC has just launched a new scheme offering <a href=\"http://www.rac.co.uk/insurance/personal-accident-cover/cycle-accident-insurance\">Personal Accident Insurance</a> cover for cyclists. It offers financial protection in the event of a serious injury or disability sustained during a road accident whilst cycling. It can help with hospital or recuperation costs, or loss of earnings whilst out of work. You can insure yourself only, or include your partner and children on your policy. Financial benefits depend on the level of cover; and can cover accidental death, permanent disability, hospitalisation and temporary disability. Personal Accident Insurance will cover you when you are cycling if you get hit by any type of vehicle while on the road whether for leisure or for work, while waiting at traffic signals or if you have to make a bicycle repair or repair a puncture at the side of the road.

First launched on a grateful nation in 1969, few other bikes are capable of reducing middle-aged people to such a state of nostalgic goo. In those early heady days it cost just £32, and the asymmetric wheels (20in and 16in), banana-shaped padded backrest, three-speed gear shift fixed to the top tube (remember the way the red pointer used to click through the gears?) and those awesome ape-hanger handlebars were enough to turn all of us into easy riders. Now it costs a lot more, but it’s gained three gears and a set of reliable V-brakes. It also comes with eye-catching flame decals. The backrest could do with being a little more generous, but other than that the Chopper is the same as the bike we always dreamed of waking up to on Christmas morning.

They offer two models – one for ladies in duck-egg blue and one for gents in racing green. Both are steel framed and fully comply with the EU’s cycling regulations. They’re blessed with V-brakes, a chrome bell, retro cream tyres, a comfy seat , posh leather handlebar grips and rubbery pedals. They chose the name Fred after discovering it’s a derogatory term used by serious cyclists to describe hopeless amateurs. But who wants to be a pro anyway? Wear tartan and a smug smile (<a href=\"http://fredsbicycles.co.uk\">fredsbicycles.co.uk</a>).</p> <h2><strong>Nolobi: £270, weight 9.8kg, gears 0</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"839959cff033d08e734ede40159e590a5154477c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412777796038/1ac90fcc-646e-483d-8c70-0df666674576-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nolobi bike\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nolobi bike</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nolobi is a bicycle company based in Hackney, London. Yes, hipsterville. So it’s beards, sleeve tattoos and a fixation with almond milk. But they do know their bikes. They build great-quality fixed-gear or single-speed bikes at reasonable rates and in an array of wacky colours. The bikes have featherweight aluminium frames. So they’re bright and light. I found it perfect for ducking and diving through the city’s choked streets. Shop online and if you don’t see what you want among the dozens of frame colours and wheel sets, you can pay another £20 and design your own. The bikes are sent out boxed but not quite fully assembled. If you aren’t handy with a spanner, your local bike shop will give it the once-over. Nolobi claims you’ll pay no more than £10-£15 for that. The bikes all come with a full one-year guarantee (<a href=\"http://nolobi.com\">nolobi.com</a>).</p> <h2><strong>Qwic N7.1: £1,895, weight 23.9kg, gears Shimano Nexus 7-speed hub</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e36a56a40515350fae3a8bf1939fc2d026940b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412777494619/a3e7482c-220e-4fb6-9a52-3eda6d84e761-460x316.jpeg\" alt=\"Qwic N7.1\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qwic N7.1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For cycling purists, electric bikes are unmentionable atrocities, the transport of choice for cheats, slobs and the feeble minded. But that’s only because the purists haven’t had a go on one. The new generation of electric bikes is clean, comfortable, low-maintenance and efficient. Qwic, for instance, is a company set up by two students of Holland’s Delft University of Technology. They’ve taken the traditional Dutch bike, with all its qualities of endurance and reliability, and attached a neat anti-friction hub motor driven by a battery fitted to the rear rack. It’ll do 15mph and assist you on the hills – you can choose the level of power it contributes. An overnight charge will give you about 60 miles. This model comes with leather handles and saddle, an enclosed chain, concealed wiring and integrated lights. It’s a sweat-saving ride you’ll grow to depend on (<a href=\"http://qwicgb.com\">qwicgb.com</a>).</p> <h2><strong>Norco Sight Alloy 7 1.5 650B: £2,000, weight 14.5kg, gears Shimano SLX 20-speed</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c63987f48f41d6e22986dbc62a3e47dc9d330f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412777714253/0dbc2035-b8af-4efc-b2e4-d0fa0c371a42-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Norco Sight Alloy 7 15 650B 2014 mountain bike\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norco Sight Alloy 7 15 650B 2014 mountain bike</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you’re new to mountain biking, you’ll find the slang bewildering. MTBers seem to spend a lot of time working on their “whips”, switching out their “650Bs” and grinding on their “granny rings”. This new model from Norco, for instance, has a soft rear end, a low BB and a slack head! In plain English that means it has full suspension, a low centre of gravity and a riding position that doesn’t tip you forward at an aggressive angle. The “front sus” will take the shoulder and wrist pain out of the lumps and bumps, while the “rear sus” (as oppose to “hardtail”) means your own rear end won’t end up black and blue. The bike has larger-size wheels (650Bs) which give superb grip – going up or down. The price tag is high, but Norco bikes boast an incredible spec. However this bike will not double as a city runaround. It’s too heavy and too big. Save it for wild weekends in the country (<a href=\"http://evanscycles.com\">evanscycles.com</a>).</p> <h2>Be safe, be seen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991c88442e9ef42919dd130b7aed34c052bdd1c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412777570100/453fa2b4-518e-4da1-a766-2e1a9c9de23b-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"Proviz Reflect 360 jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proviz Reflect 360 jacket</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the dark evenings comes the chance to really shine! Some cyclists are a bit slap dash about being visible – and some seem to go a bit overboard with flashing lights. Anybody who commutes up the Walworth Road in south London will have seen “helmet head” – a cyclist with at least 50 lights stuck all over his helmet. But there is an easier way to be seen. The <a href=\"http://www.provizsports.com/en_gb/hi-visibility-cycling/proviz-reflect360/proviz-reflective-cycling-jacket-high-visibility-cycling-jacket-reflect360\">REFLECT360 cycling jacket from Proviz</a> is the world’s first to be designed using a 100% reflective outer-shell. By day it looks a rather cool pearly grey, by night it comes alive. It’s been constructed with multiple vents – front, shoulder/back and under arm – so it isn’t too sweaty. Open the front zipper vents and you’ll get a decent “through-flow”. The jacket also has an inside chest pocket and large lower back pocket to store an extra layer or a map. It’s comfortable, warm, waterproof and astonisghingy visible – it’s the best £75 you’ll spend this winter.

He’s a good 17st and is built like a rugby prop. But last year he ran 10 marathons in 10 days and raised £34,000 for charity. “I just sort of go into a zone,” he says. “I shouldn’t be able to run like that, just look at me!” He lets out a great laugh. “The local paper is always phoning up to see if I’ve dropped dead yet.”</p> <p>It’s this singlemindedness that has enabled Dave to turn Wellhouse into the UK’s leading manufacturer of compact motorhomes in just over a decade. From its HQ near Huddersfield, the company turns out around 250 campervans a year, selling them all over the world.</p> <p>Wellhouse is like a dream factory for ugly vans. It takes a slab-sided, snub-nosed base vehicle and converts it into a miniature des-res on wheels. Saved from the coalface of white-van labour, these “glampervans” are then set free to roam the open road in pursuit of pleasure…</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8238fe0bde1a8f457c96571c3b518a6f3fdfe6a2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412163727574/111dc8a6-c3be-4e08-b65d-0061b97f083c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Space capsule: clever use of a sliding rear bench creates plenty of living room.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Space capsule: clever use of a sliding rear bench creates plenty of living room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hemingway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wellhouse’s latest project has been to convert Ford’s Terrier Custom. The result has met with universal appreciation and it has already won the coveted Campervan of the Year award. It’s easy to see why. Step into a campervan and you’ll see it all comes down to space management. If getting undressed feels more like a game of Twister, your holiday is doomed (actually, that doesn’t sound too bad…) But the Terrier is a proper Tardis thanks to two clever innovations. One is the front-opening clam roof that pops up directly above the living quarters, giving you headroom and plenty of ventilation.</p> <p>The second is the sliding rear bench. Move it forward and you create a vast storage dock at the back (I parked three bikes upright in there). Move it halfway back, put down the table, spin round the front seats and you have a dining area for five. Push the bench right back, flip it down and you have a comfortable double bed (if you can keep the kids out – they weren’t delighted with the fact that we had a bed while they camped). There is another small double in the roof, which turns the van into a posh, mobile bunkbed (we saw no reason to let the children know that).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbaeeb7fb69f1571b53bab3f80b3dc058a6a6ca1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412163826476/f79dd471-948f-4e57-9fd8-1ceb65da58d6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Raise the roof: the Wellhouse has a forward facing clam-opening roof.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raise the roof: the Wellhouse has a forward facing clam-opening roof.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hemingway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The interior is all leather, polished surfaces and recessed lighting. There are smart storage solutions and neat cubbies with locking lids everywhere. The sink, twin-burner hob, 42-litre fridge and portapotty are all very easy to use. A large solar panel on the roof keeps the battery charged when you can’t plug in on a campsite. One thing I particularly liked is that both side doors slide open – you can cook while looking out over the stove. On many vans, the business side is sealed shut.</p> <p>A word of warning: be prepared for waves of van envy. With its colour-coded elevating roof, 18in alloy wheels and twin bonnet stripes, this really is a stand-out vehicle and you’ll attract a lot of attention. I ended up feeling like a Wellhouse salesman.</p> <p>After a few days on a busy campsite, we spent the rest of the week parked in a field. The weather was perfect, we lit fires, sat up late and once even did some singing. And each night, we stretched out on our double bed in comfort. Who’d have thought a modified white van could be such a transport of delight?</p> <h2>Caravans of the future</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b76d4103e006ca4d26726bc39f2981fcfe2e7ff\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/1/1412163949953/cac8267f-2d62-4da6-a6f0-8edadb488d11-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caraviso caravan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ready to cruise: the Caravisio’s design is based on a posh yacht.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK’s biggest, most exciting, motorhome and caravanning event returns to the NEC from 14-19 October, and there’s even more to explore at this year’s national show! You’ll see all the new 2015 caravan, motorhome, holiday home, trailer tent and folding caravan models from the leading UK and European manufacturers and dealers – hot off the production line.

Plus, all the accessories you need for the year ahead including awnings, porches, caravan movers and satellite systems. One of the highlights will be the The Caravan of the Future, a stunning display utilising the Knaus Tabbert Caravisio prototype which makes its UK debut at the <a href=\"http://www.motorhomeandcaravanshow.co.uk/\">Motorhome &amp; Caravan Show</a> 2014. The Caravisio uses some of the most up-to-date technology available, including a fingerprint entry system, fully controllable air suspension and a frosted smart glass dual-paned sliding door, all of which are controlled by a smartphone app. It’s caravanning but not as we know it… Opening Times: 10am – 6pm. Tickets are £8 for adults, £7 for seniors and kids under 16 go free.

£152,900</strong><br /><strong>MPG 25.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 191mph</strong></p> <p>A tap on my shoulder: “Got any blow?” It’s my friend Byron, a large and garrulous fellow. I’m in my local Sainsbury’s and have no idea what he’s talking about.</p> <p>“Oh come on – some snow, some snort…” Total blank. “Oh for heaven’s sake, some cocaine?” He looks a bit cross. I look a bit mystified. There’s a long pause, then he bursts out laughing and indicates the new “Dragon red” <a href=\"http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_continental_gt_v8_s_convertible/\">Bentley GT V8 S Convertible</a> parked outside. “I just presumed you must have become a dealer,” he says.</p> <p>Well actually, no, I haven’t broken bad, but Byron does have a point. This arresting Bentley is a head-swivellingly stunning car. It arrives with quiet menace, like a killer whale drifting into a pool of wet-eyed baby seals. Its vast sculpted flanks, 20in double-spoke alloys with glinting brake callipers and little rimless headlights mean it oozes a sort of louche danger. It stands out in a crowd like a mafia don at a Women’s Institute craft evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-95cba84c-a25e-4216-8098-7b174576db7d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410347629572/5cad46df-c54e-48cd-b1a2-b767f749c838-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bentley rear view\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Blue Sky: the rear view of the new Conti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And that’s all before you even turn the engine on. Beneath the bulging bonnet idles a 4-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 engine that bangs out 521bhp. It’s so powerful it will push this car, which when loaded with luggage and four occupants weighs the best part of three tonnes, to a top speed of 191mph (although you do have to shut the roof at that speed – its coupé sister pips it by managing 192mph). Both cars rocket from zero to 60mph in 4.5 seconds. The power arrives in such an overwhelming and unstoppable flood – it sweeps over you like a waterfall over a rock shelf – that it makes you gasp. And the noise… It’s so deep, so shudderingly resonant, that you imagine they must have tuned into a 64ft organ pipe from the nearest cathedral.</p> <p>But Bentley has fallen out of favour as a ride of choice for the hard men of the street. It still has its fans among the footballing fraternity, minor European royalty and home county golfers, but the dealers and gangsters have moved on. As Marvin, a trainee journalist at the <em>Observer</em>, explained to me: “Today’s gangster has had to adapt. He doesn’t want hassle from the police, and a Bentley catches the eye. You are never pulled over in a Prius, and you can park a Smart car where you want.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f5578b00-2462-4440-9a45-d6545147381f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410347753050/1ef25d51-8507-4355-9a01-5f6b7e816aae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside story: comfort and speed\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: roof down and ready to go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether you are a gangster or a golfer, no one will dispute the sheer class of this luxury convertible. It delivers significant improvements in performance over the original Continental V8. It is faster, lower, more aerodynamic, more economical (well, relatively) and has tighter suspension and improved handling. Inside there is the expected wealth of leather and chrome detailing – the veneers are sanded and lacquered up to 18 times. There is a wonderful mix of the ancient (organ-stop air vents) and the modern (a multipurpose 8in infotainment touch screen). With the four-ply soft top neatly tucked into the secondary boot, the refinement of the drive is gobsmacking. Put the wind-deflector up and you can hurtle down the motorway without your partner’s hair doing its best Don King impression. The cabin’s ambience is so quiet you almost expect to hear the ice-on-crystal clink of a civilised cocktail party. And the strange thing is that the faster you go, the harder you push the car, the better the drive seems to get.</p> <p>I’ve heard older motorists talk of buying a “see-me-out” car – something safe and reliable to see out their driving days. This Bentley is more of six-weeks-to-live car: sell the house, buy one of these in red or yellow or sapphire and blast into the sunset in style. I often get asked: “What’s the best car you have ever driven?” And I never quite know what to say. Now I think I do…</p> <h2>Increasing Britain’s road-safety awareness</h2> <p>In recent years we have seen an increase in fraudulent insurance claims such as “crash for cash” which are costing the UK £2.1bn a year and adding approximately £50 to everyone’s insurance premium. Last year 183,000 road accidents were reported in the UK, and while Britain’s road safety standards are improving, there is still more we can do to make sure Britain’s drivers are acting responsibly and protecting themselves while out on the road. Many motorists consider themselves to be safe drivers, but it is often unexpected events that can catch us out. So, to offer you some advice on how best to cope in these situations and to help you stay safe on the roads is British racing driver and <em>Fifth Gear</em> presenter Tiff Needell has made a short film. It’s certainly worth a look.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk8dT-YaTsY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rk8dT-YaTsY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>How to stay safe on the road.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>The Cycle Show cranks up the excitement</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8ae35b22-eb80-476b-b952-2c942befcbd6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410349530049/e7294a22-20c6-4295-a7e7-255eaedbfbce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"cycle show\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bike stand: visitors talk to one of the Cycle Show’s many exhibitors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.cycleshow.co.uk\">The Cycle Show</a> at the NEC, Birmingham on Friday 26 to Sunday 28 September will be a gathering of the biggest road, mountain, electric, cyclocross and BMX cycling brands in the world, and visitors can get their hands on the latest products, test-ride bikes and speak to industry experts. This year, however, there’s even more going on: Britain’s most successful Olympian, Sir Chris Hoy, will attend on the Friday, featuring in a live question and answer session with ITV’s Tour de France reporter, Ned Boulting, and signing autographs on the Science in Sport stand. There’ll also be action-packed competitions including the Sam Pilgrim Big Air dirt-jumping contest and elite cyclocross races set to entertain everyone.</p> <p>In the first major dirt jumping competition to be staged in the UK since 2007, current World Champion Sam Pilgrim has invited an elite line-up of home-grown and international riders to compete over the three days of The Cycle Show on a specially designed course inside the NEC.</p> <p>If the jumping promises to be spectacular, then the cyclocross races on the Sunday are going to be fast and furious. Featuring both men’s and women’s races, this fast-growing discipline in cycling takes in tarmac and off-road elements to provide a real test for the riders.</p> <p>“These live competitions are only one part of the show though,” says Chris Holman, event director at organisers Upper Street Events. “There will be 250 stands and thousands of brands showcasing their latest bikes, kit, gadgets and plenty more. The Cycle Show has something to offer everyone.”</p> <p>Adult tickets are priced at £13 per person when booked in advance, while children aged 14 and under can attend for just £1 each with an accompanying adult. Concession prices are also available to students and those over 65, with all tickets including access to the competitions.

href=\"http://www.bathandwest.com/\">Royal Bath &amp; West</a> has its fair share of polka-dot wellies, pearl necklaces and exuberant quiffs on chubby young men wearing shirts with Liberty-print collars, but it’s also a showcase for the real countryside, a place of mud and blood. In the livestock pens, owners roll out bags and sleep next to their prize animals. The pigs are brushed lovingly like huge children, the cows are washed, the chickens stroked. Ernest, a glossy, 1.5 tonne, two-year-old Aberdeen Angus, is taken for an evening walk like a family pet. And the sheep, dozens of them, are speed-shorn. We watch, dumbstruck, as six sweating finalists compete for the Golden Shears – their target is 20 sheep in 20 minutes. “These guys are the sex gods of farming,” grins a bloke in a dirty boiler suit next to me.</p> <p>The Bath &amp; West was the perfect destination for me as I was driving a pick-up truck. If you were wondering who buys pick-ups, you haven’t been to an agricultural show in a while. They were thick on the ground. My <a href=\"http://www.ssangyonggb.co.uk/KorandoSports-Overview\">SsangYong Korando Sports</a>, with its gleaming metallic paint, leather seats, reversing camera, touch-screen satnav and great sound system, did stand out like a Chelsea tractor on working farm, but beneath its fashionable fripperies it’s as down and dirty as the best of them.</p> <p>You might think there wasn’t much demand for a pick-up, but it’s a sector that is growing fast and with the likes of the Toyota HiLux, Nissan Navara, Mitsubishi L200 and Isuzu D-Max slugging it out at the pricier end, there’s room for a cheaper model at the bottom of the ladder. At least, that’s what this Korean maker hopes.</p> <p>The Korando – a contraction of “Korea Can Do” – is a bizarre but strangely appealing amalgam of everything you might need in a car. It has a double cab which means it seats five with plenty of room, it has an enormous rear tray and folding tailgate, it has a go-anywhere low-range four-wheel drive and can handle motorway cruising without hesitation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b2c386c-f3db-402c-8984-cc61f78fd5d2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/2/1409674121532/bbaddc8d-2ad9-481a-b2ca-2bca0473665a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Interior of Korando pick-up\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the basic interior of the Korando pick-up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It will happily slot into your life whether you are a farmer, handyman, weekend camper, sports enthusiast or, in my case, parent retrieving two students and all their junk from university. It’ll tow a trailer/caravan/sailboat/horsebox as long as it weighs less than 2.7 tonnes. The only issue is parking. Not easy. Just ask the Audi driver in Bristol who took offence at me burying my tow-hook in the front of his car. Don’t mess with pick-up drivers, I snarled… Actually, I said sorry and gave him my number.</p> <p>One quirk of the Korando is that it has more sophisticated rear suspension than most of its pick-up buddies – this means it drives more comfortably on the road, but its dead-lift loads are limited to 643kg. Compromise, compromise… It comes with just one engine choice – a robust and throaty 149bhp 2-litre turbodiesel, but you can have a manual or an automatic.</p> <p>I tested the latter, which was smooth and responsive – a little too responsive in reverse, hence the Audi incident. The steering is astonishingly light, too. People moan about this: no road feel, they say. But who wants to feel the road? Sitting up high, controlling an adult-sized Tonka toy with nothing more than a finger on the steering wheel, is my idea of luxury.</p> <p>As with all SsangYongs (which means double dragon – everything seems to mean something in Korea), it comes with a confidence-inspiring five-year/unlimited mileage warranty. The car is unashamedly cheap, and some of the switchgear does feel basic, but dwelling on that misses the point. This pick-up is terrific value for money. And you don’t have to get it muddy.</p> <h2>Voyage of Discovery</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0df31ab1-10f0-411a-b6de-c6b6b063bfce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/3/1409746288708/4cd62a0f-9bbb-4177-87b1-5efeabf5cded-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Star performer: Land Rover's new Discovery Sport - ready for blast off.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star performer: Land Rover’s new Discovery Sport - ready for blast off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week sees the launch of the all-new Land Rover Discovery Sport.

/><strong>MPG 55.4</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 135mph</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>The author <a href=\"http://www.drrajpersaud.com/\">Dr Raj Persaud</a> tells a story about when he first started his training as a psychiatrist. He worked with a flamboyant consultant who used to diagnose his patients according to the cars they drove. After a session with a fraught businessman, for instance, he would sum up: “Drives a powerful Jaguar. Probably impotent.” Or after seeing an over-worked family man, he’d conclude: “Volvo owner. Must be paranoid.”</p> <p>Cars are an easy shorthand for labelling people and all of us have been guilty of judging others by what they drive. It’s fun, but ridiculously simplistic. Not least because cars all do essentially the same job – with varying degrees of panache and competence.</p> <p>And yet, despite knowing a car is just a car, I have been feeling sexy all this week and it’s down to the basic fact that I have been mooching round town in an Alfa Romeo. I’ve worn sunglasses and popped that second button on my shirt; I’ve sat with my arm resting on the warm chrome, the sun’s rays caressing the golden hairs of my forearm; I’ve… Sorry, where were we?</p> <p>The model that’s got me all worked up is the new <a href=\"http://www.alfaromeo.co.uk\">Giulietta</a> – one of the more eye-catching small vehicles you’ll see on the road today. The original, the Giulietta Sprint, first turned heads at the Turin Motor Show in 1954. It was the Italian marque’s first affordable sports car and made the fantasy of owning an actual Alfa Romeo a possibility for ordinary (and in my case, good-looking) motorists. Sixty years on and Giulietta is looking great for her age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-af630704-bebf-41ba-8f38-09c431222ada\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/27/1409136455491/e0b7e27e-e328-4276-9d70-6038612a97bd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alfa Romeo interior\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the plush interior with distinctive steering wheel.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reworked 2014 model comes with a new front grille, revised lights, a selection of cool wheel designs and a host of different colour choices. The changes are, as you would expect, discreet. Inside, Giulietta has been blessed with an all-singing “Uconnect” multimedia system, a redesigned and more intuitive dashboard, and a host of other cabin lifts and tweaks. Under the hood, every engine in the Giulietta range has benefitted from improved efficiencies and lower emissions, whether you opt for the 1.4 TB MultiAir or the 2.0 JTDM-2 150hp. It’s all good stuff, but (husky voice now) it doesn’t add up to more than some gentle flirting.</p> <p>To celebrate this 60th with style, Alfa has, therefore, also unveiled a Quadrifoglio Verde version. The special-edition car costs an extra 10 grand, but for that your Giulietta gets the full makeover. The Clover Leaf variant (doesn’t sound as appealing in English, does it, but Alfa has used the famous emblem on every one of its racing motors since the 1920s) is a high-performance car driven by the same, breathtaking 240hp, aluminium-block, direct-injection, turbo petrol engine that powers the deliriously good <a href=\"https://4c.alfaromeo.com/\">Alfa 4C </a>supercar. It has optimised transmission and traction systems which make it even snappier from 0-62mph (just 6 seconds) and customised air-intake and exhaust units to make the most of the car’s famously rorty engine noise.</p> <p>The icing on the cake, however, is its launch-control system. This is one of those pointless extras that manufacturers fit to their cars to make us buy them. And we, like lobotomised lemmings, happily oblige. The system is activated by pressing the brake and accelerator pedals to the floor, then squeezing the down-shift paddle on the steering wheel and releasing the brake – the system then takes over the traction control, power delivery and transmission upshifts to maximise acceleration. It’s exhilarating and effective. But by the end of the first week you’ll only do it when you’re bored, lonely, trying to scare the kids or maybe impress a new partner… Oh, I get it, now.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9398868","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2148211","internalContentCode":"445598884","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"What is it with these Alfa Romeos?

£31,945</strong><br /><strong>MPG up to 57.7</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 150mph</strong></p> <p>A few weeks before the Tour de France, Jaguar invited journalists to a ceremonial unveiling of this year’s Team Sky Tour bike, a joint venture between the British car maker which supplies Sky with its support vehicles and Pinarello, its bike builder.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.pinarello.com/en/bike-2015/road/dogma-f8\">Dogma F8</a> may be one of the most aerodynamic Tour bikes ever made, but it had a nightmarish Tour. Chris Froome’s crash and his team’s futile fight to salvage something from the race only served as a reminder that the bikes are irrelevant if the human beings aboard aren’t up to scratch.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.jaguar.co.uk/jaguar-range/xf/xf-models/xf-sportbrake-se.html\">Jaguar XF Sportbrake</a> which conveyed the <em>Observer</em> from Yorkshire to Paris via much of France shared the same sleek, smooth lines of the Dogma F8, but it had a far happier Tour. One judge of the Tour car is how the roadside gallery responds. A Citroën C5 I drove a few years ago incited old men to wind down their windows and wax patriotically lyrical. This Jaguar inspired gasps among both the French and British fans. We followed the race to the sound of “<em>Regardez, le</em> <em>Jaguar</em>” and “Ee up, lad, look at t’ Jag.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5d03acbb-1800-4d1e-8ee4-41be20aa05bc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/12/1407853652810/7a6d393e-8257-45ad-ad62-cd87ebede427-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris Froome and his Team Sky Procycling colleagues ride Buttertubs Pass\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Froome and his Team Sky Procycling colleagues ride Buttertubs Pass on Stage 1 of the 2014 Tour De France route, followed by their Jaguar support car. Photograph: Simon Wilkinson/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amusingly for any cycle-racing fan, the interior trim of the car is all carbon fibre, the material of choice for frames and wheels. More broadly, it’s all very James Bond – turn on the ignition and a joystick rises silently out of the vast console while the air vents ease gently open. The electronic boot closure is very slow – almost sinisterly so.</p> <p>That’s not to say Jaguar has achieved perfection here. There’s a price to pay for the swept-back lines, and it is levied mainly in the headroom. It’s disconcerting to have your eyeline above the top of the windscreen. The split-screen satnav was overcomplex and hard to interpret – not what you want in an item that should give the information you need at a glance.</p> <p>In terms of cargo space, it doesn’t match some of the larger estates, but makes up for it with a decent amount of backseat room and a rather neat hatch in the middle of the rear bench through which you can poke your skis or, as I did, the handlebars of the bike which came with me on Tour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-78c8cb18-be27-489a-a6c5-343eda7d10a7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/12/1407854279019/fa443bc7-58f0-4ac0-8a30-82cbb2c906ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sportbrake XF\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the perfect spot to watch the Tour de France from</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the joy of driving the Tour is its variety: many miles on the autoroute, lots of gentle grooving along well-maintained rural roads – how, in a country this large, is there barely a pothole in <em>la France profonde</em>? – and plenty of twists and turns in the mountains.</p> <p>With the cruise control on, the sheer silence lent autoroute driving an extracorporeal feel, while in the mountains it was far more stimulating. There aren’t many cars as long as this that you can throw about with such gay abandon on the hairpins of the Alps. It may have been down to the self-levelling air suspension or the dynamic stability control, but, whatever it was, it worked. Fortunately we didn’t need to test the Jaguar as intensely as some French colleagues did when they managed to get caught in front of the race leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/28/tour-de-france-2014-fans-vincenzo-nibali-video\">Vincenzo Nibali</a> on a key Pyrenean descent. This sort of thing is frowned upon, and they were banned from the race.</p> <p>There was a further test, however. One evening the Tour’s logistics team sent the caravan down a mountain on a steep and rocky road. This wasn’t what the Sportbrake was designed for and we took such care that an impatient colleague suggested on Twitter that we deserved to be lynched for holding up the convoy. And so the Jaguar achieved a first for a Tour press car – a complaint for being driven too carefully.</p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham\">theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham</a> for all William’s articles in one place.

And this weekend the planes will be performing in the skies over Ascot. You’ll have to be quick, though, as the event is this weekend – 17 and 18 August. Sorry not to give you more notice. But you are still in time for a tremendous day. The Red Bull Air Race World Championship features the world’s best race pilots, including Britain’s reigning two-time world champion Paul Bonhomme. Using the fastest, most agile and lightweight racing planes, pilots navigate a low-level aerial track made up of air-filled pylons 80ft high at speeds of up to 230mph. The competition this year is even more intense as all 12 pilots are using a standardised engine and propeller, intensifying the focus on pilot skill and precision flying. Often the course is held over water, but unusually at Ascot it is over the ground. Tickets are now available at <a href=\"http://www.redbullairrace.com\">redbullairrace.com</a>.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9372659","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-08-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2140795","internalContentCode":"444345804","internalRevision":"22","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"It may not have been Chris Froome’s year at the Tour de France, but at least his team car put in a terrific performance. <strong>William Fotheringham</strong> goes on tour in the new Jaguar XF Sportbrake","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Jaguar XF Sportbrake: car review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"William Fotheringham","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-08-17T05:59:07.452+01:00","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/12/1407853396676/Jaguar-XF-Sportbrake-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"53e9f313e4b0d17b25e06e0b","newspaperPageNumber":"50","internalStoryPackageCode":"49569","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-20T04:59:08Z","standfirst":"It may not have been Chris Froome’s year at the Tour de France, but at least his team car put in a terrific performance.

37.7<br />Top speed: 130mph</strong></p> <p>In the countryside an hour north of London, you’ll find the <a href=\"http://www.millbrook.co.uk/\">Millbrook Proving Ground</a>. It’s a private facility owned by General Motors and it’s crisscrossed by roads and tracks of every description. Its centrepiece is the speed bowl – a perfectly circular two-mile motorway. It is precisely banked so when driving at exactly 100mph you hardly have to touch the steering wheel. It’s great for setting endurance records – earlier this year a Vauxhall Astra covered 3,000 miles in 24 hours. An amazing feat, but surely one of the most pointless journeys ever made…</p> <p>I am lucky enough to be spinning round the bowl in the new <a href=\"https://newrangeroversport.landrover.com/gb/en/#explore/overview\">Range Rover Sport</a>. We’re cruising at a steady 100mph – “doing the ton” as my dad would say. The remarkable thing is that, even at this speed, the Sport feels so calm, composed and serene it’s almost boring. There is no sense of wrestling some fire-snorting beast that’s about to careen off the road in a fireball. Remember Steve Austin losing control in the <em>Six Million Dollar Man</em>: “She’s breaking up, I can’t hold her”? But we’re just sitting here chatting. We could be doing 40mph.</p> <p>The all-new Sport is the fastest, most agile and most technology-packed Range Rover that’s ever been made. The car was launched earlier this year by Daniel Craig. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhf18XfaL48\">film shows him hammering through Manhattan </a>before arriving unruffled at a secret destination to reveal the car to a bunch of gawping celebrities. Employing 007 as a delivery driver makes sense as it highlights Range Rover’s impeccable British credentials (it’s built in Solihull), while New York is the model’s best-selling city.</p> <p>After belting round the bowl, I head on to one of Millbrook’s fiendish off-road routes, plunging through waist-deep water and blasting up muddy inclines. The Sport is so capable, it makes even this seem easy. A bit like Bond, I suppose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4c9b75d7-1b33-48b7-b371-e20069a5c955\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406733616803/7f2dda70-e51c-4eac-b2c7-9b766d5517ad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Range Rover Sport interior\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Range Rover Sport’s electric power steering gives a lightness of touch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’m not a big fan of the aesthetics of the car. It has mean little headlamps which peer from its flat-fronted face like Clint Eastwood staring into the sun. It looks over-buffed, over-pumped, as if it’s been at the ’roids. But if you are after an imposing, assertive Alpha-car, you can call off the search – its road presence is undeniable and driving it makes you feel imperious. But that’s all just window dressing: what the Sport is really about is capability and functionality. It’s been designed to be driven hard on or off the road, all the while transporting you on a perfumed cloud of primped luxury. And in this department it has few equals.</p> <p>Its aluminium construction makes it half a tonne lighter than the outgoing model, which in turn means it is more efficient and responsive. All electric power steering gives a lightness of touch even when crashing through the undergrowth. There are several engines to choose between: from the bully-boy supercharged 5-litre 510PS V8 petrol to a more sensible 3-litre 258PS TDV6; a high-efficiency diesel hybrid is scheduled for later this year.</p> <p>I spent a day searching fruitlessly for any kind of limit to this car and in the end felt humbled to be sitting at its wheel. There really are some very clever people out there…</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9324630","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-08-03T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2133463","internalContentCode":"443208087","internalRevision":"18","publication":"The

hitchhiker. You don’t see them much any more. Remember those road junctions heading out of town with their parades of young people? Acne, backpacks, Iron Maiden T-shirts and cardboard signs saying, “The North” or “Anywhere” or, once, “Home”?</p> <p>Anyway, last week I spotted one. A smart fellow on the slip road out of Luton airport, with cabin luggage and thumb cocked. I pulled up, wondering, as you always did, if I’d regret it. Would he talk incessantly? Would he try to convert me to heavy metal? Or kill me and chop me up with a chef’s cleaver? No, he was Juergen from Berlin, a photographer whose shoulder bag had been nicked in arrivals. Welcome to Britain.</p> <p>“Been waiting long?” I say, because that’s what we always said. “No,” says Juergen, “not even a minute.” Maybe his luck is about to change. He tells me how he was robbed (put his bag down to buy a coffee – newbie), and we start talking about destinations. And journeys. And other rides. He once caught an all-nighter with a trucker who sang “Ace of Spades” over and over… Then we move on to the World Cup (he is German) and cars (we are men), and this new <a href=\"http://www.honda.co.uk/cars/civictourer/\">Honda Civic Tourer</a>.</p> <p>I explain that “tourer” is the posh word for an estate and that though Honda is Japanese, the Civic is a very British affair. It’s designed, developed and built in Swindon. I suspect Juergen thinks I am lying. To show him I am not making it up, I wow him with a few facts. “This Civic has the lightest engine in its class – a super-frugal 1.6 i-DTEC diesel with 74.3mpg and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a piffling 99g/km. That means no road tax and no congestion charge. It’s all part of Honda’s eco-driven Earth Dreams Technology range and…” Juergen looks slightly panicked. He peers at me, I notice his hand clutching the door handle. Maybe he thinks I am about to chop him up with the chef’s cleaver I’ve hidden in the boot…</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6ee3c432-dd43-4038-befa-68707c39ade8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/23/1406117228135/f585dc0d-e35b-4e50-b1b5-57acba79c03f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Honda Civic Tourer interior\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the new Civic has a calm and clean interior.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ad that accompanies this new car is called<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhBc1MprPHs\"> <em>Inner Beauty</em>.</a> It’s made by the team which brought us the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxy4n0UT82o\"><em>Hands</em></a> ad for Honda’s range last year. The ad takes you on a hyper-quick journey through the interior world of various objects – a golf ball, a suitcase, a guitar amp – to reveal the inner beauty of each, before tunnelling through the Civic.</p> <p>The car may not be your idea of beauty, but it is certainly practical and functional. It has a class-leading 624 litres of boot space, dozens of innovative safety features and driver aids and a set of Honda’s multifunctional “Magic” seats – all three back seats fold flush into the floor, which increases the loadbay to 1,668 litres. Other “magical” stuff includes the fact this is the world’s first production car to boast a rear adaptive damper system. A laser checks the road surface every 10 milliseconds and adjusts the suspension accordingly.</p> <p>We arrive in the capital and, to make up for the theft, I drop Juergen outside his hotel door. “Thanks for the ride,” he says. And then, nodding at the Honda: “You’re better at building cars than playing football…”</p> <h2>Ride round the world</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX1JaQXcJ_I\"                                                                        > <iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfX1JaQXcJ_I%3Fwmode%3Dopaque%26feature%3Doembed&wmode=opaque&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfX1JaQXcJ_I&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfX1JaQXcJ_I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=139985969e684f94bb8767e9d8b9fc2c&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Chris Evans explains how Ride25 works.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cycling enthusiasts and entrepreneurs John Readman and Rob Hamilton have set up Ride25. It’s aim is to riding around the world more accessible for everyday cyclists by splitting the route into 25 separate three-to-five day “tours”. You simply commit to one tour at a time – you could ride just one leg, or ride them all, back to back or months, even years apart. Most tours are about 4 days long with between 70 and 90 miles a day. It’s not just about the cycling though... it’s about the camaraderie, stunning landscapes, charity and sharing your day’s adventure over a meal and a few drinks in the evening. Here’s a video to explain what it’s all about.

£94,845</strong><br /><strong>MPG 135</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 155mph</strong></p> <p>The A832, which heads west from Inverness before skirting the edges of Loch Maree, is a favourite with vehicle manufacturers keen to show off the capabilities of their newest cars. But these ancient mountains have never seen anything like the <a href=\"http://www.bmw.co.uk/en_GB/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i8/2013/start.html\" title=\"\">BMW i8</a> – a revolutionary plug-in electric hybrid that’s set to change the way we see performance sports cars.</p> <p>A small group of us flew up to Inverness for a first drive in the car, which launches in the UK this week. Glancing out of the aeroplane as we landed we could see the test cars parked on the apron of the runway. Among the old island hoppers and abandoned prop planes on the outfield, the low-slung, curvaceous cars with their unique U-shaped laser lights looked surreal, as if they’d escaped from the set of the latest <em>Transformers</em> movie.</p> <p>Get closer and they look even more futuristic. The chassis is lightweight aluminium, while the “life module” is carbon. The dynamic material allows designers to make the body any shape they want to. Here, they went for a mass of overlapping contrasts: accents, lines, grooves and angles. You’ll rarely see a motor with more head-turning presence – either in the wilds of the Highlands or the mews of Chelsea. The car I drove was crisp white with bright blue accents. Its aerodynamic smoothness and carved air-flows meant it could have been a chunk of sculpted ice. And, foot down on the sweeping curves of the A832, the car had all the irresistible sweep and cutting-edge of a two-handed Mackenzie claymore.</p> <p>Inside the car, the space-age show continues. The “dihedral” doors swivel upwards at the touch of a button. There’s a digital dash, a separate multifunctional screen and head-up display. The cabin and controls feel fresh and modern without being intimidating. The back seats are tiddly and the boot pretty much nonexistent. What did you expect? It’s a car, not a miracle. Annoyingly the windows don’t drop flush into the door; for arm swingers like me that’s irritating. And getting in and out will be a challenge, if not impossible, if you have a bad back or are pregnant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fbd538d6-9956-441b-95d3-05a33f3277a4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/16/1405506810005/d03fbcde-0fb1-40ea-9549-aea67afdc14c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"BMW i8 doors open\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scissor doors with the modern yet unintimidating interior.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The car is what BMW is calling “born electric” – as opposed to being a traditional car with an electric engine shoehorned in. It certainly feels as if it has all four wheels firmly in the future. It’s aimed at <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/uk/models/911/\" title=\"\">Porsche 911</a> and <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/r8.html\" title=\"\">Audi R8</a> drivers, yet it only has a small 1.5-litre turbo three-cylinder engine. Remarkably, per litre this is the most powerful engine BMW has ever made. Coupled to the 129bhp electric motor that drives the front wheels, the i8 will do 135mpg and produce a laughable 49g/km while thrusting you from 0-62mph in 4.4 seconds. It has a range of 373 miles. It is scarcely believable.</p> <p>The car is packed with intelligent driver aids. You can remotely turn on the aircon with an app on your phone, for instance, or allow the car to use real-time traffic info to select the most efficient drive mode.</p> <p>Halfway through our test drive, we stopped at Gairloch to buy some tablet. “Is that your car, mister?” asked a freckly boy sucking on a lollipop. “No,” I said, “but I wish it was…”</p> <h2>Learning to drive?</h2> <p>If you are new to driving or have a child who has just passed that critical 17th birthday, you might want to have a look at a new app called <a href=\"http://www.midrive.com/\" title=\"\">miDrive</a>. It’s free and it’s estimated it could save you up to £300 on the overall cost of passing your test.</p> <p>The app helps learners find the best user-rated instructors in their area, helps them track their learning using GPS and provides access to a comprehensive library of digital learning materials. The service aims to reduce stress and hassle for the 750,000 people learning to drive each year, it also provides the UK’s 44,000 Approved Driving Instructors a platform for attracting new clients. For more information, go to <a href=\"http://www.midrive.com/\" title=\"\">miDrive</a>.</p> <h2>Driving abroad this summer?</h2> <p>With millions of families heading to the continent this summer, <a href=\"http://www.halfords.com/\" title=\"\">Halfords</a> is advising drivers to plan ahead and pack some glovebox essentials to ensure you don’t get caught out by variations in the motoring laws between countries. They’ve even put together all of the essentials in one handy bag. The Halfords Motoring Abroad Kit includes a warning triangle, first aid kit, headlamp beam adapters, GB sticker and high-vis waistcoat, all for £20 (usual price £29.99). Here’s what you will need for these countries:</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Glasses wearers are required to carry a spare pair in the car.<br />Motorists should disable the speed camera detector on their SatNavs before setting off as speed camera detectors are banned.<br />Etiquette dictates a flash of the lights before overtaking.<br />In some cities, cars parking on one way streets are required to park on the side of the road with even numbers on even days of the month; and on odd days, the side with odd numbers.</p> <h2>Portugal</h2> <p>It’s illegal to run out of fuel on Lisbon’s 25 de Abril bridge – make sure you top up.<br />Indicators are rarely used in Portugal, so take extra care on motorways, dual carriage ways, and when driving alongside parked cars.<br />Some motorways operate auto-tolls. You can buy pre-paid passes from most post offices or you can hire an electronic toll device that charges your credit card when you pass a toll.<br />Don’t forget to turn off speed camera alerts on your SatNav.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>It’s compulsory to carry an NF certified breathalyser in the car.<br />It is illegal to overtake a tram when passengers are alighting.<br />Most traffic lights go straight from green to red with no amber.<br />Children under 10 aren’t allowed to travel in the front seat without a special restraint.<br />Don’t forget to turn off speed camera alerts on your SatNav.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>In cities you must park on the same side of the road that you are driving on.<br />Once you commit to a decision stick to it – Italians manoeuvre quickly so hesitation can lead to an accident.<br />Don’t forget to turn off speed camera alerts on your SatNav.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>There is no speed limit on motorways unless visibility is less than 50 meters or it’s snowing, when it becomes 50kmh.<br />It’s illegal to drive while wearing headphones.<br />Tyres need to be changed to suit the season, it’s illegal to use summer tyres during winter months.<br />Traffic coming from the right has priority at junctions and crossroads.<br />In traffic jams cars feed in one at a time from alternating directions – so look both ways.</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9272702","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-07-20T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2127335","internalContentCode":"442237602","internalRevision":"13","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"A tiny engine is not the obvious way to power a sports car.

In&nbsp;fact,&nbsp;it is a&nbsp;bike manufacturer in Sheffield. But the brand's stratospheric rise over the past&nbsp;25 years means it is now a&nbsp;world away from the days when&nbsp;its founder, Dave Loughran, used to hawk frames out the back of&nbsp;his van to fellow racers at bike events around the country.</p><p>His firm is now the second largest – and the fastest growing – builder of bikes in Britain. Brompton is still&nbsp;hanging on to the top spot with its ingenious folding machines, but it&nbsp;can't be for long.</p><p>This bicycle, the <a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/CBPXSLPRIV13/planet-x-pro-carbon-sram-rival-road-bike\" title=\"\">Pro Carbon</a>, is Planet X's best seller and it has won a peloton's worth of cycle and rider awards. It boasts a full Toray T700 carbonfibre frame and it is powered by a&nbsp;specially tweaked SRAM Rival WiFli groupset which offers the type of energy-efficient, high-cadence cycling that sends you soaring up hills in the style of Alberto Contador (well, that's what he says anyway). The bike also features SRAM's unique Double Tap 10-speed gear system, which uses a single paddle for both up- and down-shifts – an elegant solution which keeps the bars neat and tidy. The wheels are lightweight FSA Team 30s, and it's all&nbsp;topped off with a smart Italian saddle by San Marco.</p><p>Hardened cyclists are a masochistic bunch, and sitting on a&nbsp;thin sliver of&nbsp;plastic as you bounce across a&nbsp;potholed road may sound about as much fun as an amateur vasectomy, but if that's your thing you'll love the&nbsp;stiff, responsive and speedy ride this bike offers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-441165312'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/2/1404299226430/Planet-X-chain-009.jpg' alt='Planet X chain' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Chain drive: the Pro Carbon is available with the SRAM Rival groupset or you can upgrade to a Shimano Ultegra.</figcaption></figure><p>The Pro Carbon is a high-end piece of kit that sums up Planet X's unusual approach to business. An approach which borders on the deranged: it offers terrific bikes at scarcely believable prices. The result of this, as the infectiously enthusiastic chief designer Brant Richards tells me, is that: \"We've never been busier. We just can't build the bikes fast enough.\"</p><p>It's hardly a surprise. The Pro Carbon sells for £999.99 – based on my calculations, I'd say it should be priced at no less than £1,400. I'm not an accountant, but does that sound like a sensible business model to you?</p><p>Oh but it is, says Brant. Ducking under the £1,000 barrier (by a&nbsp;single penny) is crucial. It means the bike scrapes below the bar set for the government's cycle-to-work scheme, which offers tax relief to encourage employees to commute by bike. The&nbsp;huge increase in sales this brings&nbsp;means Planet X can afford to keep offering its best-seller at such an&nbsp;artificially low price.</p><p>The Pro Carbon is the calibre of bike that serious riders would normally park lovingly in their shed and only venture out on when the sun is high and the tarmac dry. So&nbsp;to use it&nbsp;as a daily commute feels sacrilegious. But why save the best for Sundays? I spent a week gliding into town and it coped brilliantly. It turned my daily grind into a journey I looked forward to. In bike terms, a&nbsp;little luxury can go a long way.</p><h2>By the book</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-441165309'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/3/1404383778377/Haynes-manuals-011.jpg' alt='Haynes manuals' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Manual labour: the young people who have taken part in the first Haynes MechaniX programme. </figcaption></figure><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.haynes.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001\" title=\"\">Haynes Publishing</a>, publishers of the famous car manuals, are about to announce the first graduates of their inaugural <a href=\"http://www.create-space.net/\" title=\"\">Haynes MechaniX programme</a>.

And I don't think I've been asked it before. But last week, crawling along the A36, I&nbsp;found myself following a chopped-down, eccentrically modified Land-Rover-slash-beach-buggy. (It's a shame that the home-built vehicle is an increasingly rare sight on our roads. Remember those cars finished with a&nbsp;coat of house paint? Or the ones with a hand-cut sunroof sealed with a ring of tape? Or the boot nailed shut?) Anyway, emblazoned across the back of this buggy in foot-high letters was the question: \"How big is yours?\"</p><p>Normally I'd dodge the bullet with a&nbsp;saucy \"Who's asking?\" or maybe a&nbsp;\"Big enough!\" (It's taken me all week to think of that.) But this time I&nbsp;was in the blessed position of being able to yell: \"Yeah! Truly massive.\"</p><p>I presumed buggy man was talking about cars, obvs, and this new super-spacious SsangYong (think of the brand as a cut-price Kia) is half car, half minibus. It is a shoo-in to do awesome business as an airport hauler dragging passengers and luggage from arrivals halls to awful hotels. Cheap, reliable, no-nonsense – it's destined to be a&nbsp;minicab marvel. But for large families on a budget, or for those with a fear of packing light, there isn't a&nbsp;better option on the road.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440850441'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403696467001/Interior-of-the-Tursimo-009.jpg' alt='Interior of the Tursimo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Take control: the commanding position of the driver.</figcaption></figure><p>The Turismo's interior is incredibly flexible. It ranges from seating for seven adults with a&nbsp;decent boot through to two adults and 3,146 litres of load space. The car it replaces, the Rodius, was one of the most reviled and ridiculed cars of its generation. Uncomfortable, unsophisticated and comically ugly, it was the Marty Feldman of MPVs – a&nbsp;class of car already near the bottom of the beauty ladder – one rung ahead of dump trucks and mobility scooters. So, this new model couldn't really have failed to improve, but SsangYong has made the most of the opportunity.</p><p>The sheer scale of the car is hard to&nbsp;comprehend. It's more than 5m long and so high you can't touch the&nbsp;centre of the roof unless you stand on a door sill. Climb in and you&nbsp;will find four captain's chairs split by an aisle for you to walk down (only slightly crouched) to the&nbsp;triple bench seat at the back. With this amount of room to squander, the Koreans haven't bothered with any space-saving devices. The interior is simple and uncluttered. In party terms it's&nbsp;chairs around the dancefloor and&nbsp;we'll put the&nbsp;bar in the corner. That straightforwardness makes the Turismo likably accessible and usable.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440850442'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/25/1403696379767/aerial-view-of-the-Turism-009.jpg' alt='aerial view of the Turismo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Birds-eye view: a roof-down image of the interior of the Turismo showing how it seats seven in comfort.</figcaption></figure><p>Only a 2-litre diesel engine is available, but there are four trim levels: the top is matched to a&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz five-speed auto box and four-wheel drive. You couldn't argue that it's a&nbsp;driver's car: it's simply too large.

The Office for National Statistics released a report in February 2014 examining the impact of commuting patterns on people's levels of anxiety, happiness and satisfaction. For journeys of up to 30 minutes there was no effect on levels of happiness or anxiety for those who rode a motorcycle, moped or scooters to work. In contrast – for journeys between 15 and 30 minutes – those who walk, cycle, drive a car or take the bus – all experience an adverse increase in some or all of the factors measured. <a href=\"http://www.bennetts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bennetts</a> – the UK's No 1 bike insurance specialist – is going one step further and is investigating whether commuting by motorcycle or scooter has a positive effect on productivity levels in the workplace. Bennetts has launched a <a href=\"http://myvoice.co.uk/uc/admin/e1bf/?a=TO1\" title=\"\">short survey </a>and wants to know your thoughts (good or bad) on your daily commute. Everyone completing the survey will be entered into a prize draw – the winner will receive a <a href=\"http://Bikenation.co.uk\" title=\"\">Bikenation.co.uk</a> voucher worth £500, while five runners-up will each receive a voucher worth £100.

Taking place throughout the Grand Depart from 4-6 July 2014, the <a href=\"http://www.festivalofcycling.org\" title=\"\">Dare 2b Yorkshire Festival of Cycling</a> will be hosting high quality camping and glamping facilities, providing groups of all sizes a prime spot to see the Tour de France first hand. The Tour peloton will ride up the front drive and stop outside Harewood House for the Ceremonial Start of the 2014 edition of the race, which will be got underway by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.<br />The fun isn't limited to camping and viewing the race, however, with plenty more on-site activities to keep festival-goers entertained throughout the weekend. These include a range of sporting participation events such as duathlons, cycling time trials and trail runs (with the challenge to beat times set by Olympic gold and bronze medal-winning triathletes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee). A series of led rides will head out into the Yorkshire Dales so that fans can view the later stages of the race on both days, with selected routes led by Olympic silver medallist and local rider Lizzie Armitstead. Amongst a host of sporting and family entertainment over the weekend there will be a cycling cinema, an outdoors shopping expo, live music on various stages, literary and adventure talks, family action activities in a 2-acre Army &amp; RAF Activities Zone and big screens to view the rest of the Grand Depart, as well as the Football World Cup quarter finals, F1 British Grand Prix and Wimbledon in a bumper weekend of British sport.<br />Adding an even further sense of British-ness to the weekend will be an RAF Red Arrows fly-past just as the Tour passes through the grounds, a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight the following day featuring the rare sight of a WWII Spitfire, Hurricane, Dakota and a Lancaster, and a series of performances by the marching Band of The Corps of Royal Engineers through Harewood's historic grounds.</p><p>As well as Lizzie Armitstead, high profile guests will include 2006 Tour de France winner Oscar Pereiro, Ireland's former Tour, Giro and World Champion Stephen Roche and some principal guests who will see the race off just before midday on Saturday 5th July. \"The Yorkshire Festival of Cycling will be a great place to bring everyone together in celebration,\" said ambassador Alistair Brownlee; \"it's an opportunity to experience the beauty of one of Yorkshire's oldest estates and watch the race up close, but you can also have a go at these events yourself, meet like-minded people and get inspired to keep up a sport afterwards.\"</p><p>Day tickets start from £18, with a range of tailored packages available for camping and participation activities. Camping prices start from £14 per person per night.

With its pronounced wheel arches, star-centred alloys and exuberant twin exhausts it wouldn't look out of place in a Hot Wheels toy box. It's an Audi TT for show-offs. And it really is quick, too. In fact, it is the most powerful production car ever made by Peugeot. It's so responsive, the ooomph so immediate, that when you drive it, it's easy to imagine a giant child hovering above you, drool spilling from his toothless mouth as he zooms you across the parquet.</p><p>That huge toddler whizzed me down to the <a href=\"http://www.beaulieu.co.uk/attractions/national-motor-museum\" title=\"\">National Motor Museum</a> in Beaulieu – a place of misty-eyed pilgrimage for me, a place of eye-rolling boredom for my 12-year-old daughter, who failed to dodge the offer of a \"nice day out with Daddy\". For me and the Peugeot, however, it was the perfect destination as Beaulieu was all about speed and toys that weekend. Speed: it was celebrating the 50th anniversary of Donald Campbell achieving 403mph in his astounding <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqvpcX4HoCg\" title=\"\">Bluebird CN7 at Lake Eyre in 1964</a>. Toys: the museum had just broken the world record for the longest bumper-to-bumper line of toy cars. Volunteers took 10 hours to lay out 24,189 cars over 1.91km.</p><p>After all the autophilia it was a&nbsp;joy to climb into the RCZ R for a&nbsp;proper drive home. Peugeot launched the model in 2010 to mark its 200th anniversary (it started out in tools, hence the lion logo with its saw-like teeth). The RCZ's classic lines coupled with the seductive double-bubble rear window made it an instant hit and since then Peugeot has harnessed that impetus to try to change itself from a&nbsp;workaday car-maker to a&nbsp;want-one car-maker. And it's working:<a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/best-cars/driver-power/86713/driver-power-2014\" title=\"\"> <em>Auto Express</em> </a>named it the most-improved manufacturer and its RCZ was awarded the best sports car.</p><p>Now, to pipe more fondant on to its cake, the company has handed the RCZ over to <a href=\"http://www.peugeot-sport.com/en/home.html\" title=\"\">Peugeot Sport</a>, the Paris-based division which gave us, among other delights, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJfZo1HdW2Q\" title=\"\">908 Le Mans racer of 2011</a> and last summer's Pikes Peak winner. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZY7tFu38zc\" title=\"\">Sébastien Loeb drove the 12-mile course that climbs 5,000ft</a> with 156 hairpins in a heavily modified Peugeot 208 in a fraction over eight minutes. The video alone will have you reaching for a sick bag.</p><p>Peugeot Sport has now taken the  already amply endowed RCZ and boosted the turbocharged 1.6-litre petrol engine to create 267bhp –  40% more power than before. It's  also stiffer, has lowered suspension and upgraded brakes. For the extra five grand the race package costs you also get a matt black roof, special 19in wheels and a large rear spoiler.</p><p>To drive, the car is supple and eager – it's more of a cougar than a lion. The gearbox is incredibly flexible – you can hit 60mph while still in second, something I normally only do by mistake. It handles Britain's degraded roads well, especially as its stiff suspension has been set up for the smooth Tarmac of the continent. It's a&nbsp;thrilling yet economic performer, and those two opposites rarely come in a single package.</p><p>Should you buy one? Yes, of course. Will you buy one? No, of course not – especially as the un-tweaked RCZ is all the toy racer you need. But it's nice to think, one day, you just might.</p><h2>The journey to work</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440017072'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/19/1403174357253/Ride-to-work-011.jpg' alt='Ride to work' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pyramid selling: The Royal Signals, White Helmets Motorcycle Display Team join forces with motorbike insurance broker Carole Nash to promote Ride to Work Week 16-20 June.

Its models are called things like The Simple One, The Versatile One, The Hot Modder. The names refer to the nature of the various bikes but also read like a&nbsp;personality assessment of the future owner. This one is The Basic One. It's well made and durable, with some classy details – the chrome handles, the moulded grips and the off-centre quick release all have a quality feel to them. It has a seven-speed Shimano gear and sturdy aluminium fame, which means it will serve you well as a race-for-the-train job. As it's on the heavy side, you will start to feel it in your legs on a&nbsp;journey of more than several miles or if you live on a hill. But at this price, it's great value (<a href=\"http://www.evanscycles.com/\" title=\"\">evanscycles.com</a>).</p><h2><strong>Dahon Jifo</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £479</strong><br /><strong>Weight 9.4kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 7 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773338'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402060871792/Dahon-Jifo-009.jpg' alt='Dahon Jifo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The LA-based firm's pioneering solution to taking a&nbsp;rigid bike and sawing it in half so it can swivel into something you can carry in one hand has been credited with kick-starting the interest in folding bikes. Since 1982, Dahon has sold more than 2m bicycles and is now the undisputed world leader. All that expertise means the Jifo really does collapse in jiffy: it's just seven seconds from bike to bag. The bike is ultra-compact and very light, which makes it easy to carry once folded. It has a&nbsp;single gear, so it's only really suited for short hops around town, but the upright riding position combined with the tiny 16in wheels make it incredibly responsive to ride. A touch on the pedals and you are flying away from the lights. And don't let its small size put you off – it's as sturdy as a Shetland pony and will take riders up to 105kg in weight (<a href=\"http://wiggle.co.uk\" title=\"\">wiggle.co.uk</a>).</p><h2><strong>Brompton S2L</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £890</strong><br /><strong>Weight 10.9kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 15 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773339'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402062162895/Brompton-S2L-009.jpg' alt='Brompton S2L' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In the opening scene of W1A, Ian Fletcher (brilliantly played by Hugh Bonneville) fresh from delivering the Olympics in Twenty Twelve, is still struggling to fold his Brompton. The bike is now a metaphor for the new nightmare he faces as the BBC's head of values. A&nbsp;YouTube tutorial would have put him right – with the bike if not the Beeb. To ride, the Brompton is an instant hit. Light, agile and strangely addictive, the bike's upright position, long steering stem and super-high seat column means that as you hover above the tiny wheels you feel like a trick cyclist pulling off a clever manoeuvre. Once you have cracked the technique, it folds easily and more neatly than any other bike. In fact the folding becomes a pleasure in itself. Brompton is Britain's largest bike builder. It's as British as the BBC (<a href=\"http://brompton.com\" title=\"\">brompton.com</a>).</p><h2><strong>Airnimal Chameleon </strong></h2><p><strong>Price £1,999</strong><br /><strong>Weight 10kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 45 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773340'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402078696047/Airnimal-Chameleon-009.jpg' alt='Airnimal Chameleon' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The tiny wheels and shopper-style handlebars of the folding bike mean you have to ride upright, which more or less destroys any sense of aerodynamics. But Airnimal likes to think differently. It makes three models: the all-round Joey, the all-terrain Rhino and this one, the Chameleon. It is an extraordinary hybrid of race styling and folding technology. It has traditional drop handlebars, a 20-speed Shimano 105 groupset and carbon forks. It has skinny tyres and a pain-in-the-ass saddle. It weighs very little and you can ride it like an all-out race bike. Yet it will still fold neatly into the boot of your car. It's expensive and is aimed at serious cyclists. But if you travel for work and long to stretch your legs on unfamiliar roads after endless meetings, this would be an inspired solution (<a href=\"http://airnimal.eu\" title=\"\">airnimal.eu</a>).</p><h2><strong>Mando Footloose</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Price £3,349</strong><br /><strong>Weight 21.7kg</strong><br /><strong>The fold 3 seconds</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773341'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402078610734/Mando-Footloose-009.jpg' alt='Mando Footloose' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Mando Footloose is the world's first chainless electric folding bike. It may also be the world's only chainless electric folding bike. It looks like a cross between an exercise bike and an exhibit from an art gallery. There are no gears and there is virtually no resistance on the pedals, as if you are permanently cycling downhill. Pedalling doesn't drive the bike forward – it replenishes a battery through a&nbsp;tiny alternator which then generates electricity to power the automatically geared motor which is hidden inside the sculpted aluminium frame. It takes a while to get used to riding it – and it will take longer to get used to the baffled looks of passersby. Once you do, you'll be happy to sit back and let the bike do the work – it'll cruise at 15mph. But it's as heavy as a bag of golf clubs, so it'll take a strong back to heft it into the boot (<a href=\"http://justebikes.co.uk\" title=\"\">justebikes.co.uk</a>).</p><h2>Ninety years of Harley</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438773336'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401894395676/Harleys-on-the-Kings-Road-009.jpg' alt='Harleys on the King's Road' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Happy birthday Harley: 90 years old.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you forgot about the other type of two-wheeler… Europe's oldest and best-known Harley-Davidson dealership has just celebrated its 90th anniversary. It threw open the doors of its iconic King's Road showroom to passionate riders, vintage bike fans and customisation enthusiasts from across the country.</p><p>In 1924 FJ Warr opened his motor bicycle repair shop on London's&nbsp;King's Road. That same year he became an agent for the Harley-Davidson Motor Co of Milwaukee, USA, and Warr's Harley-Davidson was born. At that time the flagship of the Harley range was the Silent Gray Fellow, which would have cost a princely £85. Now, with a collection worth more than £2m, the Warr's Museum displays the largest number of historic Harleys this side of America. From the Second World War WL models which inspired the Harley used in 2011 movie <em>Captain America</em> to the Model K that shot to fame in the 50s when a young Elvis Presley posed for the May 1956 cover of The Enthusiast magazine, and later for his <em>Return of The Rocker</em> album cover, they are all here. For the first time Warr's has also revealed some of the unique and innovative custom bikes that have been designed and built by their in-house experts, Kings Road Customs.

Located at One Canada Square and Canada Square Park in Canary Wharf, London's prestigious business and leisure district will be transformed into an indoor and outdoor exhibition space, with organisers expecting more than 400,000 visitors. Motorexpo conveniently provides all those working in, living near and visiting Canary Wharf, plus car enthusiasts from further afield, a chance to see, touch and in many cases, test drive the cars on display. Now in its 19th year, the 2014 line-up includes a mouthwatering collection of high-end cars: the Porsche Cayman GTS, Lotus Evora Sports Racer, McLarens 650s and Aston Martin Vanquish Volante will all be on show as well as Bentley's new Continental GTV8 S. If that is not enough, there will be two F1 cars as well as electric cars and bikes. There's even the launch of the Luxury Mobile Office Company, a novel idea which makes it possible to work in style and comfort when travelling by car. Motorexpo is open daily between 10am and 6pm (11am to 5pm on Sunday 15 June) and it's free to enter.

But the strongman hasn't finished with us yet. He tears his leotard from his heaving frame and lies on the sawdust, making the sign of the cross in the air. Drums beat. A&nbsp;4x4 comes out of the darkness and drives towards his prone body. His father's at the wheel. Very Freudian. Do it, we scream. Yes! It drives right over him! Circus life, eh?

You get the fun of driving an SUV without the associated costs of piloting a huge technically capable land grabber. They are lighter, smaller, simpler, more efficient. They'll cope with tracks and trails, but not the wild. But, honestly, do you really need to?</p><p>The champion in this class is Nissan's Qashqai – Britain's bestselling car. To be a contender Suzuki knew it had to bring its A game. So, did it? Well, on first impression it's not much to look at. It's not particularly chunky or sporty. But climb in and it soon grows on you. Having spent a week in its company, I'd say it's one of the most likable, versatile and drivable cars I have driven in years.</p><p>Let's start where it hurts the most – your wallet. The SX4 is £2,500 cheaper than the Qashqai. It's available in a choice of four specifications: SZ3, SZ4, SZ-T and SZ5. It has a smooth DDiS 6-speed manual gearbox and can be in fuel-saving permanent 2WD or Allgrip four-wheel drive. There's also  a choice of sprightly petrol or frugal diesel engines. Step inside and you'll find a neatly styled, no-nonsense cabin. The simple dash is easy to use and the touchscreen infotainment and satnav are refreshingly straightforward. You also get a lot of standard kit: heated seats, reversing camera, keyless entry and a vast double sliding panoramic sunroof.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437998110'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/28/1401291154973/Sky-from-the-sun-roof-of--011.jpg' alt='Sky from the sun roof of the Suzuki SX4 S-Cross' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sky high: view from the 'likable, versatile, drivable' Suzuki SX4 S-Cross</figcaption></figure><p>I drove the 1.6-litre diesel, which was as silky as the circus acrobats' leotards. <a href=\"http://www.suzukicycles.org/history/history_01-loom-cyclemoto.shtml\" title=\"\">Michio Suzuki</a> first got into business in 1909 making silk looms – maybe it's still in the blood.

The first, and probably the most important, lesson we all learn as drivers is that no good can come from letting your attention wander. All we have to do is stare at the onrushing grey ribbon with a&nbsp;fixed, unwavering focus… but gosh, it can be hard can't it? And this new <a href=\"http://www.citroen.co.uk/new-cars/car-range/citroen-grand-c4-picasso/?campaignid=PPC_NCS&amp;advertiserid=google&amp;bannerid=grand_c4_picasso#/new-cars/car-range/citroen-grand-c4-picasso/\" title=\"\">C4 Grand Picasso</a> is so packed with digital thingumajigs and flashing screens and rubbery buttons, all encased in a vast wraparound panorama of glass, that looking at the car in front is almost the last thing on your mind.</p><p>A survey of 1,500 drivers from the <a href=\"http://www.iam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Advanced Motorists</a> (and these are people who take their driving seriously) found that a&nbsp;third said children were the biggest distraction to their driving. Close on the heels of those pesky kids were mobile phones (er, that's illegal, guys), changing radio stations, back-seat drivers, fiddling with the satnav, smoking, cuddling or kissing by a&nbsp;passenger (that would be distracting) and, <em>lastly</em>, attractive pedestrians… Just 14% of respondees admitted that, yes, very occasionally an attractive pedestrian had indeed caused their gaze to be dragged from the bumper of the car ahead.</p><p>Well, that's a straight lie, isn't it – 14%? Come on, must be closer to 100%. And how come no one mentioned arguing? The greatest  rows my wife and I have always seem to take place in the car.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336915'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400603570646/Citroen-interior-011.jpg' alt='Citroen interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: a view of driver's area, note the two large digital screens. </figcaption></figure><p>Anyway, if you <em>are</em> easily distracted, you are going to find Citroën's new MPV a nightmare. The Grand is the bigger, seven-seat version of the five-seat model which arrived on these shores at the end of last year, and there are signs of sibling rivalry bubbling up. Despite the fact that the Grand has just put rubber on British roads, it has already collected more awards than its little sister…</p><p>This new C4 Picasso is lighter, roomier and quicker than the outgoing version. It has much-enhanced aerodynamics and an optimised range of engines that, at the extreme end, will deliver CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of just 98g/km and a class-leading combined fuel economy of up to 74.3mpg. The drive is assured and engaging. For such a large vehicle, it feels supple, almost athletic.</p><p>If MPV means boring to you, this car will make you think again. It is bold and modern and quite unlike any other car you will sit in this year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336916'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400603982710/citroen-interior-2-011.jpg' alt='citroen interior 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Room in the back: the huge seating area of the Grand Picasso has been designed inspired by 'loft living'.</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside, handsome flowing lines work hard to disguise the box-on-wheels approach of most people carriers. It has unusual squinting headlamps which sit beneath glinting running lights and a futuristic grille which cleverly incorporates Citroën's double- chevron logo. The short bonnet steps up to a huge curving windscreen that sweeps over your head. I've visited aquariums with less glass.</p><p>Inside, the step-change in design continues. Citroën claims it was inspired by \"loft living\". That doesn't mean exposed brick and a steel beam through the centre. What it means… well, let's be honest – it doesn't really mean anything, does it? But, strangely, a loft really is what it feels like: you sit up high, surrounded by glass and nice design touches. There's a huge flat floorspace on which the three rows of large, comfortable seats can slide around. The dashboard is an appealing mixture of curves and angles, and there's a clever centrally mounted instrument binnacle. The digital screen can be configured any way you like – you choose from a&nbsp;range of themes and profiles. You can even upload your own picture as a sort of automotive desk top.</p><p>Spacious, versatile, efficient and with plenty of pizzazz… More than enough to concentrate the mind.</p><h2>Purple Harry cleans up</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438336917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/20/1400605104415/Alistair-and-Jonathon-Bro-003.jpg' alt='Alistair and Jonathon Brownlee' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Clean bikes go quicker: Jonny and Alistair Brownlee training near their home. Photograph: Levon Biss for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>It may sound like the kind of game Prince Harry plays late at night in his hotel room, but <a href=\"http://www.purpleharry.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Purple Harry</a> is in fact a new brand of bike cleaning accessories, scrubs, lubes and washes. Set up by Richard Hargreaves and Dean Perry in Derby three years ago, the pair appealed for investment using the website <a href=\"http://www.crowdcube.com/\" title=\"\">CrowdCube</a>. The final investors were none other than Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, the Olympic gold and bronze medal winning triathletes. The brothers had become interested in Purple Harry after trialling the products during their bike training, and they liked them so much they decided to support the business directly by becoming shareholders. Another chapter in the book of \"I liked the product so much I bought the company\" stories. Before starting up Purple Harry, Perry and Hargreaves worked in the logistics sector but spent much of their spare time cycling in Derbyshire dales. Witnessing the boom in popularity of cycling and the vast increase in people taking up the sport to keep fit, race and commute, the two decided to enter the cycling industry after finding a solution to an age old problem. How to reach the most inaccessible but crucial components of a bike, especially the rear cassette and drive train? After searching in vain for industrial grade dental floss the Eureka moment came when Perry was helping his daughter on a school project using pipe cleaners, and realised that a modified version could be ideal. They began working with a pipe cleaner manufacturer in Yorkshire which was keen to explore new ventures and 'Bike Floss' was born. The product sold well, so Purple Harry began branching out with a complementary range of non- aerosol cleaning sprays and chain lubricants, plus another simple but unique creation – a microfibre Wash and Polish Mitt. The products are all affordable and well made. Give them a shot.

It's still a family firm, run from its Milan workshop by Ugo's sons Danilo, Doriano and Cristiano.</p><p>De Rosa is one of the few bike builders which offers frames in a&nbsp;choice of steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon. Debating the pros and cons of each of these materials is the kind of thing that keeps passionate cyclists awake at night – that and their saddle sores. Dip into any bike website and the word \"stiffness\" occurs with such alarming regularity you'll be clearing your search history. Either way, \"structural rigidity\" is essential – a&nbsp;stiffer frame yields a better power transfer with each stroke (phnaar).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.i-ride.co.uk/2014-Idol-AthenaRed-Winds.aspx\" title=\"\">The Idol</a>, made of Super Hi-Modul carbon fibre, is both rigid and virtually weightless – the holy grail of bike building. Lift it with your finger and it's more hologram than bike. The mix of tube shapes blends aerodynamics with power and good looks with comfort. The slim rear stays feed into the top tube like the straining tendons of an athlete's neck. The gear and brake cables are all internally routed, which keeps the lines clean and uncluttered. The Idol comes with an 11-speed <a href=\"http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/index/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Campagnolo</a> Athena groupset. \"Oh, a Campag…\" muttered my neighbour reverentially. \"So mechanical…\"</p><p>I tested the Idol on the Surrey hills in last Sunday's London Cycle Sportive.

On the hills it turned me into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/mar/07/cycling.features\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>… Well, you've got to have an \"idol\".  But best of all, it was so comfortable. It's not often you climb off a bike after 100 miles with a bottom that isn't the bright pink of the Maglia Rosa.

Photograph: Matt Alexander</figcaption></figure><p>Keen cyclists from the mean streets of south London are a familiar sight on the leafy hills of Surrey, but last Sunday's second annual <a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/events/cycling/london-cycle-sportive\" title=\"\">FT London Cycle Sportive</a> turned the quite lanes into a busy cycle track. Torrential rain and gale-force winds threatened to de-rail the ride, I even checked the website before I left home in the vain hope that the event would be cancelled. But cyclists are a hardy bunch and it was clearly going to take more than rain and 30mph gusts to send us back to bed. In the end almost 2,300 turned out to tackle either the 48km, 100km or 100-mile distances of the sold-out sportive organised by Human Race in support of Access Sport. As I was on the De Rosa (reviewed above) it seemed the least I could do was to tackle the longer loop. We started at 7.30am in Dulwich Park, puzzled dog walkers wondering what was going on as hundreds whirred out of the gates, before climbing up towards Crystal Palace and then along the edge of the North Downs with amazing views over Kent and Surrey. As always it is a surprise just how quickly London goes green when you are on two wheels whisking along empty Sunday-morning roads. Eventually we returned through the suburbs and were rewarded with a victory lap of the Herne Hill velodrome – the one used in the 1948 London Olympics and now being restored by the <a href=\"http://www.hernehillvelodrome.com/friends/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. It was a great and testing day – competitive yet filled with camaraderie. The London Cycle Sportive is part of the Human Race Sportive Series. The next event is the Chiltern 100 on 1 June.

Called <em>Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist</em>, it explores the startling truth behind his remarkable descent from being among the finest athletes on earth to his tragic end in a sport riven by intrigue. Based on two years of extensive research and inspired by Matt Rendell's excellent book <em>The Death of Marco Pantani</em>, the film combines scintillating race archive with contemporary news footage, stylised reconstructions, and interviews with Pantani's friends, family, colleagues, and rivals, including Sir Bradley Wiggins, Evgeni Berzin and Greg LeMond. Known as Il Pirata thanks to his head scarf and gold hoop earrings, the film celebrates the rise of a man born in 1970 to a humble family in Cesanatico in northern Italy to become the most successful, flamboyant and popular cyclist of his era.&nbsp;In 1998, he won both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia – he was the last man to accomplish the titanic feat. Yet, less than six years later, he died alone, in a cheap hotel room – destroyed by the sport to which he had given so much. It's a sad, humbling film which shines a light on the extraordinary pressures the riders faced at the height of the doping scandals.

Probably not for a while, right?</p><p>Well, I've just spent 24 hours giving myself a full-throttle lesson in <em>sammã-sati</em> courtesy of Lotus's relaunched<a href=\"http://www.lotuscars.com/gb/our-cars/current-range/evora-sports-racer\" title=\"\"> Evora Sports Racer</a> – and there can be few vehicles better equipped to help you hurtle along the path to enlightenment. Lotus has a reputation as a maker of drivers' cars and for more than 60 years it has been a class-leading manufacturer of sports cars. The old maxim that its vehicles were Lots Of Trouble Usually Serious is now dead and buried.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435676555'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398855851907/Lotus-evora-interior-011.jpg' alt='Lotus evora interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the racing cockpit of the Evora.</figcaption></figure><p>Today, its vehicles put the divine act of driving front and centre, and in the Evora S that is almost to the exclusion of everything else. Rear visibility – none; rear seats – suitable for flatpacked children only; boot – baguette sized… But this mid-engined 3.5-litre V6 supercharged 2 plus 2 sports car delivers a phenomenal, memorable driving experience.</p><p>Slide into the bucket seat and wrap your fingers around the chunky steering wheel, gaze down its wide bonnet between the twin arches of the front wheels, fire up the engine, slot the gearstick into first, feel your foot pressure the throttle… When you are in the grip of a Lotus it's hard to think about anything else.</p><p>I drove it 560 miles up the spine of England and across the winding roads of Cumbria, past old hay barns and crumbling Wesleyan chapels, along sweeping lanes beneath menacing hills, and the live-in-the-moment joy of driving never ceased.</p><p>The Evora was unveiled at the 2008 British Motor Show and almost instantly became the benchmark for ride and handling. There were teething problems, however – build quality was erratic and there were complaints about the naturally aspirated V6 engine and clunky six-speed gearbox. Since then Lotus has dealt with its snagging list and now the Evora is a genuine contender to undercut a basic Porsche 911. It's as fast, as aggressive and as exhilarating to drive. If you were able to let rip on a track you'd also be able to sample the Evora's DPM (Dynamic Performance Management) traction and stability systems.</p><p>There are still a few irritants. The tiny back window coupled with the wide arches over the rear wheels, its \"love handles\", make this as hard  a car to park as you'll find. And flush, brushed-steel buttons on the dash are almost impossible to see while driving. But all these are quickly forgiven the moment you take to  the road and lose yourself in the everyday brilliance of mindful driving. Nirvana here we come.</p><h2>Time to write your car's AUTObiography</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435676556'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398856001967/Lucy-Burnford-006.jpg' alt='Lucy Burnford' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Full service history: Lucy Burnford. who hopes to transform the way we track our car's repairs.</figcaption></figure><p>Lucy Burnford, 34, bought a secondhand car from a seemingly reputable dealer for a good price. After a few weeks, something strange started happening to the fuel gauge. She took it to a specialist who diagnosed the problem and told her the car needed a host of urgent repairs. The quote was £3,500.</p><p>Had Lucy had access to all of the vehicle's history, it might well have flagged some urgent repairs advised to the previous owner that had not been addressed. Annoyingly, that information is \"out there\" somewhere – sitting redundant on a variety of dealer databases and garage records or as paperwork languishing in previous owners' drawers.</p><p>The experience led her to launch <a href=\"https://www.motoriety.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Motoriety.co.uk</a> – a \"digital glove compartment\" for anyone who owns a car. It enables them to document the full service history of their cars – adding an estimated 26% in value when they sell it. It has all sorts of administrative features to make life easier for motorists. There's a clever two-way rating and review service for garages and it alerts users to key dates – like when their car insurance and car tax needs renewing while saving them cash on insurance, servicing and repairs.</p><p>In order to launch Motoriety Lucy wound down a successful marketing agency she started and ran for 12 years, which represented luxury global food and drink brands such as Grey Goose vodka. Now, instead of going to dinners with Sir Elton John, she's attending automotive conferences across the UK and talking tech and API integration!</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow himn on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"8909161","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-04T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2084570","internalContentCode":"435674177","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"<p>A car for people who love to drive, the Lotus Evora has more in common with Buddhism than you would believe, says <strong>Martin Love</strong></p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Lotus Evora: car review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Love","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398855595531/Lotus-evora-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"57","internalStoryPackageCode":"49569","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-07T09:30:00Z","standfirst":"A car for people who love to drive, the Lotus Evora has more in common with Buddhism than you would believe","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T00:21:34Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/04/lotus-evora-car-review-martin-love","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/may/04/lotus-evora-car-review-martin-love","sectionName":"Technology","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"love","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Mazzzeraaaattti. Let's say it again… Mazzzeraaaattti. Yeah! The brand is so synonymous with smouldering Italian sexuality, with unhinged speed, with head-swivelling performance and with being a bit, er, suspect that it is impossible to even say the word without a frisson of expectation running through you. When it comes to passion, Lotharios always have a streak of unreliability running through them. And over the decades, Maserati has certainly had that.</p><p>The iconic brand celebrates its centenary this year and has launched bold plans for world domination. Two signings have been added to its team sheet: this Ghibli and next year the Levante, a luxury SUV. These are the cars which the Italians hope the Chinese and the Americans will be queuing up to buy. Maserati plans to sell 50,000 cars by 2015, which sounds unlikely when you consider last year's global sales of just 6,200.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.maserati.co.uk/maserati/uk/en/index/models/ghibli/ghibli-diesel.html\" title=\"\">Ghibli</a> is a four-door, five-seat sports car which Maserati hopes will barge aside top-end Audis, BMWs, Jags and Mercs. History and myth-making are so much a part of Maserati's appeal that it's worth noting this is the third Ghibli – there was a stunning two-door coupé in the 60s and a pig-ugly saloon in the 90s. (The <a href=\"http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wind/The-Ghibli.htm\" title=\"\">Ghibli</a> itself is a hot, dry wind in north Africa.) This third Ghibli boasts Maserati's first ever diesel engine. That tells you something: after 100 years, it has finally decided to offer a powerplant that doesn't drink like George Best on a bender. Join the party, guys! Rather incredibly for such a large and heavy car, the 3-litre turbocharged V6 will do 47.9 mpg and puts up a decent fight against emissions with just 158g of CO<sub>2 </sub>per km – not so much hot dry air as its namesake. For diehards there is also a twin-turbocharged 3-litre V6 petrol that is faster and more powerful but not as clean living – just 27.2 mpg.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435313179'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398262987003/Ghibli-interior-010.jpg' alt='Ghibli interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lovely Ghibli: the luxurious interior.</figcaption></figure><p>Few cars make an entrance like a&nbsp;Maserati does. It almost comes with a&nbsp;dress code – in this case acid-washed designer jeans and a&nbsp;reptile-skin Cavalli wasitcoat. A&nbsp;<em>Towie</em> tan and nails to match would be in order, too, to accessorise the blood-red leather interior. The car exudes presence, its gaping grill is ready to suck air in like a sprinter, the triple vents on each flank harking back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/17/maserati-250f-perfect-racing-machine\" title=\"\">its Fangio days</a> and racing pedigree. Passers-by gawp, other road users let you sweep ahead of them – this must be what Sophia Loren felt like as she marched across thronged piazzas. Some motorists weren't on message and saluted me with their middle finger. What did I care? I was a Maserati man for the week.</p><p>So: great looks, a lavish cabin and a fearsome engine roar. But there were a few things I wasn't prepared for. First, the price. It isn't crazy; it's less than 50 grand. Second, the drive. It isn't great. The automatic box – a&nbsp;much-praised eight-speed – was lumpy and unpredictable. I found it hard to engage drive and reverse. And the engine, though it responds to a heavy foot and makes mincemeat of the oppo if you drive as if you are fleeing the law, was worryingly shuddery at low speeds. The handling I found wearying if I did anything other than drive in a straight line.</p><p>A shame, really, as it's a great-looking car, though the allure of saying \"I drive a Maserati\" might fade faster than you think.</p><h2>Fancy go-karting?</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435313180'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398263255354/go-karting-006.jpg' alt='go-karting' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the hot seat: a teenage Michael Schumacher finds his kart a little uncomfortable (circa 1986). Photograph: Sutton</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.team-sport.co.uk/\" title=\"\">TeamSport</a>, Europe's biggest and most successful indoor go-kart operator has revamped a state-of-the-art track for London. The circuit, formerly known as the Raceway Docklands, now offers the finest indoor racing facilities for adrenaline junkies of all ages. This spectacular venue, only one tube stop from Canary Wharf, is set to follow in the footsteps of other TeamSport circuits which regularly attract celebrities such as One Direction, Simon Cowell, Ellie Goulding, Jamie Cullum, Liam Gallagher and diver Tom Daley. The track is 800m long, with exhilarating straights, plus challenging hairpin bends and banked turns. A brand new fleet of high-spec 270cc LPG karts can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, but at just two inches off the floor can feel like twice that! Every lap is recorded to an accuracy of 1/1000th of a second, with large screens and print-outs allowing drivers to compare their results against rivals – and check out technique.  Smart new racing suits and helmets are also part of the deal.  Friends, family and colleagues can take in the action from the bar or restaurant as they overlook the track. TeamSport is not just for fearless grown-ups. Little Lewis Hamiltons can also show off their racing skills in specially designed top-of-the-range 'cadet' karts. TeamSport now has 12 tracks across the UK and is set to double in size in the next three years.

The packed line-up so far is planned to include show-stopping arenas on the beach, a cliff-top demonstration course featuring racing cars and bikes, pier jumps, displays, live entertainment, fireworks and much more. Plus, there will be two parades each day as well as sideshows, trade stalls and places to eat. It'll be an unmissable family event – and all for free!

from £28,959</strong><br /><strong>MPG up to 65</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 155mph</strong></p><p>I have an old annual called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Motoring-Through-1900-1970-Russell-Brockbank/dp/0715351192\" title=\"\"><em>Motoring Through Punch</em></a> – it's a charming collection of cartoons (car-toons!) gathered from each decade of the past century. One of my favourites is from the 1930s. It shows an old lady wearing a flowery hat, white gloves and a bemused expression. She's gripping a steering wheel as if her life depends on it. The caption says: \"And do I have to keep hold of this thing?\"</p><p>I had the same feeling while driving <a href=\"http://www.infiniti.eu/\" title=\"\">Infiniti's</a> hyper-sophisticated new hybrid saloon, the Q50. Even the name sounds space-agey, as if it isn't a car at all but some dark star from a fathomless galaxy. It also has an extraordinary secret up its sleeve: it is the first car in the world to do away with the steering column. That round thing in your hands, formerly known as a steering wheel, now transfers your movements electronically to a high-response actuator which connects to the steering rack and thus causes your wheels to turn… that's the theory anyway.</p><p>It's not unheard of – aeronautics have used fly-by-wire technology for years. But drive-by-wire cars, in which mechanical linkages are replaced by electro-magnetic hocus-pocus, are pretty newfangled. And to sit gripping the steering wheel, knowing a little black box is going to interpret my wishes and pass them on to another black box, is unnerving. It's all too easy to imagine plunging down a country lane, eyes bulging, teeth bared, the limp steering wheel lying in your lap, your screams muted by the Q50's suede interior, like some video game gone rogue…</p><p>The technology is called <a href=\"http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/OVERVIEW/direct_adaptive_steering.html\" title=\"\">Direct Adaptive Steering</a> and the idea is that the digitally enhanced steering connection allows for better, sharper handling as it filters out all unwanted vibration. And it really works. Steering can hardly ever have felt lighter or more responsive. It does also raise the question, could the wheel be replaced with something else altogether? A&nbsp;banana-shaped joystick, maybe? Could you sit in the back and steer? Back-seat driving becomes a reality…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434015930'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396956523633/Q50-interior-007.jpg' alt='Q50 interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The futuristic cockpit of the Q50.</figcaption></figure><p>So much for the steering, what about the rest of the vehicle? Infiniti is the posh arm of Nissan, in the same way that Lexus is Chelsea to Toyota's Essex. The firm was only set up in 1989 and it makes just six high-performance yet discreet vehicles. The Q50 is the cheapest, starting at £29,000, while the QX70 is the most expensive, going for over £54,000.</p><p>The Q50 seems to be on a quest to be different – both inside and out it stands out from the crowd. Inside there are <em>three</em> touchscreens with a&nbsp;bewildering display of information and driver aids. The entertainment and online package looks more like the welcome screen of an iPad than anything you'd normally find in a&nbsp;car. Outside every panel is creased and pillowed, bulged  and curled with almost wilful disregard for the norm. It's as if the designers have looked elsewhere  and thought: \"If they curve that way, we'll go the other.\"</p><p>It is powered by a great surging 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine and an electric motor via a seven-speed automatic box. With its featherlight controls joyfully harnessing the heavyweight powerplant, it all feels dizzyingly effortless – as if it's found an antidote to gravity. Sitting in the futuristic cockpit, surrounded by blinking screens and holding your unchained steering wheel, it's easy to imagine you are in some sort of space fantasy… Is that George Clooney floating past the window?</p><h2>The Tweed Run</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-434015927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/8/1396962958774/Tweed-run-009.jpg' alt='Tweed run' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Tweed Run: where style meets cycling.</figcaption></figure><p><br />On Saturday 17 May people dressed in tweed and riding lovely old bicycles will be spreading their particular brand of charm and eccentricity through the streets of London as they take part in the 6th annual <a href=\"http://tweedrun.com\" title=\"\">Tweed Run</a>. It's a spectacular social bicycle ride through the capital's historic streets, and all the riders wear their best tweed 1920s and 30s cycling attire. If you possess such garments, it'll certainly be the place to be. Participants can expect a day of leisurely riding in the company of fellow ladies and gentlemen exceptionally dressed in plus-fours, Harris tweed jackets, merino wool team jerseys, silk cravats, bow ties and flat caps. It's been hailed as \"the metropolitan bicycle ride that brings sartorial elegance back to the bicycle.\" From penny-farthings to customised vintage two-wheelers and contemporary pedal-powered contraptions, prizes are awarded to the best-dressed, best moustaches and best vintage and decorated bicycles on the day.

£999<br /><strong>Gears</strong> Shimano 105<br /><strong>Frame</strong> Aluminium</p><p>Ooooooffff… The bike's wheel drops into a gaping hole then ricochets upwards, driving the hard saddle into my cowering rump. The thump travels through my shoulders, making my mouth snap shut and my head yank backwards… Ask any urban cyclist about the perils they face on the road and they'll list everything from homicidal taxi drivers to Boris-bike bozos and zoned-out pedestrians. But the number-one menace is the pothole.</p><p>The tarmac along stretches of my pock-marked commute looks like it is in the grip of some hellish Victorian contagion – it is scarred, ravaged, pustulant. It's so pitted, in fact, that as I rallycross over it, I no longer feel safe on my skinny-tyred road bike. The poor thing bucks around like a&nbsp;two-wheeled bronco, shaking the fillings from my teeth. These mean streets call for something much tougher.</p><p>For years, the only frames built to really cope with this sort of punishment are mountain bikes. In the wilds of Wales, fine, but you feel ridiculous pedalling around town on a ride with full suspension, jelly-mould tyres and handlebars as wide as steer horns. There is, however, another way: step forward the cyclocross bike, or \"gravel racer\". Developed as a rugged, off-road alternative, it is, depending on your point of view, either a pumped-up, redneck road bike or a slimmed-down, urbane mountain bike.</p><p>The sport of cyclocross, or CX, is aimed at adrenalin addicts who like to spend time with their hearts in their mouths – and their stomachs in their pants. Racers hurtle down terrifyingly narrow tracks, haul their bikes up hills and through streams. They scramble across boggy fields. Mud, in fact, is mandatory. It's tough stuff and CX bikes are unbreakable. They boast a rough-riding, take-no-prisoners geometry and that makes them ideal for urban badlands, so this new Lombard from Marin is all set to put the CX into the city. Oh, come on, that was hilarious…</p><p>Established in California in 1986, Marin is a brand that's long been synonymous with off-road biking. It's also long been synonymous with bearded hippies wearing bandanas who spent their days blasting down trails on home-modified bikes. But without those deranged pioneers off-roading wouldn't be what it is today.</p><p>The Lombard's frame is double-butted aluminium. It only comes in black, but a reflective strip along the top bar gives it depth and texture. It isn't lightweight, but that's not what you want here. Straddle the bike and it feels so grounded it's like sitting on a small heffer (I imagine). It's so well planted, in fact, that when you lift your feet you're surprised when it starts to tilt. The tapered carbon forks make it agile, and you get stout mixed-tread tyres to provide plenty of grip and comfort. Those tyres soak up potholes with relish. The drivetrain is a dependable Shimano 105, which switches from gear to gear with a neat, accurate click. The brakes are hydraulic discs which give you mighty stopping power whatever the terrain or the conditions.</p><p>Applied to the chronic impetigo of the capital's distressed roads, the Lombard is a&nbsp;soothing balm.</p><h2>Win tickets to the British Superbiking Championship with <br />I, Superbiker 4: The War for Four</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433688932'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/3/1396543156399/I-Superbike-009.jpg' alt='I Superbike' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Grabbing some air: Josh leaves the world behind.</figcaption></figure><p><br />The 2014 MCE Insurance <a href=\"http://www.britishsuperbike.com/\" title=\"\">British Superbiking Championship</a> kicks off at Brands Hatch on 18 April followed by 11 electrifying rounds across the nation over the next six months.

The <a href=\"http://www.haynesmotormuseum.com/\" title=\"\">Haynes International Motor Museum</a> officially relaunches on 16 April following a £5m investment, more than two years of work (and many more of planning). The new museum will be home to over 400 of the greatest cars from around the world, dating from 1885 to the present, among them you'll find Bentleys and Rolls-Royces from the 50s, a Ferrari 360, a huge variety of veteran, vintage and pre-war classics, motorsport cars through the ages, a $10m Duesenberg and many more, as well as brilliant collection of motorbikes. The Museum was first established in a sawmill in Sparkford (just outside Yeovil) in 1985 by John Haynes OBE with 33 cars. This new, rather more impressive, building boasts a long s-shaped glass double storey entry foyer and showcase. There are three new exhibition halls, two modernised halls, interactive displays and virtual reality interpretation. There is also the Haynes Motorland children's adventure play zone, a suite of function rooms, a café and museum shop. It makes for a great day out!

And now it has its very own cycling festival. For the second year running, <a href=\"http://pedalnorfolk.co.uk\" title=\"\">Pedal Norfolk</a> will be taking place on 3-5 May at Holkham Hall. The historic house and its stunning 25,000-acre estate make a perfect place to camp and cycle. The Olympic medallist Emma Pooley will be there to get riders under starter's orders and will be riding alongside participants of the eight sportives, before sharing insights into her career at a Q&amp;A on Saturday evening. You can choose between 20, 50 and 100-mile races and even a time trial. Do them all and you will clock up 250 miles over the weekend. There is also a host of entertainment for all ages with a new cyclocross and off-road trail, fantastic displays by Team Extreme's Zero Gravity BMX team, fun and games with Doctor Spinoff and his 22 whacky bicycle inventions and Highline Adventures's climbing wall, plus lots of \"have-a-go\" activities. With great food from Norfolk's Feast on the Street and many of the leading bike brands including Merida, SRAM, Cinelli and Shimano exhibiting, Pedal Norfolk is a great opportunity to see and test the latest equipment and meet their teams. More than that it is a great chance to get on your bike and spend a long weekend among like-minded cyclists.

Books and films were real, but the stories in them were made up. Cartoon characters were made up, of course, but one day we met an 8ft Percy Pig in Hyde Park. That really messed with her little blonde head.</p><p>That same sense of bafflement occurs in motorists when they consider the \"made-up\" mile-per- gallon figures published in glossy brochures about their new car's fuel consumption and the \"real\" figure they achieve out on the road, you know, when they are actually driving. The literature says 45mpg and you get half that, which is not so much \"made up\" as flamboyant fantasy.</p><p>By law, fuel economy is measured under controlled conditions using a&nbsp;standardised test. A vehicle's drive wheels are placed on a machine called a dynamometer that simulates the driving environment. It's a sort of hamster wheel for cars. Fuel burned and emissions produced are recorded under the watchful eye of the Vehicle Certification Agency. For years there have been dark tales of collusion between manufacturers and testers, of cars stripped of seats to make them lighter, of door seals taped shut for better aerodynamics. But the truth is far more mundane…  In the quest to find an affordable and repeatable tool to measure a car's thirst and provide a&nbsp;useful comparison across all models, almost every single real-world variable has been removed from the driving experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485138'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841025547/Volvo-V60-inside-011.jpg' alt='Volvo V60 inside' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the lavish interior of the new Volvo V60.</figcaption></figure><p>In reality, everything from road surface to wind resistance and even the weight of your passenger will make a difference. Then there's the optimum operating temperature of the engine and whether you are consuming extra energy by having the aircon on full blast. But the single greatest variable – and the one that is impossible to test for – is your driving style. It's estimated that this alters your car's efficiency by at least 50%.</p><p>The only consistent variable seems to be that none of the manufacturers' figures are accurate. Last year <em>What Car?</em> tested 240 different vehicles to find their \"True MPG\". Only three of those 240 met their official combined consumption figure – the Porsche Boxster, BMW's 320d and Suzuki's Swift. The worst was Porsche's  Cayenne GTS.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485139'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841524457/Volvo-rear-view-009.jpg' alt='Volvo rear view' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Keep up if you can: the new Volvo is one of the most fuel-efficient cars you can buy.</figcaption></figure><p>The car with the highest \"claimed\" figure is Volvo's V60 Plug-in Diesel Hybrid. Official testers signed off on a&nbsp;scarcely believable 155.2 miles to a single gallon of fuel. More astonishingly, it will do that while emitting just 49g of CO<sub>2</sub> per km. It's a&nbsp;proper luxury estate, too. Despite all its eco credentials it can be driven hard and fast. It'll hit 62mph in a&nbsp;shade under 7 seconds and tops out at 143mph. The V60 achieves all this by having two motors: a D5 2.4-litre diesel up front and a 69bhp electric motor mounted on the rear axle. It's much like a&nbsp;normal hybrid but this one can be plugged into the mains. When fully charged, which takes 4.5 hours on a standard plug, you can drive it as a purely electric car at up to 60mph for a range of 30 miles. There's no range anxiety as when the batteries are exhausted the diesel kicks in until you can next plug it in.</p><p>All this incredible technology comes at a whopping price – almost 50 grand. For half that you could buy an identical-looking V60 diesel which would still do a claimed 74mpg.</p><p>What was my mileage? I&nbsp;drove 400 miles and averaged close to 75mpg. Impressive, but hardly the promised 150. That's the real world for you.</p><h2>Calling all bikers</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433485140'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/26/1395841833541/Easy-riding-011.jpg' alt='Easy riding' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>On the road: spring is here!

Literally. Sixteen years after undergoing a triple bypass one of the arterial grafts had failed. The surgeon had told him the operation had been inevitable as he'd had three of the major risk factors – he'd been overweight, a smoker and from Glasgow. He now had to undergo a&nbsp;percutaneous coronary intervention. It sounded gruesome, but the brilliantly named Dr Savage said it would take two hours and he'd be out by the end of the day. My job was simply to chauffeur him in and out of <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bhi/\" title=\"\">Bristol's Heart Institute</a>. It was a surreal day. Rain and sunshine, fear and laughter, coffee and cake…</p><p>Then it got stranger. While waiting to pay in the carpark on the way home, the young woman in front of us said: \"Is that your car? That's my favourite Vauxhall. It's the new model, right?\" I gawped. Really? Do people have favourite Vauxhalls? It seemed bizarre. The car she was admiring was indeed the new model – it's the second-generation <a href=\"http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/new-insignia-range/index.html\" title=\"\">Insignia</a>, a big, five-seat family car which goes up against the likes of Ford's Mondeo and Mazda's 6. It's a loyal, workmanlike slogger, a Monday to Friday car. It's not a Saturday special. But before I could ask why she liked it, she drove off – in an ancient Astra.</p><p>I looked at the Insignia with new eyes and, yes, maybe she was on to something; there is much to admire in an understated way. It has a lovely silhouette – all long lines and grown-up curves. It's exactly the sort of vehicle you'd want to be ferried to hospital in: it feels safe and reliable. The car does have a few surprises up its sleeve, though. It is the most aerodynamic car in its class. Thanks to clever changes to the body design, the engineers have reduced the drag coefficient and boosted the car's slipperiness. There's even an active front air shutter that shunts air below the vehicle and causes less turbulence from its bottom. Maybe my dad could have one of those fitted, too…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431881920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394621307171/Vauxhall-interior-011.jpg' alt='Vauxhall interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the handsome interior with new infotainment system.</figcaption></figure><p>The Insignia is available as a&nbsp;hatchback, a saloon or an estate. If you opt for the full eco package and go for the 2-litre CDTi ecoFLEX diesel you'll also get class-leading CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 99g/km and a whopping 76.3mpg on the combined cycle. Dipping below the magic 100 barrier means no road tax and no congestion charge. For a car of this size, that seems almost nonsensical. The clever people in Vauxhall's PR department have calculated that the average UK driver covers 8,200 miles – this means you'd only have to visit the garage for a refill seven times a year.</p><p>Inside, everything has been made a lot simpler. The rash of buttons that used to spread across the old Insignia's central console like shingles has been replaced with a&nbsp;smart 8in infotainment display  and re-designed instrument cluster.</p><p>The diesel handles well, though it does sound a bit gruff at low speeds – but to achieve such a high economy sacrifices have to be made. The ride is firm and steady. It eats motorway miles with the same quiet determination a teenage boy demolishes a mountain of pasta.</p><p>The all-round frugality means the Insignia will find its way on to many a&nbsp;fleet manager's list. Will this Vauxhall find its way on to your dream wish list? No, but after a heart operation it offers all the excitement my father could cope with…</p><h2>Bournemouth revs up for a new Wheels Festival</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-431881917'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/12/1394622374122/Monster-truck-009.jpg' alt='Monster truck' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sun, sea and monster trucks: are you ready for Bournemouth's new Wheels Festival?</figcaption></figure><p>The seaside town's airshow is one of the best in the world, now it's hoping to do the same with a new Wheels show.

£23,995</strong><br /><strong>MPG 44.8</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 129mph</strong></p><p>We know a car is a substitute for all manner of personality defects. They're the six-cylinder seawall we erect to shore up our mounting insecurities. And nothing does that better than a big-engined convertible. The mighty rumble from its exhausts tells the world we are solvent, virile and, yes, awesome. We park next to miserable mid-size saloons in company carparks and watch the oppo limp away… pulverised. <em>Booyakasha</em>! So how come I always feel like a knob when I&nbsp;drop the top?</p><p>The reason, I think, is that people who purchase convertibles are overly concerned with their image. They buy ludicrous red sports cars made by Italians; they wear sunglasses in the shade; they put too much gel on their thinning hair. But one thing they don't do is buy <a href=\"https://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/cascada/overview.html\" title=\"\">Vauxhalls. So this Cascada</a>, a&nbsp;new convertible from the Luton-based company (which last year celebrated its 110th anniversary), comes prejudice-free. No one will think you're a&nbsp;right tool in the grip of an existential crisis. Leaving you free to savour the enduring joy of driving an unpretentious car with the roof down. I am convinced this pleasure goes right back to the days when our hairy-faced ancestors roared about in open chariots. Even then, though, there must have been jumped-up poseurs with chrome wagon wheels, flashing a thigh in a short leather tunic. Maybe in white, with tassels…</p><p>So, for those of you looking for an unassuming&nbsp;convertible, you'll find the Cascada is more than up to the job. It's a well-made and thoughtfully designed car. With the roof folded neatly away, it has all the clean functionality of an elegant yacht's tender. The roof is fabric – those folding hard-tops are so last year – and this softens and feminises the car. You can also have it in a stylishly contrasting colour. My test vehicle had a chocolate hood on a pale sapphire body – gorgeous.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430122849'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392742955670/cascada-drop-top-011.jpg' alt='cascada drop top' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Open Sesame!: the fabric folding top in action.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside, the dash is wrapped in stitched leather, the seats are deep and the controls are nibbed in quality rubbers. The only oversight is the crappy red dot-matrix display between the dials, which looks like it was nicked from a 70s microwave.</p><p>You could be forgiven for guessing the Cascada is nothing more than a roofless Insignia, but it has been designed from the chassis up and doesn't share a single panel with any other Vauxhall. The car comes in two trim levels, SE and Elite, and there's a range of engines to choose from. The two bestsellers will be the 1.4-litre petrol, which is slowish yet refined and pleasant, and the gutsier 168bhp 2-litre diesel.

(That's internal combustion engine, OK!) Now VW has put a toe in the water to test the temperature of consumer demand by launching its own purely electric car. It's a&nbsp;modified version of the all conquering Up – the supermini which drove off with the World Car of the Year title in 2012. The electrified <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/e-up-nf/home\" title=\"\">Up is called the e-Up</a> (said in a Yorkshire accent it sounds even better. Let's hope the next model is the e-Bah-gum).</p><p>Last week I travelled to Volkswagen's test centre in Milton Keynes to have a go in their smart little car. But before I tell you about it, we need to address the elephant in the room – The Price. This titchy car costs a staggering £24,250. The standard Up costs £8,265. There is a £5,000 \"incentive\" that the government will slip into your pocket if you buy any electric car, but even so you are still talking almost 20 grand. You'd have to spend more than £11,000 on fuel before you broke even. The e-Up's battery is guaranteed for eight years or 99,360 miles, but no one knows what sort of state the battery will even be in by then. Ergo, there is no possible economic case that would justify you splashing out on an e-Up! Which is a real shame as it's a terrific car. For comfort, economy, practicality and sheer joie de vivre it's one of the most forward-looking and transformative cars you'll see on the road.</p><p>Right, on with the drive. From the outside, the e-Up is identical to its non-electric sister. The difference is all in the drivetrain. Up front you now find a 81bhp electric motor, while the 230kg battery is cleverly built into the entire floor. This means there is no loss of space – you still have a usable boot and four good-sized seats. The extra weight also gives the car a&nbsp;lower centre of gravity which improves its handling – titchy cars can sometimes feel a bit skittery.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429559970'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/12/1392208746423/interior-of-VW-e-up-011.jpg' alt='interior of VW e up' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the interior of the car is almost identical to the standard Up.</figcaption></figure><p>Turn the key and the Up powers up. There's no sound, of course. Press the throttle and… hey, it drives just like your own car. Despite all its futuristic technology it is so intuitive and so much a member of the VW family that you feel instantly at home. By the time I'd hit the first of Milton Keynes's millions of roundabouts  – about 200 yards – I'd forgotten what was powering me. This chirpy little motor is smooth, unhesitating and effortless. It's swift, too. You'll soon be cruising on the motorway with the best of them – just not for very far. And that's the other but…</p><p>After The Price comes The Range. It's such an issue that it has spawned its own sub-category of anguish: \"range anxiety\". The Up has a range of 99 miles. It takes all night to fully charge and that 99 miles will cost you £2.80. Of course range is totally influenced by your driving style. On the open road I floored it and saw the needle shoot into the red faster than a&nbsp;teenager's bank account…</p><p>VW obviously wants its e-Up to be a massive sales hit. It won't be. I&nbsp;wouldn't be surprised if they don't shift a single unit, but that doesn't mean it isn't a success. For today's motorists, worried about the petrol running out, the e-Up is a harbinger of a carbon-free future.</p><h2>Launch of Auto Trader Magazine</h2><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWRrFgjgLtQ\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWRrFgjgLtQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.autotrader.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Auto Trader</a>, the UK's biggest motoring destination, has announced the return of <em>Auto Trader Magazine</em>, re-imagined for the digital era.

£16,395</strong><br /><strong>MPG 56.4mpg</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 119mph</strong></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.kia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Kia</a> introduced its new <a href=\"http://www.kia.co.uk/new-cars/range/mpvs-cars/new-carens.aspx\" title=\"\">Carens</a>, it seemed like a&nbsp;great idea to enlist the help of England's cricketers to get the marketing ball rolling. After all Kia is the headline sponsor of the <a href=\"http://www.kiaoval.com/\" title=\"\">Oval</a> and English cricket was on a bounce having just won the Ashes (was that a dream?). So Surrey's finest players donned pads and gloves and walked out on to the immaculate wicket to see how many could fit into Kia's mid-size seven-seat vehicle. The result was an impressive 13. But in the light of the drubbing we received Down Under last month, 13 now sounds like a typically miserable score.</p><p>Kia has never taken its eye off the ball, though. Last year it sold 72,090 new vehicles in the UK, up 10% on the year before, and one of its star performers is the Carens. Its tagline is: \"Putting the fun into functional\", which describes exactly what the new Carens is all about. When you boil it down, this MPV is a van-with-windows into which has been shoe-horned a choice of reassuringly responsive and economical engines <em>and</em> seven seats. Yet Carens has managed its transition from van to car brilliantly. Most car impersonators can't disguise those giveaways – the slab sides, the heavy-set bumpers, the unrefined drive – but Carens is properly convincing.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VbNjELZbjE\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VbNjELZbjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>This is the third generation and it not only replaces Carens No 2 but also Kia's ponderous Sedona. The new model is smaller outside yet somehow bigger inside. This, it seems, is the opposite of what happens to us as we get older: we feel less significant yet we get bigger and bigger with each passing lunch.</p><p>The Carens is a likable-looking car. Kia's head designer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schreyer\" title=\"\">Peter Schreyer</a>, has now rolled his distinctive \"<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-13/reinventions-how-kia-got-its-tiger-nose\" title=\"\">tiger's nose\" grill</a> out across the whole Kia fleet. There is nothing of the big cat about the Carens but, to me, it's just the right side of unassuming. It won't catch your eye at first, but look again and you'll notice the sculpted headlamps, its understated panelling and a sparing accent of chrome.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428962707'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/5/1391600628865/Kia-Carens-interior-011.jpg' alt='Kia Carens interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the light-filled interior of the third-generation Kia Carens.</figcaption></figure><p>It's certainly roomy, and though the 6th and 7th seats in the boot would be a little too snug in the long haul, they're just the job for a&nbsp;\"nominated driver\" ferrying friends safely home. There's plenty of fun and functionality to be found. The panoramic sun roof lets your passengers soak up the winter rays, while electric seats and mirrors, privacy glass, dynamic headlamps, automatic wipers and cruise control all make life more bearable. The passenger seat folds flat, as do the second and third rows, meaning the driver can sit in solitary splendour with the deck of a mini aircraft carrier stretched around them. The glove compartment is also a cool box and there's even a detachable torch for when you lose your keys in one of those dark, carpeted recesses that cars specialise in.</p><p>The car comes in three trim levels and a choice of either a 1.6-litre petrol or two versions of a 1.7-litre diesel. All three do their job with uncomplaining competence, but the lower-powered diesel offers the best compromise of power and efficiency.</p><p>Is it a driver's car? No. Why would it be? It's a family car and, as such, it knows exactly what it's doing. Which is more than can be said about English cricket.

from £30,980</strong><br /><strong>MPG up to 47.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed up to 155mph</strong></p><p>\"We call that the Waitrose stripe,\" said the red-trousered man in the carpark of Bath's posh supermarket. He had stopped next to me as I crouched to examine the long, pale graze that ran the length of the&nbsp;brand new <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/q7.html\" title=\"\">Audi Q7</a>. Water still dripped from its bumpers on to the clean concrete floor and, as far as I could tell, the wound to its polished flank was sickeningly fresh. The poor owner – what a&nbsp;nightmare, I&nbsp;thought. You nip to the shops and this happens. It would have wrecked my Christmas. My fellow shopper studied me for a while then bleeped open the door and I&nbsp;suddenly realised it was his car and not mine. He didn't seem bothered in the least. \"I did it on the way in,\" he said, rolling his eyes and puffing out his cheeks like Billy Bunter. \"Bloody hate shopping…\"</p><p>Poor Billy, I thought, in more ways than one. I also thought what a&nbsp;trial multistorey car parks are. Their malicious sharp-edged columns, knee-high kerbs and miserly turning circles must account for more scrapes and gouges, dings and dents on our cars than any other buildings in the land. Our cars probably wince as we turn their wheels on to the approach ramp.</p><p>In his colossal Audi, Billy would have had no chance. The reason I'd been inspecting his car, other than general empathy,  was that I&nbsp;had initially thought it was mine that had been \"striped\" and I'd panicked. I was driving the identically coloured Audi SUV parked in the next bay. But mine was a <a href=\"http://www.audi.co.uk/explore-models/explore-by-range/q5.html\" title=\"\">Q5</a>, the petite sister to Billy's big-boned Q7. To my mind it offers everything the top-of-the-range Q7 offers without the drawback of its size. In the Q7 you are always the fat man in Speedos squeezing up to the poolside bar, love handles bulging out. In a&nbsp;Q5 you are that same man after his gastric band has been fitted…</p><p>Audi has long excelled at sniffing out niches in the motoring market and have a suitable vehicle for every eventuality. But when it proposed the midsize SUV in 2008 it could not have known it would go on to become the brand's bestselling vehicle in America and the car leading the charge in China. A remodelled version is due to be launched at the end of this year to go on sale in 2015, but in the meantime there is still plenty of life left in this refreshed 2014 edition.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-427936251'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/24/1390566972805/Inside-the-Audi-Q5-011.jpg' alt='Inside the Audi Q5' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the refined interior of the new Audi Q5</figcaption></figure><p>In the flesh it's extremely well proportioned. Big enough to swallow my family of five plus dog and all Santa's presents for the Christmas journey home (the sliding rear benchseat is a neat touch), but also small enough to cope with city streets and, of course, multistoreys. The lack of stature means it drives much more like a car than many of its SUV rivals, but it still gives you that in-demand \"command\" position that today's drivers can't get enough of.</p><p>There is a range of engines to choose from, but the entry-level 2.0-litre TDI provides the ideal compromise between performance and economy. For my money, I'd stretch for the 3.0-litre SQ5 diesel which with Audi's legendary Quattro four-wheel-drive system (fitted to every model in the line up) develops 650Nm of torque, will do 0-62mph in 5.2 seconds yet has an official average fuel consumption of 41.5mpg and emissions of 179g/km. Cake? Eat it!</p><p>It's not often you get a chance to truly test a car's capabilities, but the appalling weather of early January meant the Audi and I faced floods, 80mph winds, lanes overwhelmed with mud, a vomiting dog (she ate the Christmas pudding) and that multistorey. And never once did Audi's sure-footed Q5 falter.</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a>.

He may have had a style bypass, but he was strong, eager and looking for work. He's the fourth in his family to arrive on these shores and judging by how his siblings Duster, Sandero and Sandero Stepway have got on, Logan could well be here for the long haul.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/vehicles/logan-mcv/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=logan%20mcv&amp;utm_campaign=Logan+MCV+-+Main&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;ORIGIN=cpc&amp;CAMPAIGN=google_Logan+MCV+-+Main&amp;gclid=CIDKyOu77rsCFY3LtAodIT0AIg\" title=\"\">Logan MCV</a> (Maximum Capacity Vehicle or, as we say over here, an \"estate\") is from Romania and is made by <a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dacia</a> – the unpretentious and workmanlike manufacturer that for the past dozen years has been Renault's ever-growing budget arm, playing the same role <a href=\"http://www.skoda.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Skoda</a> does for <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Volkswagen</a>. The problem is that Skodas have started to go up in the world. They're still cheap and colossally good value, but you could not rightly describe them as budget any more than you'd call <em>Made in Chelsea </em>a gritty reality show. This  has left the door open to <a href=\"http://www.renault.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Renault</a> which has sniffed out a rung at the bottom of the motoring ladder, so drivers who prioritise low-cost motoring over, say, performance, or handling, or a <em>radio</em>, have found a&nbsp;new champion.</p><p>Already a hit in mainland Europe, Romania's runaway success has finally arrived in the UK, so pennywise Brits now have the chance to both drive <em>and</em> save money.</p><p>The Logan MCV is the least expensive new estate car on the road. In its entry-level \"Access\" trim, you can drive one away for £6,995. I poshed up and opted for the range-topping \"Laureate\", which at £10,795 is still more than three grand cheaper than the equivalent vehicle from Skoda or Seat. It comes with a touchscreen satnav, air-con, electric mirrors, Bluetooth and cruise control.</p><p>But don't let this soft packaging sucker you into thinking you are driving anything other than a&nbsp;utilitarian toiler. It's so basic, the plastics so tough, the panelling so unrefined, that it feels indestructible – it will elicit a grudging respect from you in the way a Greggs' sarnie does. The car's two other selling points are its colossal rear (only <a href=\"http://www.volvocars.com/uk/All-Cars/Volvo-V70/pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Volvo's V70</a> has a&nbsp;bigger loading bay) and its fuel-saving consumption (the 1.5-litre diesel does a claimed 74.3mpg.)</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426584911'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389181486317/dacia-interior-008.jpg' alt='dacia interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Keep it simple: the basic but user-friendly interior.</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside the car is fairly anonymous. You could probably park it anywhere as the wardens wouldn't notice it. You will also be immune from road rage. When my wife \"accidentally\" jumped a long queue no one batted an eyelid. As a&nbsp;Dacia driver she was clearly one of the people. Had she been in a Porsche there would have been an outcry.</p><p>Inside it's fine. It's a Travelodge on wheels. You know it's cheap, but it never pretended it wasn't. There's no central locking for the boot. The drive is straight out of the 70s. It pitches and rolls on corners, the acceleration is feeble, the engine rattles and the thin gearstick offers as much feedback as a spirtle in a pan of semi-set porridge. But what did you expect for less than seven grand?</p><p>I&nbsp;wasn't heartbroken to give the Logan back. But I am sure its keen price and its honest diligence means it'll find plenty of work over here.</p><h2>Cars in the sun</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426584909'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389192844180/Madeira-cars-008.jpg' alt='Madeira cars' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Streets lined with cars: last year's classic at Madeira.</figcaption></figure><p>If looking at lovely old cars and staying in a beautiful hotel is your idea of fun, you might want to check out <a href=\"http://www.reidspalace.com\" title=\"\">Reid's Palace</a> in Madeira which is hosting its third annual Classic Auto Show from 10–11 May 2014.

I asked her not because I thought she'd say something insightful, but because we were waiting for our teenage daughter to get ready so I knew we had time to fill. \"Um…\" Juliet said. \"Well, I'd say I&nbsp;feel nothing. Actually that's not true, I&nbsp;feel bored because I suspect you are about to start blathering on about the minutiae of its design or its engine or something.\" She's right, I was. But her answer is also interesting because it tallies perfectly with some research conducted by Volvo into the way we feel about cars.</p><p>By wiring up a few hapless human guinea pigs and monitoring brainwave activity in the pre-frontal cortex while they gazed at cars, Volvo's scientists found that men experienced more emotion while looking at a beautiful car than they did looking at an image of a crying child. Brilliant! Well done, guys. You knew that was coming, didn't you, but it still takes my breath away that men really are from Mars – or at least some distant place where cars and football and beer and cars matter more than bawling infants. Women, of course, the balanced emotive sensitive beings that they are, felt the opposite. Though I didn't tell Juliet. I punished her with some interesting chat about the 308's new emergency collision braking system.</p><p>A parallel survey revealed that men found the car's \"face\" to be its most appealing feature. While women – those who responded at all – were drawn to how the rear of a car looked. Go figure!</p><p>I didn't have wires sprouting from my scalp, but I can tell you I&nbsp;felt sensations of pleasure when I looked at the new Peugeot 308 outside our house. It's a great looker – from both back and front. It has taken inspiration from the elegant 208, although this is much more than a pumped-up supermini. Tapering LED headlamps swirl from the aerodynamic face round to its muscular flanks. The rear end is more upright than before and the back panels feature a triple wave which flows down from the back door over the enhanced wheel arch. I felt \"happy to very happy\" when I looked at these.</p><p>The new 308 is the first model in the company's history to retain the name of its predecessor. Usually each new Peugeot has its number bumped up. So in theory this should be the 309. I suppose it had to stop somewhere, but there is no sense that this new car is standing still. It's bigger, safer, smoother and more efficient than the outgoing 308. And, more importantly, it shows the direction Peugeot sees itself going – upmarket. It's taking on the Germans. VW's Golf and Audi's A3 have set the standard for this group for years, but the 308 wants a bit of the action and has been designed to be if not class-leading then definitely up there on the swots' table.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426132637'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/1/2/1388666305608/Peugeot-308-interior-008.jpg' alt='Peugeot 308 interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the refined cockpit with panoramic windscreen.

Much of this comes from the new i-Cockpit which features a compact integrated steering wheel, a head-up instrument panel and a large 9.7in touch screen. Scroll from menu to menu and the unit makes a barely audible whooshing sound which adds to the sense of hi-tech. The console has numerous connected services, too. It'll tell you where nearby parking spaces are or fuel prices at the nearest station.</p><p>The car is 140kg lighter than the old 308, and a range of eight engines are on offer. The highlight will be the diesel 1.6 HDi (which arrives this summer). It'll churn out 120bhp and just 82g/km CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Finally, our daughter arrived. \"What do you feel about this car?\" I&nbsp;asked. \"Eh?

£8,399</strong><br /><strong>MPG 48.7</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 108mph</strong></p><p>The MG is back, sort of. No other two letters conjure up so immediately an image of fun, affordable, sporty motoring. Still based in Longbridge, but now owned by the massive <a href=\"http://www.saicmotor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chinese manufacturer SAIC</a>, the marque tentatively made its reappearance on British roads last year with the unspeakably dull <a href=\"http://mg.co.uk/mg6/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=MG6&amp;utm_term=mg6%20-e&amp;atlassearch=paid\" title=\"\">MG6</a> – a bargain-basement Mondeo wannabe which managed to sell a paltry 300 motors. Where's the fun in that? Now we have the more promising <a href=\"http://mg.co.uk/mg3/\" title=\"\">MG3</a> – which is half the size but at least twice as good.</p><p>With images of sportsters, scarves and blonde hair floating before my eyes I ring my friend Guy to tell him MG's news (I did have other things to say to him, too, <em>actually</em>). He was once the proud owner of an MG roadster back in the 80s. It was an unhealthy sludge colour with brown seats and a beige fabric roof, but we all loved it. For a couple of summers it was our trump card in the dating game. Who am I kidding? It was our only card.</p><p>\"Oh no,\" Guy groans. \"That car was a pile of rusting crap that cost me a&nbsp;fortune.\" Would he like to come for a test drive in MG's new entry-level hatchback? There's a pause. And then: \"No, of course not.\"</p><p>So I'm on my own. But the MG3 still wants to have fun. It's not glamorous in the way you remember an MG being, and to the young motorist who it's aimed at, the letters now mean something quite different from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars\" title=\"\">Morris Garages</a>. My teenage son informs me they now stand for Morning Glory. As in: \"Bruv, man's mum came in and almost saw the MG – it was peak!\" Nevertheless, the  MG3 is a sharp-looking car. It's mostly built in China, with the final assembly taking place in the UK, but it is styled and designed in Longbridge, where the company employs about 400 engineers. You can still fly the flag if you want to.</p><p>The car has clean lines and a&nbsp;pleasing, bold face. But it's hard for a vehicle to stand out in the super-competitive supermini class. Squint and it looks a bit Fabia, or maybe a bit Yaris, oh and definitely a&nbsp;bit Fiesta. MG has got round this by offering more personalisation options than really make sense. They claim the car has over a million possible permutations. The graphic packs cost up to £225 and you can put emoticon stickers on the roof, or a&nbsp;decal that looks like a tyre burnout. My test car seemed to be covered in fake fallen leaves – which drove me mad, as it was covered in real ones, too, being winter, and I kept trying to pick them off. Did it look cool? I'm not its 20-something target, but I think not.  I asked the boy again: \"Nah, it just makes you look like a real beg.\"</p><p>The base car starts at an amazingly cheap £8,399. Even if you go for the top-spec model, which includes an iPod connection, DAB radio, aircon, Bluetooth, parking sensor, airbags, LED running lights, cruise control and steering wheel audio controls, you still get a pound change from 10 grand.</p><p>The car handles well, but it's let down by the engine. It's a 1.5-litre petrol, which for this size of car is far too big. You could live with that, but this one whines and wheezes and you have to rev it hard to make any headway. The large engine means emissions are high, though consumption is reasonable. But no one in a car this size wants to pay £140 road tax when far bigger cars attract close to nothing.</p><p>This MG could be up there with the best cheap cars – but not until it gets a new engine.

They go up, I go down – and what's that strange droning I hear, like a&nbsp;punctured bagpipe but less melodic? Ah yes, of course, it's me – singing. People often say they can't hold a tune, but I am properly rubbish. My own children used to ask me to stop when I&nbsp;sang them a&nbsp;lullaby. Don't believe me? Ask the music teacher at my school. I was the only pupil he actually asked to leave the choir: \"I think we'll manage without you, Love.\"</p><p>Anyway, that's the feeling I've had this past week. I've been driving <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/uk/models/cayenne/cayenne-s-diesel/\" title=\"\">Porsche's Cayenne S Diesel</a>. A high-performance V8 engine has been hefted into the German marque's bestseller with the intention of generating prodigious power at more palatable levels of fuel consumption. Porsche has succeeded in both: the hulking 2.3-tonner hits 62mph in 5.7 seconds (imagine an elephant in running blades and you'll get some idea as to how unnerving it is to be in vehicle that's so heavy and yet so fast); and yet it still does 34 miles to the gallon. The manufacturers claim a range of 700 miles – which is impressive, but to brim the 100-litre tank will cost you up to £150, so it's hardly cheap motoring. Palatable, but only in a bush-tucker trial way.</p><p>This Porsche SUV has sent the motoring press into a frenzy of delight. <em>Top Gear</em> advises: \"Sell the hot hatch, the big estate and the 4x4 wagon. This one will do all that and more…\" While MSN Cars lists 16 reasons, with all the breathless panic of an asthmatic, as to why the Cayenne S Diesel is the ultimate family car. But I must have been out&nbsp;of tune with the choir (again), as I&nbsp;couldn't stand it.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425281595'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/12/16/1387195419354/Porsche-interior-008.jpg' alt='Porsche interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the luxurious interior of the Cayenne.</figcaption></figure><p>It is indubitably a wondrous feat of technical brilliance, the pinnacle of sophisticated super-luxe motoring. But it doesn't half make you feel sick, and the drive is as lumpy as hospital custard. The nausea starts when you first see the car. I've never been a&nbsp;fan of its bulging aesthetics, but the test model I drove in ice white with black trim and smoked alloys would have felt more at home in a <em>Star Wars</em> tribute night in Chelmsford. The huge grill is as widely spaced as a cattle grid, while its foot-thick wheels and aggressive stance seem tiresomely 80s. Greed doesn't seem quite so good in these post-red-braces-and-a-magnum-of-fizz days, no matter what Boris says.</p><p>Clamber in and everything feels heavy and lumbering. Even the door is too heavy. My wife (who is admittedly pretty feeble) parked the car facing up the hill we live on and claimed she couldn't prop the door open with her leg.</p><p>The interior is as you would expect: a symphony of stitched leather, chrome and glossy piano plastics. But for a car with such a&nbsp;gigantic footprint it feels cramped. A Range Rover aspires to feel light and airy, but the Cayenne wraps itself around you like a dark, furtive glove.</p><p>And what about the engine that had so many hacks drooling? I found that heavy, too. The engines I love lift a car and send you skittering across the tarmac, weightless and agile. This one is a grinder. It shoves you along with all the brutal finesse of an ice breaker. Once up to speed it was impressive, but today driving is rarely about bounding along open roads.</p><p>For me, this Cayenne was a dirge, and I was expecting an aria.</p><h2>Race2Recovery rally team</h2><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDfuiMtEhE\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQDfuiMtEhE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>The <a href=\"http://www.dakar.com/dakar/2014/us/history.html\" title=\"\">Dakar rally</a> began back in 1977, when Thierry Sabine got lost on his motorbike in the Libyan desert during the Abidjan-Nice rally. Saved from the sands in extremis, he returned to France still in thrall to this landscape and promising himself he would share his fascination with as many people as possible. He proceeded to come up with a route starting in Europe, continuing to Algiers and crossing Agadez before eventually finishing at Dakar. The founder coined a motto for his inspiration: \"A challenge for those who go. A dream for those who stay behind.\" Courtesy of his great conviction and that modicum of madness peculiar to all great ideas, the plan quickly became a reality. Since then, the Paris-Dakar, a unique event sparked by the spirit of adventure, open to all riders and carrying a message of friendship between all people, has never failed to challenge, surprise and excite. Over the course of almost 30 years, it has generated innumerable sporting and human stories.

£13,995</strong><br /><strong>MPG 60.1</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 115mph</strong></p><p>No one owns more Barbie dolls than Bettina Dorfmann (15,000); no donkey is taller than Oklahoma Sam (5ft&nbsp;1in), and nobody has broken more concrete blocks with their fist while gripping an egg than Joe Alexander (24)… Don't you just love  a winner? And their records are great because you just add up the numbers and… boff… there's your champion. So, surely, there is a clear-cut answer to the question: what's the world's best-selling car? Well no, not exactly. <a href=\"http://www.ford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ford</a> and Toyota both claim the title.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.toyota.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Toyota</a> stated that their Corolla was the undisputed champion, but then Ford got up in their faces by talking up their boy Focus as the winner. Bragging rights count in this game as both are vying for sales in developing markets, and being able to announce to a&nbsp;benighted market ignorant of your charms that you make the \"world's best-selling car\" has all the persuasive impact of being belted about the head by Freddie Flintstone's club. Who wants nuance when you can have clout?</p><p>So what <em>are</em> the facts? Last year, Ford sold 1,020,000 Focuses, while Toyota sold 1,160,000 Corollas. So, it's Toyota… Whoa, this is where it gets a little hairsplitty, as not all Corollas are Corollas, some are Aurises. Eh? Same car, same maker, different name. But Ford's Focus is called  a Focus everywhere. Therefore, figures adjusted, Ford sneaks the nameplate title on a technicality!</p><p>Anyway… both are phenomenally competent world-beating motors and you'll be very happy with either. This week, however, I have been driving just one of the million-plus <a href=\"http://www.ford.co.uk/Cars/Focus\" title=\"\">Focuses</a> that have rolled out of a dealership somewhere on earth this year. The car has been a&nbsp;relentless, massive sales hit ever since the original Mk1 appeared in showrooms in 1998 – and this is now the third generation.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424103427'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/12/3/1386072165179/Ford-Focus-interior-008.jpg' alt='Ford Focus interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside job: the clearly laid-out interior.</figcaption></figure><p>Why it works so well for customers is no secret. It's well-made, efficient and reliable; it's arguably the best driving car in its class; it looks great; it's roomy; it's packed with hi-tech gadgetry and safety systems and… what else? Oh, yes, the clincher, it's cheap. The vast economies of scale that both Toyota and Ford bring to their prize fighters have pretty much closed the shop when it comes to the family saloon (except, of course, for VW's contender, the Golf).</p><p>For a car with such universal appeal, the Focus has a remarkably distinctive shape. Often such global players sink beneath the waves of anodyne compromise, but this new model has dramatic triangular air-intakes at the front alongside bug-eyed spotlights. The side panels are both creased and scooped and the rear features sculptural tail lights and a flying lip on the roof. It has real presence, especially if you get it in Candy Red or Burnished Glow.</p><p>The Focus wears its gadgetry lightly. The list of active and passive driver aids would soothe the brow of even the most anxious mother (Active City Stop, Lane Keeping Aid, Driver Alert and Forward Alert have all received the highest Euro NCAP awards). If you manage to crash a&nbsp;Focus you have exceeded the lowest expectations of Ford's safety officers.</p><p>As you would expect there is a&nbsp;host of engine options to choose from, ranged to suit the driving styles of the languid (1.6-litre petrol) to the lairy (the 247bhp ST). The best of the new crop is the award-winning 1-litre EcoBoost turbo petrol, which is economical and brilliant fun to drive. For ultimate efficiency go for the ECOnetic model – which looks and drives like any other Focus, but delivers more than 80mpg and just 88g/km CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>If you like backing winners, should you buy a Ford or a Toyota? Might be easier to start collecting Barbies…</p><h2>Pagani Huayra: art, emotion, technology<br /></h2><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga7_w4Ib2MM\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ga7_w4Ib2MM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/XCARFilms\" title=\"\">XCar</a>'s incredible tribute to the one of the most amazing Italian sports cars on the road.

It is 100 years since William Morris converted an old military college into a car factory – and no one could have foreseen that it would develop into one of the world's most technologically sophisticated automotive manufacturers. Now lines of laser-guided robots work together in a perfectly sequenced choreography to churn out a new car every 68 seconds – a total of 900 a day. One in every six cars built by BMW is a&nbsp;Mini, and 40% of all UK car exports are Minis. It is impossible to overstate how important Mr Bean's little car is to this country's stuttering economy.</p><p>And that is why the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin, secretary of state for transport, has joined many of BMW's top brass on a miserably wet November morning in Cowley for the launch of the new <a href=\"http://www.mini.co.uk/\" title=\"\">New Mini</a>. After coffee and a few moments to learn some startling facts about one of the world's most recognisable cars – did you know that each one is brushed with ostrich feathers to remove dust in the paint shop, or that the great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Issigonis\" title=\"\">Alec Issigonis</a> once designed an amphibious wheelbarrow? – we were&nbsp;ushered into a huge darkened hall to meet and greet the third generation of BMW's baby boomer.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-423502708'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/27/1385552236445/Mini-interior-008.jpg' alt='Mini interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the latest Mini is the most 'connected' to date. </figcaption></figure><p>The honour of introducing the car was given to the historian <a href=\"http://www.dominicsandbrook.com/\" title=\"\">Dominic Sandbrook</a>, who arrived on stage in one of Sir Alec's original Minis accompanied by Spike the bulldog. (Spike is the star of the new Mini's ad campaign. \"Spike\" is just his stage name. He's actually called Turbo. Isn't that better? For a car star?) Journalists fiddled with their multilingual headsets. The chap next to me was from Moscow. On the other side, it was a bloke from… Cowley. Oh well. Dominic said Spike was a symbol of Britishness. He slobbered a bit and licked his testicles – Spike, that is. Dominic said the Mini was also a symbol of Britishness – lovable, cheeky, reliable, robust. A&nbsp;small car with big clout.</p><p>The old Mini revved off the stage to make way for its latest incarnation. Lights flashed, engines roared, and three new Minis spurted on to the stage from the shadows. They looked nearly the same as the ones we've got used to over the past 12 years, since BMW reinvented the car and began this remarkable renaissance. Out stepped Harald Krüger and Peter Schwarzenbauer, two of BMW's most senior figures – both slim, suave, grey-haired, immaculate. These industrialists run an ¤8bn a&nbsp;year company. Success seems to do wonders for your complexion. They stood on either side of the new car. More cameras flashed; we applauded. It was a rock-star moment.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IC6jtnUVgY\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IC6jtnUVgY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Not so long ago a launch like this would have been accompanied by a host of beautiful women wearing skirts slit to the thigh; now it was well-groomed men in suits. One said: \"Mini is a way of life, a friend. It holds a special place in our hearts.\" We all cheered. Car launches are always interesting and often star-studded, but I&nbsp;can't remember one where we all felt so proud, or so emotional.</p><p>This new Mini is a perfect blend of heritage and innovation. It's quicker, cleaner and safer than the last one. It looks tidy. It comes with a choice of ground-breaking three-cylinder engines. It's more interactive and smarter than ever. Production officially started last Thursday – which would have been Sir Alec Issigonis's 107th birthday. He'd have been proud, too.

£87,959</strong><br /><strong>MPG 28.5</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 184mph</strong></p><p>\"Oooofff, it gets you right in the vulva!\" howls Julia from the tiny back seat. The middle-aged mother of three had never sat in a Porsche before and to give her a taste of what the world's most lusted-after performance car can do, I had floored the accelerator without warning. That effortless, visceral, forward rush, underscored by the engine's distinctive rorty note, is as close to an automotive high as you can get. It's the reason Porsche drivers often seem to be grinning – it's not just because they know they earn more than you do…</p><p>This <a href=\"http://www.porsche.com/uk/models/911/911-carrera-4s/\" title=\"\">Porsche is the new 911 Carrera 4S</a>. It's the largest sports car the German masterbuilder has ever created – though Julia is still having to sit in the back with her knees in her armpits and the boot is a joke. But up front I am as comfortable as a chubby banker in his favourite club chair.</p><p>There's never a day when you wouldn't want to find yourself driving a car like this, but this week it feels particularly apt as the 911 has just celebrated its 50th birthday.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422980405'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/20/1384945914681/Porsche-at-50-008.jpg' alt='Porsche at 50' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The original Porsche 911 from 1963.</figcaption></figure><p>To mark the occasion, Porsche has created a commemorative model. Aside from a few extra flounces and period references, it is the same as the one I'm driving here. But it's worth noting – as this is the kind of obsessional attention to detail that Porscheophiles love – its multi-spoked wheels are inspired by the original <a href=\"http://www.fuchsperformance.com/wheels.cfm\" title=\"\">Fuchs</a> rims, the dials have green lettering, as the 1963 car did, and the badge colours are repeated in the headrests' stitching. Porsche has also only made 1,963 of them. I love that sort of numerical homage.</p><p>Porsche does make other models – from the \"poor man's\" Boxster up to the unlovable Panamera, and it sells more of its hideous Cayenne SUVs than all the others put together – but the 911 has always been the beating heart of the brand. It's the quintessential sports car and the benchmark against which all others measure themselves. It's the Steve McQueen; the steak baguette; the… You could go on. Porsches do this. They make you feel like you're in love.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422980406'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/20/1384946015727/Porsche-then-and-now-008.jpg' alt='Porsche then and now' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Porsche then and now: 50 years in the making of an icon.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the 50 years more than 820,000 911s have been built. Most have made their way into their owner's lives as surprisingly useful, everyday cars. Everyday? Actually, yes. There are not many supercars with room for two little elfs in the back and, despite being so low-slung, my elderly neighbour managed to clamber in and out. It's biddable in town and even surprisingly frugal with the fuel. But all 911s, given half a&nbsp;chance, are flyers with the potential to let rip on the track. And to have such a limitless supply of power, grace and ability on tap is something that always improves your mood.</p><p>This all-wheel-drive car is powered by a phenomenal 3.8-litre six-cylinder 400bhp engine – which I, of course, spent the week driving responsibly. It's also fitted with a new seven-speed manual gearbox. It's the world's only seven-speed manual and it's easy to see why – it's a complete pain. You never seem to know what gear you are in, or should be in. My father's first car only had three gears and that served him well enough.</p><p>I rarely drive on my own. But late last Sunday I headed out to the quiet, dark lanes of Kent for one last go before the car was collected the next morning. I drove 50 miles in 50 minutes – Porsche would like that. No music, just the engine's mesmerising buzz. Fast, slow, straight, cornering… and grinning.</p><h2>Time to start the Christmas shopping</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422980407'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/20/1384967926114/Pedal-car-008.jpg' alt='Pedal car' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Step on it: a lovely classic pedal car from the RAC's online shop.</figcaption></figure><p><br />It can be hard buying for the car-lover in your life.

I know who you are by your weight so I'll move the chair and mirrors to the position you like. There, how's that? Oops, belt up! I'm in charge now, naughty, so you're not going anywhere until you clunk and click. Right, where shall we go? Tell me and I'll instruct that useless satnav to find a scenic route. Much nicer than sticking to the motorway like he always does. OK, how about a bit of music? You know I like a bit of jazz. Please, God, not Magic again… Come on, talk to me… Capital, really? Well, OK, you're the boss. Right, let's get go… whoa watch out, there's someone coming up behind you. That's my upgraded blind spot information system there. Great isn't it? Ah, here's the rain, I'll flick on the wipers, and, as it's dark, I think I'll turn on my lights. Don't worry about dipping them, I'll take care of that. OK, that's it, next left. And now we're on the open road. What speed do you want to cruise at? 70mph! Well, I'd say that was a bit quick for these conditions, but I'll keep a&nbsp;safe distance from the bloke in front and my lane-keeping device will stop you swerving all over the white lines like you did yesterday. Hang on, are you feeling sleepy? Your head's wobbling. I'll vibrate your seat, ha, that gave you a surprise didn't it? Wake up! Clearly you can't be trusted to park so I'll do that, too, just let go of the steering wheel for a mo'. Right, we're there, how was that?

Laughter comes from inside the darkened car. She steps out then leans in to say something which causes more hilarity. As she talks she steps into her shoes and wriggles her wrinkled skirt down over her bottom. She rebuttons her blouse, runs her hands through her hair and hops back in. The door slams and the engine starts…</p><p>I'd been walking my dog (honestly), and I wondered if the couple had been having sex. Think about it: laughter, darkness, a secluded lay-by, that rumpled skirt and – the clincher – a Fiesta. According to a recent poll by <a href=\"http://www.bba-reman.com/uk\" title=\"\">BBA Reman</a> of more than 2,000 drivers, the car most people have had sex in is a Ford Fiesta. Does this tell us more about Fiestas or the people who tend to own Fiestas? I'm not sure.</p><p>I pondered this as I loaded the dog into the back of the palatial <a href=\"http://www.honda.co.uk/cars/cr-v/\" title=\"\">Honda CR-V</a> I was test-driving. The boot is colossal – there's 1,669 litres of loadspace (odd how manufacturers measure space in litres, but what else would you use? A quick Wiki yields 94 different units of volume, including firkins, rundlets and hogsheads). If you fold down the back seat, which you can do in seconds by pulling a single easy-grip handle, there's room in the back of the CR-V for, oh, six and a bit hogsheads. Certainly there'd be room for a copulating couple. They'd be more than comfortable and the little sidelights would be quite romantic…</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421939261'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383737175794/Interior-CR-V-008.jpg' alt='Interior CR-V' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside story: the interior of the CR-V.</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, despite selling more than five million vehicles since it was first launched in 1995, the CR-V is not known for setting your pulse racing. It's a quietly sedate, brilliantly functional \"soft\" roader. But still waters run deep and this new model has something to boast about. Honda has put the ultrafrugal, superlight, downsized diesel engine it developed for its Civic into the SUV. This new engine is named Earth Dreams; it is 1,598cc and only powers the front wheels, so this 4x4 is only really a&nbsp;2x4. But that saving means this CR-V is more economical and eco-friendly than almost any other family off-roader on the, er, road. The loss of full \"green-lane\" capability is more than offset by the fact that fuel economy reaches unscaled heights for such a&nbsp;large car. Honda claims a coquettishly optimistic figure of 62.8mpg – maybe, if you're driving on the moon. But in mixed conditions and with a loaded car I still did average a none-too-shabby 54mpg. The remarkable engines will be built at Honda's UK manufacturing base in Swindon and they will churn out up to 500 units a day.</p><p>Does a small engine in a big car work? Thanks to a raft of technologies and weight-saving strategies, the answer is yes, incredibly well. The car flows nicely on the motorway and never feels underpowered, yet the diesel still sounds agricultural enough to convince you that you're at the wheel of something fruitier at low speeds.</p><p>Inside, the CR-V is comfortable, conservative, rewarding, grown-up. Nothing is showy, yet there is no sense of being short-changed either.</p><p>It doesn't feel like a car people will have sex in. But if they do, I'm sure it will be comfortable, conservative, rewarding and grown-up.</p><h2>Lost in translation: a sat-nav love story</h2><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOHN0o6GzT0\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOHN0o6GzT0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.birdinabox.tv/\" title=\"\"><em>Bird in a Box</em></a> is a surreal short comedy about a lonely man whose first proper date in years is sabotaged by the unattainable love of his life, who proves to have as much control over his heart as she does over his route.

from £11,255</strong><br /><strong>MPG 53.3</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 102mph</strong></p><p>When Baxter, an old friend, was first introduced to the gruff Yorkshireman who would one day be his father-in-law, the response was abrupt. \"Baxter!\" he said. \"Dog's name in't it?\" But slowly he warmed to his future son-in-law – as a wedding gift he gave him a dog tag engraved with the word Baxter. Now the human-as-dog naming trend has gone into reverse with half the dogs in my local park answering to human names. My own dog, Minty (what? She's white) enjoys romping around with Gary the Labrador and Adrian the Staffie. Whatever next? Are we going to start giving human names to cars? Exactly. Meet <a href=\"http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/adam/overview.html?ppc=gb_adam_adam\" title=\"\">Adam the Vauxhall</a>.</p><p>Adam follows in the footsteps of a new breed of premium superminis that have put hipster design at the core of their being – the Fiat 500, Citroën's DS3, Audi's A1 and, of course, the Mini. But there's nothing retro about Adam. He's a&nbsp;teen dream of puppy-like playfulness; a riot of endless options and choices. The online \"configurator\" offers up to 30,000 variations in everything from wheels to mirror covers. You can even order internal ambient lighting which rotates through seven shades.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420945224'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382529820002/Vauxhall-Adam-interior-008.jpg' alt='Vauxhall Adam interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mellow yellow: the new Adam can be modified in up to 30,000 different ways.</figcaption></figure><p>Based on Vauxhall's bestselling Corsa, Adam is a little shorter and a&nbsp;little wider – he's wider physically and socially. From here it all starts to get a bit wacky. The three different trim levels are called Adam Jam, Adam Glam or Adam Slam. The first is for the \"funky and fashionable\", the second for \"turning heads\" and the third is if you are \"born to be wild\". If you are, say, \"nice\" or \"morbidly shy\" then, sorry, Adam doesn't want to know you.<br /><br />Once you've selected your trim level, the party really kicks off. Take colour, for instance. You can't simply opt for white because that is called Saturday White Fever. Grey! Surely you mean The Greyfather? Yellow! That'll be James Blonde, and the worst (or best if you are Mr Fun) is orange, which is called Papa Don't Peach. It's exhausting, but it works. I&nbsp;have never before scrolled along the entire length of a&nbsp;manufacturer's colour bar to see what every shade was called – has anyone? And the relentless upbeatness is, finally, cheering. You just have to go with it…</p><p>Inside, Adam is roomier than you'd think; he has a&nbsp;decent back seat. His boot is deep and narrow, perfect for an upright suitcase, but irritating for just about everything else. He comes with a&nbsp;choice of engines (of course he does), but the 1.2 petrol I tested was right for the job. Zippy and economical, it more than held its own around town, which is what Adam is all about. On the open road Adam coped, but you'd think twice before a long trip. Unless you're young, in which case you'll be having fun so you won't mind.</p><p>Maybe, with all this personalisation, Vauxhall should also launch an Eve for their women customers? Or an \"insert name here\" for the rest of us. If my name was Adam I'd definitely buy one…</p><h2>Inspiring the engineers of tomorrow</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420945222'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/25/1382702511070/Leena-Gade-008.jpg' alt='Leena Gade' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Poll position: Leena Gade is the first woman engineer to win Le Mans.</figcaption></figure><p><br />A leading race engineer for <a href=\"http://www.joest-racing.de/en/index.php/team/das-audi-sport-team-joest\" title=\"\">Audi Sport Team Joest</a>, Leena Gade is an ambassador for <a href=\"http://www.tomorrowsengineers.org.uk/week.cfm\" title=\"\">Tomorrow's Engineers Week 2013</a>, a government and industry campaign running from 4-8 November to encourage young people to pursue engineering careers.

The launch of a new model is always a special occasion, but <a href=\"http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/\" title=\"\">Rolls-Royce</a> clearly decided something extraordinary was needed for its <a href=\"http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/wraith/\" title=\"\">Wraith</a>.</p><p>We are led along a corridor of trees which reach 40ft up to the curve of the ancient barrel ceiling. It's like a&nbsp;hammy production of <em>Macbeth.</em></p><p>And then there it is, the mighty Wraith glowering in the half light. What an entrance this vehicle makes. It is a statement car; the ultimate get-me for the look-at-me generation. But whether you like it or not is another question. Its very singular style (not to mention its colossal price tag) means there will be as many who think it's foul as fair. To the haters those pinched eyes, slab sides and brutal architecture conjure up nothing more than an Insignia on steroids; to fans it's a contemporary interpretation of the 1938 original – bold, purposeful and unique.</p><p>In essence the Wraith is a two-door, four-seat coupé version of its bigger and squarer sister, the Ghost. Its whopping 6.6-litre V12 engine makes it the most potent and technologically advanced Rolls-Royce ever. It weighs in at an elephantine 2.4 tonnes yet it will still top 62mph in five seconds.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420121400'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381918360570/rolls-royce-wraith-interi-008.jpg' alt='rolls royce wraith interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Star performer: the roof of the Wraith can be studded with twinkling lights. Photograph: Mark Bramley</figcaption></figure><p>So much speed in such a stately body is perplexing – like a granny hoiking up her skirts and giving Usain Bolt a&nbsp;run for his money. Surely the point of a&nbsp;Rolls-Royce is to waft, to glide from one banquet to the next, rather than thrashing down the autobahn like some jumped-up member of the vulgar classes.</p><p>But this paradox is exactly what Rolls has in mind, and it's a duality that goes back to the marque's two founding fathers: goody-two-shoes Henry Royce, the perfectionist engineer, and Charles Rolls, the boy racer of his day. The choice of the word Wraith hints at this. Rolls-Royce likes to recycle names from its family tree, it gives a sense of continuity and perseverance (and alongside Phantom and Ghost, it maintains the current spectral theme), but a&nbsp;\"wraith\" has an edge of wickedness, a dark side, and that's what this car has, too – a&nbsp;streak of naughtiness.</p><p>You won't initially notice the endless ornate detail as the awesomeness of the first impression sweeps over you. The absent B-pillar, the recessed grille which references the mouth of a&nbsp;jet turbine, the rear-opening coach doors, the self-righting centres of the huge wheels…</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ82dP5s1cU\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJ82dP5s1cU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Inside, it manages to be both grand and naff all at once. The carpets are inch-thick sheepskin, the seats look like they've been stolen from a&nbsp;gentleman's club and the doors close themselves. But the open-pore wood veneer would be more at home in a 70s sauna and the light-studded \"star\" ceiling is pure <em>X Factor</em>.</p><p>Technologically it is a&nbsp;masterpiece: wireless hotspot, touchpad multimedia, voice-activated controls.

Every other car seemed to have one marshmallowing up the back window alongside the stereo, the half-dead pot plant, the Ikea bag full of clothes… And squeezed in amongst the baggage you could glimpse the wide eyes and pale face of a first-year student being driven to start the next big chapter of their lives. We had one in the back of our car, too – all at once nervous, excited, chatty, quiet, laughing, tearful.</p><p>Earlier that morning we'd left home with neighbours, siblings and a&nbsp;boyfriend waving on the pavement, and now here we were off to university – 18 years gone in a flash. It's a cliché to say parenting is all about letting go, but this really felt like it, as if we were on a trapeze, chalk dust glinting in the dark, empty fingers stretched wide…</p><p>On the return leg, the tarmac slipping silently under the wheels, I thought about how many of life's defining journeys start, and finish, in a car.

It's a car that can be all things. It is versatile, innovative, sexy and practical. Over the years it is a car that has eagerly made itself one of the gang in a host of very diverse families, bearing silent witness to all their life dramas. If cars could talk, the 3 Series would… well, have a&nbsp;series to itself.</p><p>For my money, the Touring is the most complete car on the road. It's a&nbsp;family car that handles like a sports car; an estate that drives like a saloon; it has a&nbsp;beautiful performance engine that is also incredibly economical. It proves that mutually exclusive concepts can sometimes coexist.</p><p>BMW makes two estate cars: a&nbsp;larger version for its 5 Series range and this neater, more compact model for the 3 Series line-up. This sixth-generation model is more spacious, more powerful and more economical than the outgoing one. From the front you wouldn't notice much of a&nbsp;difference, but from the waist back BMW has been very clever. It has added a long crease running the length of the body, a huge swoosh, and raked the rear screen. This somehow creates the impression you are sitting in a grand family wagon, yet the car still only has the daintiest of footprints. This makes it brilliant for ducking and diving in the city as well as stretching out on a long run.</p><p>As a premium motor, it has all kinds of goodies and gadgets to make you feel special. Take the boot, for example. It can be opened by hand, by pressing the fob or by waving your foot under the valance. The glass is also separately hinged and can be opened on its own. Or the headlights – these are self-activating, self-dipping and directional. They will smartly illuminate the entire road ahead yet somehow cast a shadow only over the car in front so as not to dazzle them. With so much thought going into the lights alone, it's reassuring to imagine the endeavour and ambition applied to the rest of the car's workings.</p><p>Several engines are available. I&nbsp;drove the one that will be the bestseller – a&nbsp;184bhp, 2-litre turbodiesel giving a&nbsp;top speed of 143mph, 0-62mph in 7.7 seconds, fuel consumption of 60.1 mpg and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of just 124g/km.</p><p>To drive it's smooth, grown-up, embracing, responsive – a total joy. Motoring home last Sunday night, feeling – admittedly – a little emotional, the car almost felt caring, solicitous, a rock in a changing world.</p><p>And here's the thing about that trapeze: it soon swings them back.</p><h2>BMW roadsters: 1929-2013</h2><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apqDx0o6ZgA\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/apqDx0o6ZgA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><br />BMW entered the world of cars in 1929 and quickly became known as one of the best manufacturers of luxury motor vehicles. Some of its most notable early cars were the roadsters, exciting and attractive roofless toys that tore up the European roads and racetracks. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/XCARFilms\" title=\"\">XCAR</a> explores the earliest roadsters from BMW, from the 315/1 and 319/1 to the amazing 328 and look at the post war beauty that was the 507 as well as leaping forward in time to the latest generation of roadsters, the Z series.</p><h2>Nuts about cars</h2><p>In its annual survey of the top motors that premiership footballers are driving, <a href=\"http://www.nuts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nuts magazine</a> has revealed that the Range Rover Sport is the car most likely to be seen parked at the training ground. Second and third on the list are the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7. Here's the full list:</p><p><strong>1. Range Rover Sport</strong> This year has seen universal love for the daddy of all SUVs. It's fast, it's full of tricks, it looks awesome – and it was made here in Blighty. A worthy winner! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Jon Obi Mikel, John Terry (both Chelsea); Scott Parker (Fulham); Luis Suarez (Liverpool); Ryan Giggs, Javier Hernandez, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City); Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>2. Porsche Cayenne </strong>For the second year, the surly SUV pips its road-hogging rival to second spot. Could it be the speed of the turbo that the prem stars love? Whatever it is, it's still the most popular Porsche ever! Drivers include: Scott Parker (Fulham); Steven Gerrard, Kolo Touré (both Liverpool); Yaya Touré (Man City); Tom Cleverley, Patrice Evra, Robin van Persie, Chris Smalling (all Man United); Younes Kaboul (Tottenham Hotspur); Carlos Cuéllar (Sunderland)</p><p><strong>3 Audi Q7 </strong>The sporty R8 got a sound showing further up the top 10, but if it's German muscle the prem's finest are after, the Q7 wins it. Drivers include: Kieran Gibbs, Bacary Sagna (both Arsenal); Fernando Torres (Chelsea); Luis Nani, Rio Ferdinand (both Man United); Steve Nzonzi (Stoke City); Phil Bardsley (Sunderland); Mousa Dembele, Emmanuel Adebayor (both Tottenham Hotspur) Chris Brunt (West Brom)</p><p><strong>4. Aston Martin DB9</strong> Since its inception in 2004, this British beast has become a bona fide favourite with the famous football-playing folk. Very cool, very fast, very nice all round! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Frank Lampard, Juan Mata, Fernando Torres (all Chelsea); Gareth Barry (Everton); Glen Johnson (Liverpool); James Milner (Man City); Peter Crouch, Matthew Etherington (both Stoke City); Jake Livermore (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>5. Bentley Continental</strong> No round-up of top-flight players' preferred wheels would be complete without the GT – the <em>Downton Abbey</em> of the nation's training ground car parks. Drivers include: Samuel Eto'o, (Chelsea); Glen Johnson, Victor Moses, Martin Skrtel (all Liverpool); Gael Clichy, David Silva (both Man City); Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young (both Man United); Wes Brown (Sunderland); Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>6. Porsche Panamera</strong> All the flash of a rubber-burning motor, but with the added bonus of a couple of rear doors. Handy for a queue-busting impromptu outing to Nando's after training. Drivers include: Thomas Vermaelen (Arsenal); Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea); Steven Pienaar (Everton); Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool); Edin Dzeko, Vincent Kompany, Samir Nasri (both Man City); Guly Do Prado (Southampton); Robert Huth (Stoke City)</p><p><strong>7. Ferrari 458 </strong>It's a warm welcome to this Italian bad-boy – new to 2013's top 10. The boffins at Ferrari have worked their stylish behinds off to create their most aero efficient motor ever with the 458 Speciale. Drivers include: Mathieu Flamini, Mesut özil, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshire (all Arsenal); Frank Lampard, John Terry (both Chelsea); Micah Richards (Man City); Luis Nani (Man United)</p><p><strong>8. Lamborghini Gallardo </strong>A slightly better showing for the Italian stallion this year, grunting its way two places up the lead-footed league in style. Nice! Drivers include:Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa); Ashley Cole (Chelsea); Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, David de Gea, Luis Nani, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Stephen Ireland (Stoke City)</p><p><strong>9. Audi R8 </strong>The slick style and super six-speed gearbox means it still makes all the right (gleefully grunty) noises for the boys. Drivers include: Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Cleverley (Man United); José Fonte (Southampton); Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott (both Arsenal); Micah Richards, David Silva (both Man City); Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur)</p><p><strong>10. Chevrolet Camaro</strong> The General Motors-built beast brings a touch of the NFL to the English Prem. Drivers include: Joe Allen (Liverpool); Alex Buttner, Luis Nani (both Man United); Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Huddlestone (Hull City); Cheick Tioté (Newcastle)</p><h2>From the GT40 to the Veyron</h2><p>And finally, a brilliant infographic of the <a href=\"http://www.buyagift.co.uk/content/supercar\">evolution of the supercar</a>.

Cute isn't it? Mmmm… OK, wake up. It's the adorable city car that revolutionised urban motoring with its unmatched combination of retro chic, metrosexual attention to dinky detailing and honest practicality. By updating its classic Cinquecento – that miniature darling of the 50s – so brilliantly, a&nbsp;relieved Fiat found itself with a mighty bestseller on its hands. Its first in years, decades even.</p><p>But in the time since the 500 first arrived, the trendy urbanites who bought it have grown up and started families (their ironic facial hair is now grey and their thick-rimmed glasses no longer merely for fashion). This means they need something bigger to scoot the brood around town. Hold on a&nbsp;moment, thought Fiat's designers, we know just what's needed: a bigger small car. They took their diminutive masterpiece and \"larged\" it. So, in an act of automotive torture, they took the innocent 500 and stretched it and pulled it and inflated it and distended it until, finally, their lumbering, bloated mutant hobbled off the production line like one of Cinderella's ugly sisters. From the brightest of templates Fiat had managed to create a Frankencar.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418228870'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380105266023/Fiat-500-L-interior-008.jpg' alt='Fiat 500 L interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Inside job: the cheerful interior of the 500L.</figcaption></figure><p>The bulging <a href=\"http://www.fiat.co.uk/uk/fiat-500l/discover?campaignid=PPC46416&amp;gclid=CPLV4f6q5rkCFc7C3goduEwAFA\" title=\"\">500 gained an L </a>(standing for Large and Loathsome) and lost almost everything else that was charming about it. Beyond the badge on the bonnet there seems to be no genetic link.</p><p>But here is the thing: Fiat has great form when it comes to designing plug-ugly cars. The original <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/stuartbailie/2009/09/lets_do_multipla.shtml\" title=\"\">Multipla</a> was so hideous it was described by one critic as a&nbsp;\"strangulated hernia  on wheels\" when it first slithered on to the street, but its unorthodox 3-plus-3 seating plan, high driving position and short, wide body made it a slow-burning hit and one of my favourite cars of all time. There's  a Y-reg for sale at the end of my street at the moment for £1,100 and I am sorely tempted to buy it.</p><p>Over the course of the week I&nbsp;spent with the 500L (we nicknamed her Ugly Betty), I began to wonder if Fiat was on to something: had it deliberately made its car stand-out goofy? In a&nbsp;world of anodyne anonymity, there is definitely a place for the unlovely, the teeth-grindingly gruesome. If you don't believe me you clearly haven't seen the line-up for the world's ugliest dog title for 2013.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyd5Ut9dX6E\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyd5Ut9dX6E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Sitting inside the compact MPV persuaded me that perhaps Fiat does know what it's up to. It feels like you are at the wheel of a tiny, trendy bus. There is usable space and innovation everywhere: the rear seats slide, hinge and flip down; the passenger seat folds flat to complete a single-bed of a loading bay; the double-shelved boot is massive and can be fitted with two extra seats; the dashboard features a Uconnect \"infotainment\" system including  a Dr&nbsp;Dre Beats Audio stereo system; and there is even a built-in Lavazza coffee machine (really) if you so wish. The fascia can be given a soft-touch surface or finished in suede.</p><p>Various engines are available. I&nbsp;drove the biggest of the lot, a&nbsp;105bhp 1.6-litre turbodiesel. It's noisy, unapologetic and crazily economical. Fiat isn't taking itself seriously, and neither should we. Betty is chubby, fun and up-for-it.

£5,995</strong><br /><strong>MPG 47.9</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 97mph</strong></p><p>Two questions motoring journalists are often asked: \"What's the best car you've driven?\" and \"What's the worst?\" The first is hard, as the \"best\" is always the car doing the job you need doing. An economical estate to take you to Scotland – step forward the Skoda Octavia; a hair-raising spin through the tree-canopied lanes of Kent – that'll be the McLaren 12C; a show-boater for the streets of Chelsea – how about a gullwinged Mercedes SLS? The second is almost impossible because, as the cliché goes, they don't really make crap cars any more – until now. Let me introduce you to the <a href=\"http://www.dacia.co.uk/vehicles/sandero/\" title=\"\">Dacia Sandero</a> – the worst car I have ever driven.</p><p>Like all black-and-white statements, that rather simplifies the point, because the Sandero is also the cheapest new car in Britain. Not just cheap, but arse-out, rock-bottom cheap. It costs £5,995, which is £10,000 cheaper than the average price for a new car. So, when viewing it through this prism of \"shocking affordability\", one is forced to reevaluate. The Sandero has no fancy extras – in fact, it has no extras; it's barely got the basics. It has wind-up windows, no radio, squidgy seats, no&nbsp;central locking, no spare wheel. The unforgiving plastic dashboard is&nbsp;bereft of buttons, dials, read-outs – the car does nothing, so there is nothing to control. It doesn't so much seem basic as brutally regressive. It&nbsp;feels like the car your dad used to moan about driving 20 years ago, unlocking his door with a key, then leaning over to pull up the buttons on&nbsp;the three other doors.</p><p>Dacia says it is able to offer cars at these prices by stripping its production of waste and \"making an enemy of the unnecessary\". I'd disagree with them on what is unnecessary.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ytK2KprvYw\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ytK2KprvYw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Dacia (pronounced Da-chi-a) hails from Romania and has a history going back to pre-Iron Curtain motoring – a&nbsp;low point for any product, not just&nbsp;cars. In 1999 Renault bought the firm&nbsp;and began turning Dacia into its own in-house budget brand – in the same way that VW has made Skoda its secret weapon of mass manufacturing. The great surprise has been how unanimously Europe has taken the skin-flint Sandero to its heart – the Romanian brand has been the fastest-growing on the continent for the past eight years and last year sold 350,000 vehicles. Now it's our turn to get on board.<br /><br />The 1.2-litre petrol engine is loud and high-revving, but eager enough. The car has done remarkably well in reliability tests, and Dacia clearly believes in its product, as it comes with a five-year warranty.</p><p>From the outside the Sandero looks anonymous, but if you are paying less than six grand maybe that's a blessing. Inside it's bunker basic, but in a way its honest simplicity and rustic finishing is curiously likable. It's been built for the roughest roads of Europe, so it will be able to cope with ours here, and it handles better than you might expect on the motorway – though you won't be able to hear yourself think, let alone the nonexistent radio. It's also usefully roomy – most cheap cars are small. On closer inspection, you'll notice Dacia has been good enough to include power steering, airbags and ABS brakes. So there are some niceties.</p><p>The worst car I have ever driven, yes, but also the best car I have ever driven that costs less than £6,000.</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></p>","internalOctopusCode":"8064190","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-22T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1967191","internalContentCode":"417611399","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"<p>A new Dacia Sandero costs less than £6,000.

£95,000 <br /><strong>MPG</strong> 313<br /><strong>Top speed </strong>99mph<br /><br />A supercar on the streets of Chelsea barely gets a second look these days, but the two young men in front of us in red jeans, sockless loafers and surprisingly tight Hawaiian shirts are standing slack jawed on the pavement. \"Hugo, what the hell is that?\" one bellows at the other. Hugo has no idea and sticks his  head in the window. \"What's this, buddy?\" he asks of Peter Wouda,  one of VW's brightest talents, who is over from the firm's design HQ in Potsdam to show off his new baby. \"It's the <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/xl1?gclid=CL3Atda-kbkCFS3HtAodNWAAUg\" title=\"\">XL1</a>,\" Peter replies in flawless English. Hugo looks impressed and then asks what it runs on, pushing his floppy fringe off his face. But before Peter can reply he guffaws: \"Cham-bloody-pagne!\"</p><p>We are driving the world's cleanest and most fuel-efficient production car. It's a miracle of super-lightweight performance engineering. Its diesel-electric hybrid engines give it a fuel consumption of 313 miles per gallon – that's 10 times the figure an average car achieves. While hitting this astronomical target it emits a piffling 21g of carbon per km. Ironically, that is the same amount generated by a cyclist.</p><p>The ultra-frugal XL1 looks like a&nbsp;vision of the future, but it is already in limited production. So far 50 have been manufactured in Volkswagen's Osnabrück factory (which also produces the Golf Cabriolet and the Porsche Boxster) and there are immediate plans to make 200, though that could soon rise to 5,000. Peter explains: \"They will be made to be sold and driven – they are not for collectors. But the XL1 is mostly about technology that will make its way down into our regular cars.\"</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z9kuCvRDc\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3Z9kuCvRDc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>The body is made of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer and is created from a single monocoque mould. This one-piece construction, a&nbsp;sort of exoskeleton, makes the car stronger and lighter as it supports loads through its skin – like a table-tennis ball. The drivetrain melds a two-cylinder 800cc diesel with a tiny electric motor.</p><p>The twin forces which shaped this car are weight and aerodynamics. Everything possible has been done to optimise these two. It doesn't have electric windows, for instance, as hand winders weigh less. There are no wing mirrors as these create drag. Instead, tiny rear-facing cameras transmit an image on to a screen on the door panels. The car has fared-in wheels, skinny tyres and an entirely flat bottom. The extreme tear-drop shape makes it incredibly \"slippery\". If the tail had been followed to a tapered tip it would have been 7m long – a perfect sperm-like shape, agrees Peter. The entire car, including two engines, crash protection, sat nav, radio, etc, weighs in at less than 800kg. That's featherweight.</p><p>Inside, the XL1 looks remarkably normal. The car is so radical and challenging that Peter and his team wanted the interior to be familiar, calm and uncluttered. Much of the kit is the same as you'd find in a Golf.</p><p>To drive it doesn't feel alien or peculiar. It zips along, it's easy to manoeuvre, it's fun. When the diesel kicks in it barks like a&nbsp;\"little terrier in the boot\". It sounds odd to say this, but this most ultramodern, dynamic, game-changing, avant-garde, frugal Dougal of a vehicle – a&nbsp;time traveller into the future of motoring – feels instantly familiar and congenial.  And, somehow, that is very comforting. Champagne all round!</p><p></p><p><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z9kuCvRDc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile?

£1,395</strong><br /><strong>MPG 110</strong><br /><strong>Top speed 28mph</strong></p><p>Just as you can't explain  a joke to someone without a sense of humour, so you can't describe the appeal of a tiny <a href=\"http://www.tomosgb.com/index.html\" title=\"\">Tomos</a> to anyone who takes life too seriously. It's  a beyond-basic moped from Slovenia which hasn't changed much in 60 years. It should probably have been parked years ago in the bay marked: Noisy, Dangerous and Stoopid. But this chortling, splurting, juddering little moped has been winning over our hearts (and wallets – it costs just £1,395) for decades. And now, after a gap of more than 30 years, you can once again buy the timorous wee beastie in Britain.</p><p>One of the many reasons why children have more fun than adults is that they can truly live in the moment. They are happy because they are on that trampoline and how high they're bouncing is all they can think about. Adults, however, would be bouncing but they'd also be thinking about pelvic floors, failing pensions and, oh, that guttering looks full from up here. But a Tomos has the gift of making it impossible to think about anything else. When you feel its feisty 49cc air-cooled two-stoke engine putter into life beneath your buttocks, its chopperlike handlebars start to vibrate violently in your hands and you surge out into the traffic… Certain death seem so imminent that savouring your last few moments of life on a Tomos becomes all consuming.</p><p>To add to this sense of merriment, Tomos UK is importing baby blue mopeds and minty green ones (it will do a \"shadow black\", but I'd say that would only be for people who refuse to wear paper hats at Christmas).</p><p>There is no ignition, the bike doesn't have a battery and starts with a push of its pedals – you can actually ride it very slowly as a bicycle using the pedals. In theory you might need to add some leg power to aid the trifling engine up the steepest of hills, but I rode up Crystal Palace hill in south London and it put in a heroic Chris Froome-like performance. It's an automatic and has two gears with a top speed of about 28mph – which feels fast enough. It weighs in at 57kg and it'll do more than 100 miles to the gallon. I filled it up and it cost a whopping £2.40 at the pump. It's congestion-free and the road tax is £17. You can ride it on a driver's licence if you passed before 2001 – otherwise you will need to pass your CBT and be over 16. It's sturdily built, as if it has every intention of being here in another 60 years. It's Tomos the tank engine.</p><p>I have never been on a vehicle that has provoked such goodwill from my fellow road users. It turned my seven-mile commute into a sea of waves, grins, thumbs-up signs and marriage proposals… not quite, but you get the picture. When I got home I&nbsp;thought I'd better wheel it through to the back garden for its own security, but then – brimming with <em>joie de vivre</em> – I&nbsp;decided to ride it through the house, round the kitchen, down the back steps on to the patio and across the garden. Yee-haaing all the way.  Adult behaviour? No, it must have been the Tomos factor.</p><p>For more information, go to <a href=\"http://www.tomosgb.com/index.html\" title=\"\">tomosgb.com</a></p><h2>Thinking outside the box</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416504829'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/4/1378295809698/Mini-campers-008.jpg' alt='Mini campers' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Happy campers: Mini's unusual take on camping.</figcaption></figure><p><br />Earlier this summer, Mini unveiled three unique camping concepts which are designed to appeal to people who enjoy the outdoors, from festival goers to campers alike. There's the Clubvan Camper, the Cowley and the Countryman ALL4 Camp and each highlight Mini's creative use of space in their own way and all three have their own distinct Mini touches. The Clubvan Camper is the world's smallest luxury camper van; the Cowley is a compact yet comfortable caravan for two people, equipped with a twin-ring gas stove, fridge and sink; and the Countryman ALL4 Camp with its innovative roof-top tent is the getaway car for an adventurous couple. All are just concepts at the moment, but as you can see from this picture, they'd be a brilliant addition to the Mini line-up.</p><h2>Thoughts on the E-Type Jaguar</h2><p>Last week I reviewed the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/01/jaguar-f-type-car-review\" title=\"\">F-Type from Jaguar</a>, but almost all the emails I received were from people very happy to linger a little longer on the legendary E-Type. Here's one typical letter from Mark Styring, which sums up how we all felt about the old car:</p><p>Hello Martin, I enjoyed your article on the F-Type, but I really do feel you should have compared it with the competition, rather than with the incomparable E-Type. The cars were, after all, conceived 50 years apart.</p><p>Most of the other automotive press say that the \"F\" is there or thereabouts compared with the current offerings from the usual suspects. I'm glad everyone seems to like it, and I would sign up myself if I had a spare 60K+ burning a hole in my pocket. However, I bought a Toyota GT86 this year, and am looking forward to a long-term relationship with it.</p><p>In 1961, though, the E-Type was so far ahead of anything else in the world, that, if the competition weren't embarrassed, they should have been. I can just imagine in my mind's eye Enzo Ferrari kicking his engineers in the culo all the way up and down Modena High Street when he came home from that year's Geneva Motor Show. Still, he was spot-on about the E-Type's aesthetics.</p><p>There were road cars which were about as fast, but they were three times more expensive to buy, were far more temperamental, and drank rather more fuel.</p><p>There were touring cars which were as comfortable, but they struggled to get past 100 mph.</p><p>There were American cars which could get to 60mph faster in a straight line: just don't ask them to stop any time soon, or get round a bend without the tyres squealing.</p><p>There were cars with neater roadholding and handling, but the E would catapult past them on the straights.</p><p>I guess I am getting towards old fartdom, with which you associate traditional Jag. fans in your article, but I've thus far managed to avoid the angina pills. If you want an E with a thoroughbred exhaust note, just fit it with a two-inch straight-through system. Everything else with multiples of six sound like coffee grinders. The founder of Jaguar wouldn't have anything to do with V8s, as they are inherently unbalanced and unrefined. Same goes for V6s.

It's so hot (the weather, that is) that I've had to close the roof. That took just 12 seconds. But then everything about <a href=\"http://www.jaguar.co.uk/f-type/\" title=\"\">Jaguar's new F-Type</a> is quick – except its genesis. It's taken years to arrive. If you were drumming your fingers waiting for Andy Murray's Wimbledon win or were irritated by Prince George's tardy entry, you'll be spitting biscuit crumbs over the F-Type's 39-year gestation.</p><p>The gorgeous new roadster is the alphabetic successor to the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type\" title=\"\">E-Type </a>– the car once described by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Ferrari\" title=\"\">Enzo Ferrari</a> as the \"most beautiful ever made\". But production of the E ended in 1974, sparking four decades of feverish speculation about the due date for an F among Jag-heads.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416527680'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/4/1378311217067/F-Type-interior-008.jpg' alt='F-Type interior' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The F-Type's interior.</figcaption></figure><p>And now, at last, it's here. But what a buildup. The first time many of us saw the car was earlier this summer when Jaguar released a 13-minute <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trlv9UdIheM\" title=\"\">\"advert\" starring Damien Lewis and the F-Type</a>. It was shot by Ridley Scott Associates in Peru's Atacama desert – a car-heist with <em>Homeland</em> overtones – that also featured a soundtrack of throbbing exhausts and a lot of sighing. It was so knowingly trendy it had many Jag fans reaching for their angina pills. It also sent a clear message: Jaguar is cool, sexy and young. Pringle is dead! Long live Alexander McQueen!</p><p>So, has Jaguar delivered on its promise? If you were hoping for some rehashed, heated-up simulacrum of the E-Type, you'll be gutted. If you've been waiting, credit card in hand, for a modern, muscular, dynamic driving machine, you'll be fist-pumpingly delighted.</p><p>The 60s icon was all about grace and chappish Englishness, today's stocky F-Type has a much more forceful personality. Its hefty flanks bulge; its thin rear lights squint out of a&nbsp;chopped tail; its front lights scream back from a gaping Munch-like grille. It comes with a choice of three engines – a&nbsp;pair of 3-litre V6s with 340 or 380bhp and a 5-litre V8 \"big daddy\" with 495bhp. All are supercharged. Sports-car purists love a manual gear change, the F-Type only comes as an automatic, but they'll be happy with the crispness of the car's \"Quickshift\" eight-speed which leaves you to blip up and down the gears with your fingers on the steering-wheel paddles.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416527681'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/9/4/1378311290601/Martin-and-Kitty-008.jpg' alt='Martin and Kitty' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sunshine motoring: Martin and Kitty, his young co-pilot. Photograph: Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Inside, it's leathery, roomy, posh. Of course it is, it's a luxury sports car. It also boasts a few \"surprise and delight\" details: copper is used for some of the buttons, instead of boring old chrome, and the air vents rise up out of the dashboard when you start the ignition, as if the car is coming alive. This same impression begins before you even get into the car. From a distance, press \"open\" on the fob and the door handles ease out from where they've been hiding, flush to the flanks. It's an Alice in Wonderland moment, as if the car is saying: \"Open me.\" You climb in and there's a copper-coloured button saying: \"Start me.\" Press it and… oooph… the… noise… it is <em>so</em> loud. Crackling, burbling, moaning, snapping – maybe you should call for an exorcist. Pull the gear lever into D and the F is <em>off!</em></p><p>Will the Jaguar cope with the pressure of expectation?

Either way it is clearly an issue for today's motorists – and a source of friction among many couples. My neighbour walks away from the car when his wife is at the wheel. \"She says she can't do it  if I am watching,\" he sighs – as if she is going to the loo. Perhaps because  of this manufacturers have spent  a fortune over the past decade on  a plethora of \"parking aids\" (marital aids might have been a better name). There are front and rear proximity sensors; rear, front and even side-view cameras (my children love gurning under the number plate so I can see their contorted faces on the dashboard); bird's-eye positioning graphics; and technology which means you just let go of the steering wheel and the vehicle will parallel park itself.</p><p>Yet these devices are missing the point. The real issue with parking is spaces – or lack of them. <a href=\"https://www.parkatmyhouse.com/\" title=\"\">ParkatmyHouse</a>, a company that lets drivers park in private spaces at homes, schools and elsewhere, has estimated that the average city motorist spends six minutes and 45 seconds looking for a space, which adds up to a colossal 2,500 hours over a lifetime. Forget worrying about kerbing your alloys or scraping the bumper – you've got a space, rejoice!</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-415005021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376481508188/interior-lexus-008.jpg' alt='interior lexus' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A vision in beige: Alan Partridge would certainly approve of this interior colour scheme.

Mention Lexus to most people and they will tell you one of two things: first, that it stands for Luxury Exports to the US – the acronym Toyota apparently used when developing the range for the American market; and second that David Cameron and Alan Partridge were both owners. If you can stand the stigma of driving the motoring equivalent of posh smugness or hilarious offensiveness (you decide which is which), your Lexus will repay you handsomely.<br /><br />What is crucial about this GS 450 is the h and the F – it is both a hybrid and a graduate of the marque's Mount Fuji race-tuning programme. Lexus claims that its new GS is \"the most technologically advanced production vehicle in the world\". Even allowing for unseemly aggrandisement that's quite a boast. But they're not far off the mark. The GS is a V6-powered luxury saloon as quick to 60mph as the top flight of performance Audis, BMWs, Mercedes and Porsches, yet thanks to its eco-technology it is as clean and efficient as many cars  half its size. In many ways this is what the future of performance four-door motoring will look like. The petrol engine is harnessed to two electric engines: one functions as a generator and starter, the other provides the oomph needed to take  a hybrid to 155mph.</p><p>To drive the GS is whisper quiet, effortless and nimble. Choose between the eco and comfort setting for around town and the sport and sport plus (possibly an unnecessary 11 on volume) for Huhne-ing down the motorway. Floor it and you get an almighty shove in the behind, like your porch rocker has been lassoed by a galloping cowboy.</p><p>Inside, the car is comfortable but surprisingly basic. Yes, there's leather and chrome, and a clever finger-light remote-touch mouse makes navigating the satnav a doddle, but for a car of this price it doesn't have that sense of privilege: we want more Bullingdon and less Butlins. Outside, the car looks quiet, almost apologetic. It's both a sports car and a saloon, a cruiser and an eco wagon – a true hybrid, and as such Lexus could do with shouting about it. And if you  do happen to find a place in front of your house, you want the neighbours to know about it...</p><p>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/martinlove\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/martinlove</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>","internalOctopusCode":"7897501","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-08-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1950619","internalContentCode":"415004268","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"<p>The new Lexus is not only eco-friendly and quiet, its power would please Alan Partridge, <strong>says Martin Love</strong></p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Lexus GS 450h F-Sport: car review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Love","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376481351178/Lexus-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"47","internalStoryPackageCode":"49569","commentCloseDate":"2013-08-21T09:30:00Z","standfirst":"The new Lexus is not only eco-friendly and quiet, its power would please Alan Partridge","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-05T16:13:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/lexus-gs-450h-f-sport-car-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/aug/18/lexus-gs-450h-f-sport-car-review","sectionName":"Technology","tags":[{"id":"technology/series/wheels","webTitle":"Wheels","description":"Martin Love covers new models, developments in the motoring industry and quirky tales from the highways and byways of the world of transport","type":"series","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/wheels","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/series/wheels","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/motoring","webTitle":"Motoring","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/motoring","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/motoring","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology","type":"keyword","sectionId":"technology","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/technology","sectionName":"Technology","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","webTitle":"Life & style","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine/life-and-style","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/magazine","webTitle":"Observer Magazine","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/magazine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/magazine","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martinlove","webTitle":"Martin Love","rcsId":"GNL004707","r2ContributorId":"16079","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/30/1254318000497/martin_love.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"love","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Love is the motoring editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.
