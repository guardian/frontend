But sometimes the teacher seems to mumble or fudge rather than give you a straight reply. Here are truthful answers to some common questions ...</p> <p><strong>I want to ask how my child is doing in relation to her classmates. My question makes teachers look very uncomfortable.</strong> </p> <p>I understand their discomfort. The sense of weighing and measuring one child against others, as opposed to against common standards, can seem like a betrayal of a group of young people whom we teachers also feel a duty of care towards. If I tell you that your child is doing better than Rachel, then I’m telling you how Rachel is doing as well, and you don’t really have a right or need to know that. When pushed, I’ve ventured that a child is in the top/middle/bottom third of the class. However, a better question (being top of a weak class is not necessarily a great achievement) – and the one I ask for my own children – is: “Are they where you’d want them to be at this point?” Teachers will happily tell you whether your child is doing better/similarly/worse than they’d expect, and what appropriate action can be taken.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, what you really want is some sort of gloat-ready statistics that you can post on Facebook about how your child leaves her friends in the dust, then I’ll deliberately spill my cup of tea in your lap while I talk really loudly about her being rock-bottom of the entire school. You sad individual.</p> <p><strong>Why are school reports so formulaic? They say nothing personal about my child. Don’t the teachers know her?</strong></p> <p>Partly this is the inevitable outcome of the bean-counting culture in our education system, where children become numbers on spreadsheets, rather than individuals to be developed. Schools aren’t trying to be distant, but they’ve been told by Ofsted that providing data is how they will be judged, and that parents care only about test results, so that’s what tends to be presented.</p> <p>However, it’s partly a feasibility thing: most secondary school teachers will see hundreds of students each week, often for less than an hour and in the company of 29 other students. So unless your child is really naughty (always the ones whose names are learned first), then it’ll take a while before the teacher can say much about them other than stock phrases based around assessment outcomes. By the way, since you asked, the order in which I learn names is: naughty, ginger, loud, funny, very high/low ability, tall, the rest. If your child is quiet, well-behaved, with brownish hair and of average height, it’s going to take me a little longer ...</p> <p><strong>What do these ‘levels’ mean and what do they tell me about how my child is doing?</strong></p> <p>Levels were initially supposed to give you an idea of how your child was doing at the end of each key stage. So by the end of primary school, most children were expected to be able to be “working at” level 4, and by the end of year 9, most would reach level 5. These were supposed to be approximations reached by teacher judgment considering all their work over the previous year, and based on reasonable expectations of achievement based on the national profile. They were never intended either to be used to mark individual pieces of work, or to provide some sort of measurement of endlessly rising linear progression. Unfortunately, Ofsted’s limitless demands for numbers on spreadsheets have meant that’s exactly how they ended up being used, which led us to all sorts of bonkers places, such as awarding students “sub-levels” (which don’t actually exist in most subjects in secondary school – we have to make them up), and demanding that most children achieve a level by the end of primary school which the original authors of levels thought would not be achieved by the majority of children even at the end of year 9.</p> <p>Throw in the new performance-related pay system, in which teachers are told their careers depend on ensuring that all children hit inflated “aspirational” targets based on these non-existent sub-levels, and you’ll understand why the abolition of levels last year was one of the few things Michael Gove did which didn’t arouse universal derision. Unfortunately, he didn’t replace levels with anything sensible or useful, but simply instructed schools to make up their own assessment systems. So levels may have been misused and inaccurate, but compared to the smorgasbord of half-baked individual measurement systems on the way, they were the essence of clarity.</p> <p><strong>Why hasn’t my son reached his target level in some subjects, when he works really hard and is very bright?</strong></p> <p>As explained above, targets are often pretty meaningless, and their purpose is more to beat teachers and schools than to help your son. Nevertheless, if there’s an assessment, then the teacher should be able to explain how it was marked, and why the result went one way as opposed to another (whatever measurement system is used). In your case, I’d listen, as given that the teacher’s pay is probably dependent upon your son hitting whatever target has been spat out of the school’s “aspirational” spreadsheets, the fact that he’s still been marked as missing it suggests he has an honest teacher who’ll be able to give you decent feedback.</p> <p><strong>My son is constantly being praised for ‘teaching the other children’ or ‘helping people with their maths’? Is he doing your job for you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Why must my daughter do all this group work? She always gets mixed in with children who can’t be bothered, and she ends up doing all the work.</strong></p> <p>I was a bright kid often asked to help others, and I, too, was peeved at school when I was having to carry the load for the group while Alice fiddled with her hair and Kathryn drew rude pictures on Tom’s book. However, there is a lot of pretty convincing evidence that one of the best ways to secure and improve both knowledge and understanding is not to receive it from others, but to deliver it to others. So in situations where children are helping other children learn, they are almost certainly learning more themselves than if they were passively receiving instruction from the teacher. So, while it may seem annoying at the time, feel free to come back and compare exam results with the freeloaders in a year or two, and see if you’re still miffed about your child having to do the group’s presentation on the similarities between the Stasi and Ofsted on their own.</p> <p><strong> I reported a boy for bullying and although the school seemed to take it seriously I never heard the outcome. Why not? </strong></p> <p>Schools do take bullying very seriously. If unaddressed it can escalate in the classroom, even though much of it now takes place outside school, particularly online. It is a very difficult situation because often it’s a “he-said-she-said” situation with little, or no, hard evidence. Nevertheless, even without evidence, action will usually be taken to reduce contact between protagonists, and a watchful eye will be kept. Remember that just because you didn’t hear about an outcome doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. It’s important to bear in mind that both parties in a bullying situation are children, and often bullying results from a difficult background situation for the bully, and so it wouldn’t be appropriate for the school to share details with the parent of another child. I know that can be frustrating, but the issue to focus on is whether the bullying stops, not whether revenge has been duly visited on the bully.</p> <p>• The writer is a history teacher and blogs under the name of Disappointed Idealist (<a href=\"http://disidealist.wordpress.com/\">http://disidealist.wordpress.com</a>)</p> <h2>Teachers Translated: what they say and what they mean</h2> <p><strong>Primary schools</strong></p> <p><strong>1 ‘So, how do you think she’s settled in?’</strong></p> <p>Parents always react to this as if I were making idle chitchat. But it’s actually important to me and I need an honest response. If your child is showing any signs of unhappiness at all, hopefully there is time for us to get to the bottom of it so that a) we can make her happy again and b) her learning won’t be impeded.</p> <p><strong>2 ‘She’s quite a character’</strong></p> <p>Even the most stone-hearted teacher loves to have lively children in their class, but if a teacher makes this sort of comment it might be that your child is sending out worrying signals. Could she be crying out for attention and, if so, why? Is she parked in front of a screen for most of the time at home to keep her quiet or occupied? If so, it’s little wonder that she may want an audience when that screen isn’t around. While getting laughs from her peers might make her feel good, it won’t help her learning. It might be time to limit the screen time and have a few conversations in which you listen to her.</p> <p><strong>3 ‘I’d like to see him contribute more to class discussion.’</strong></p> <p>Some children genuinely lack self-confidence. If this is the case I’ll tell you so in a heartbeat, and we could discuss a few strategies to build his self-esteem or speaking skills. Some children, on the other hand, don’t lack confidence in class yet for some reason they choose to sit and watch others put up their hands in discussion. If I use this phrase, it’s because he’s a bright kid, and I think he – and the rest of the class – would benefit from him sharing his ideas more readily. It would be great if we could both encourage him to do so, and shower him with praise when he does.</p> <p><strong>4 ‘He needs to take more responsibility for his own learning.’</strong></p> <p>I’m telling you, regretfully, that he’s bone idle. Could it be that he is is too used to having everything done for him at home? If he can’t think for himself, he’ll be in for a major shock at secondary school. He needs to learn responsibility, and fast; a few chores around the house in exchange for his weekly pocket money would be a good way to support this at home.</p> <p><strong>Secondary and FE</strong></p> <p><strong>5. ‘His written work is inconsistent.’ </strong></p> <p>Your son’s arts course isn’t just painting, acting and drama games. He needs to put hard hours in on the theory as well as the practical stuff, because written work will count for just as much when it comes to his final grade. Unless he starts taking this side of things seriously, he’ll end up losing that university place to somebody else who does. It would be great if you could join me in reminding him of this as often as I seem to be doing.</p> <p><strong>6 ‘This subject doesn’t come naturally to him/her …’</strong></p> <p>See also: <strong>‘Needs to apply herself a little bit more.’ </strong></p> <p>To be blunt, he’s going to fail unless he pulls his finger out. We can discuss a variety of intervention strategies and extra revision, but I really need you to limit the X-Box. Coming up with a structured work/play timetable nailed to the fridge at home – particularly in the run-up to exam time – would be a good start.</p> <p><strong>7 </strong>(to child at parents’ evening) <strong>‘How do you think you are getting on? Tell me about your progress this year.’</strong></p> <p>Sorry. It’s nothing personal, but I’ve been sitting in this chair for the past three hours, and I physically can’t talk any more.</p> <p><strong>Other phrases translated:</strong></p> <p><strong>‘When you apply yourself you can create some really good work’</strong></p> <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Timmy needs to knuckle down and work harder.</p> <p><strong>‘Can be a little chatty’ </strong></p> <p><strong>Translation: </strong>REALLY disruptive.</p> <p><strong>‘Please remind me what time your appointment is?’ </strong></p> <p><strong>Translation:</strong> I have absolutely no idea who you are or what your child is called.</p> <p>By @Super_Work</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9721359","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2204817","internalRevision":"26","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Some honest replies to the issues that seem to make teachers squirm.

Photograph: Handout/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>In the 1860s when the Austrian ambassador complained to the home secretary, Sir George Grey, about Karl Marx and other revolutionaries, he received a brief and dismissive reply: “Under our laws, mere discussion of regicide, so long as it does not concern the Queen of England and so long as there is no definite plan, does not constitute sufficient grounds for the arrest of the conspirators.”</p> <p>Not quite what the current home secretary would have replied, I suspect. Theresa May is rushing yet another terrorism bill through parliament. This will place a legal duty on universities to ban radical speakers – “mere discussion” in the words of her Liberal predecessor, who probably also took a more favourable view of being labelled “radical”.</p> <p>Fifty years ago Malcolm X came to speak in Oxford, an episode now recalled to stir the sentimental memories of the university’s alumni. Today, of course, he would never have made it to Oxford; the UK Border Agency would have turned him back at Heathrow. After all even the very silly, but vile, Julien Blanc, the seducers’ guru, has been banned.</p> <p>Malcolm X would probably have fared better in his homeland. The United States remains a nation of laws girded by a constitution, despite police shootings and protest riots. Sadly the United Kingdom is rapidly becoming a nation of ministerial discretion and direction, ever wider administrative powers that would probably have more than satisfied the 19th-century Prussian and Austrian bureaucrats who were so worried about Marx.</p> <p>Under May’s new legislation, universities will have to follow the “guidance” issued by the Home Office. If they fail to follow it, the home secretary will be able to issue them with “directions”. Far from being regarded as institutions in which the most vigorous (and contested) debates should be encouraged, higher education institutions are now to be treated as fertile ground for the “radicalisation” of gullible students by supporters of “extremism”.</p> <p>This is not the first time the government has introduced legislation to require universities to ban “extremist” speakers, although paradoxically the first political intervention back in the 1980s was to stop universities, and student unions, banning rightwing speakers, extremists of another ilk.</p> <p>But this initial, and rather one-sided, libertarianism was quickly succeeded by more authoritarian interventions. Until now, the centrepiece has been the “Prevent” strategy, begun under Labour and revamped by the current government.</p> <p>The 2011 white paper asserted the government’s “absolute commitment to defending freedom of speech”. But, in the very next sentence, it argued that preventing terrorism meant that “extremist (but non-violent) views” had to be “challenged” – by the administrative measures it then outlined. We have travelled a long road from Grey’s reply to the ambassador.</p> <p>There is so much wrong with the new legislation. The key terms such as radicalisation, extremism and terrorism will be defined by politicians who are advised by securitocrats, cowed by tabloid-inflamed public opinion and influenced by electoral advantage.</p> <p>These definitions will not only, and inevitably, be politicised but are also likely to be expandable and open-ended. Those who express their opposition to UK interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Syria, possibly in ill-judged rhetorical language, could well be caught in the net.</p> <p>Mission drift is also inevitable. Previous anti-terrorist legislation has been used to spy on parents who might be mis-reporting their home addresses to get their children into popular schools. Botched, but costly, spying on environmental protesters has also been justified under legislation that clearly had entirely different intentions.</p> <p>But the major objection is two-fold. First, academic freedom, like freedom of speech, is not something to be name-checked and then undermined. It is a fundamental principle, not because ivory-tower dons deserve to be indulged but because free universities are an essential component of a free society. The free expression of even the most detestable views should only be curbed by the most precise necessity – back to Grey’s Whiggish formula.</p> <p>In the case of universities, there is an extra argument. If the war on terror has demonstrated anything, it has shown how little we in the west understand the feelings of others, or know about the countries we have invaded/liberated. To risk curbing that understanding and knowledge by discouraging the engagement and dialogue required by scholars and researchers seems perverse.</p> <p>Second, banning “extremist” speakers is a counsel of despair. It accepts that such views are so seductive that they can only be suppressed. There is no confidence that, in the battle of ideas, values of openness, tolerance and liberty – those much lauded “British” values – will triumph, so we must be closed, intolerant and authoritarian (rather like the extremists we seek to oppose?).</p> <p>Sadly higher education leaders, with their default pro-establishment setting, will not make these arguments – or only behind closed doors. May and her successors are unlikely to have to issue any “directions” to universities because her “guidance” will be so closely followed. In England, even amid this “clash of civilisations”, discreet pragmatism will always take precedence over open and principled debate.</p> <p>Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies, Institute of Education</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9812089","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2200163","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"By forcing universities – the home of vigorous debate – to ban radical speakers we are adopting closed, intolerant values, says <strong>Peter Scott</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Anti-terror measures will make us the ‘extremists’ we fear","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Scott","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T06:59:08.482Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417099954728/Theresa-May-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43yxe","wordcount":"845","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417099954728/Theresa-May-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54773824e4b08fbd11e1b0f9","newspaperPageNumber":"41","internalStoryPackageCode":"82755","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T06:59:08Z","standfirst":"By forcing universities – the home of vigorous debate – to ban radical speakers we are adopting closed, intolerant values","linkText":"Anti-terror measures will make us the ‘extremists’ we fear | Peter Scott","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-02T06:59:08.482Z","internalContentCode":"452709709"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/anti-terror-measures-make-us-extremists","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/anti-terror-measures-make-us-extremists","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"11960f34cec55efea284972289290d77257aba81","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417099961102/Theresa-May-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*48439517","suppliersReference":"LON002","altText":"Theresa May","caption":"Theresa May is pushing a terrorism bill through parliament which will place a legal duty on universities to ban radical speakers.

We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.”</p> <p>Though David Cameron used the word “state” in front of “multiculturalism”, his speech was widely reported as telling us that it was the bit about living our “different cultures” that had been a disaster. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12371994\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC website wrote</a>: “In frank language he made abundantly clear he believes multiculturalism has failed.”</p> <p>At the time, I didn’t hear anyone in government rushing to correct any ambiguity around what the prime minister actually said. The “vision” that teachers should “provide” has turned out to be the “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/michael-gove-british-values-curriculum\" title=\"\">basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs</a>”.</p> <p>I guess we’re supposed to lay to one side the fact that these owe plenty to universalist ideas originating in France, the US and the United Nations rather than to something specifically British. The message I get here is that in education, we don’t need to bother about being historically accurate. Or is talking about “values” in a universal way in itself dangerously multicultural?</p> <p>Cameron’s speech came early on in this government. Subsequently, we’ve been offered free schools. People like me have opposed these on the grounds that they get in the way of providing the same educational opportunities to all children and can lead to the absurd situation I heard played out on Radio 4’s Today programme in which a local authority is accused of not intervening in so-called problem schools over which it has no control – as has happened in Tower Hamlets recently. How handy for you that it wasn’t you being grilled by the interviewer. And yet, in your government’s rush to create schools controlled by your office, it’s your office that encourages “state multiculturalism”, which according to Cameron leads to us having “separate lives”, and can result in “Islamist extremism” and “terrorism”.</p> <p>I nipped over to the “<a href=\"http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/what-are-free-schools/find-a-free-school\" title=\"\">Find a free school near you</a>” page at the New Schools Network site and found more than 30 schools which appear to provide a culturally specific faith ethos, whether that’s dubbed Islamic, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, Church of England or Catholic.</p> <p>I fully concede that this is a guess – and people will correct me if I’m wrong – but I doubt if there are many Muslims in the Jewish schools on this list, nor let’s say, many Catholics in the Hindu schools, or Jews in the Hindu schools … and so on. Doesn’t that encourage people to lead “separate lives”? When people set up free schools with a faith name on the board outside, don’t they tend to give off a signal about who’s welcome to come inside? Why else set them up?</p> <p>I gather that these days, I’m what’s known as “ethnically Jewish”. I could set up an “ethnically Jewish” school, couldn’t I? I could agree to abide by all the conditions on your website; on the board outside my school I could write “The Michael Rosen Ethnically Jewish School”. If I set this up in north London, say, I can imagine that it might attract a few parents.</p> <p>And what would I have achieved? I would have pulled some children out of schools where they had mixed with children of many faiths, no faith, many cultures and mixed cultures. Ofsted would of course pop in to make sure I was teaching “British values” so I would take care to not call them “universal”. Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11253436/Ofsted-rural-schools-failing-to-promote-British-values.html\" title=\"\">as Ofsted have instructed some rural schools recently</a>, I’d have to teach “diversity” even as we were practising the opposite.</p> <p>As I thought some more about my ethnically Jewish school, I wondered what kind of encouragement would the state give me, even though Cameron has warned me of the dangers of this? This time I nipped over to the government’s own website to see what kind of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326402/201407v3_Single_FA_mainstream_published.pdf\" title=\"\">financial assistance</a> I might expect from your office.</p> <p>Here I learned that: “The secretary of state will pay grants towards recurrent expenditure and may pay grants towards capital expenditure” for my free school. Recurrent expenditure “means any money spent on the establishment, conduct, administration and maintenance” of my school, apart from the  capital expenditure which means expenditure on such things as: “acquiring land and buildings”; and “such other items … of a substantial or enduring nature which the secretary of state agrees are capital expenditure...” This may also include “funding for any other costs to the academy [or free school] which the secretary of state considers necessary”.</p> <p>That’s quite a lot of “encouragement”.

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>We had all been waiting with dread for the Bristol child sexual exploitation case to end, as it did on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/27/guilty-prostitution-bristol-rape-girls-sex-abuse-somali\" title=\"\">Thursday</a>. The police and local authority had briefed secondary headteachers twice in preparation this term. For those of us who’d been paying attention to the local press, we had read of a large number of men being arrested and charged nearly a year ago. Last week, 13 men were convicted of systematic sexual abuse, and 49 other individuals are now being investigated. But while we’ve been waiting for the trials to end, it has hardly been quiet in our own schools. Child sex exploitation on such a large, organised scale is shocking and rare, but we spend too many of our days working with devastating individual cases that don’t draw as much attention.</p> <p>Every week another child protection case comes to light at my school. Sadly, the children do not always perceive themselves to be victims and therefore referrals to the police can sometimes lead nowhere. A year-9 girl returned from a few weeks’ absence and regaled her PSHE class with details about her work as a prostitute. When we expressed concern, she simply told us not to worry: no one slapped her around; she could look after herself.</p> <p>A year-11 boy in similar circumstances reassured us that men couldn’t be prostitutes, he was just helping his mum with the rent and she knew all about it.</p> <p>These are extreme examples but there are more children being exploited every day. Waiting for Operation Brooke, as it was called, to become public meant everyone would stop and point at Bristol for a while. But it is more complex than that.</p> <p>We were fairly confident that none of our current or ex-students were among the victims in these cases, but in a city as small as Bristol the associations will ripple out to most schools. It could so easily have been one of our children: we can tick off the at-risk factors for so many. We have children who are looked-after and in care. Some of our students attend a pupil referral unit (PRU), where they meet other vulnerable children. Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period. Parents do not always keep them at home for these days, so where are they? I am very aware that when I make a decision about a child, such as sending them to a PRU, I may risk making that child even more vulnerable. But there are simply not enough alternatives on offer to me as a headteacher.</p> <p>Of course, I always report every incident to the police if appropriate; we also report things to social services. But the thresholds for them to take action are high, and getting higher.</p> <p>Every week I become aware that another of my students has made and distributed an indecent image of a child. Usually it’s a girl who has taken a naked photo of herself and sent it to someone she trusted. The now ex-boyfriend has shown his friends, or her friend has found it and put it on Facebook as a joke. Each time the fallout is incredible for these children, but the police are not really interested. And unless there was coercion involved, social services may not be able to help either.</p> <p>I’ve sat in meetings with parents who have joked it off, said that it is “just one of those things”. I’ve even heard them say: “If Facebook had been around when I was 13, I’d have been doing the same.”</p> <p>There is simply not enough support for my staff to help vulnerable children, let alone try to educate them. Referrals to Early Help can take weeks; a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) months; educational psychologists are overworked. If something happens and I need some immediate support – imagine a girl is raped, or a boy watches his mother beaten up – it can take for ever. We can offer sympathy, comfort, somewhere to cry, but we are not specialists and I worry that we might do more damage without realising it. It comes down to a few charities helping out as much as they can – and their caseloads are heaving. In Bristol, they will be even heavier now.</p> <p>It’s far too easy to think that all victims are girls in care. But the behaviours they often demonstrate in care may have been learned in abusive families – sometimes they are being prostituted by their own relatives and therefore have an altered concept of what is right and wrong. More needs to be done, far earlier, to prevent such behaviours becoming normal.</p> <p>Taking children away is usually too little too late, and you have to know that the abuse is there. Schools are a universal service, and sustained and robust education could do a great deal. A couple of lessons a year on respectful relationships will do nothing to counter what is happening at home.</p> <p>Even before it finished, the Bristol trial had already created problems. Last week, one of my students reacted violently against a friend who had called her mum a name. The insult about her mother was a racial slur linked directly to Operation Brooke. Just over a year ago this girl’s mum had died; she’d been coerced into prostitution by a boyfriend who’d also introduced her to drugs. The end was tragic.</p> <p>What was I to do about the girl’s outburst? I could internally exclude her – but she was in an internal exclusion when this happened. I called home and her grandmother came to get her. But within an hour, Grandma called to say she had run away to meet friends in town. I’ve no idea how to help this girl – she refuses counselling or any other support. Just as she was settling back into a new kind of normal, this happens.</p> <p>She is not alone. The shocking headlines open old wounds for many children. There are children, and adults, all across Bristol who are reeling this week. Multiply that across Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford …</p> <p>One of the greatest strains on us now in school is a breakdown in race relations. Some parts of Bristol are very multicultural, but other areas – like mine – are steadfastly white and working class. There are EDL flags in windows. Racist language is common, along with sexism and homophobia. We are on a constant crusade to develop inclusivity and tolerance and to combat ingrained rage.</p> <p>Nearly 40% of our families have neither parent working; 15% have never worked; we have twice as many children on free school meals as those who pay. Most of our children have never been into the centre of Bristol, let alone been on a holiday. For many of these children, all of whose consciousness is post-2001, anyone different from them is a terrorist, an illegal immigrant, a job-stealer or a sex attacker. I have spent the last month redoubling our focus on combating racism in preparation for the Operation Brooke verdict.</p> <p>The executive summary in the Rotherham inquiry identified some professionals not wanting to target Asian men as predators for fear of being racist; my own fear about the racist response to Operation Brooke has already been realised. It is perhaps this aspect that is hardest to deal with. The convicted men are, as a point of fact, of Somalian heritage. We know that does not mean that all Somalian men are sex offenders, but some of the children – and some of their parents – are struggling with this. One morning recently, while waiting for his bus to work, one of my teachers was spat at and called a “Paedo”. He doesn’t live that far from the school.</p> <p>Our jobs are already extremely difficult. Every day we are dealing with smaller one-off cases and struggling to keep our heads above water. I don’t have enough staff; I don’t have enough money, or time, or options available to make a difference.</p> <p>We need small off-site units that students can go to for both education and emotional or lifestyle support. I’d like more one-to-one mentors to work with children in school and at home. We need more access to different types of therapies because one size does not fit all. We need more family workers supporting children and parents from an earlier age.</p> <p>Our communities are struggling and a case on this scale simply makes things harder for us all. I dread to think what else is out there.</p> <p>The author is a headteacher in Bristol</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9759882","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2196827","internalRevision":"14","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","allowUgc":"false","headline":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"A Bristol headteacher","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:30:09.152Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107008142/Child-sex-exploitation-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43gcq","wordcount":"1427","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107008142/Child-sex-exploitation-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f3b62e4b08a4e6205ae5d","newspaperPageNumber":"40","internalStoryPackageCode":"82645","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:30:15Z","standfirst":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","linkText":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-03T00:03:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"452363907"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"f4faa7558615e9f7ba5a9122d418682d568d4237","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107013430/Child-sex-exploitation-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*48534037","suppliersReference":"ACJ094","altText":"Child sex exploitation","caption":"'Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period.

Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<h2>Academy defends huge transport bill</h2> <p>An academy spent £15,000 from its pupil premium money on ferrying students by taxi to school last academic year, Education Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The same school, the Oldham Academy North spent a further £85,000 on free bus travel for pupils living around a mile away, also coming from its pupil premium money, which is designed to raise the test results of disadvantaged pupils. It plans to spend a further £75,000 on bus transport and £13,500 on taxis this academic year. The figures are revealed in documents on the school’s website.</p> <p>The school is part of the troubled E-Act chain, which this year was stripped of 10 of its schools following government concerns about standards.</p> <p>The document shows that in the 2012-13 academic year the school spent £20,750, or 8% of its £261,202 pupil premium funding, on transporting pupils by bus, and a further £8,682 on funding for students with “individual transport issues” getting to school, “coach costs for tours of the new academy to ensure smooth transition” and transport costs for a sports day held at Manchester’s Sportcity stadium.</p> <p>The transport funding is a legacy of the academy moving a mile from the site of its predecessor secondary, Grange school, in April 2013.</p> <p>A source close to the school, where 71% of pupils are eligible for pupil premium funding, says the cash should have been spent supporting children directly in the classroom.</p> <p>We do wonder whether the Education Funding Agency, which distributes academy funding, might take a view on whether this is an effective use of the pupil premium.</p> <p>In a statement, E-Act says: “The academy chose to provide daily transport for the most vulnerable students to ensure that punctuality and attendance would remain at a high level. Using pupil premium funding to support that is entirely appropriate.” E-Act also highlights a high recent pupil attendance rate and Ofsted stating that its free schools meals pupils performed well relative to their peers.</p> <h2>Anger over council leak of inspection report</h2> <p>Parents at a primary school in the Thames Valley are furious after a senior council officer publicly released its “special measures” judgment from an Ofsted inspection before the report had been published.</p> <p>Alison Alexander, director of children’s services for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, sent a message detailing the verdict in a “reply to all” response to parents, many of whom have been campaigning to save the school from being forced into academy status. The parents have been copying in journalists and politicians on their emails to Alexander.</p> <p>At the time of Alexander’s email concerning Bisham Church of England primary school, near Marlowe in Buckinghamshire, parents had not been informed of the Ofsted report results. Her email came nearly a week before the official publication. <a href=\"http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/11602637.Marlow_school_in_special_measures_after__inadequate__Ofsted_controversy/\" title=\"\">The Bucks Free Press ran a story on the verdict the following day</a>.</p> <p>Parent campaigners are now fearful that the school could lose its headteacher of 28 years, Jim Cooke, despite a string of previous good Ofsted reports.</p> <p>Alexander tells us: “The moment the Ofsted report is sent to the school as well as the local authority … it is no longer confidential.” The local authority is now using formal intervention powers to improve standards, she adds, somewhat ominously for the campaigners.</p> <h2>Haringey NUT call off strike action</h2> <p>The National Union of Teachers has called off strike action in Haringey, north London, which arose after the suspension of union rep Julie Davies.</p> <p>To the fury of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2830709/Union-PAYING-teachers-strike-Parents-outrage-NUT-bankrolls-walkouts-official-hasn-t-taught-14-years.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail, which put the story on its front page two weeks ago,</a> two secondary schools were partially closed for three days this month. NUT members had walked out in support of Davies in a dispute over letters sent by groups of secondary and primary headteachers about her work.</p> <p>The secondary heads had suggested their schools would no longer pay for Davies’s working time while she was in post. The union said it would not be told by heads who its representative could be, although the heads denied they were trying to veto NUT members’ choice.</p> <p>Now the NUT says headteachers have agreed to back a proposal that the local schools forum, on which they are represented, would pay into a fund which will continue to support the work of all local union reps, whoever they are. It sounds like relief all round, though we will keep a watching brief on this story.</p> <h2>Ofsted plays down website row with DfE</h2> <p>An impending move to close down Ofsted’s dedicated website provoked a little-noticed row between the inspectorate and the Department for Education, we have discovered.</p> <p>Ofsted is to have all of its online content – including inspection reports on schools across England – transferred to the government’s overarching website, “gov.uk”, by the end of the year.</p> <p>An Ofsted spokesman seemed enthusiastic this month about the move, <a href=\" http://academiesweek.co.uk/no-link-left-behind-for-edu-watchdogs-website-move/\" title=\"\">saying</a>: “The gov.uk portal brings more than 300 public services together under a single web address, making it simpler, clearer and easier for users to find the information they need.”</p> <p>However, minutes of an Ofsted board paper from last December paint a different picture. They say: “Ofsted is currently formally contesting the earlier decision by the Government Digital Service (GDS) not to grant the organisation an exemption from the transition of government digital content to the single gov.uk platform in 2014.”</p> <p>An Ofsted spokeswoman confirmed last week that “initial concerns [from Ofsted] related to the control over content published to the site” but added that the issue had been resolved.</p> <p>She said: “Having sought assurances that Ofsted would retain control over the content published on the site, including all our published reports, we were satisfied that a move to gov.uk would in no way compromise our independence.”</p> <p>Fair enough, but this does look like another behind-the-scenes contretemps between the DfE and the schools watchdog over the latter’s independence, with the two sides at odds a few times this year.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9792261","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2197069","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Warwick Mansell","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591702939/Taxi-sign-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43gyp","wordcount":"982","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591702939/Taxi-sign-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f78a1e4b0f48993abc86a","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:00:06Z","standfirst":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","linkText":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z","internalContentCode":"452381111"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"149b231f70c37f801ff833cf2ca7ef577e622b06","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591709630/Taxi-sign-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"GD*12090980","altText":"Taxi sign","caption":"The Oldham Academy North plans to spend another £13,500 on taxis for pupils in this school year.

Senior figures say that some vice-chancellors have been choosing to retire early – while others are being pushed. The new business ethos inside higher education means university leaders are expected to deliver results and be able to show it.</p> <p>Their plight will not be met with sympathy from all quarters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/10/universities-vice-chancellors-ministers-pay-budget-cut\">Ministers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/02/vice-chancellor-wage-increase-angers-students-unions\">rank-and-file academics and students</a> have all expressed anger about escalating “fatcat” salaries for university leaders, against the backdrop of a public sector pay freeze.</p> <p>Prof Michael Shattock, visiting professor of higher education at the Institute of Education and author of a recent book on good university governance, says that university boards are now subjecting management teams to corporate-style appraisals. “Governing bodies are a good deal more forceful than they used to be, and VCs are a lot more vulnerable than in the past,” he says. “A lot of universities are quite unhappy places at the top.”</p> <p>Dr David Palfreyman, bursar of New College Oxford, says: “Vice-chancellors are being unceremoniously dumped, albeit doubtless with golden parachutes, and this fits with them demanding ever more money over the past decade on the alleged basis that they are dynamic CEOs of mega-enterprises.”</p> <p>And Matt Robb – managing director of Parthenon, a management consultancy that has given strategic advice to universities – agrees: “The market is gradually exposing the failings of universities’ business models, and putting them under a lot of pressure. Some vice-chancellors are responding sensibly, and others idiotically. One problem is that few boards really know enough about how universities work to understand the difference.”</p> <p>Political battles within universities are typically fought quietly, but a recent acrimonious dispute between Wendy Purcell, vice-chancellor of Plymouth University, and her then chair of governors, Judge William Taylor, has rocked the university and the city.</p> <p>Purcell was suspended from her £288,000-a-year post by Taylor in July, following complaints about her conduct. The university has declined to release details about the concerns, or the findings of the inquiry that followed her suspension. Meanwhile Taylor resigned at the end of September following allegations of sexual harassment – which he vigorously denies.</p> <p>Purcell returned to the university on 10 November – and in name she remains vice-chancellor. But Plymouth has confirmed that her deputy, Prof David Coslett, will be in charge of running the university as interim chief executive, a role he took on in her absence. Purcell will have a much smaller portfolio, concentrating on external relations and business engagement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0d37d8e96d0c31540d7630ebfffdf1da75487bc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416595018774/45f83ab0-33b9-431c-86df-3df9bdc5f72b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strikingly, the senior management section of Plymouth’s website no longer includes any mention of Purcell. And senior figures close to the university say that her return is the first stage in a negotiated exit plan. Purcell declined to comment on her change of role.</p> <p>Last week Plymouth’s new chair, James Brent, and Coslett told the Guardian that they were determined to put this conflict behind them. “But that doesn’t mean forgetting about the past,” Coslett says. “We want to learn from our experiences. We will look at our systems of governance and develop and improve them. Our recent experience has made us want to be even more ambitious and an exemplar of good governance for the sector.”</p> <p>Brent, an entrepreneur and chair of Plymouth Argyle football club, says: “It is very important that the organisation has a clear focus on what success looks like. There should be no difference between the board and the executive on that shared view.” He says he is prepared to challenge the senior management team, “but only to improve the organisation”. Both he and Coslett say they are building a new culture of “confidence and trust” in the university. “If it is a relationship of policeman and policed that is not an effective board,” Brent adds.</p> <p>The battle at Plymouth may have been unusually public, but senior academics say this is far from the only example of tensions at the top. The vice-chancellor of one research university says: “If you look at the recent vice-chancellor departures, a lot of them are linked to problems in the institution. In other words, they have been pushed.”</p> <p>There have been some unexpected resignations in recent months, though it is difficult to say if they are due to tensions between boards and their university figureheads. Prof Chris Higgins sparked surprise when he announced in March that he would retire from his £244,000-a-year post as vice-chancellor of Durham University in September. The university, like any forward-looking organisation, he said “needs an injection of new ideas and energy from the top”.</p> <p>In a formal statement at the time the chair of the university council, Robert Gillespie, said that Higgins had told him “some months ago” that he wanted to retire. He confirmed that Higgins would “relinquish all his executive responsibilities” at the end of September, but retain an emeritus role looking after external relations. His deputy has now stepped in as acting vice-chancellor.</p> <p>Last week Southampton University began advertising for a new vice-chancellor. Prof Don Nutbeam announced in July that he intended to retire from the post within two years. Nutbeam is one of the biggest earners in the sector. Last year his salary went up by more than £19,000 to an overall package of £333,000. Other university heads say Southampton has fallen short of its student recruitment targets for the past two years, but a Southampton spokesman said there was no link between the VC’s departure and a shortfall in student numbers: “In a statement to staff and students at the time, the chair of council, Gill Rider, said that Professor Nutbeam’s decision to retire relates directly to his desire to pursue his academic interests in public health.”</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, who proudly states that 20% of his salary is performance related, maintains that hard-hitting commercial questions from governors do universities good: “Let’s be honest, although we aren’t just a business, we are a business, and I need help with some of the big commercial issues. The scrutiny of people with a business background is incredibly helpful,” he says.</p> <p>He adds: “Some boards are over-zealous and micromanage. And equally some management teams try to bounce their board by not telling them things. But in my view any failure of a university is a failure of governance.”</p> <p>Chris Sayers, chair of Northumbria University and a former regional director at BT, believes that in this uncertain climate, boards have a more important role than ever. “Money is now following the student and student-number controls are being relaxed. It means if you don’t get the number of students you need, you don’t get your top line revenue, and that is a massive change. This is competition as never before. People who think we can ignore the business side of this are very much mistaken.” </p> <p>Sayers admits that he has had some “challenging conversations” with the vice-chancellor and his team at Northumbria. “But our relationship is based on trust,” he says. “Without it any institution is in big trouble.”</p> <p>He adds: “The relationship between the university board and the executive is a partnership. And any partnership is like a teabag. You don’t know how strong it is until you put it in hot water.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 26 November 2014.

Photograph: Ableimages/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>It would be churlish of me not to give half a cheer for the latest idea from David Laws. The Liberal Democrat proposal to stop politicians making decisions on the curriculum and assessment is a paler version of a policy I have singularly failed to persuade my own party to adopt for the next general election.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the dividing line between politics and education is in the wrong place. In policy areas such as health, the equivalent of ministers telling teachers how to teach would not happen. To some extent, this is explained by their different approaches to evidence. Education doesn’t have the sort of shared evidence base that is available to medical staff – and politics fills the gap.</p> <p>However, things could be about to change. There is an increasingly powerful voice in education that is calling for a shift in culture from one where ideas seem to re-emerge with a different label every few years to one where we build on evidence of what has gone before.</p> <p>Seeds are being sown; the <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk\" title=\"\">Education Endowment Foundation</a> is spending millions of public money to invest in high-quality research; funding bodies such as the Wellcome Trust and Esmée Fairbairn, universities such as York and Durham, thinktanks such as Nesta are all looking at what might happen if evidence is placed centre stage.</p> <p>Most encouraging of all, teachers are beginning to drive the change. The rapid growth in organisations such as ResearchEd – a grassroots initiative that brings together teachers who want to improve the links with research – shows a thirst to find out what works in the classroom and share it with others.</p> <p>Laws’s idea tries to catch the edge of this revolution but I’m not convinced that he has the right focus or solution. He highlights the curriculum as being the area that should be free from political interference and while I couldn’t defend the constant meddling of recent years, it is a far more complicated than that. The knowledge and skills that children are taught are certainly not a matter just for politicians but neither are they a matter just for teachers, subject experts or universities. We all have a stake.</p> <p>Laws’s solution is to entrust the responsibility to an independent body. Part of the turmoil of recent years has been the constant shift of powers and responsibilities, from government to local authorities to schools to quangos and back again. I can see why an independent body is seen as the answer but the prospect hardly fills me with excitement. Education already has its share of such organisations – Ofqual, Ofsted and the funding agencies, for example, and I’m not convinced that they are seen as significantly different from government.</p> <p>I would focus the debate around where to place the boundary between education and politics on the issue of who decides how teachers should teach – after all, that is what makes the difference.</p> <p>Parties currently have policies on how reading should be taught, whether pupils should be set by ability and even whether teachers should adopt whole-class teaching. Soon, a school’s rating could depend on whether it complies.</p> <p>This is the debate from which politics should be excluded and where the line should be drawn. Pedagogy is becoming a case of opinion and prejudice rather than a decision based on evidence and professional judgment.</p> <p>Although it would be tempting to follow the usual path of giving responsibility for gathering and disseminating evidence to an independent body, we need to be more imaginative. Freedom from unnecessary interference is important, but the users – in this case teachers – need to be able to shape it to meet their needs. The gain might not only be a change in the relationship between politics and education, but for the first time teachers would have access to good quality evidence to inform their decisions. It might have the potential to be a big idea for both politics and education.</p> <p>Estelle Morris is chair of the executive board at the Institute of Effective Education, University of York</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9785715","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2196741","internalRevision":"11","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Instead of political meddling, why don’t we look to rigorous research to decide what works in our classrooms? asks Estelle Morris","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Estelle Morris","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:10:06.863Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571859915/education-research-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43g9y","wordcount":"679","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571859915/education-research-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f2847e4b0770f491f744e","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:10:07Z","standfirst":"I failed to persuade my own party, but I still believe politicians should not tell teachers how to teach","linkText":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence | Estelle Morris","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:10:07.000Z","internalContentCode":"452356962"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"669122a631ce5278f0973914ce8a608c87351766","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571865333/education-research-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*3863547","suppliersReference":"200522794-001","altText":"education research","caption":"'The knowledge and skills that children are taught are not a matter just for politicians … we all have a stake in it.'

After five years, if all goes to plan, she will end up with a permanent job. What makes her promotion unusual is that Latham was appointed to the role on a part-time basis only a few weeks after returning to work from maternity leave. “I haven’t seen this kind of prestigious role offered part-time anywhere else,” she says. “Normally if you are looking for a part-time position, you are looking at term-time teaching roles.”</p> <p>Latham is one of the lucky ones. Female academics find it disproportionately difficult to juggle their career and parenthood. Fewer professors, lecturers and researchers at some leading universities are taking maternity leave than in 2010, while at others there has been little or no improvement.</p> <p>If more women were being promoted into staff and senior jobs, the numbers taking maternity leave would rise. Instead they are stagnating, or, worryingly, in some cases, falling. That’s the finding of new research by Education Guardian and comes as figures published on Tuesday reveal a persistent pay gap, the continued dominance of men in senior roles, and very few permanent part-time academic jobs.</p> <p>We surveyed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/02/university-league-tables-2015-the-complete-list\">top 10 institutions</a> in the 2015 Guardian university league table for the numbers of professors, associate professors and lecturers taking maternity leave. In 2010, the average number of academics who took maternity leave at these universities was 14. By 2013 it had dipped slightly to 12. At Cambridge and St Andrews, though, the numbers have fallen more dramatically. While in 2010, 13 Cambridge professors and lecturers went on maternity leave, by 2013 this number had dropped to six. At St Andrews, the number fell from 14 to six in the same period. Is it a statistical blip, or a worrying trend?</p> <p>Women in academia take less time off to have a baby than those in other careers, the research found. The average length of maternity leave at Cambridge and St Andrews, for example, was 187 days and 138 days respectively in 2013. That’s well below the norm: figures from the Department for Work and Pensions suggests the typical length of maternity leave is 273 days. At both universities the length of leave has fallen since 2010. Out of the top 10 institutions in the Guardian league table, six were able to provide data on the length of maternity leave taken by academics. The average was 191 days.</p> <p>“It’s much more difficult for academics to take maternity leave than support staff or administrators in higher education,” says Ellen Pugh, senior policy adviser at the <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk\">Equality Challenge Unit</a>, a charity seeking to improve diversity in higher education.</p> <p>The ECU’s annual data report, published on Tuesday, shows how pervasive the dominance of men in academia still is. More than three times as many men as women hold professorships; there are more than twice as many male department heads and there are still only 35 female vice-chancellors (out of 170), the report found.</p> <p>And then there’s the pay. Whereas the majority of women earned less than £42,000, most men earned more than that. Nearly three-quarters of roles paying more than £57,000 were held by men. Overall, there is a 13.6% median pay gap between male and female academics and it is not closing.</p> <p>Close to two-thirds of full-time academics are men, whereas more than half of part-time academics are women. But many of these part-time roles are either hourly teaching or fixed-term research contracts and maternity pay for these academics is usually a lot less generous, according to figures this year from the Universities and Colleges Union. Only 6.9% of academic senior management roles are part time, the ECU report shows.</p> <p>“A lot of women end up taking poorly paid contracts once they have children, rather than permanent jobs,” says Deborah Sugg Ryan, associate professor of history and theory of design at Falmouth University.</p> <p>These contracts themselves can make taking maternity leave difficult. Fay Davies, now a research fellow in the school of the built environment at Salford University but previously a meteorologist, says it is a particular problem in the sciences. “The contracts are getting shorter and shorter. If you have got a three-year contract you can probably fit in a maternity leave, but if it is only for one year, it makes maternity leave very problematic.”</p> <p>In meteorology, she says: “So many women opt not to have children. Pregnancy is almost seen as unprofessional.”</p> <p>Job shares are even rarer. When Harriet Atkinson’s third child was born in 2012, she was eligible only for statutory maternity pay. On her return to work, Atkinson, now on a part-time lecturer contract at Brighton University, wanted to find a permanent position. “Because a lot of permanent jobs are full time, I tried to apply for a job share. My job share partner and I got to the final interview stage, only to be asked how we would work it if we had to go on a research trip for 10 days at a time. So of course we didn’t get the job as neither of us could juggle that with small children.”</p> <p>But some universities are bucking the trend. Partners Julia Böttcher and Peter Allen are both assistant professors of mathematics at the London School of Economics. The couple, who have two children, are highly unusual in that they applied to work at the university in 2011 as a job share (although they are now treated as separate part-time workers). In addition, they have benefited from the LSE’s generous parental leave system. When their second child was born in May, Böttcher took 18 weeks’ maternity leave at full pay, while Allen is now a few weeks into his 16 weeks’ paternity leave (also at full pay). UCU figures show many universities still pay only the statutory minimum: the first six weeks at 90% pay, then 33 weeks at statutory maternity pay – currently £138.18 a week.</p> <p>“Everyone was very positive and no one complained I was taking so much time off,” says Allen. Böttcher was offered the option to have a reduced teaching load for one semester. Both are also able to do some work from home.</p> <p>Oxford University, meanwhile, has seen the number of professors and associate professors taking maternity leave increase 18% from 2010 levels to 26 in 2013. A spokesman says this is partly because of the generous maternity pay, but also the support given to returning mothers. The university is one of those that offer a phased return following maternity leave, where women may gradually increase their hours. Oxford, like Cambridge, also has a returning carers’ scheme, which allows academic and research staff to apply for cash awards to support their return to work.</p> <p>Changes to how research is assessed should make it easier for female academics to maintain their research ratings, another factor that has hindered longer periods of maternity leave. The Research Assessment Exercise, the last of which took place in 2008, did not take account of any career breaks, but the new Research Excellence Framework, due to report next month, has reduced the research expectations for parents who have taken maternity leave or additional paternity leave beyond two weeks.</p> <p>Some universities compete for the ECU’s <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/athena-swan/\">Athena Swan</a> and gender equality <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/gender-equality-charter-mark/\">Charter Mark </a>schemes, which promote women’s representation in science and humanities departments respectively. Both schemes take account of how pregnancy, maternity leave and women’s return to work are managed. “We put a lot of effort, not just centrally, but at school level, to make it easy for women to take maternity leave,” says Yvonne Galligan, of Queen’s University Belfast, one of only five silver-level Athena Swan institutions. “The university expects that women going on maternity will be able to take it without worrying that their work will pile up and force them to come back early.”</p> <p>Responding to Cambridge’s maternity leave figures, a spokesman says: “We recognise that there are challenges for many staff when returning from maternity leave and have introduced various policies and initiatives to support the careers of academics.” Cambridge is also an institutional Athena Swan silver award winner.</p> <p>A spokesman for the University of St Andrews says: “These figures are very small and cannot be taken as evidence of a trend; as fluctuations are inevitable in such a small sample. However we are not complacent, and have introduced a single equality outcomes scheme, put in place an equal pay statement, introduced flexible working, and created a female academic networking scheme.”</p> <p>Back at Liverpool, Latham’s boss, Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health, says encouraging part-time and flexible working is a no-brainer. “It makes sense. Otherwise you are handicapping half of your workforce,” he says. “You have to create an environment and structures where women can really excel. If you cut people some slack when they need it, then they really appreciate it and more than pay it back.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sian Elvin</em></p> <p><em>• </em>This article was amended on 19 November 2014.

That is wrong, because it will potentially mess up the lives of children turning 16 this academic year. So let’s talk about it.</p> <p>For the past 14 years, if you sat A-levels, your final grade was based on a number of exams taken at different points across your two years of study. If you did badly at one, you could resit. Beyond giving more opportunities for improving grades, this process had two other advantages. First, universities could see the grades so far achieved by a student when they applied for a place. And second, students could drop subjects at the halfway point while still receiving a formal (AS) qualification.</p> <p>From next September, however, the government has decreed that A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification. Exams will all be taken, just once, at the end of the two years’ study. The mid-point AS exams will be stripped out and offered as a standalone qualification.</p> <p>At first, this doesn’t sound too much of a debacle. Won’t sixth forms just offer the standalone AS levels first and then have students sit the full A-level in their second year? Well, no. Because, in its wisdom, the government asked exam boards to make sure the materials don’t easily overlap. Ministers want students to either do the AS or the A-level, but not both.</p> <p>So which do you take? No one knows. Cue debacle. Government sentiment is that the new A-levels are more “rigorous” and universities prefer them. Though given that almost all degree courses are modular, I expect “universities” is more likely to be ministerial shorthand for “my mates who are professors at a couple of Oxbridge colleges”.</p> <p>There were suggestions when the changes were announced that they would reduce the amount of teaching time that was being lost to exams and that they would relieve stress on students. This sudden concern for students’ stress levels seems disingenuous from a party intent on assessing four-year-olds and which had to be talked down from ranking children in their primary school exams. ​​</p> <p>B​esides, it’s not true. Without formal AS ​exams at the end of year 12, sixth forms will ​likely still run mock exams to ensure students are well-practised and can check their progress. As for stress, the one-shot nature of A-level exams​ will likely send student blood pressure skywards.</p> <p>Then there are the practical problems facing schools and colleges with the policy’s implementation. Funding to sixth forms has been cut; they will now receive funds only for three subjects per student. Given the lack of overlap between AS and A-level, it’s likely that only the brightest students would cope with sitting both. Solely offering three A-levels, and ditching AS levels ​entirely, seems the best option to many.</p> <p>This,​ though, comes at a price. Faced with “one shot” exams, students pick safer choices. “Try it for AS, and drop it if it’s too hard” is a common coaxing option in subjects such as maths and foreign languages, in which teenagers often have low confidence despite good skill levels.</p> <p>Cambridge University last week added a further twist when it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29914310\" title=\"\">wrote to schools</a> urging them not just to do A-levels but to enter students for the standalone AS. Its reasoning is sound: without AS grades students will be selected for university places based on less-recent GCSEs, or the notoriously unreliable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/22/half-a-level-grade-predictions-wrong\" title=\"\">predicted grades</a>.</p> <p>Even if schools and colleges can pick their way through the minefield and find a sensible way to deal with this for their students, it’s still likely that the summer of 2017 will culminate in problems. Students will sit all of their new exams at once; exam boards will have to mark them – all at once – and no one has the foggiest how grades will be affected by the newly introduced “rigour”. If it works as it should, grades ought to go down. What does this mean for university offers? No one knows, but a good guess is that students just returning from a gap year, with A-levels already under their belts, will be at a serious advantage over thousands of others now unexpectedly getting lower grades – who will be plunged into the chaotic clearing system to find a university place.</p> <p>The education secretary said in a speech this year that she didn’t believe the government had acted too fast. She wants to <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/98807929855/nicky-morgan-speech-to-conservative-party-conference\" title=\"\">plough on</a> with this “reform”.</p> <p>But with something this half-cooked it has to be worth delaying – even if just for a year. Exam boards still haven’t released their syllabuses, universities don’t know what they want, funding is tumultuous. The only reason for barrelling ahead is because there’s an election next year. But that is irrelevant if you’re a teenager making decisions about your entire future.</p> <p>We need to talk about this issue, and the government needs to fix it now. Sixteen-year-olds will only live this year once. Let’s not disrupt their futures for the sake of an election.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9758771","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2192448","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Schools, students, exam boards and universities aren’t ready but the change to ‘one-shot’ exams is happening anyway, says <strong>Laura McInerney</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"This half-baked A-level reform is being rushed for the election","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Laura McInerney","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-18T07:10:03.207Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900060825/A-levels-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43acy","wordcount":"840","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900060825/A-levels-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5464e8f7e4b0cb80d027b802","newspaperPageNumber":"43","internalStoryPackageCode":"82731","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-21T07:10:03Z","standfirst":"Schools, students, exam boards and universities aren’t ready but the change to ‘one-shot’ exams is happening anyway","linkText":"This half-baked A-level reform is being rushed for the election | Laura McInerney","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-20T17:51:50.000Z","internalContentCode":"451845289"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/18/half-baked-a-level-reform-rushed-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/18/half-baked-a-level-reform-rushed-election","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"fd9a27608f874d6053dbac6d3a3e10ee8a84965d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900067119/A-levels-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*45777661","suppliersReference":"EDUCATION_Languages_134060.JPG","altText":"A-levels","caption":"From next September A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification with exams taken at the end of the period.

Governors must henceforth, we were told, ensure that schools “actively promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs …”</p> <p>The Friends School Council, which supports Quakers in education, had argued in the consultation that “British values” should be replaced by “human rights” or “international law”, but this view was seemingly not taken on board.</p> <p>At a time when the UK government is sending bombers to the Middle East, we had a weekend to think what the “fundamental British values of democracy” might actually be. Are British values different from French or Swedish ones? How can governors really ascertain the level of our activity in promoting these values, whatever they might be? Can we look at values without seeing how these are translated into action? And should we really promote an unquestioning adherence to the rule of law?</p> <p>As a Quaker, I tend to believe that we should at the very least question the rule of law, and indeed, on occasion, feel compelled to break it. The Quakers’ guide publication Advices And Queries says: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes. If you feel impelled by strong conviction to break the law, search your conscience deeply.”</p> <p>It has been the questioning and challenging of the rule of law that has shaped and developed some of the British values that we are now asked to promote. Acceptance of the law would have meant that slavery remained legal, that homosexuality was a criminal offence and that women were wrong to campaign for universal suffrage.</p> <p>It is not difficult to find modern examples of activity endorsed by the government that would seem to breach the demand that we “encourage respect for democracy” and “further tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions”. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/uk-firm-sold-teargas-hong-kong-review-sales-policy\" title=\"\">The sale of the teargas used against demonstrators in Hong Kong by UK arms company Chemring is unlikely to be condemned by the government</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, as Sarah Waldron from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) said: “Last year’s arms fair in London welcomed some of the most authoritarian regimes in the world and those who profit from their brutality. The deals done here fuel death, injury, fear and repression – yet instead of banning it, the government helps make it happen.”</p> <p>Those who felt impelled to draw attention to this anomaly were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.</p> <p>At least the new regulation requires governors to encourage respect for other people, “paying particular regard to the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010”.</p> <p>How does “freedom of speech” – which is surely a British value that all of us could agree is central to our democracy – and the requirement that, in political issues, students “are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views”, sit with this insistence that we not only must enable “pupils to acquire a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England” but we also must enable them to have respect for those same institutions and services (though not, by the way, for the Welsh or Scottish ones, which are presumably not deemed worthy of respect in our British-value driven culture).</p> <p>Of course we want students’ experiences not to be blighted by bigotry but this authoritarianism – motivated by a fear that multiculturalism has failed in some of our communities – is not a clear or practical way forward.</p> <p>I object from a liberal Quaker perspective to the idea that the individual conscience isn’t valued: am I guilty of brainwashing in expressing this principle to my students? I think that one of Quaker schools’ strengths is that we do not believe we have a monopoly over the truth and actively encourage our students to question authority. This falls far short of the proselytising that the establishment seems to accept from many faith schools, who can demand, for example, church attendance as a condition of admission.</p> <p>I worry that this new legislation sounds like authoritarianism and could be the basis for heresy hunts.</p> <p>At our school we will hold on to some values that are wider than “British” and might look for our inspiration to human rights legislation and international law. Above all, we hope that we can translate some of these values into student action, including the right to protest.</p> <p>Michael Goodwin is headteacher of Sibford school, one of seven independent Quaker schools in the UK and Ireland</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9731635","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2188530","internalRevision":"23","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Blind acceptance of the law would mean that slavery was still legal and homosexuality was still a crime, says Quaker school headmaster <strong>Michael Goodwin</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"British values?
