        "headline":"England and Stuart Lancaster are spoilt for choice for autumn internationals",
        "body":"<p>Decisions, decisions. Coaching and management demands a range of skills but good selection can make or break a developing team. The trick is to pick just ahead of the curve rather than just behind it, to have a sixth sense of when a particular side has reached its limit and needs reinvigorating. Injuries clearly play a part and a bit of luck helps, too.</p><p>But what happens when just about everyone is fit and eager and, as with England, you have 90-odd players to consider? Welcome to Stuart Lancaster's world as he prepares to unveil his autumn international squad this week.</p><p>If old-style England trials were to be reintroduced \"The Rest\" would fill three dressing rooms. To illustrate the fact here are four XVs, plus a further list of standby candidates and the currently injured. The first side will not be a million miles away from the team to face Australia on 2 November. Fourteen members of the \"second XV\" have already been capped this year. The last two contain a host of names – George Ford, Jonny May, Sam Hill, Dave Ewers, Jack Nowell, Will Fraser – who are rising swiftly up the ranks. Throw it all into one giant sorting hat and it becomes apparent that identifying England's best team – as opposed to their best squad – remains an ongoing struggle.</p><p>The same old questions keep recurring. What is England's best midfield combination? Who should be playing at half-back? What is the most complementary back-row blend? What about the second row? Hooker? By this stage, two years out from a World Cup, most international coaches should ideally know the answers to the majority of those questions. England probably only have about half a dozen individuals inked in, if that.</p><p>It explains why Lancaster is trying to downplay the profile of the captaincy. Tom Wood, Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley and Geoff Parling could all do the job and may end up sharing it between now and 2015. Yet none of them, for assorted reasons, are absolutely nailed on as the best player in their position for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Parling was the only one who actually went on the last Lions tour but he and Joe Launchbury are under some pressure from Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood. Tom Youngs is currently starting ahead of Hartley, a fit Tom Croft would be a strong contender at No6 instead of Wood and Matt Kvesic is seen as the way forward as a specialist No7, the shirt Robshaw has been wearing.</p><p>And, while we are at it, how many of those four would make the current pre-eminent All Black team? What about the likes of Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Mike Brown or Owen Farrell? All good players but would New Zealand choose them ahead of, respectively, Aaron Smith, Julian Savea, Israel Dagg and Beauden Barrett? It is around this point that you begin to sympathise with Lancaster and realise just how vital the next eight months will be in terms of identifying not just his best team, but a potentially world-beating unit.</p><p>This week's autumn international squad announcement, oddly, has been complicated by the relative lack of injuries around. At the last count 30 of the 33-strong senior EPS squad named in August are fit and available, with only Manu Tuilagi, Brad Barritt and Croft sidelined.</p><p>That means choosing two centres from Joel Tomkins, Luther Burrell, Jonathan Joseph, Henry Trinder and Sam Hill – Tomkins and Burrell appear the best fit – and promoting a back-rower from the Saxons. On the shimmering evidence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/exeter-chief-cardiff-blues-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">Sunday's win over Cardiff Blues</a> it should be Exeter's Tom Johnson, still under-rated by many but perfectly suited to the all-court game England are aspiring to play.</p><p>Then again, at what stage does Ford's obvious promise eclipse Toby Flood's experience? Why would you not want a spectacular finisher of May's ability at least in your squad? And are Ewers and Northampton's Sam Dickinson not both performing with more elan at this precise moment than Ben Morgan? What about Anthony Watson, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie, all of whom look potential internationals of the future? In theory it is a nice position to be in, to have a squad with plenty of depth. But there is a difference between a good squad player and someone capable of winning a World Cup semi-final with one game-changing intervention. Lancaster needs to separate his Woods from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/billy-twelvetrees-gloucester-stuart-lancaster-england\" title=\"\">Twelvetrees</a> and keep in mind that steadiness will get England only so far.</p><h2>Too many cooks? Four potential England XVs</h2><h2>1st XV<br /></h2><p>M Brown; C Ashton, J Tomkins, B Twelvetrees, M Yarde; O Farrell, B Youngs; A Corbisiero, T Youngs, D Cole, G Parling, J Launchbury, T Wood, M Kvesic, B Vunipola.</p><h2>2nd XV<br /></h2><p>A Goode; C Wade, L Burrell, K Eastmond, B Foden; F Burns, D Care; M Vunipola, D Hartley, D Wilson, D Attwood, C Lawes, T Johnson, C Robshaw, B Morgan.</p><h2>3rd XV<br /></h2><p>M Tait; C Sharples, J Joseph, S Hill, J May; T Flood, L Dickson; J Marler, R Webber, Henry Thomas, G Robson, G Kruis, E Slater, W Fraser, D Ewers.</p><h2>4th XV</h2><p>C Pennell; J Nowell, H Trinder, S Geraghty, D Strettle; G Ford, Haydn Thomas; M Mullan, C Whitehead, P Doran-Jones, G Kitchener, K Myall, C Clark, L Wallace, J Crane.</p><h2>On standby<br /></h2><p>D Paice, R Buchanan, J George, P Doran-Jones, N Catt, N Wood, A Waller, C Matthews, T Savage, J Gibson, S Dickinson, R Wigglesworth, J Simpson, S Myler, H Slade, E Daly, J Elliott, U Monye, A Watson, N Abendanon.</p><h2>Injured<br /></h2><p>T Croft, M Tuilagi, B Barritt, J Haskell, L Cowan-Dickie.</p><h2>MATT FINISH</h2><p>Did anyone out there manage to watch all 50-plus hours of rugby union coverage on Sky Sports over the weekend? By the time Racing Métro and Clermont Auvergne started limbering up late on Sunday evening, you suspect relationships in hundreds of households across Europe were under significant strain. Too much of a good thing? Probably, but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/exeter-chief-cardiff-blues-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">Exeter-Cardiff Blues</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/jonny-wilkinson-toulon-glasgow\" title=\"\">Toulon-Glasgow</a> fixtures produced some particularly striking action.</p><p>Man of the week? If there is one player in the Toulon team who you would currently pay to watch, live or on screen, it is Matt Giteau, the Australian centre whose Wallaby career seems to have petered out.</p><p>England and Wales will hope it remains that way; as underlined by the sharpness of his performance against Glasgow, there are few better creative second five-eighths out there.</p><h2>PREDICTION OF THE WEEK</h2><p>Curses. Our resident result-predicting rabbit Thumper 2 has struck back and cut the autumn deficit to 3-2, courtesy of Castres' victory over Northampton. This week we head to Scotland; old lop ears, who must have a bit of Caledonian blood somewhere, has plumped for the food bowl marked \"Glasgow\" while I think Exeter will continue their current hot streak.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419951899|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|e31b9b1b04719c5f4c876cc93c86fe7b46b80076 -->",

They occur every time Rory and I are apart a few days or do not write on Twitter,\" she told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet.</p><p>\"There is nothing in it, and from now on I just think that I will keep my private life private.</p><p>\"It is so annoying that the media and the so-called sources constantly spread the rumours. They write just what they want.\"</p><p>Wozniacki, who has slipped to ninth in the world rankings, said \"all is well\" with the relationship.</p><p>\"I just want to be allowed to live my life off the court without all the speculation,\" she added.</p><p>McIlroy, who claimed the order of merit on both sides of the Atlantic last year and won two major titles by the age of 23, has endured a difficult year.</p><p>After switching his club brand at the start of the season to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/19/rory-mcilroy-defiant-nike-nick-faldo\" title=\"\">Nike in a lucrative deal</a> reported to be worth £78m, the 24-year-old slipped from world No1 to sixth in the rankings.</p><p>Asked if his problems on the course were caused by mechanical or mental issues, McIlroy said: \"I think it was a little bit of both.</p><p>\"Mechanically my golf swing ... I fell into a couple of bad habits and I was trying to work myself out of it. It affects mental issues as well.</p><p>\"Golf is a game of confidence and if you are confident it allows you to play better and freer ... with a free mind. Definitely nothing to do with equipment.\"</p><p>McIlroy said there was plenty of golf left in the year and ample opportunities for him to get that first win.</p><p>\"I learned a lot this year,\" he added. \"I was undergolfed for the first three to four months. It's the first year I struggled and I didn't live up to the expectation.</p><p>\"This year is a little bit of a disappointment, But I have six tournaments left and will finish the season strongly.\"</p><p>In another off-course distraction, McIlroy recently terminated his contract with Horizon Sports Management and set up his own company to run his business interests.</p><p>That messy break-up<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/rory-mcilroy-horizon-dublin-court\" title=\"\"> reached a Dublin court</a> on Monday with McIlroy unhappy with the commission the Dublin firm was charging for its services.</p><p>Horizon has said it was disappointed McIlroy had ended a contract that had a number of years left to run.</p><p>\"Since October 2011 Horizon has achieved exceptional results for Rory in realising his commercial objectives,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>\"Under Horizon's management Rory has signed some of the most lucrative endorsements in sports history.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419982277|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|5a356c89acee64b4b99f9cb38f277464be321de3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The PGA of America is considering staging the US PGA Championship, one of golf's four majors, outside the United States. A report in Golf Digest states that a committee is studying the impact of holding the event around the world, with the earliest possible date in 2020.</p><p>The 2019 championship was awarded to Bethpage Black on Long Island last month. \"This is an exercise we are going through, an analysis,\" PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua told Golf Digest. \"It is far from a fait accompli that we are going to take the PGA Championship international. When we sat down to map our strategic plan to service our members and grow the game the question arose as to what impact it would have to take the PGA Championship to an international location once or twice a decade.</p><p>\"It would be something we would only do if we had the co-operation of quite a few groups. It would need to work for the PGA Tour and it would need to work for the PGA Tour players.</p><p>\"Another would be the PGA in the particular area we would consider. We would want the international PGAs to be a part of this and share in this. Many pieces would have to fall in place.\"</p><p>Adam Scott fired a course-record 64 to storm past Justin Rose and claim victory at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda. Rose had led by a single stroke with three holes to play but he had no answer to Scott in the closing stages as the Australian won the 36-hole tournament – which gathers the season's four major champions – by two shots on eight under.</p><p>The Masters winner took control on the penultimate hole when his six-iron landed within inches to allow him a tap-in eagle three. The US Open champion Rose had given up his single-shot lead at the previous hole, forced to take a drop after a wayward tee shot, before par on the 17th left him two shots adrift as Scott accelerated.</p><p>Scott's win means that he was able to add the winner's pink jacket to the green one he dramatically secured after a play-off against Angel Cabrera at Augusta in April.</p><p>Jason Dufner finished third on three under while Padraig Harrington, who replaced the Open champion Phil Mickelson, was well off the pace on three over after a 71 on Wednesday.</p><p>Harrington was the defending champion after he stepped in for Ernie Els last year.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185397|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|420566ce023eea6e45505df2a77ef89004b2aad8 -->",
