But for those holding out for employment that meets these criteria, things are looking up; recruitment opportunities for the \"best jobs in the world\" are definitely on the rise.</p><p>Today, lastminute.com became the latest travel company to offer one lucky individual the chance to become a professional holidayer. The site is the on the hunt for a <a href=\"http://www.lovelivinglastminute.com/\" title=\"\">\"Spontaneity Champion\"</a>, who will be given £50,000 worth of travel and experiences to \"road test\" over the course of 2014. The winner will get do something different every weekend of the year - from long haul breaks to luxury hotel stays in London - and by sharing what they get up to will become the online face of the brand.</p><p>The ideal candidate will \"have a spontaneous approach to life which will inspire others,\" which we assume translates as, \"is very good at persuading people to drop everything and book a holiday.\"</p><p>Indeed, it is not just the winner that wins here – for a very modest outlay holiday companies are boosting their social media presence, and there have been a string of such opportunities offered by savvy travel operators.</p><p>In August, online travel agents <a href=\"http://www.bestjobaroundtheworld.com/\" title=\"\">Jauntaroo launched a campaign to find a \"Chief World Explorer\"</a>, who will be paid $100,000 to fly to destinations across the globe. Among the desired attributes for the job is being \"partial to naps and/or massages on pristine beaches\", however they are also expected to blog about their travels, sharing photos, videos and other content through the site's social media channels along the way.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jan/08/slide-tester-swimming-pool-first-choice\" title=\"\">UK company First Choice advertised for a \"slide tester\"</a> to spend six months riding and rating the water slides at its SplashWorld resorts around the world, while enjoying free accommodation and an ample £20,000 salary.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/06/briton-wins-best-job-australia\" title=\"\">Back in 2009, Tourism Queensland advertised for someone to live on the great barrier reef for six months and \"house sit\" the tropical islands there</a>. The stunt, which is where the \"best job in the world\" moniker originates, received 34,000 applicants from 200 countries. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/06/best-job-in-world-tourism-hamilton-queensland\" title=\"\">From a $1m investment, Tourism Queensland generated more than $110m of global publicity.</a></p><p>The idea was then adopted by <a href=\"https://bestjobs.australia.com/\" title=\"\">Tourism Australia</a>, who now run an annual competition for six jobs, with increasingly daft titles, such as \"chief funster\" and \"wildlife caretaker\".</p><p>This year <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/travel/virgin-australia-announce-best-job-world\" title=\"\">Virgin Australia</a> also jumped on the concept, collaborating with Tourism Australia to offer the role of \"high flyer\" as a seventh \"best job\". The position involves flying around the country \"experiencing the heights of Australian hospitality\".</p><p>And since 2007, STA Travel have run a <a href=\"http://www.statravel.com/world-traveler-intern-07-itinerary.htm\" title=\"\">\"World Traveler Internship\"</a>, which invites young people to enjoy a paid for holiday, producing videos and taking photos in each country they visit.</p><p>It seems that when it comes to bagging the \"best job in the world\", you've got a better chance than you think.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421644385|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|e5c089951beb8ea244fdd8f5982d1640a98d82ed -->",

        "body":"<h2>WINNING TIP: The Verulam Arms, St Albans</h2><p>St Albans has a lot of pubs to choose from but this place is different: no Stella. Where else can you get a hogweed and bloete martini? The food and drink are brought in from the Hertfordshire countryside by a group of local hunter-gatherers called The Foragers is surprisingly bountiful. Add a&nbsp;friendly atmosphere, cosy interior, approachable bar staff and a great choice of craft beers, and this is the place for a pint and good food, all in the shadow of the cathedral.<br /><a href=\"http://the-foragers.com/id/the-verulam-arms/\" title=\"\"><em>the-foragers.com/the-verulam-arms</em></a><br /><em> </em>cand82</p><h2><br />The Eagle, Cambridge<br /></h2><p>The highlight of my Saturday visit to the market is a pint in the Eagle, which dates from the 14th century and, much later, was where Watson and Crick announced they had discovered \"the secret of life\", or DNA. The Eagle is also famous for its ceiling: in the second world war, RAF pilots signed the ceiling with anything to hand: lipsticks, cigarette lighters, candles, even candle smoke. It also does fantastic cask ales and home-cooked food.<br /><em>8 Bene't Street, 01223 505020</em><br /><strong>Kimmy90210</strong></p><h2>The Bell, Bath</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464388'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234059775/Bell-Inn-Bath-001.jpg' alt='Bell Inn Bath' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>The Bell really is the local's local. After facing closure last year, it sold shares to its customers and is now a co-operative. As well as regular guest ales and local beers, it's the music at the Bell that draws many. The food is OK, but it's not what you would go there for. It's just a great boozer!<br /><em>103 Walcot Street, 01225 460426, </em><a href=\"http://www.thebellinnbath.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>thebellinnbath.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>joolsy</strong></p><h2>Y Delyn, Mold, Flintshire</h2><p>From its unprepossessing exterior, you would never guess at the wonder that awaits you inside Y Delyn. As well as walls adorned with old theatre posters, tables from spinning machines and fairy lights around the bar, there is a vast choice of beers, including Leffe and Hoegaarden on tap, reasonably priced delicious tapas, live music nights and an atmosphere that means you can easily lose several hours imagining you have stepped into continental Europe.<br /><em>3 King Street, 01352 759642</em><br /><strong>mattnash</strong></p><h2>Prince of Wales,  Kenfig, Bridgend</h2><p>The 16th-century Prince of Wales must be the best pub in Wales. It's walking distance from my house, and full of family, friends, locals, ghosts, history on the walls, great food, the finest cask beers and wonderful hosts – there is no&nbsp;better way to spend an evening. After a walk to <a href=\"http://www.kenfig.org.uk/naturereserve#.UnEHYBnspS4\" title=\"\">Kenfig Pool and through the local nature reserve</a>, it's a wonderful place to relax and refresh those tired bones. <br /><em>01656 740356, </em><a href=\"http://www.princekenfig.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>princekenfig.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>wxerri</strong></p><h2>The King and Queen,  Hamble, Hampshire</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464389'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234092303/King-and-Queen-Hamble-001.jpg' alt='King and Queen Hamble' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>Got a bag of dirty laundry? Take it to the King and Queen, where there's a laundrette, and relax by the inglenook with a book from the shelf while waiting for it to finish. This is a haven for sailors from near and far, and filled with locals whose faces you might recognise from Howards' Way. This pub has a jovial feel, with good food, great beer, excellent rums and friendly staff. <br /><em>023-8045 4247,  </em><a href=\"http://thekingandqueenpub.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>thekingandqueenpub.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>FarawayVisions</strong></p><h2>The Three Compasses, Hornsey, London<br /></h2><p>If planning an ascent up the south face of Muswell Hill, pause in the foothills of Hornsey High Street at this regular winner of best community pub awards. It has one of the finest ale selections in north London, with new ones appearing weekly, and the menu is ambitious without being terrifying. But it is the ambience that keeps 'em coming back: a modern interpretation of the traditional London boozer, popular without being poncey.<br /><em>62 High Street, N8, 020-8340 2729, </em><a href=\"http://threecompasses.com/\" title=\"\"><em>threecompasses.com</em></a><br /><strong>winskill</strong></p><h2>Inn on the Green, Bristol<br /></h2><p>From the raucous beer festival over May Day to the cosy Sunday night quiz, the Inn on the Green is our second living room. A short stumble from Horfield common, it's the last best stop on the A38 out of Bristol, with its ever-changing ales, wood fires, good food and amusingly graffitied Jenga. Yes it's a bit tired (gents toilets), yes it's a funny shape (old bowling alley bit), but it's my local and I like it!<br /><em>2 Filton Rd,&nbsp;Horfield, 0117 952 1391</em><br /><strong>crodd</strong></p><h2>The Jolly Brewer Lincoln,<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464390'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234034760/Jolly-Brewer-Lincoln-001.jpg' alt='Jolly Brewer Lincoln' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>The Brewer has a jarringly bright interior and a questionable selection of artwork. It makes up for that with a friendly and eclectic clientele and a great selection of real ales and ciders. It's also popular with the local steampunk scene, so there are often amazing outfits to gawp at, and the beer garden is full well into autumn.<br /><em>26 Broadgate, 01522 528583</em><br /><strong>Rosie Kelly</strong></p><h2>The Woodbine,  Finsbury Park, London<br /></h2><p>Our favorite local in Finsbury Park is near where Blackstock Road runs into Highbury. The Woodbine is one of the cosiest pubs around, coupled with amazing music (on vinyl and usually of the Neil Young/Rolling Stones/Springsteen ilk), fantastic beers on tap (rotating casks along with Meantime and Camden breweries), great staff and awesome regulars. I would copy the decor in my house if I had the balls to do it. Good pub quiz, good specials, decent Thai food.<br /><em>215 Blackstock Road N5, 020-7354 1061 </em><br /><strong>ID6725784</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421300907|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|9aaca9750f8b30d30ebc80ed8f52e86f1d8eb435 -->",

        "headline":"Favela tourism in Rio de Janeiro",
        "body":"<h2>Santa Marta</h2><p>They are proud of the bronze Michael Jackson statue that stands on the edge of a little square in the Santa Marta favela in Rio de Janeiro. \"It's the only one in Rio,\" said 32-year-old Thiago Firmino, DJ, local resident and our tour guide. Its arms stretch out to embrace a dizzying view of Rio, and of the shanty town that tumbles down the hillside below. On the wall behind it is a Michael Jackson mosaic.</p><p>It was here that director Spike Lee filmed scenes for the video to Jackson's 1996 hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNJL6nfu__Q\" title=\"\">They Don't Care About Us</a>. Rio authorities originally opposed the video because they felt filming in a favela would show a negative side of the city, which at the time was bidding to host the 2004 Olympics. Nearly two decades later, with both the 2014 World Cup final and the 2016 Olympics set to be staged here, Rio is no longer quite so ashamed of its favelas. Officially, it has 763 of them, (according to the 2010 census), and they are home to almost 1.4 million people, or 22% of the city's population.</p><p>Lee's video plays on a loop in the little tourist shop that Thiago's parents run on the square, Praça Cantão. The alleyways in which Jackson danced seem little changed but lower down, a square at the foot of the favela has been brightened up with a 7,000-square-metre lick of paint. <a href=\"http://www.favelapainting.com/\">The Favela Painting art project</a>, created by Dutch duo Haas&amp;Hahn, with the aim of boosting community pride, has seen 34 houses painted in a rainbow of bright colours.</p><p>In 2008, Santa Marta was the first favela in Rio to be \"pacified\" under a state programme to expel its drug gangs by installing a police base and initiating social change projects. Since then, another 34 favelas have been pacified. Santa Marta is held up as the model and has become a stop-off for visiting celebrities, Madonna, Beyoncé and Alicia Keys included.</p><p>They come to see the effects of pacification: creches, new houses, concrete steps instead of treacherous muddy tracks, and a free tram that glides up at a 45% angle to help its 6,500 or so residents get up and down what is essentially a 1,000m mountain covered in rough brick, breezeblock and even wooden houses, just below the Christ the Redeemer statue.</p><p>In what used to be one of Rio's most violent slums, residents are turning to tourism. That day, Thiago's clients were two Dutch tourists from Utrecht, and he had recruited student Pedro Monteiro, 18, to translate. The Dutch visitors wandered wide-eyed through the favela.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614182'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221884226/Michael-Jackson-video-sti-001.jpg' alt='Michael Jackson video still' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Jackson filming the video for They Don't Really Care About Us at the Santa Marta favela in 1996. Photograph: Globo/ages</figcaption></figure><p>\"I like it very much,\" said Mirko van Denderen, 33, a teacher. \"The strange buildings …\"</p><p>Both peeked into Thiago's house, impressed by the contrast between its rugged raw-brick exterior, and its neat living room, fitted kitchen and flat-screen TV.</p><p>\"The majority of houses are cool inside, all done up,\" said Thiago. \"It demystifies it.\"</p><p>Tours like Thiago's offer a glimpse of another side of Brazilian life. But tourists should be aware that these are tours of places where very poor people live – which some might find difficult. It's very useful to have guide who lives in the area: they'll be accepted by local people, and are unlikely to gloss over issues the favela faces.</p><p>Pedro pointed out handmade signs protesting at the forced removals of dwellings that perch precariously at the very top of Santa Marta. \"Property speculation,\" said Thiago.</p><p>This used to be one of Rio's most violent slums, and was controlled by the Commando Vermelho (Red Command) drug gang. Now, like Thiago, residents of pacified favelas such as this are turning to tourism. \"I had to accept the work because so many people were coming,\" Thaigo said. </p><p>Roberto de Conceição, 48, was carrying his shopping up the hill. He likes the tours, he said: \"We meet new people. Thiago is from here,\" he said. Paulo Roberto, 45, was selling mobile phone cases, pens and Santa Marta T-shirts designed by his 11-year-old son, on a little stall. \"We are more and more involved. I live from this now,\" he smiled.</p><p>The alleyways got narrower as we descended. Chickens clucked in a drain. Purple flowers sprouted near bags of gravel. Children in flip-flops pushed past talking football. An old woman was carried past on a chair. Humanity teemed in the narrow alleys. Everything was tiny: a barber shop, an electrical products stall, a bedroom with three small bunk beds.</p><p>\"Every part of the community has a name,\" said Pedro, as he paused in front of a wall. \"This was called Beirut.\" The building behind which traffickers used to hide is now used for boxing and judo.</p><p>At the foot of the favela, outside the Bar Cheiro Bom (Good Smell Bar) Pedro pointed out bullet holes in a wall.</p><p>\"This was a conflict zone,\" said Thiago. \"Now there is always a police car and a camera.\"</p><p>The Dutch visitors were taken back up the hill on the tram. \"It feels a little strange to be wandering around taking pictures,\" concluded bank worker Willem van Duuren, 41. \"It feels a bit voyeuristic, seeing how poor the people are, but it is part of the country.\"</p><p><em>• Local resident Thiago Firmino offers two-hour tours of Santa Marta from around £15 in Portuguese or £20 in English (+55 21 9177 9459, </em><a href=\"http://favelasantamartatour.blogspot.com.br/\" title=\"\"><em>favelasantamartatour.blogspot.com.br</em></a><em>)</em></p><h2>Vidigal</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614183'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383231251139/Vidigal-Favela-001.jpg' alt='Vidigal Favela' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The best view in town … Vidigal overlooks Leblon beach. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Vidigal is Rio's most foreigner-friendly favela, with <em>pousadas</em> (guesthouses), bars, restaurants and even a sushi joint aimed at the tourist market. It is relatively small and picturesque, with spectacular views over the Atlantic, and an hour-long walking trail that winds from its upper limits to the top of the Dois Irmãos (Two Brothers) mountain.</p><p>When pacified in 2012, Vidigal was already popular with artists, young Brazilians and foreigners. Scottish school librarian Graeme Boyd, 34, lived there for two six-month periods, in 2009 and 2011. \"As long as foreigners respect the locals, make a contribution and use the businesses inside the favela, they will be welcomed,\" he said. \"People reacted to me as if I had lived there all my life.\"</p><p>Today Vidigal is compared to Rio's bohemian Santa Teresa district. This is a favela undergoing a gentrification process, with all the property speculation that entails. Critics say locals are the losers in this process. A legal battle over ownership of its most famous pousada, <a href=\"http://altovidigal.com/novosite/?page_id=253&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">Casa Alto Vidigal</a> – between Austrian proprietor Andreas Wielend and its previous German owner – even made the newspapers. But that hasn't diminished its popularity.</p><p>Casa Alto Vidigal looks like a squat transplanted from Dalston, east London, and offers rough-and-ready accommodation. But its all-night electronic music parties and Sunday sunset DJ sessions on a terrace with breathtaking views over Leblon and Ipanema beaches have made it a landmark. On weekend nights, young tourists queue for motorbike taxis to climb the hill to Alto Vidigal and other electronic music parties such as Morro Eletronico – an Ibiza-style lounge bar, whose outdoor dance floors and terraces cling to a tropical hillside.</p><p><em>• Carioca Free Culture (+21 99800 6278, </em><a href=\"http://www.cariocafreeculture.com/\" title=\"\"><em>cariocafreeculture.com</em></a><em>) is run by Brazilian Rodrigo, who grew up in the neighbouring Rocinha favela, and his partner, American Mary Ellen. Their  Dois Irmãos Trail in English lasts three to four hours and costs £15pp (minimum two people). It starts and ends in Vidigal and includes a hike up the mountain </em></p><h2>Tavares Bastos</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614184'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383231353655/Jazz-at-Maze-in-Tavares-B-001.jpg' alt='Jazz at Maze in Tavares Bastos' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jazz night at Maze pousada in Tavares Bastos</figcaption></figure><p>Vidigal is not the only favela with nightlife credentials. Monthly jazz nights at the <a href=\"http://jazzrio.com/en/\" title=\"\">Maze Pousada</a> have put the Tavares Bastos favela in Catete, central Rio, on the city's nightlife circuit. Staff hold up signs to direct the hundreds of partygoers who flock down the favela alleys. The live music is excellent but the 40 reais (£11) cover charge makes it too expensive for most locals; instead foreigners and richer Brazilians cram in. The pousada is owned by British expat Bob Nadkarni, and his son also runs a monthly alternative rock night, called Labirinto.</p><p>Bob has been tinkering with and expanding the building for the 30 years he has lived there, and opened the pousada seven years ago. It now teeters over the favela like a Gaudí castle, full of stairways and corridors and hidden nooks and crannies, with panoramic views over Guanabara Bay from its ample terraces. It has five double rooms and a dorm.</p><p>The neighbouring police training base has long made this favela relatively safe – on a recent visit, officers holding automatic weapons were practising combat drills in the alleys around the pousada.</p><p>\"People who come here don't want a common, tourist hotel that might be more comfortable, with air conditioning and TV,\" said Bob's wife, Mariluce da Silva. \"It is very tranquil.\"</p><h2>Complexo do Alemão</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614185'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221625009/mariluce-with-tourists-001.jpg' alt='mariluce with tourists' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mariluce, centre, with a group of tourists in Complexo do Alemão. Photograph: Dom Phillips</figcaption></figure><p>Mariluce was our guide to the Complexo do Alemão favela in north Rio. When soldiers and police invaded in 2010, a TV Globo helicopter showed dramatic live footage of bandits brandishing rifles and machine guns as they fled up a dirt track from advancing security forces. Now Alemão, a vast complex of 13 favelas, has a six-station cable car that has become a tourist attraction. The little gondolas glide silently over the concrete roofs, water tanks and satellite dishes of this vast favela, while sounds of dogs and chickens drift upwards. The <em>teleférico</em>, as it is called, opened in 2011 and a ride costs £1.40 for tourists (residents pay just 28p). And while some complain that the opening hours – 6am-9pm weekdays and 8am-8pm weekends – suit tourists rather than locals, the cable car is still better than cramming into the rickety minibuses that criss-cross the favelas for twice the price.</p><p>Complexo do Alemão, literally \"the Complex of the German\" was actually founded by a Pole – but blond, blue-eyed gringos are invariably refered to as \"Germans\" in Brazil. At the cable car's last stop, Palmeiras, resident Jackson Menezes, 74, was sitting in the sun. \"God blessed all the residents who live here who use the cable car. It really helps the community,\" he said. Menezes supported pacification, but said that the drug trade for which Alemão was notorious continues surreptitiously: \"It doesn't stop. It never stops. It stays hidden.\"</p><p>Beside him a boy was selling water. He said in English that he was 11 and his name was João. He was barefoot. João said he goes to school in the mornings and sells at the station in the afternoons. \"It's good. It's profitable,\" he said.</p><p>Cleber Araújo, 36, was minding his souvenir store. \"I am against cable-car tourism,\" he said. \"It is a safari.\"</p><p>Instead he organises group walking tours of favelas. A group of 70 have just been from a South African university, and 107 Spanish visitors have booked for the World Cup.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614186'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221481937/The-cable-car-in-Complexo-008.jpg' alt='The cable car in Complexo do Alemnão' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cable car in Complexo do Alemnão has become a tourist attraction. Photograph: Dom Phillips</figcaption></figure><p>Out here in Rio's gritty, dirty, industrial Zona Norte, far from the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema in Zona Sul, the community is clearly much poorer than in Vidigal. Many roads are just dirt. Three rangy horses were grazing on waste ground. Children passed with a horse and cart. Mariluce advised us not to take photographs as we looped through one alleyway in a part of the favela called Inferno Verde (Green Hell).</p><p>Tourist Alejandro Barreneche, 31, from Colombia, stopped to buy beer at a hole-in-the-wall bar. \"It's like going into a reality TV show,\" he said, \"like a zoo feeling. But again, it allows you to be closer to reality.\"</p><p>Barman Leoni Franco, 24, shrugged: \"It's good that tourists come. After pacification it is 100% better.\"</p><p>Other residents seemed more surprised by the visitors than the visitors were by them. Police were patrolling the streets, hands on the triggers of their automatic weapons, like an occupying army. Residents averted their eyes: from them, from us.</p><p>Mariluce stopped to point out an electricity meter, installed by the Rio electricity company after pacification. Previously, residents hooked up illegally with homemade tangles of cables called <em>gatos</em> (cats). The electricity meter is called a <em>tigre</em> (tiger). \"We used to steal from them,\" smiled Mariluce. \"Now they steal from us.\"</p><p>For decades, the people of Rio's favelas lived in gang-controlled isolation. Fear of the drugs trade that dominated so many of these neighbourhoods kept middle-class Brazilians away. Now that is changing. And the rest of the world is arriving. This throws up interesting questions – for those living there, and for those visiting. A curtain has come down.</p><p>\"We didn't have all these visitors,\" said the owner of a tiny shop. \"But no one gets annoyed. I hope it continues.\"</p><p>On a little high street similar to many in Brazil. Mariluce shooed her tourists out of the way of a minibus. \"As you can see, this is a neighbourhood like any other,\"  she said.</p><p><em>• Cleber Araújo (+55 21 </em>96736 9353<em>, complexoalemao.rj@gmail.com) offers group tours for £15pp, with English translation and cultural options such as capoeira and samba, and even lunch at a new favela bistro</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421366170|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|9ac66f679e315850391d0f95f5de5d1046d73ac1 -->",

Led by Beefeaters, the tours run through the winter and give visitors a chance to experience the Traitors' Gate, Scaffold Site and Bloody Tower at their most atmospheric. It wasn't so long ago that most of Britain's tourist sights would shut up shop for the winter, but the so-called off-season is rapidly becoming the best time of year to visit our museums and heritage attractions, as they come up with creative ways to attract visitors, from after-hours concerts and talks to candlelight tours and musical performances.</p><p>If you've ever wondered how our ancestors passed the long November evenings before X&nbsp;Factor came along, pay a visit to the excellent Geffrye Museum in Hackney, which is hosting a Gothic and Ghostly Gathering (14 November, £16, <a href=\"http://www.geffrye-museum.org.uk/\" title=\"\">geffrye-museum.org.uk</a>). See recreated 18th- and 19th-century home interiors by candlelight before settling down for an evening of live music, anecdotes and readings from the Victorian era.</p><p>In Bath you can enjoy a torch-lit tour of the Roman Baths and dinner in the Roman Baths Kitchen (£38pp, <a href=\"http://romanbaths.co.uk/\" title=\"\">romanbaths.co.uk</a>). And in Cambridgeshire, Anglesey Abbey will be lighting up its beautiful gardens, creating a&nbsp;wonderland of lights and live jazz music after dark (various dates, 29 Nov-15 Dec; £10.50 adults, £7.50 children; <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk</a>).</p><p>Now the clocks have gone back there are no excuses for hibernation, so embrace the night.</p><h2><strong>For an elegant getaway, head to... Bath</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>White Hart Inn</strong> Decent budget accommodation is thin on the ground in Bath, which makes this unpretentious pub, a short walk from the train station, a real find. There's a dormitory or private rooms, and a shared kitchen where you can help yourself to a breakfast of cereal and toast. In summer the plant-filled courtyard garden is a lovely spot for lunch. <br />Dorm beds from £15pp per night, twin £40, double en-suite £50 (<a href=\"http://whitehartbath.co.uk\" title=\"\">whitehartbath.co.uk</a>)</p><p><strong>Basement 48</strong> This studio apartment in the basement of a Georgian house on Rivers Street makes a cosy bolthole for couples.

Minimum three-night stay required (<a href=\"http://holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/bath/259408\" title=\"\">holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/bath/259408</a>)</p><p><strong>The Halcyon</strong> If you don't want to spend your time in Bath pretending you're in a Jane Austen novel, then head for the Halcyon.

The hotel will launch self-catering apartments in January.<br />From £99 (room only) for a standard double (<a href=\"http://thehalcyon.com\" title=\"\">thehalcyon.com</a>)</p><p><strong>Grays Boutique B&amp;B Hotel</strong> This new B&amp;B in a Victorian villa on the south side of town is run by the people behind Brindleys, one of Bath's most highly rated hotels, so you'll find sublimely restful bedrooms with soft white linen, immaculate bathrooms and an impressive choice of cooked and continental breakfasts. <br />From £100 for a small double and £175 for a deluxe room with four-poster bed (<a href=\"http://graysbath.co.uk\" title=\"\">graysbath.co.uk</a>)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421312677|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|7e7ad42583a428bc914b874102a3c759144e9673 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Established by Congolese migrants, Brussels' vibrant Matonge area is now a magnet for young Belgians – plus the odd Eurocrat, says <strong>Emma Beddington </strong></p>",
        "headline":"Out of Africa: Brussels' vibrant Matonge quarter",
        "body":"<p>\"Smile\" reads the sign over the ramshackle shopping centre, where racks of highly flammable vest tops rub shoulders with vats of hair relaxer. \"You're in Matonge.\"</p><p>Tucked incongruously between the plate-glass and concrete of European Union institutions on one side and the high-end boutiques of the Avenue Louise on the other, the African quarter of Brussels hasn't always had the best reputation. Scruffy and anarchic, it has been a frequent flashpoint for conflict, particularly in 2011 following the Congolese elections, but it's emerging as one of the most exciting, creative parts of the city.</p><p>Named after a lively area of Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Matonge took shape in the wake of the country's independence in 1960, though the area already had African associations. The following year, as more Congolese citizens moved to Belgium to study, an aristocratic philanthropist called Monique Van der Straten founded \"Maisaf\" (La Maison Africaine), a hostel for these students, on rue Alsace-Lorraine, in the heart of today's Matonge.</p><p>A community – with nightclubs, bars and shops – grew up in the network of streets south of Chaussée de Wavre, and other African immigrants followed in the wake of the Congolese pioneers.</p><p>At the <a href=\"http://www.kuumba.be/\" title=\"\">Kuumba</a> cultural centre, which organises excellent walking tours of the area with local guides, Jeroen Marckelbach explains that, after that first wave of students, Matonge has not been a place where Africans lived (the area has been too expensive for poor migrants for decades), but a meeting place: somewhere to shop, eat and party.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468988'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383219843873/Le-Soleil-dAfrique-restau-001.jpg' alt='Le Soleil d'Afrique restaurant' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Le Soleil d'Afrique restaurant Photograph: Emma Beddington</figcaption></figure><p>Walk down Chaussée de Wavre at night and you'll see batik shops, hairdressers and exotic grocers all open late, packed with groups of all ages gossiping and hanging out. In the pedestrian rue Longue Vie, restaurants such as Le Soleil d'Afrique serve cheap, delicious chicken <em>mafé</em>, a Senegalese dish with peanut sauce, and dubious cocktails with names like Viagra to customers at packed communal tables, lanyard-draped Eurocrats sitting elbow-to-elbow with Congolese students.</p><p>The European Union institutions grew up alongside Matonge, just a few hundred metres to the east but, until recently, the two communities largely kept a cautious distance. Initiatives such as last summer's Matonge-Europe football tournament, are working to bring them together.</p><p>And Matonge has more to offer than wigs, nails and dried fish: it's a fascinating place to soak up a mix of African culture, <em>bobo</em> (the much-derided <em>bourgeois-bohème</em>) hangouts and historic Brussels.</p><p><a href=\"http://afrikamali.be/\" title=\"\">Afrikamäli</a> – the word means \"African treasures\" in Swahili – is a community project that set out to show another side to the area: in a bright, appealing shop on rue Ernest Solvay, Magali Sylvestre sells fair traded and ethical crafts from across sub-Saharan Africa, assisted by long-term unemployed locals, for whom the shop is a springboard into work.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468989'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383220222131/Afrikamali-shop-Matonge-001.jpg' alt='Afrikamali shop, Matonge' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Afrikamali shop, Matonge</figcaption></figure><p>The central location and relatively forgiving business rents have allowed other small creative entrepreneurs to move in, giving Matonge a more varied texture: places like <a href=\"http://lepetitboudoirixelles.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Le Petit Boudoir</a>, which sells delicate, quirky accessories, or <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\" title=\"\">Les Midinettes</a> <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\" title=\"\">(30 rue Ernest Solvay, lesmidinettes.be)</a>, a sewing atelier, cafe and clothes shop promoting young Belgian designers. There are cavernous vintage shops, second-hand bookstores, cool neighbourhood bars like <a href=\"http://www.stamgent.be/nl/bezoek/cafe\" title=\"\">Stam Café </a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stam1050\" title=\"\">(1 rue Bouré, facebook.com/stam1050)</a> and an excellent art house cinema, the <a href=\"http://www.cinema-vendome.be/\" title=\"\">Vendôme</a>.</p><p>On the western edge of Matonge, on rue du Berger, is another extraordinary slice of Brussels history. <a href=\"http://www.lebergerhotel.be/hotel/\" title=\"\">Hôtel le Berger</a> is a former <em>hôtel de rendez-vous</em>, renting rooms by the hour to well-to-do Brussels residents for discreet liaisons.  It has kept its louche 1930s charm while adding a few 21st-century comforts.</p><p>In the south of Matonge, rue St Boniface is another kind of meeting place, crammed with restaurants and bars, from Japanese ramen to Belgian mussels and all points between. It's a magnet for young Belgians and expats, and responsible for coaxing a younger, richer public into the area.</p><p>From the beautiful <a href=\"http://comptoirflorian.be/\" title=\"\">Comptoir Florian</a> cafe at number 17, owner Vincent has watched the area evolve. \"When I opened 19 years ago, all my friends thought I was mad. There was nothing here. But I knew the area and its history and I loved it. I like how mixed it is.\" His customers reflect that: out on the terrace a group of middle-aged African men are laughing over cheesecake, while inside students, galleristas and locals drink Japanese brown rice tea and flick through the piles of interiors magazines.</p><p>\"Mixed\" is a word you hear a lot from the residents of Matonge: that's a huge part of its appeal. From 78-year-old Bartholomé and his parrot Chirac, still mending shoes on rue de l'Athénée, to the kids checking each other out in the fried chicken shops, all human life is there.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468990'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383220006734/Elisabeth-and-Sinem-of-Un-001.jpg' alt='Elisabeth and Sinem of Unico restaurant' width='460' height='450' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Elisabeth and Sinem of Unico </figcaption></figure><p>Looking back over a year since they opened, Elisabeth and Sinem of <a href=\"http://jesuisunico.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">Unico</a>, a tiny Italian wine bar and restaurant have embraced the area in all its contradictions. \"It can seem scary,\" says Sinem, \"but it's been wonderful.\"</p><p>Isabelle and Mathilde of <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\">Les Midinettes</a> add a reminder to look up above the bustle and the chaos to discover the wonderful façades and glorious art nouveau details that are everywhere in Matonge's streets. \"Every day, I discover something new\" says Isabelle, which would certainly give you something to smile about.</p><p><em>• Eurostar (eurostar.com) trains from London St Pancras to Brussels take under two hours, from £69pp return </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421363813|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|3646c941f1ed53634346b6329e05275fafdd920e -->",

        "headline":"Askham Hall, Penrith, Lake District: hotel review",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the Lake District where, of course, it is raining ... hard. Which provides the perfect excuse to stay put at Askham Hall and forget about the fell walks. You want views? I've got them through the mullioned windows of my room. Activity? A well-stocked honesty bar in the lounge demands exploration.</p><p>Former home of landed gentry the Lowthers, this 13th-century pile has just reopened as a restaurant with rooms. Charlie Lowther, a hands-on farmer, publican and now restaurateur, is turning this once-austere family seat into a swish but informal bolthole, staffed by smiling, chatty human beings.</p><p>Naturally the house, set in 40 beautiful acres, oozes character. Even the loo off the lounge is a memorable antique. But Askham Hall doesn't hammer its history. The walls feature not Lowther family portraits, but modish art by Charlie's wife, Juno, and the centrepiece of the whole place is chef Richard Swale's restaurant.</p><p>The dining room is a cosy space with a clever open kitchen. Bright tiles and trailing hops give a rustic \"Britalian\" feel. Ingredients come mainly from the estate (there are polytunnels and rare breed pigs on site), and so seriously is the local, seasonal ethos being taken that, until spring 2014, Askham will open only at weekends – in part to give Swale time for all the foraging and preserving needed to make the place almost self-sustaining.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421472788'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383233282808/Askham-Hall-001.jpg' alt='Askham Hall' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Askham Hall</figcaption></figure><p>A local lad, Swale has returned to Cumbria via some of Europe's best kitchens, and his technical ability is clear. Some dishes require further refinement, but a scallop starter with many intelligent dimensions of flavour – intense chicken jus, tiny pork scratchings, pickled Jerusalem artichoke – confirms Swale as a serious, potentially impressive chef.</p><p>Upstairs, 13 bedrooms marry  antique furniture (and fantastic wide firm beds) with bursts of contemporary design. My walk-in shower is separated from the bedroom only by jazzy Spanish floor tiles. Minor irritations, such as a lack of towel rails and no shelf in the shower, need addressing. Imported Indian toiletries and a tea tray of generic hotel biscuits and UHT milk also jar, despite a subsequent delivery of homemade cookies.</p><p>Broadly, though, with its open fires and sharp food, architectural drama and easygoing feel, Askham Hall offers the best of old and new. Leave your cagoule in the car.</p><p><em>• Accommodation was provided by Askham Hall.

        "headline":"Reno and Denver: forget the resorts and stay in a US ski hub",
        "body":"<p><hr /><strong>RENO</strong><br />March in Reno, Nevada, isn't particularly cold. The average daily high is around 12C. Beige and gold, dust and sand, glittering neon and glinting glass – the entire cityscape hollers heat, revels in sunlight, and bathes in the sparkling flow of cash in and out of the casinos.</p><p>At first glance, it doesn't appear to be a place you'd associate with skiing. Yet within an hour's drive of the city centre are a glut of resorts – some big, some small, all offering knee-deep powder and a local feel. Like its Colorado counterpart Denver, Reno, on the Nevada-California border, is a city most skiers fly into and head straight out of to their resort of choice. But there are benefits to sticking around – and these are not limited to the obligatory breakfast bloody mary offered by the casinos.</p><p>While I recommend the bloody marys at <a href=\"http://www.peppermillreno.com/\" title=\"\">Peppermill hotel and casino</a>, I was more excited about the dull sky and snow-heavy clouds overhead as we made our way up to the resort of <a href=\"http://www.mtrose.com/\" title=\"\">Mount Rose</a>. The 30-minute drive saw the dry landscape morph into pine trees, mist and great dollops of snow. We passed a car that had skidded off the road on the black ice, languishing in a ditch as police cars rallied, but we managed to arrive unscathed. The petite nature of the main lodge belied the 1,200 acres of steep terrain and superb tree runs that awaited us – chute after chute of perfect powder popping out at the base of Chuter chair, which took us to the top to do it all again. And meeting locals was a breeze as we kept bumping into the same people.</p><p>It snowed all day, so we headed for the trees, which provided markers and broke up the whiteness, and when the sun finally came out for our final hour, we were treated to a glistening view of Lake Tahoe in the distance, trees resplendent in their snowy attire. The day was topped off with a pint of Shock Top (a Belgian white beer that Mount Rose skiers seem to have made their own) in the main lodge bar. Kids wet through from snow and exertion greeted parents, parents greeted each other, ski instructors had laughs with punters and the whole lodge hummed with the vibe of a community celebrating a great day on the hill.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468965'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/11/1/1383305674851/Reno-map-001.jpg' alt='Reno map' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><strong></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Mount Rose isn't the only place within shouting distance of Reno. Another 10 minutes up the road is  <a href=\"http://diamondpeak.com/\" title=\"\">Diamond Peak</a> (blink and you'll miss it) with its locals-only-know powder glades. The behemoth of <a href=\"http://www.northstarcalifornia.com/\" title=\"\">North Star</a> – 3,170 acres of terrain, superpipes, freestyle parks, shops, restaurants and bars – is an hour away. Then there's Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, Kirkwood, Homewood and Heavenly.</p><p>The majority of these resorts would not by themseleves hold a skier's interest for a 10-day trip, but put them together and you've got an itinerary to keep even the hardiest skier entertained. Acting as the apex for all these resorts is Reno, which also probably wouldn't be enough to keep you entertained for a full trip. But break each day into wake up, ski, night in Reno, and throw in the odd day off, and out of the neon and gambling-den mire emerges a lotus of a city.</p><p>Reno is famously the place where divorce is quick and painless – in the 1961 film The Misfits, Marilyn Monroe threw her wedding ring into the Truckee river which snakes through downtown. It's not all about endings, though. Small businesses and restaurants are pushing up in between the casinos like green shoots, and the river constantly drags your eye towards the peaks of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>Java Jungle, (246 West 1st Street, <a href=\"http://www.javajunglevino.com/\" title=\"\">javajunglevino.com</a>), all band posters, open mic nights and poetry readings, served up a cracking cup of organic chai. Sundance Books (121 California Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.sundancebookstore.com/\" title=\"\">sundancebookstore.com</a>) is a haven of fairy lights and cushy sofas in a classic revival style building – and is said to have its own ghost.</p><p>The Riverwalk is the prettiest part of town, with restaurants serving organic local produce to streetside diners. And although Reno isn't a cultural hub, the <a href=\"http://www.nevadaart.org/\" title=\"\">Nevada Museum of Art</a> carries some interesting exhibitions. It's a far cry from Las Vegas, but offering as it does the chance to ski little-known local hills, then ditch the thermals and eat citrus-marinated tofu with swiss chard in a buzzy downtown, a trip to Reno feels like two holidays for the price of one.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468966'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/11/1/1383305441052/Skiing-in-Vail-near-Denve-008.jpg' alt='Skiing in Vail near Denver' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Skiing in Vail near Denver</figcaption></figure><p><hr /><strong>DENVER</strong><br />Denver doesn't have the mild identity crisis that seems to afflict Reno. It's very confident of its place in the world – the gateway to the Rockies, a vibrant cultural scene mixing effortlessly with the outdoor life. The Mercury Cafe (2199 California Stret, <a href=\"http://mercurycafe.com/\" title=\"\">mercurycafe.com</a>) is a great example of this. While savouring a pint of Treehugger from the list of microbrews as we waited for our dinner of local veggies and organic meats, a poetry slam gave way to jazz flutes and a touch of wailing from the performance room.</p><p>Its artsy vibe is mirrored in the River North area of the city – all yoga studios and raw-food restaurants. Linger (2030 West 30th Avenue, <a href=\"http://lingerdenver.com/\" title=\"\">lingerdenver.com</a>) is a former mortuary that's been converted into an eatery where the cocktails are as good as the panoramic view of downtown.</p><p>Equally inspiring are the indie music venues, record shops, thrift stores and dive bars in and around East Colfax Avenue. If Pete's Satire Lounge (<a href=\"http://www.petesrestaurants.com/SatireLounge.html\" title=\"\">petesrestaurants.com</a>) has changed at all since Bob Dylan gigged there as a teenager before he moved to New York, it's hard to tell.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468967'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/11/1/1383305736327/Denver-map-001.jpg' alt='Denver map' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><strong></strong></figcaption></figure><p>But as well as being yoga mat and tattoo parlour central, Denver is arguably one of the best hubs for skiing in North America. Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain, Vail, Winter Park, Beaver Creek and Arapahoe Basin are within a two-hour drive. They all offer superb skiing and all of them except Winter Park and Copper Mountain are owned by Vail Resorts and so covered by its Epic Pass (<a href=\"http://www.snow.com/epic-pass.aspx\" title=\"\">snow.com/epicpass</a>). Instead of spending a week in one resort, you can ski them all without buying a new pass. You can also hire skis in one resort and drop them off at the end of your trip in another.</p><p>All of which points to exploration rather than hanging out in one resort. It's not a plan that will suit everyone, but if you want the freedom to ski where the snow is good and fancy seeing a bit more than snowscapes – it is a long way to go just to ski – Denver is a great option.</p><p><em>• The trip was provided by Crystal Ski (0871 231 2256, </em><a href=\"http://www.crystalski.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>crystalski.co.uk</em></a><em>) which offers a week at the </em><a href=\"http://www.crystalski.co.uk/ski-resorts/usa-ski-holidays/lake-tahoe/peppermill-casino-reno/\" title=\"\"><em>Peppermill Casino in Reno</em></a><em> from £1,044pp for seven nights (based on two sharing) including American Airlines flights via Los Angeles.

Among the best-known is Garmisch-Partenkirchen, with 59km of pistes, which includes Germany's highest peak, Zugspitze. Rail operator <a href=\"http://www.bayerischeoberlandbahn.de/\" title=\"\">Bayerische Oberlandbahn</a> offers combined train and ski-lift tickets to Bad Tölz and Lake Tegernsee. <a href=\"http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/\" title=\"\">Deutsche Bahn</a> trains also serve Bavarian Alpine resorts, including Berchtesgaden.

Some of the Mont Blanc resorts, including Chamonix, are an hour away, as is the huge ski region of the Grand Massif (Samoëns, Flaine, Les Carroz, Morillon); Grand Bornand and La Clusaz in Aravis; and Les Gets in Portes du Soleil. Within two hours' drive are Paradiski, Tarentaise and Les Trois Vallées, which includes Courchevel and Méribel.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.skigeneva.co.uk/skigeneva-ski-resorts.htm\" title=\"\"><em>skigeneva.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Vancouver, Canada</h2><p>Vancouver, host of the 2010 Winter Olympics, has three local mountains: Grouse Mountain, Cypress Mountain and Mount Seymour. Cypress is 30&nbsp;minutes from the city centre and has downhill and cross-country skiing, snowtubing and snowshoeing. Grouse is even closer: 15 minutes from downtown. Whistler, North America's largest ski resort, is a two-hour drive north along the scenic Sea-to-Sky highway; buses and trains also take that route.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.tourismvancouver.com/do/activities-attractions/skiing/\" title=\"\"><em>tourismvancouver.com</em></a></p><h2>Queenstown, New Zealand</h2><p>This is New Zealand's best ski base, with bars, bungee jumps and four ski areas. Coronet Peak, 25&nbsp;minutes away, has roller coaster terrain and night skiing; the Remarkables (50 minutes), is best for beginners; Cardrona (55&nbsp;minutes) is the biggest close to the city; and Treble Cone (90&nbsp;minutes) is ideal for advanced and off-piste skiers.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.newzealand.com/uk/queenstown-wanaka+skiing/\" title=\"\"><em>newzealand.com</em></a></p><h2>Sapporo, Japan</h2><p>Japan's fifth-largest city is one of its snowiest, hosting an annual snow festival. Ski resorts within day-trip distance include Teine, 45&nbsp;minutes away, a mix of beginners' slopes and steep tree skiing. Kokusai (60 minutes) gets busy but has lots of quiet off-piste areas. Kiroro is 70&nbsp;minutes' drive; nearby Asari is good on windy days; and lavish Tomamu is an 80-minute train ride away.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.powderhounds.com/Japan/Hokkaido/Sapporo.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>powderhounds.com</em></a><br /><strong>Rachel Dixon</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421280529|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|72ccf0a3585c39e0a46339c1f3342423b9bd6ca4 -->",

        "body":"<h2>WINNING TIP: The Verulam Arms, St Albans</h2><p>St Albans has a lot of pubs to choose from but this place is different: no Stella. Where else can you get a hogweed and bloete martini? The food and drink are brought in from the Hertfordshire countryside by a group of local hunter-gatherers called The Foragers is surprisingly bountiful. Add a&nbsp;friendly atmosphere, cosy interior, approachable bar staff and a great choice of craft beers, and this is the place for a pint and good food, all in the shadow of the cathedral.<br /><a href=\"http://the-foragers.com/id/the-verulam-arms/\" title=\"\"><em>the-foragers.com/the-verulam-arms</em></a><br /><em> </em>cand82</p><h2><br />The Eagle, Cambridge<br /></h2><p>The highlight of my Saturday visit to the market is a pint in the Eagle, which dates from the 14th century and, much later, was where Watson and Crick announced they had discovered \"the secret of life\", or DNA. The Eagle is also famous for its ceiling: in the second world war, RAF pilots signed the ceiling with anything to hand: lipsticks, cigarette lighters, candles, even candle smoke. It also does fantastic cask ales and home-cooked food.<br /><em>8 Bene't Street, 01223 505020</em><br /><strong>Kimmy90210</strong></p><h2>The Bell, Bath</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464388'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234059775/Bell-Inn-Bath-001.jpg' alt='Bell Inn Bath' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>The Bell really is the local's local. After facing closure last year, it sold shares to its customers and is now a co-operative. As well as regular guest ales and local beers, it's the music at the Bell that draws many. The food is OK, but it's not what you would go there for. It's just a great boozer!<br /><em>103 Walcot Street, 01225 460426, </em><a href=\"http://www.thebellinnbath.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>thebellinnbath.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>joolsy</strong></p><h2>Y Delyn, Mold, Flintshire</h2><p>From its unprepossessing exterior, you would never guess at the wonder that awaits you inside Y Delyn. As well as walls adorned with old theatre posters, tables from spinning machines and fairy lights around the bar, there is a vast choice of beers, including Leffe and Hoegaarden on tap, reasonably priced delicious tapas, live music nights and an atmosphere that means you can easily lose several hours imagining you have stepped into continental Europe.<br /><em>3 King Street, 01352 759642</em><br /><strong>mattnash</strong></p><h2>Prince of Wales,  Kenfig, Bridgend</h2><p>The 16th-century Prince of Wales must be the best pub in Wales. It's walking distance from my house, and full of family, friends, locals, ghosts, history on the walls, great food, the finest cask beers and wonderful hosts – there is no&nbsp;better way to spend an evening. After a walk to <a href=\"http://www.kenfig.org.uk/naturereserve#.UnEHYBnspS4\" title=\"\">Kenfig Pool and through the local nature reserve</a>, it's a wonderful place to relax and refresh those tired bones. <br /><em>01656 740356, </em><a href=\"http://www.princekenfig.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>princekenfig.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>wxerri</strong></p><h2>The King and Queen,  Hamble, Hampshire</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464389'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234092303/King-and-Queen-Hamble-001.jpg' alt='King and Queen Hamble' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>Got a bag of dirty laundry? Take it to the King and Queen, where there's a laundrette, and relax by the inglenook with a book from the shelf while waiting for it to finish. This is a haven for sailors from near and far, and filled with locals whose faces you might recognise from Howards' Way. This pub has a jovial feel, with good food, great beer, excellent rums and friendly staff. <br /><em>023-8045 4247,  </em><a href=\"http://thekingandqueenpub.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>thekingandqueenpub.co.uk</em></a><br /><strong>FarawayVisions</strong></p><h2>The Three Compasses, Hornsey, London<br /></h2><p>If planning an ascent up the south face of Muswell Hill, pause in the foothills of Hornsey High Street at this regular winner of best community pub awards. It has one of the finest ale selections in north London, with new ones appearing weekly, and the menu is ambitious without being terrifying. But it is the ambience that keeps 'em coming back: a modern interpretation of the traditional London boozer, popular without being poncey.<br /><em>62 High Street, N8, 020-8340 2729, </em><a href=\"http://threecompasses.com/\" title=\"\"><em>threecompasses.com</em></a><br /><strong>winskill</strong></p><h2>Inn on the Green, Bristol<br /></h2><p>From the raucous beer festival over May Day to the cosy Sunday night quiz, the Inn on the Green is our second living room. A short stumble from Horfield common, it's the last best stop on the A38 out of Bristol, with its ever-changing ales, wood fires, good food and amusingly graffitied Jenga. Yes it's a bit tired (gents toilets), yes it's a funny shape (old bowling alley bit), but it's my local and I like it!<br /><em>2 Filton Rd,&nbsp;Horfield, 0117 952 1391</em><br /><strong>crodd</strong></p><h2>The Jolly Brewer Lincoln,<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421464390'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383234034760/Jolly-Brewer-Lincoln-001.jpg' alt='Jolly Brewer Lincoln' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>The Brewer has a jarringly bright interior and a questionable selection of artwork. It makes up for that with a friendly and eclectic clientele and a great selection of real ales and ciders. It's also popular with the local steampunk scene, so there are often amazing outfits to gawp at, and the beer garden is full well into autumn.<br /><em>26 Broadgate, 01522 528583</em><br /><strong>Rosie Kelly</strong></p><h2>The Woodbine,  Finsbury Park, London<br /></h2><p>Our favorite local in Finsbury Park is near where Blackstock Road runs into Highbury. The Woodbine is one of the cosiest pubs around, coupled with amazing music (on vinyl and usually of the Neil Young/Rolling Stones/Springsteen ilk), fantastic beers on tap (rotating casks along with Meantime and Camden breweries), great staff and awesome regulars. I would copy the decor in my house if I had the balls to do it. Good pub quiz, good specials, decent Thai food.<br /><em>215 Blackstock Road N5, 020-7354 1061 </em><br /><strong>ID6725784</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421300907|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|9aaca9750f8b30d30ebc80ed8f52e86f1d8eb435 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Santa Marta</h2><p>They are proud of the bronze Michael Jackson statue that stands on the edge of a little square in the Santa Marta favela in Rio de Janeiro. \"It's the only one in Rio,\" said 32-year-old Thiago Firmino, DJ, local resident and our tour guide. Its arms stretch out to embrace a dizzying view of Rio, and of the shanty town that tumbles down the hillside below. On the wall behind it is a Michael Jackson mosaic.</p><p>It was here that director Spike Lee filmed scenes for the video to Jackson's 1996 hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNJL6nfu__Q\" title=\"\">They Don't Care About Us</a>. Rio authorities originally opposed the video because they felt filming in a favela would show a negative side of the city, which at the time was bidding to host the 2004 Olympics. Nearly two decades later, with both the 2014 World Cup final and the 2016 Olympics set to be staged here, Rio is no longer quite so ashamed of its favelas. Officially, it has 763 of them, (according to the 2010 census), and they are home to almost 1.4 million people, or 22% of the city's population.</p><p>Lee's video plays on a loop in the little tourist shop that Thiago's parents run on the square, Praça Cantão. The alleyways in which Jackson danced seem little changed but lower down, a square at the foot of the favela has been brightened up with a 7,000-square-metre lick of paint. <a href=\"http://www.favelapainting.com/\">The Favela Painting art project</a>, created by Dutch duo Haas&amp;Hahn, with the aim of boosting community pride, has seen 34 houses painted in a rainbow of bright colours.</p><p>In 2008, Santa Marta was the first favela in Rio to be \"pacified\" under a state programme to expel its drug gangs by installing a police base and initiating social change projects. Since then, another 34 favelas have been pacified. Santa Marta is held up as the model and has become a stop-off for visiting celebrities, Madonna, Beyoncé and Alicia Keys included.</p><p>They come to see the effects of pacification: creches, new houses, concrete steps instead of treacherous muddy tracks, and a free tram that glides up at a 45% angle to help its 6,500 or so residents get up and down what is essentially a 1,000m mountain covered in rough brick, breezeblock and even wooden houses, just below the Christ the Redeemer statue.</p><p>In what used to be one of Rio's most violent slums, residents are turning to tourism. That day, Thiago's clients were two Dutch tourists from Utrecht, and he had recruited student Pedro Monteiro, 18, to translate. The Dutch visitors wandered wide-eyed through the favela.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614182'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221884226/Michael-Jackson-video-sti-001.jpg' alt='Michael Jackson video still' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Jackson filming the video for They Don't Really Care About Us at the Santa Marta favela in 1996. Photograph: Globo/ages</figcaption></figure><p>\"I like it very much,\" said Mirko van Denderen, 33, a teacher. \"The strange buildings …\"</p><p>Both peeked into Thiago's house, impressed by the contrast between its rugged raw-brick exterior, and its neat living room, fitted kitchen and flat-screen TV.</p><p>\"The majority of houses are cool inside, all done up,\" said Thiago. \"It demystifies it.\"</p><p>Tours like Thiago's offer a glimpse of another side of Brazilian life. But tourists should be aware that these are tours of places where very poor people live – which some might find difficult. It's very useful to have guide who lives in the area: they'll be accepted by local people, and are unlikely to gloss over issues the favela faces.</p><p>Pedro pointed out handmade signs protesting at the forced removals of dwellings that perch precariously at the very top of Santa Marta. \"Property speculation,\" said Thiago.</p><p>This used to be one of Rio's most violent slums, and was controlled by the Commando Vermelho (Red Command) drug gang. Now, like Thiago, residents of pacified favelas such as this are turning to tourism. \"I had to accept the work because so many people were coming,\" Thaigo said. </p><p>Roberto de Conceição, 48, was carrying his shopping up the hill. He likes the tours, he said: \"We meet new people. Thiago is from here,\" he said. Paulo Roberto, 45, was selling mobile phone cases, pens and Santa Marta T-shirts designed by his 11-year-old son, on a little stall. \"We are more and more involved. I live from this now,\" he smiled.</p><p>The alleyways got narrower as we descended. Chickens clucked in a drain. Purple flowers sprouted near bags of gravel. Children in flip-flops pushed past talking football. An old woman was carried past on a chair. Humanity teemed in the narrow alleys. Everything was tiny: a barber shop, an electrical products stall, a bedroom with three small bunk beds.</p><p>\"Every part of the community has a name,\" said Pedro, as he paused in front of a wall. \"This was called Beirut.\" The building behind which traffickers used to hide is now used for boxing and judo.</p><p>At the foot of the favela, outside the Bar Cheiro Bom (Good Smell Bar) Pedro pointed out bullet holes in a wall.</p><p>\"This was a conflict zone,\" said Thiago. \"Now there is always a police car and a camera.\"</p><p>The Dutch visitors were taken back up the hill on the tram. \"It feels a little strange to be wandering around taking pictures,\" concluded bank worker Willem van Duuren, 41. \"It feels a bit voyeuristic, seeing how poor the people are, but it is part of the country.\"</p><p><em>• Local resident Thiago Firmino offers two-hour tours of Santa Marta from around £15 in Portuguese or £20 in English (+55 21 9177 9459, </em><a href=\"http://favelasantamartatour.blogspot.com.br/\" title=\"\"><em>favelasantamartatour.blogspot.com.br</em></a><em>)</em></p><h2>Vidigal</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614183'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383231251139/Vidigal-Favela-001.jpg' alt='Vidigal Favela' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The best view in town … Vidigal overlooks Leblon beach. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Vidigal is Rio's most foreigner-friendly favela, with <em>pousadas</em> (guesthouses), bars, restaurants and even a sushi joint aimed at the tourist market. It is relatively small and picturesque, with spectacular views over the Atlantic, and an hour-long walking trail that winds from its upper limits to the top of the Dois Irmãos (Two Brothers) mountain.</p><p>When pacified in 2012, Vidigal was already popular with artists, young Brazilians and foreigners. Scottish school librarian Graeme Boyd, 34, lived there for two six-month periods, in 2009 and 2011. \"As long as foreigners respect the locals, make a contribution and use the businesses inside the favela, they will be welcomed,\" he said. \"People reacted to me as if I had lived there all my life.\"</p><p>Today Vidigal is compared to Rio's bohemian Santa Teresa district. This is a favela undergoing a gentrification process, with all the property speculation that entails. Critics say locals are the losers in this process. A legal battle over ownership of its most famous pousada, <a href=\"http://altovidigal.com/novosite/?page_id=253&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">Casa Alto Vidigal</a> – between Austrian proprietor Andreas Wielend and its previous German owner – even made the newspapers. But that hasn't diminished its popularity.</p><p>Casa Alto Vidigal looks like a squat transplanted from Dalston, east London, and offers rough-and-ready accommodation. But its all-night electronic music parties and Sunday sunset DJ sessions on a terrace with breathtaking views over Leblon and Ipanema beaches have made it a landmark. On weekend nights, young tourists queue for motorbike taxis to climb the hill to Alto Vidigal and other electronic music parties such as Morro Eletronico – an Ibiza-style lounge bar, whose outdoor dance floors and terraces cling to a tropical hillside.</p><p><em>• Carioca Free Culture (+21 99800 6278, </em><a href=\"http://www.cariocafreeculture.com/\" title=\"\"><em>cariocafreeculture.com</em></a><em>) is run by Brazilian Rodrigo, who grew up in the neighbouring Rocinha favela, and his partner, American Mary Ellen. Their  Dois Irmãos Trail in English lasts three to four hours and costs £15pp (minimum two people). It starts and ends in Vidigal and includes a hike up the mountain </em></p><h2>Tavares Bastos</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614184'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383231353655/Jazz-at-Maze-in-Tavares-B-001.jpg' alt='Jazz at Maze in Tavares Bastos' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jazz night at Maze pousada in Tavares Bastos</figcaption></figure><p>Vidigal is not the only favela with nightlife credentials. Monthly jazz nights at the <a href=\"http://jazzrio.com/en/\" title=\"\">Maze Pousada</a> have put the Tavares Bastos favela in Catete, central Rio, on the city's nightlife circuit. Staff hold up signs to direct the hundreds of partygoers who flock down the favela alleys. The live music is excellent but the 40 reais (£11) cover charge makes it too expensive for most locals; instead foreigners and richer Brazilians cram in. The pousada is owned by British expat Bob Nadkarni, and his son also runs a monthly alternative rock night, called Labirinto.</p><p>Bob has been tinkering with and expanding the building for the 30 years he has lived there, and opened the pousada seven years ago. It now teeters over the favela like a Gaudí castle, full of stairways and corridors and hidden nooks and crannies, with panoramic views over Guanabara Bay from its ample terraces. It has five double rooms and a dorm.</p><p>The neighbouring police training base has long made this favela relatively safe – on a recent visit, officers holding automatic weapons were practising combat drills in the alleys around the pousada.</p><p>\"People who come here don't want a common, tourist hotel that might be more comfortable, with air conditioning and TV,\" said Bob's wife, Mariluce da Silva. \"It is very tranquil.\"</p><h2>Complexo do Alemão</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614185'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221625009/mariluce-with-tourists-001.jpg' alt='mariluce with tourists' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mariluce, centre, with a group of tourists in Complexo do Alemão. Photograph: Dom Phillips</figcaption></figure><p>Mariluce was our guide to the Complexo do Alemão favela in north Rio. When soldiers and police invaded in 2010, a TV Globo helicopter showed dramatic live footage of bandits brandishing rifles and machine guns as they fled up a dirt track from advancing security forces. Now Alemão, a vast complex of 13 favelas, has a six-station cable car that has become a tourist attraction. The little gondolas glide silently over the concrete roofs, water tanks and satellite dishes of this vast favela, while sounds of dogs and chickens drift upwards. The <em>teleférico</em>, as it is called, opened in 2011 and a ride costs £1.40 for tourists (residents pay just 28p). And while some complain that the opening hours – 6am-9pm weekdays and 8am-8pm weekends – suit tourists rather than locals, the cable car is still better than cramming into the rickety minibuses that criss-cross the favelas for twice the price.</p><p>Complexo do Alemão, literally \"the Complex of the German\" was actually founded by a Pole – but blond, blue-eyed gringos are invariably refered to as \"Germans\" in Brazil. At the cable car's last stop, Palmeiras, resident Jackson Menezes, 74, was sitting in the sun. \"God blessed all the residents who live here who use the cable car. It really helps the community,\" he said. Menezes supported pacification, but said that the drug trade for which Alemão was notorious continues surreptitiously: \"It doesn't stop. It never stops. It stays hidden.\"</p><p>Beside him a boy was selling water. He said in English that he was 11 and his name was João. He was barefoot. João said he goes to school in the mornings and sells at the station in the afternoons. \"It's good. It's profitable,\" he said.</p><p>Cleber Araújo, 36, was minding his souvenir store. \"I am against cable-car tourism,\" he said. \"It is a safari.\"</p><p>Instead he organises group walking tours of favelas. A group of 70 have just been from a South African university, and 107 Spanish visitors have booked for the World Cup.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421614186'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383221481937/The-cable-car-in-Complexo-008.jpg' alt='The cable car in Complexo do Alemnão' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cable car in Complexo do Alemnão has become a tourist attraction. Photograph: Dom Phillips</figcaption></figure><p>Out here in Rio's gritty, dirty, industrial Zona Norte, far from the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema in Zona Sul, the community is clearly much poorer than in Vidigal. Many roads are just dirt. Three rangy horses were grazing on waste ground. Children passed with a horse and cart. Mariluce advised us not to take photographs as we looped through one alleyway in a part of the favela called Inferno Verde (Green Hell).</p><p>Tourist Alejandro Barreneche, 31, from Colombia, stopped to buy beer at a hole-in-the-wall bar. \"It's like going into a reality TV show,\" he said, \"like a zoo feeling. But again, it allows you to be closer to reality.\"</p><p>Barman Leoni Franco, 24, shrugged: \"It's good that tourists come. After pacification it is 100% better.\"</p><p>Other residents seemed more surprised by the visitors than the visitors were by them. Police were patrolling the streets, hands on the triggers of their automatic weapons, like an occupying army. Residents averted their eyes: from them, from us.</p><p>Mariluce stopped to point out an electricity meter, installed by the Rio electricity company after pacification. Previously, residents hooked up illegally with homemade tangles of cables called <em>gatos</em> (cats). The electricity meter is called a <em>tigre</em> (tiger). \"We used to steal from them,\" smiled Mariluce. \"Now they steal from us.\"</p><p>For decades, the people of Rio's favelas lived in gang-controlled isolation. Fear of the drugs trade that dominated so many of these neighbourhoods kept middle-class Brazilians away. Now that is changing. And the rest of the world is arriving. This throws up interesting questions – for those living there, and for those visiting. A curtain has come down.</p><p>\"We didn't have all these visitors,\" said the owner of a tiny shop. \"But no one gets annoyed. I hope it continues.\"</p><p>On a little high street similar to many in Brazil. Mariluce shooed her tourists out of the way of a minibus. \"As you can see, this is a neighbourhood like any other,\"  she said.</p><p><em>• Cleber Araújo (+55 21 </em>96736 9353<em>, complexoalemao.rj@gmail.com) offers group tours for £15pp, with English translation and cultural options such as capoeira and samba, and even lunch at a new favela bistro</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421366170|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|9ac66f679e315850391d0f95f5de5d1046d73ac1 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Established by Congolese migrants, Brussels' vibrant Matonge area is now a magnet for young Belgians – plus the odd Eurocrat, says <strong>Emma Beddington </strong></p>",
        "headline":"Out of Africa: Brussels' vibrant Matonge quarter",
        "body":"<p>\"Smile\" reads the sign over the ramshackle shopping centre, where racks of highly flammable vest tops rub shoulders with vats of hair relaxer. \"You're in Matonge.\"</p><p>Tucked incongruously between the plate-glass and concrete of European Union institutions on one side and the high-end boutiques of the Avenue Louise on the other, the African quarter of Brussels hasn't always had the best reputation. Scruffy and anarchic, it has been a frequent flashpoint for conflict, particularly in 2011 following the Congolese elections, but it's emerging as one of the most exciting, creative parts of the city.</p><p>Named after a lively area of Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Matonge took shape in the wake of the country's independence in 1960, though the area already had African associations. The following year, as more Congolese citizens moved to Belgium to study, an aristocratic philanthropist called Monique Van der Straten founded \"Maisaf\" (La Maison Africaine), a hostel for these students, on rue Alsace-Lorraine, in the heart of today's Matonge.</p><p>A community – with nightclubs, bars and shops – grew up in the network of streets south of Chaussée de Wavre, and other African immigrants followed in the wake of the Congolese pioneers.</p><p>At the <a href=\"http://www.kuumba.be/\" title=\"\">Kuumba</a> cultural centre, which organises excellent walking tours of the area with local guides, Jeroen Marckelbach explains that, after that first wave of students, Matonge has not been a place where Africans lived (the area has been too expensive for poor migrants for decades), but a meeting place: somewhere to shop, eat and party.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468988'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383219843873/Le-Soleil-dAfrique-restau-001.jpg' alt='Le Soleil d'Afrique restaurant' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Le Soleil d'Afrique restaurant Photograph: Emma Beddington</figcaption></figure><p>Walk down Chaussée de Wavre at night and you'll see batik shops, hairdressers and exotic grocers all open late, packed with groups of all ages gossiping and hanging out. In the pedestrian rue Longue Vie, restaurants such as Le Soleil d'Afrique serve cheap, delicious chicken <em>mafé</em>, a Senegalese dish with peanut sauce, and dubious cocktails with names like Viagra to customers at packed communal tables, lanyard-draped Eurocrats sitting elbow-to-elbow with Congolese students.</p><p>The European Union institutions grew up alongside Matonge, just a few hundred metres to the east but, until recently, the two communities largely kept a cautious distance. Initiatives such as last summer's Matonge-Europe football tournament, are working to bring them together.</p><p>And Matonge has more to offer than wigs, nails and dried fish: it's a fascinating place to soak up a mix of African culture, <em>bobo</em> (the much-derided <em>bourgeois-bohème</em>) hangouts and historic Brussels.</p><p><a href=\"http://afrikamali.be/\" title=\"\">Afrikamäli</a> – the word means \"African treasures\" in Swahili – is a community project that set out to show another side to the area: in a bright, appealing shop on rue Ernest Solvay, Magali Sylvestre sells fair traded and ethical crafts from across sub-Saharan Africa, assisted by long-term unemployed locals, for whom the shop is a springboard into work.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468989'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383220222131/Afrikamali-shop-Matonge-001.jpg' alt='Afrikamali shop, Matonge' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Afrikamali shop, Matonge</figcaption></figure><p>The central location and relatively forgiving business rents have allowed other small creative entrepreneurs to move in, giving Matonge a more varied texture: places like <a href=\"http://lepetitboudoirixelles.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Le Petit Boudoir</a>, which sells delicate, quirky accessories, or <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\" title=\"\">Les Midinettes</a> <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\" title=\"\">(30 rue Ernest Solvay, lesmidinettes.be)</a>, a sewing atelier, cafe and clothes shop promoting young Belgian designers. There are cavernous vintage shops, second-hand bookstores, cool neighbourhood bars like <a href=\"http://www.stamgent.be/nl/bezoek/cafe\" title=\"\">Stam Café </a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stam1050\" title=\"\">(1 rue Bouré, facebook.com/stam1050)</a> and an excellent art house cinema, the <a href=\"http://www.cinema-vendome.be/\" title=\"\">Vendôme</a>.</p><p>On the western edge of Matonge, on rue du Berger, is another extraordinary slice of Brussels history. <a href=\"http://www.lebergerhotel.be/hotel/\" title=\"\">Hôtel le Berger</a> is a former <em>hôtel de rendez-vous</em>, renting rooms by the hour to well-to-do Brussels residents for discreet liaisons.  It has kept its louche 1930s charm while adding a few 21st-century comforts.</p><p>In the south of Matonge, rue St Boniface is another kind of meeting place, crammed with restaurants and bars, from Japanese ramen to Belgian mussels and all points between. It's a magnet for young Belgians and expats, and responsible for coaxing a younger, richer public into the area.</p><p>From the beautiful <a href=\"http://comptoirflorian.be/\" title=\"\">Comptoir Florian</a> cafe at number 17, owner Vincent has watched the area evolve. \"When I opened 19 years ago, all my friends thought I was mad. There was nothing here. But I knew the area and its history and I loved it. I like how mixed it is.\" His customers reflect that: out on the terrace a group of middle-aged African men are laughing over cheesecake, while inside students, galleristas and locals drink Japanese brown rice tea and flick through the piles of interiors magazines.</p><p>\"Mixed\" is a word you hear a lot from the residents of Matonge: that's a huge part of its appeal. From 78-year-old Bartholomé and his parrot Chirac, still mending shoes on rue de l'Athénée, to the kids checking each other out in the fried chicken shops, all human life is there.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421468990'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/31/1383220006734/Elisabeth-and-Sinem-of-Un-001.jpg' alt='Elisabeth and Sinem of Unico restaurant' width='460' height='450' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Elisabeth and Sinem of Unico </figcaption></figure><p>Looking back over a year since they opened, Elisabeth and Sinem of <a href=\"http://jesuisunico.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">Unico</a>, a tiny Italian wine bar and restaurant have embraced the area in all its contradictions. \"It can seem scary,\" says Sinem, \"but it's been wonderful.\"</p><p>Isabelle and Mathilde of <a href=\"http://www.lesmidinettes.be/\">Les Midinettes</a> add a reminder to look up above the bustle and the chaos to discover the wonderful façades and glorious art nouveau details that are everywhere in Matonge's streets. \"Every day, I discover something new\" says Isabelle, which would certainly give you something to smile about.</p><p><em>• Eurostar (eurostar.com) trains from London St Pancras to Brussels take under two hours, from £69pp return </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421363813|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|3646c941f1ed53634346b6329e05275fafdd920e -->",
