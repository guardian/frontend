        "headline":"Tommy Hindley obituary",
        "body":"<p>Tommy Hindley, who has died from a brain tumour aged 66, covered many Olympic Games – from Moscow 1980 onwards – and was a regular at World Cup football tournaments, but he was most celebrated for his shots of grand slam tennis matches. His images are displayed at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon and were regularly published in the Guardian, the Observer and many other publications.</p><p>Tommy had worked as the official Tottenham Hotspur photographer for a long time before starting to freelance at the Observer. One of his early commissions from the paper was to cover the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989. His poignant picture of the ensuing disaster, depicting the victims laid out on the pitch, was used on the Observer's front page the next day.</p><p>Born in Hackney, east London, Tommy was the only child of Thomas and Catherine Hindley. He often said he had to bring himself up as his father spent much of Tommy's childhood in a sanatorium suffering from TB and his mother had to work long hours in a clothing factory to support them.</p><p>Throughout his life Tommy seemed to thrive on adversity. He would not surrender to the gangs of boys from neighbouring Tottenham or his opponents on the football pitch or, much later, sports stars such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/john-mcenroe\" title=\"\">John McEnroe</a>, who at the 1983 French Open kicked one of Tommy's lenses. \"You cannot be serious, John!\" Tommy screamed back.</p><p>After leaving Lordship Lane Secondary Modern, Tottenham, Tommy worked in Fleet Street as a messenger and, one day, had the cheek to walk into one of the broadsheets and ask for a job as a photographer. He was told politely to come back when he could do the job.</p><p>He managed to get some part-time evening work teaching at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication). Fortunately, his partner, Jan, whom he went on to marry in 1981, had a good job in the City and an old secondhand Mini so she paid all the bills and drove them around.</p><p>I played a small part in his change of fortunes in the late 1970s. I had just got a start on the Guardian and needed somebody to look after my local paper contracts when I saw Tommy's advert looking for work in the <a href=\"http://www.bjp-online.com/\" title=\"\">British Journal of Photography</a>. It turned out that we lived around the corner from each other and Jan was soon driving Tommy to Enfield Town FC, Saracens rugby club and Southgate hockey on wet, dark Saturday afternoons.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419183643'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/6/1381063900029/Tommy-Hindley-sports-phot-009.jpg' alt='Tommy Hindley, sports photographer, with camera' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tommy Hindley was the official Tottenham Hotspur photographer before starting to freelance at the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>He would shoot everything on a handful of rolls of film and then print and deliver to the local papers personally by deadline, often in the middle of the night. Soon they were delivering to the national papers. Jan remembers: \"I would wait in Fleet Street, with the engine running usually (in case my Mini broke down), while Tommy ran up and handed the photos to the picture desk.\"</p><p>In 1977 he formed his own agency, <a href=\"http://tommyhindley.com/about.html\" title=\"Tommy Hindley's Professional Sport picture agency\">Professional Sport</a>, which has since won many awards. He secured high-profile contracts with the Lawn Tennis Association and the All England Club and was presented with a 2010 Tennis Europe award by Derek Howorth, then president of the LTA. He was chairman of the International Tennis Photographers Association for many years and was also a member of the Sports Journalists' Association.</p><p>His first Olympics came at Moscow in 1980, and his son Julian remembers working with him at the Athens Games of 1996, when they scooped the front pages of many papers with a shot of Kelly Holmes bringing home a gold medal for Great Britain. \"Dad got the shot and I ran (almost probably as fast as Kelly) to transmit the picture he literally threw across the track to me on a disc.\"</p><p>Last year was the pinnacle for Tommy as the Olympics were staged in his home town. It had all come full circle for the boy from the East End, and again he was on hand to take striking shots.</p><p>Tommy is survived by Jan and their children, Julian, Faye and Giles.</p><p>• Thomas Valentine Hindley, photographer, born 20 June 1947; died 18 September 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179293|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|692b1fa18815c3fa1dae8500c229877dd1ba48ee -->",

        "body":"<p>Novak Djokovic, the No1 seed, won his fourth China Open crown on Sunday with a straight-sets victory over the No2, Rafael Nadal.</p><p>The Serb, who will on Monday surrender top spot in the world rankings to the Spaniard, captured his fourth ATP World Tour title of the year with a 6-3, 6-4 triumph in Beijing.</p><p>The result improved his record in the Chinese capital to 19-0 and made him the first four-times winner of the event following his successes in 2009, 2010 and 2012.Nadal had secured his return to the world No1 spot on Saturday when he advanced to the final courtesy of Tomas Berdych retiring with a back injury, with the Czech trailing 4-2 in the first set.</p><p>The 27-year-old Spaniard's return to the summit follows a lengthy lay-off with a knee injury. Since returning in February, Nadal has won 10 titles, including those at the French Open and US Open.</p><p>Djokovic broke serve in Nadal's first service game en route to closing out a 35-minute opening set in which he conceded only two points on serve.</p><p>The six-times major winner was equally dominant in the second set, snaring an early break and dropping just four points on serve to clinch an impressive win which ended a run of three straight defeats against the Spaniard.</p><p>\"I needed this win today,\" Djokovic said after halting Nadal's 22-match winning streak. \"I really wanted to get my hands on the trophy and win against Nadal, who has been the best player so far in 2013. It's very important for my confidence. It's very important, mentally and emotionally, for me. I still haven't lost a match here. I just love the conditions.\"</p><p>The 26-year-old, runner-up to Nadal at the US Open last month, continued: \"I managed to stay tough and not drop my concentration, which I think [happened] in both Montreal and at the US Open in the important moments.</p><p>\"I learned my lesson. It was a few very tough and close matches that I lost against Rafa on hard courts, especially the last one in the US Open final.\"</p><p>Nadal was gracious in defeat, saying: \"This afternoon he was too strong for me. I didn't play my best match, but he played at a very high level with his serve.</p><p>\"I was not able to have any chance when I was returning during the whole match. He had the ball staying very low. It was very difficult to create spin on this ball.</p><p>\"He was able to hit all the balls where he wanted. When that's happening against a player like Novak, you are dead. You don't have one chance.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419183142|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|6607e3f9b14fc09c579cc6454f89876c0112375c -->",

        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Rafael Nadal will return to the top of the men's world rankings after Tomas Berdych retired with a back injury during their China Open semi-final on Saturday. Serbia's Novak Djokovic, who will lose top spot when the new rankings are announced on Monday, defeated the Frenchman Richard Gasquet in the second semi-final 6-4, 6-2.</p><p>Berdych, trailing 4-2 in the opening set, tweaked his back while running for a backhand slice and needed a medical time-out. He did return to the court but after a few points decided he could no longer continue, handing the 27-year-old Spaniard an easy passage to the final.</p><p>Nadal, who boosted his grand slam singles tally to 13 this year by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/09/rafael-nadal-ferrer-french-open\" title=\"\">winning the French</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/sep/11/rafael-nadal-us-open-video\" title=\"\">US Open</a>s, has not been ranked No1 since July 2011 but has produced a stunning run since returning from a long injury lay-off in February.</p><p>\"This is a great year, one of the best years of my career without any doubt,\" Nadal said. \"It sure is special to be back to the top position of the rankings after more than a half year without playing tennis.</p><p>\"At the end, it's just a number ... What makes me happy is everything I did to be back where I am today.\"</p><p>He has lost two finals since his return, winning 10 tournaments and adding over $10m (£6.3m) in prize money in 2013. The semi-final victory extended Nadal's winning run to 21 matches and another win on Sunday will give him his first China Open title since 2005.</p><p>\"It will be a great finish to the season if I am able to finish the season at No1 spot,\" the Spaniard added. \"For that, I am sure I need to win more matches if I want to be there.\"</p><p>The top-ranked Serena Williams and Jelena Jankovic of Serbia advanced to the women's final with contrasting wins. Williams earned a straightforward 6-2, 6-2 victory over Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland while Jankovic rallied for a 6-7, 6-1, 6-1 win over Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic.</p><p>Meanwhile, the top seed Juan Martín del Potro beat Nicolas Almagro of Spain 7-6, 7-6 in the semi-finals of the Japan Open to set up a title clash with the big-serving Milos Raonic of Canada.</p><p>The in-form Raonic, who lost to the home favourite Kei Nishikori in last year's final, defeated the unseeded Ivan Dodig of Croatia 7-6, 6-1 in 84 minutes to reach his fourth final of the year.</p><p>The Argentinian Del Potro, 25, prevailed in both the tie-breakers to beat the sixth seed Almagro under a closed roof at the Ariake Coliseum in Tokyo.</p><p>Raonic, 22, who won his second title of the year at last week's Thailand Open, has neither dropped a set nor been broken in his four matches in the tournament. He has won the only meeting against the world No7 in straight sets in Montreal in August.</p><p>\"I know his game,\" said Del Potro, \"and it's tough to break his serve. But anything can happen in the final and maybe I need to play better than today for me to have a chance.\"</p><p>The Montenegro-born Raonic, who won his first 2013 title after retaining his San Jose crown in February, served 12 aces in the semi-final to boost his four-match tally to 64.</p><p>\"For me, it's going to be about taking care of my serve primarily, and after that, trying to dictate and play on my terms as much as possible,\" Raonic said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419128122|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|5c8ecd6fc555cdf2d293f38387ca7efd27cbe110 -->",

The world No3 has been named alongside Juan Martín del Potro, Nicolás Almagro and Richard Gasquet in the four-man exhibition tournament, which begins on 28 November.</p><p>Murray's participation is subject to him coming through a rehabilitation programme following his surgery to correct a niggling back problem that ruled him out of the French Open earlier this year. The Scot is expected to join up with his coach, Ivan Lendl, at his annual winter training camp in Miami in mid-November where he will focus on challenging for a third grand slam title at the Australian Open in January.</p><p>Murray underwent a procedure on a disc last month and Friday's announcement from the Dream Cup's organisers would appear to confirm that he will miss the ATP World Tour Finals at the start of November.</p><p>While Murray recovers, the race to finish the year as world No1 is taking place between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal with the latter now one victory away from returning to the top of the rankings. The Spaniard will regain top spot if he reaches the China Open final regardless of what Djokovic does.</p><p>Nadal, who took his grand slam singles haul to 13 this year by winning the French and US Opens, has not been ranked No1 in the world since July 2011. Nonetheless he had to survive a huge scare against the Italian Fabio Fognini to reach the semi-finals in Beijing on Friday. Fognini, ranked 19, took the first set before Nadal earned a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory.</p><p>\"It's something that doesn't create more pressure for me,\" Nadal, who will meet either Tomas Berdych or John Isner in the last four, said. \"It's something that already happened in the past. If that happens again, it will be good, it will be special for me, but we'll see.</p><p>\"I am going to have a very tough opponent in front of me. In the end, it's another match.

However, Tomic Sr was not required to serve jail time because his sentence was under two years.</p><p>The ATP rescinded Tomic's accreditation for all tour events this year and will decide whether to lift the ban next May.</p><p>\"The grand slams as well as the ATP work together on this,\" the Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said. \"The rule is he's not accredited and does not have permission to purchase a ticket. And the systems we have in place – John [or] anyone else who is banned, they are not allowed on the grounds and our security personnel will take care of that appropriately.\"</p><p>Bernard Tomic has stood by his father throughout the controversy and criticised the ATP for being quick to impose the ban. At Wimbledon, the 20-year-old said he would ask tournament officials to allow his father to be courtside at his matches, but the ban remained in place.</p><p>Tomic, the world No55, won his first ATP title in Sydney during January, but has struggled for fitness and form during his father's exile. He made the fourth round at Wimbledon, but was knocked out at the first hurdle at Roland Garros and the second at Flushing Meadows.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418830043|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|c25b331e80d35fa74ad39209c777138306e9044f -->",

        "headline":"LTA's new chief executive Michael Downey aims to break down barriers",
        "body":"<p>Following in the footsteps of the Bank of England, the Lawn Tennis Association has imported a well-regarded Canadian to overhaul an oft-criticised institution. But even as the chairman, David Gregson, unveiled Tennis Canada's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/24/lta-tennis-chief-executive\" title=\"\">Michael Downey as the LTA's new chief executive</a>, he was forced to defend a lengthy and sometimes controversial recruitment process.</p><p>He also delivered a coded rebuke to his predecessor as chairman by revealing that Downey, a former brewery executive who has led Tennis Canada for nine years, would take home around half of the £640,000 plus that the much maligned Roger Draper earned.</p><p>Gregson, who was appointed in December 2012 six months before Draper announced his intention to step down, talked up Downey's ability to marry elite success with a growth in participation. He pointed to figures showing more than 1.2m people played tennis at least twice a month in season in Canada.</p><p>The LTA had come under fire during Draper's tenure for failing to increase the strength in depth in the elite men's game beyond Andy Murray, for failing to grow participation levels and for making only limited progress in transforming perceptions of the sport.</p><p>But Downey, who will take up his post in January, vowed to bring a new attitude of partnership and collaboration to the LTA in a country that he called \"the cradle of tennis\". He will embark on a consultation with all involved in the game, including long-standing critics. \"The LTA has a new mission. To get more people playing more tennis more often. It starts there. One of the things I want to bring to the LTA is the belief we're not talking about the LTA, we're talking about tennis in Britain. What the LTA is about is trying to engage with others to help collectively grow the sport,\" said Downey.  The 56-year-old will relocate from Canada and will be paid £300,000 a year, with the potential to earn up to £90,000 in performance-related bonuses.</p><p>In May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/13/lta-replacement-roger-draper\" title=\"\">Baroness Billingham</a>, the chair of the All Party Tennis Group and a long-standing critic, said the LTA was a \"total shambles, tottering from one broken pledge to another\". It was the revelation that Draper earned £640,000 a year, plus benefits, that increased the volume of criticism aimed at the organisation.</p><p>\"I am confident in asserting that is the right level for a job of this magnitude. We have benchmarked it. I am absolutely confident that is the right level for this job,\" said Gregson of the £300,000 salary. He said that a longer-term incentive plan could also be put in place.</p><p>The LTA originally advertised the position in May and had to restart the recruitment process in July after a series of false starts and criticism from some of those rejected. \"I always thought that a global search of this magnitude would take this long. I make no apology for the fact it has taken us until now,\" insisted Gregson, who said that Downey was the LTA board's first choice and that no other candidates turned it down.</p><p>He was also unapologetic about the fact that the LTA had gone overseas to recruit its chief executive. \"We went for a completely global search and we were looking for the best person to lead the LTA wherever they came from and whatever gender they were. We had over 350 applications.</p><p>\"We interviewed nearly 30 of those. We spared no effort to find the right person to lead the LTA. If you asked me who was the best person to run the LTA out of all of those, I would say Michael.\"</p><p>When Draper joined the LTA in 2006, he abandoned the wild card system and recruited a team of expensive overseas coaches. Both experiments were short lived.</p><p>While the emergence of Laura Robson and Heather Watson as top 50 players has improved perceptions of the women's game, and Draper deserves credit for improving the LTA's governance and commercial clout, Murray has remained virtually alone at the top of the men's game.</p><p>Downey emphasised his intention to concentrate on breaking down some of the barriers within the game to better invest the £30m dividend that the LTA receives every year from the All England Club. But he acknowledged that expectations would be higher in England than they were in Canada.</p><p>\"Kids start playing tennis too late. I believe a lot of resources should go into mini tennis so we can engage kids earlier. One of the advantages of our sport is that it is truly cradle to grave and if we get kids earlier they're more likely to stay with us for life,\" he said. \"We want the sport to be open to everyone and to be perceived as being open to everyone.\" In Canada, he said, 80% to 90% of tennis was played on public courts.</p><p>Downey said he backed the idea of having a high-performance national tennis centre, like the LTA's £40m facility in Roehampton, but said it should be balanced by a willingness to work with and fund other coaches in the private sector.</p><p>He also promised to capitalise on the surge of interest sparked by Murray's Wimbledon win: \"The opportunity now that Andy Murray is a Wimbledon champion and two-time Grand Slam champion is immense for tennis in Britain.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418165720|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|7d93987caa26a119cbe1cf6b37dbd40e85f8409c -->",

        "headline":"Michael Downey's 'new mission' must change culture at LTA and beyond",
        "body":"<p>Deep in leafy west London, behind two sets of security gates and a car park packed with luxury motors, the new chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association was sitting in the bowels of the £40m National Tennis Centre expounding his democratising vision for a sport still too often regarded as the preserve of the privileged few.</p><p>The irony barely needed spelling out. The LTA has a \"new mission\", declared the Canadian Michael Downey: \"To get more people playing more tennis, more often\". He expounded the joys of mini-tennis and talked of the need to overhaul public courts and inspire more kids into the game, to change the image of the sport, to be a better partner for the betterment of British tennis and to make it truly accessible to all.</p><p>So far, so familiar. But if Downey, in tandem with the relatively recently introduced chairman, David Gregson, can actually put into practice those oft-heard mantras then the rewards could be great.</p><p>Behind his simple statement lies both a huge challenge and a big opportunity. Despite the rivers of cash flowing into an organisation with revenues of £60m plus every year, which includes a £35.8m  dividend from those who throng SW19 every summer and more than £10m of public money, it has consistently failed by two of its main measures of success.</p><p>Firstly, the pool of men's talent in the top 200 beneath Andy Murray has stubbornly refused to get any deeper despite occasional incursions (Dan Evans being the latest hope). Secondly, when the dapper – later derided – Roger Draper swept into the job in 2006 on a wave of promises, 457,200 adults played tennis once a week, according to Sport England figures.</p><p>According to the most recent numbers in April 2013, that figure stood at 424,300. The total has fluctuated and has recently been on a gentle upward curve but Draper, on his now infamous £640,000 salary, took too long to get to grips with the problem.</p><p>As recently as last year, government insiders were scathing about the pitch given by the LTA for public money and Draper's attitude to the process – another irony, given that he was a former Sport England chief executive. The quango responded by withholding next year's award of £10.3m unless the governing body can prove it deserves it.</p><p>The National Tennis Centre, the number of people the LTA employs and the large pay-offs given to a group of expensively acquired overseas coaches are regularly cited as examples of its largesse.</p><p>Nor is there much evidence that Draper, who does deserve credit for overhauling the LTA's governance structures and improving its commercial standing, did much to catalyse a genuine shift in the way tennis is perceived by those potential young players who represent its future.</p><p>Draper's many critics down the years –from his bête noire Baroness Billingham of the All Party Tennis Group to Tony Hawks' laudable Tennis for Free campaign, and Mark Petchey and Judy Murray – have had valid points. Some have made them more forcefully than others and some, including Murray, seem cautiously heartened by recent progress and the new mindset under Gregson.</p><p>Downey's one big advantage is that he is not his predecessor. Draper sometimes suffered a bad press but in truth he did not help himself with his high self-regard and reluctance to admit mistakes. Too often, he managed up but failed to delegate down. And the \"not invented here\" suspicion of anyone beyond the LTA's walls who thought they could contribute to growing the game was palpable.</p><p>The fear persists that the LTA remains culturally too concerned with preserving the status quo to heal itself. Gregson underlined that he and Downey were outsiders and the newly arrived Canadian emphasised that they had a \"blank sheet of paper\", promising to consult and be partners with anyone who could help the game. Yet the pull of inertia is strong.</p><p>As with any new administration, Downey needs to hit the ground running in January and come up with a credible plan within his first months in the job for dramatically improving the access of young people to coaching and facilities, as well as conducting an audit of the size and scope of the LTA's administrative hub.</p><p>As with British Cycling, which is so regularly referenced in sporting circles that it has become something of a cliche, it won't be changing one thing that transforms tennis in this country but marginal gains across a multitude of areas.</p><p>As councils and schools become increasingly cash-strapped, the LTA will have to play more of a proactive role in ensuring affordable access to facilities and coaching. Here, too, Downey made some of the right noises, promising to go beyond London to evaluate the national picture. The recent AllPlay initiative was a belated start but doesn't go nearly far enough.</p><p>Downey is right to reference the importance of Andy Murray in catalysing interest and excitement among potential young players. But, once inspired, they need somewhere to play and someone to coach them. It need not be a flash £40m indoor facility (though the provision of more indoor courts within a reasonable distance of major cities is also key) but simply a reasonable surface without rips in the net or potholes in the court.</p><p>There is a curious paradox at the heart of the continued malaise of a sport that finally has a British male Wimbledon champion again after 77 years.</p><p>At the top end, the avalanche of cash generated by Wimbledon has arguably stunted ambition as pampered players have remained in their comfort zone with their every whim catered for.  Yet not enough of that money has trickled down to public courts up and down the land or to the local coaches who can forge links between schools and clubs and who will ultimately be charged with seizing on the interest generated by a Murray grand slam victory. Too often, it has been left to inspirational individuals to succeed despite the system rather than because of it.</p><p>Rather like football, where St George's Park and Premier League academies stand in secluded isolation and offer pitches that are the best of the best to a lucky few while tens of thousands toil on waterlogged quagmires elsewhere, tennis has ended up with an entirely polarised map of facilities.</p><p>That is perhaps starting to change, but not fast enough. The same is true of the culture at tennis clubs – there are many laudable exceptions that genuinely encourage junior players, but every glorified social club where the pitter-patter of gentle recreational doubles dominates to the exclusion of all else remains one too many.</p><p>And the day when towns and cities up and down the land have the kind of affordable municipal facilities and sports club culture to rival France, Germany and the Netherlands seems as depressingly far away as ever.</p><p>Despite that, all the pieces of the puzzle are laid out before Downey. He has money and goodwill behind him. It will now be up to him to put them together.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418173907|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|8d9c881eb8af4684964da950c33cc38f928652de -->",

        "body":"<p>Marin Cilic's announcement during Wimbledon that he was pulling out of the tournament due to a knee injury was to avoid \"adverse publicity\" from the fact he had failed a drugs test, the full findings of the case have revealed.</p><p>The Croatian, who was No10 seed at the All England Club this summer, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/16/marin-cilic-ban-positive-test\" title=\"\">banned for nine months last week after testing positive for a banned supplement</a>.</p><p>He had been one of the leading players at Wimbledon, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/16/andy-murray-marin-cilic-queens-club\" title=\"\">finished runner-up to Andy Murray at Queen's</a>, but pulled out of his match against France's Kenny de Schepper on 26 June having accepted a provisional suspension for the positive test – but cited a knee injury as the reason. He was one of seven players to withdraw – such a higher number led to an inquest into the state of the courts.</p><p>The findings by the International Tennis Federation's independent anti-doping tribunal stated: \"He [Cilic] played and won his first-round match at Wimbledon on 24 June. He has not played in a competitive match since.</p><p>\"On 26 June his lawyers in Brussels responded on his behalf, voluntarily accepting a provisional suspension until a decision in the case, and waiving his right to analysis of the B sample. He withdrew from Wimbledon, citing a knee injury to avoid adverse publicity.\"</p><p>Cilic, 24, tested positive for the banned supplement nikethamide after taking Coramine glucose tablets bought at a pharmacy in Monte Carlo. The tribunal heard the tablets' information leaflet contained a warning for athletes that they could lead to a positive test, but Cilic argued that he could not understand French.</p><p>The tribunal's findings stated that the player could easily have checked before taking the tablets, but accepted he had inadvertently ingested the nikethamide and \"did not intend to enhance his performance in doing so\".</p><p>They added: \"The product had the word 'Coramine' in upper case letters on the front. The player was familiar with websites such as Google and Wikipedia. It would have taken only minutes to search under 'Coramine' on those sites, and discover the danger he was in.\"</p><p>Cilic had also stated that he was under considerable stress due to problems between his coach Bob Brett and his parents. The tribunal accepted that but said: \"We do not, however, think that the stress the player was suffering is a factor of great weight. Conditions in the highest echelons of professional sport are inherently stressful.\"</p><p>The tribunal said the offence was \"not at the most serious end of the scale\" but still warranted a nine-month ban. Cilic has said he will appeal against the decision to the court of arbitration for sport.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418130303|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|f1e8b2315b65659003feaa8ca94a06efad9adb69 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andy Murray has said the Wimbledon final on centre court was one of the toughest matches of his career but \"the best day of my life so far\".</p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Murray said his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-win-djokovic\" title=\"\">historic victory on Sunday</a> had finally sunk in, but admitted that he \"embraced\" rather than enjoyed crunch matches.</p><p>The tennis star, who on Sunday beat the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets to become the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said that around 45 minutes after he had won, he suddenly became \"so so tired\".</p><p>\"Yesterday was a long day, but the best day of my life so far.\"</p><p>Asked if he enjoyed playing the biggest matches of his career, Murray said: \"I'd say embrace rather than enjoy. It's tough to explain [...] if I had lost I wouldn't have enjoyed it, but I won.\"</p><p>He said the match against Djokovic \"was one of the most challenging matches I've played in my career&nbsp;… an unbelievable physical and mental challenge, so I don't know about enjoying it but you have to embrace that situation.\"</p><p>The Scot said he had raised his game and come back strong after losing against Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final last year. \"It was the hardest loss of my career. I was very emotional afterwards, but I just responded really well to it.\"</p><p>He said the pressure on him as Britain's No 1 was huge, which could make playing Wimbledon \"hard and stressful\", and added: \"We're programmed to hit tennis balls. That's the easy part.\"</p><p>\"One thing I can say is that I have always enjoyed the training aspect [...] working hard and trying to get better, but dealing with the pressure has been hard at times.\"</p><p>Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, denied \"photo-bombing\" David Cameron at the match when he raised a large Scottish flag behind the prime minister immediately after Murray's win.</p><p>Salmond told the programme he \"had no idea what the seating arrangements were\" and that since Murray was the first Scot to win Wimbledon since 1896 \"a few saltires hoisted does no harm at all\".</p><p>He insisted the All England Club did not have any problem with his celebration, and \"didn't mind a little bit of Scottish exuberance\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412365865|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|3965bc96fdbf048d8d685d770d50c7c5fbc6a7b9 -->",

        "headline":"Wimbledon 2013: new generation threaten to shake up women's game",
        "body":"<p>The days when precocious teens dominated the upper reaches of women's tennis looked to be gone for good, given the increased fitness of the top players and the more physical nature of the sport – plus new rules to reduce the risk of burnout.</p><p>But a new generation is now threatening to make its mark at this year's Wimbledon, with Britain's Laura Robson and the hotly tipped American hope Madison Keys leading the way. Where there were just two teenagers inside the top 100 at last year's Wimbledon, now there are 11.</p><p>The youngest of all, the 16-year-old Croatian Donna Vekic, has already been compared by some to Maria Sharapova, who won her first Wimbledon title at the age of 17 and was the last teenager to win at the All England Club in 2004. Vekic turned heads by reaching the final at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham earlier this month, although she fared less well on Monday, losing to Petra Cetkovska from the Czech Republic.</p><p>From Monica Seles to Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova to Serena Williams, not forgetting Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger and Jennifer Capriati, youthful talents dominated women's tennis for decades – for many years you were nothing if you hadn't won a grand slam title by your 20th birthday.</p><p>Yet the flipside was a trail of stories of overbearing parents and coaches, psychological trauma and physical burnout.</p><p>For the past decade, the direction of travel has been in the opposite direction as the top 100 got steadily older. At 31, Serena Williams is the oldest No 1 player in the history of the game. But further down the ranks, there has been a clear shift.</p><p>\"I think we've had some reordering of the dominance in the past 12 to 18 months. The youth movement is coming,\" said Stacey Allaster, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief executive, of the changing of the guard.</p><p>Robson, now 19 and the highest ranked teenager on the WTA tour at 37, won a silver medal on Centre Court last year in the Olympics mixed doubles alongside Andy Murray and has claimed several big-name scalps in the past year.</p><p>But she has just changed coaches, linking up with Murray's former trainer Miles Maclagan on a temporary basis, and faces a tough draw in the shape of world No 10 Maria Kirilenko.</p><p>Keys, from Rock Island in Illinois, is already ranked 52 and is one of a crop of youngsters who the American public hope will assume the mantle of the Williams sisters. She plays British No 2 Heather Watson on Tuesday.</p><p>Robson's best friend, the 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, was among those to progress at Wimbledon on Monday.</p><p>And the most eye-catching victory was by a 19-year-old Puerto Rican, Mónica Puig, who defeated the Italian fifth seed Sara Errani in straight sets to provide the first shock of the fortnight on her senior Wimbledon debut.</p><p>The German Annika Beck, ranked 54, and the Spaniard Garbiñe Muguruza, ranked 59, are also highly rated.</p><p>Vekic has already reached two senior finals, most recently the Aegon Classic, and is ranked 64 in the world despite not turning 17 until Friday.</p><p>David Felgate, the coach who helped Tim Henman to four semi-finals at Wimbledon and has coached Vekic since she was 11, said: \"Her biggest attributes are her heart and her head. It's still harder than it was 10 years ago for the really young players to get to the top. But at the moment we've got a decent crop.\"</p><p>The last teens, male and female, to win a grand slam were Maria Sharapova and Rafael Nadal in 2006, who won the US Open and French Open respectively.</p><p>While there is little sign of anyone emerging in the men's game to change that statistic, in the women's game it is not impossible to imagine the old order being eventually challenged by the new.</p><p>Not that the likes of Serena Williams and Sharapova are likely to take the challenge lying down. Allaster said that while the number of teenagers had grown sharply in the past year, the number of players over 30 in the top 100 was also going up, showing the extent to which players were increasingly playing on beyond their 20s.</p><p>The WTA age restrictions, dubbed the \"Jennifer Capriati rules\", were put into place in the wake of problems the American notoriously faced after becoming a top 10 player at the age of just 14 in the early 90s, including an arrest for shoplifting.</p><p>Andrea Jaeger and Jelena Dokic were others who initially burned brightly but had to endure high-profile off-the-court issues in the glare of the public eye.</p><p>The restrictions limit the number of senior tournaments a young player can take part in and Felgate believes it is time they were reviewed.</p><p>\"It's a strange rule because the tour only allows so many tournaments but Donna could, if she wanted to, go and play a load more junior tournaments as well. I'd like to see the rule looked at so that if you get to a certain ranking, they could allow for a couple more tournaments,\" he said.</p><p>Restricting the number of tournaments can increase the pressure on young players because it ratchets up the pressure on them to perform, he said: \"All the intentions are in the right place, but it's worth looking at again.\"</p><p>It was widely assumed that rule changes introduced to protect younger players, combined with the way the game has changed and become more physically demanding, would mean it took longer than ever for young players to become established.</p><p>That has been the case in the men's game, where there is only one player under 20 in the top 100.</p><p>\"If people want to say good things then that's very nice,\" said Felgate of Vekic. \"None of it has changed what she has to improve and there are other very good young players out there, even younger than Donna, who haven't come to the fore yet.\"</p><p></p><h2>Teenagers in the WTA top 100</h2><p><strong>38 </strong>Laura Robson (GB), 19</p><p><strong>52 </strong>Madison Keys (US), 18</p><p><strong>54 </strong>Annika Beck (Germany), 19</p><p><strong>59 </strong>Garbiñe Muguruza (Spain), 19</p><p><strong>64 </strong>Donna Vekic (Croatia), 16</p><p><strong>65 </strong>Mónica Puig (Puerto Rico), 19</p><p><strong>66 </strong>Eugenie Bouchard (Canada), 19</p><p><strong>82 </strong>Elina Svitolina (Ukraine), 18</p><p><strong>85 </strong>Lauren Davis (US), 19</p><p><strong>90 </strong>Yulia Putintseva (Kazakhstan), 18</p><p><strong>100</strong> Caroline Garcia (France), 19</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411474284|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|e4666f5656959d63a449428d8abd4f46fbba2e27 -->",

The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs.</p><p></p><p>\"However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate.</p><p></p><p>\"Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.\"</p><p></p><p>Lloyd's brother, John, is a BBC tennis pundit and colleague of Castle's. The pair, both former No 1 British men's tennis players, are expected to feature in the corporation's coverage of Wimbledon, which started on Monday.</p><p></p><p>The BBC refused to say whether Castle personally paid damages to Lloyd or whether the bill was footed by licence fee payers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411460795|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|be8839544f4d1335f7b8f5dee265e58ed2793827 -->",

        "headline":"Judy Murray: lack of free courts is keeping tennis elitist",
        "body":"<p>Andy Murray's mother has called for tennis's governing body to introduce more \"free courts\" around the country to widen the game beyond its \"middle-class and elitist\" base.</p><p>On the eve of Wimbledon, Judy Murray, Britain's Fed Cup captain, said she was worried about a dearth of new talent after it emerged that several schemes to improve free-to-use public courts in deprived urban areas had failed to materialise.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tennisforfree.com/\" title=\"\">the charity Tennis For Free (TFF)</a> agreed a partnership last year \"to improve the places where people play tennis and the programmes on offer to encourage takeup of the game\".</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/03/lta-funding-sport-england-tennis\" title=\"\">following cuts to the LTA budget</a>, seven new schemes in areas including Tower Hamlets in east London and Glasgow have not gone ahead, although one has been established at Devonport Park, Plymouth.</p><p>Murray, who is a patron of the charity, said: \"TFF gets into areas you don't associate with the game. We, as a country, have got to be prepared to get our hands dirty. TFF is a small charity trying to put tennis where it has never been before and to have attractive, affordable public courts is crucial.\" Britain has never had stars with origins like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/jun/15/venus-serena-williams-film\" title=\"\">those of the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, </a>who started playing on the public courts of Compton, Los Angeles. The pair have since gone on to win 23 grand slam singles titles.</p><p>Speaking at the recent Edgbaston women's tournament, where she was coaching Britain's under-12s team, Murray said: \"Places like <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/sport/sports-development/tennis/tenniscourts/kelvingrove-park/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow</a>, where TFF already operates, are incredibly busy and successful. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/dec/08/judy-murray-fed-cup-team-captain\" title=\"\">When I was appointed Britain's Fed Cup captain</a> it made me realise our talent pool has been very small because so few girls play. I realise it is very difficult to turn around a derelict area into a tennis site, but we need to deliver more.\"</p><p>The TFF website says there are 2,594 free UK public tennis courts and 16 free park coaching programmes.</p><p>Baroness Billingham, president of Oxford LTA and a member of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/olympic-paralympic-legacy/\" title=\"\">House of Lords Olympic legacy committee</a>, said the partnership was a lost opportunity. \"It is a complete cop out by the LTA and absolutely wrong,\" she added. \"As far as the governing body is concerned, a few hundred thousand of new money is a drop in the ocean, as they get £60m a year in Wimbledon profits and public money.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.labourlords.org.uk/angela-billingham\" title=\"\">Billingham, a former Wimbledon player</a> who captains the parliamentary tennis team, said she was proud of a \"five-year campaign\" to remove LTA chief executive Roger Draper. \"I hope the new chief executive is at least someone who understands grassroots tennis and the LTA do have the opportunity to save hundreds of thousands on the salary,\" she said.</p><p>Murray said of her experience at TFF: \"What immediately struck me was how welcoming, sociable and fun it all was. Based on what I know of tennis in this country, that's not always the case. The game here is still very middle-class and elitist. I loved the fact that parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters were all joining in and helping. I left absolutely uplifted, thinking this is exactly what we need throughout the country.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/17/sport-england-funding-olympic-cycle\" title=\"\">Sport England revealed last year that it was withholding £10.3m of funding</a> because it believed the LTA's plans to expand participation were inadequate.</p><p>An LTA spokesman said: \"We work with a range of partners across the public and commercial sector to deliver free and affordable tennis, and we recognise the valuable work that Tennis For Free do in making tennis more accessible.\"</p><p>The LTA is spending \"a few thousand\" in refurbishment work at courts at centres such as Brodie Park, Glasgow, and Christchurch Park, Ipswich. However, TFF trustee Patrick Hollwey said: \"We are not being given a grant by the LTA. In fact, we still have to pay for coaches and equipment ourselves.\"</p><p>The charity has lost patience with the LTA and wants to raise £750,000 from private sources to try to launch 50 venues over the next three years.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411362301|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|c94fa7d69fab309fa8f934470fffceb155066087 -->",

        "headline":"Wimbledon to mark 40 years since Billie Jean King sexism victory",
        "body":"<p>Equal opportunity laws in the US were still two years away [see footnote] when Billie Jean King barricaded 63 of her colleagues in a room at the Gloucester Hotel in London and emerged triumphantly waving legal papers that led to the formation of the Women's Tennis Association 40 years ago.</p><p>The WTA has announced plans for more than 20 of the 23 women who have since been ranked number one to gather at a glitzy event on the middle weekend of Wimbledon, which begins on Monday, to commemorate what became not only a seminal sporting moment but a key staging post in the battle for equality.</p><p>\"What started as a few women and a dollar has grown to thousands, living the dream – our dream. We were athletes who wanted to compete – and along the way we made history, determined to win, not just for ourselves, but for women everywhere,\" says King in a WTA campaign to mark the milestone.</p><p>Against a febrile backdrop in the summer of 1973 King, who won the fifth of her six Wimbledon singles titles that year, called a meeting of her fellow players amid widespread and intense frustration at sexism and inequality in the sport.</p><p>Particularly angered by a tournament in Los Angeles where the women's champion earned a sixth of the prize money of the men, King became in 1970 one of a group of players – The Original Nine – who each signed nominal $1 contracts with World Tennis publisher Gladys Heldman to compete in a newly created Virginia Slims Series.</p><p>Three years later in London she got everyone in the room, told fellow player Betty Stove to lock the door and emerged clutching legal documents that were drawn up by Larry King, the tennis player's then husband.</p><p>\"If we hadn't had Billie, our sport wouldn't be where it is today. She was the catalyst, the dreamer, the person who said 'we will do this and we will be successful'. She is as active today in the WTA as she was in 1973,\" said Stacey Allaster, the WTA chief executive, recalling how the pioneering players of the 1970s would have to drum up publicity for their own tournaments in small towns across America.</p><p>Later in 1973, King would beat Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match in the US dubbed \"the battle of the sexes\".</p><p>King, the daughter of a firefighter from Long Beach, made her Grand Slam debut aged 15 in 1959 and two years later neighbours raised $2,000 so she could play at Wimbledon. There she won the women's doubles at her first attempt, the first of 39 Grand Slam titles that included 12 singles triumphs. She retired from competitive singles in 1983 having seen the sport transformed.</p><p>Amid a passionate debate about the amount of coverage and profile afforded women's sport, most recently reanimated here following London 2012, tennis is one of only a handful of sports in which women can genuinely claim equality of opportunity and potential financial reward.</p><p>Prior to the formation of the WTA in 1973, the annual prize money available to professional female tennis players was around $2m. Today it is $118m (£75m) across the WTA's 54 tournaments in 33 countries and the four Grand Slams.</p><p>Those original nine players will be present alongside most of the number ones of the past 40 years, from King to Serena Williams.</p><p>\"I was lucky enough to meet the original nine last year in Charleston. It's thanks to Billie Jean King that we have everything in professional sport that we have today. It's amazing,\" said Martina Hingis, who has won five Grand Slams and will also be present.</p><p>\"It was only the second or third time that they had all got together. Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were there too. All these great tennis players, who did so much for the game, in one place.\"</p><p>Hingis, now a coach, said King was a \"real leader\", a \"trooper\".</p><p>Allaster said that without King and her colleagues, the riches and opportunities on offer today would not exist. \"They set the course. Today's players know the debt they owe Billie and the original nine and all the generations that have come before them to make tennis the number one sport in the world for women,\" she said.</p><p>\"Part of my job is to educate them. Every player's meeting we start with a photo of the original nine or a picture of Billie. I don't want anyone to ever forget their courage.\"</p><p>But although there is now equality of prize money at the four Grand Slams, which took until 2007 at Wimbledon, there are other tournaments where there is still a big gap, said Hingis.</p><p>\"It's 2013. But the men still generally make a lot more. At least there's equality at the Grand Slams but at all the other tournaments, there's still a gap.\"</p><p>King passed the baton of WTA president to Evert, whose rivalry with Navratilova took women's tennis to new heights.</p><p>Evert said the women's game \"started as a small intimate family and evolved into a big business\".</p><p>\"It started with one sponsor in Virginia Slims and turned into hundreds of sponsors vying for a position in sponsorships,\" she said. \"The prize money, exposure, the fan base, sponsorships, media and even the level of tennis greatly improved. Also the tour became more international.\"</p><p>The women's game has come under fire in recent years for, variously, not producing enough characters and dominant players to rival a golden period for the men's game or, conversely, becoming too predictable and dull.</p><p>Allaster argues that the balance is now about right, with a host of young players from around the world coming through to challenge the leading players including Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka and Agnieszka Radwanska.</p><p>\"We've got 11 teenagers in the top 100. We've got 12 players who are more than 30. We've got this nice mix of the current generation, the future stars and some dominance and rivalry at the top. When Serena and Venus were winning everything, people wanted more depth,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then we had the depth and people wanted the personalities and the rivalries. Now I feel we have both. To have Serena as the world number one, probably playing the best tennis of her life, is great.\"</p><p>She said the emerging markets in China, India and the Middle East offered huge opportunities for the sport, in terms of new talent and potential commercial return, but growth had to be carefully managed.</p><p>Radwanska, the Pole who reached the Wimbledon final last year, said the women's tour was getting \"better and better every year\".</p><p>\"We can see that a lot of things have changed in the last 10 or 20 years. I think it's great. I think we can really see that the women's game is bigger than before. We can see more matches on TV and people are more interested in women's tennis,\" she said.</p><p>Allaster said that while the sport had hugely evolved since the events of 1973, today's players still felt a kinship when it came to the big issues and insisted the future of the sport was secure. \"They are individual athletes but when the time comes for them to get together on an issue, they are committed to each other,\" she said.</p><p>\"I truly believe we have the best female athletes in the world. I'm blessed with the most marketable assets in the world. They're smart, they're super strong and they're fun. They engage well with their fans and that's a fantastic base for us to build on.\"</p><p>For Evert, King's hotel room revolution blew open the doors for those who followed, enabling a professional tennis career that provided \"the opportunity for a woman to compete at the highest level, to be proud of her physical and mental strength and to take advantage of the opportunity to be a positive role model\".</p><p>• This footnote was appended on 24 June 2013: A number of state and federal laws relating to equal opportunities were passed before 1975 in the USA; the particular equal opportunity law that was two years away when the WTA was formed was Article IX, which requires gender equity in educational programmes that receive federal funding; while Article IX itself was enacted in 1972, its implementing regulations - which covered, among other things, school and college athletics - were not signed into law until 1975.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411185264|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|31bce947265704eb018bd4d9acd1aa268982fe1c -->",
