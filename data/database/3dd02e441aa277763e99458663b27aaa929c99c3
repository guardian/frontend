They occur every time Rory and I are apart a few days or do not write on Twitter,\" she told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet.</p><p>\"There is nothing in it, and from now on I just think that I will keep my private life private.</p><p>\"It is so annoying that the media and the so-called sources constantly spread the rumours.

I fell into a couple of bad habits and I was trying to work myself out of it. It affects mental issues as well.</p><p>\"Golf is a game of confidence and if you are confident it allows you to play better and freer ... with a free mind. Definitely nothing to do with equipment.\"</p><p>McIlroy said there was plenty of golf left in the year and ample opportunities for him to get that first win.</p><p>\"I learned a lot this year,\" he added. \"I was undergolfed for the first three to four months. It's the first year I struggled and I didn't live up to the expectation.</p><p>\"This year is a little bit of a disappointment, But I have six tournaments left and will finish the season strongly.\"</p><p>In another off-course distraction, McIlroy recently terminated his contract with Horizon Sports Management and set up his own company to run his business interests.</p><p>That messy break-up<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/rory-mcilroy-horizon-dublin-court\" title=\"\"> reached a Dublin court</a> on Monday with McIlroy unhappy with the commission the Dublin firm was charging for its services.</p><p>Horizon has said it was disappointed McIlroy had ended a contract that had a number of years left to run.</p><p>\"Since October 2011 Horizon has achieved exceptional results for Rory in realising his commercial objectives,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>\"Under Horizon's management Rory has signed some of the most lucrative endorsements in sports history.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419982277|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|5e88e8d93f13823c2d01207d642682d7e46a975f -->",

        "headline":"Why Rory McIlroy cannot wait for 2013 to finish",
        "body":"<p>The only thing missing from Rory McIlroy's traumatic 2013 is a relationship break-up. That news, it seems, is edging ever closer amid reports in Ireland last weekend that the golfer has finally split from his girlfriend, the Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.</p><p>When thrown into a year which has seen McIlroy involved in legal cases worth tens of millions of pounds, slide from No1 to No6 in the world on account of missed cuts and absent form, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/02/rory-mcilroy-honda-classic-walked-out\" title=\"\">plus the public-relations disaster of a mid-tournament walk off</a>, that is quite a package. Should the Northern Irishman ever decide to write an autobiography, there will be little doubt over the key chapter.</p><p>\"Wozilroy\" has been one of the most famous and high-profile partnerships in global sport. But, from the outside, it has not been a scenario best suited to the pair's careers. When whispers first circulated about an imminent parting of the ways, almost two months ago, McIlroy was said to be as concerned by Wozniacki's tumble down the world rankings as his own on-course problems.</p><p>At the Open Championship in July, McIlroy had claimed to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/23362904\" title=\"\">\"brain dead\"</a> on course. It was an alarming statement. Since then, there have been only glimpses that he will recover some of his brilliance this year rather than regard it as a total write-off.</p><p>McIlroy has spent much of his recent time either in Belfast with childhood friends, as was the case when he took in Ulster's Heineken Cup match with Leicester on Friday night, or Dublin, where he was by Saturday. The inclination to follow the WTA Tour at any given opportunity has long since passed, it would seem.</p><p>McIlroy is nothing if not single-minded. He is not averse to change. In fact he makes a habit of it, as demonstrated by his move from International Sports Management to the Horizon group in late 2011. Now, Horizon itself has been ditched.</p><p>There has been a distinct cooling of the relationship, too, with his close friend Graeme McDowell. When McDowell married in the Bahamas last month, McIlroy was a notable absentee.</p><p>Today, Horizon and McIlroy will be represented in a Dublin courtroom as that alliance continues its own messy break-up. As with the McDowell alliance, it is sad that something which worked so well has come to this. The newly-formed Rory McIlroy Incorporated claims it has terminated the golfer's contract with Horizon under which McIlroy agreed his much-publicised £78m equipment deal with Nike. McIlroy's commercial appeal is further demonstrated by sponsorship agreements with Omega and Bose.</p><p>McIlroy believes he has a right to end that Horizon spell because it has taken too high a percentage of his sponsorship agreements.<strong> </strong>If no settlement can be reached, Horizon is set to counter-sue McIlroy for ending a five-year contract with more than half of it to run; that turn of events, needless to say, would lead to more of the golfer's financial affairs being made public than he would prefer.</p><p>Not that money should be of concern to McIlroy. He is already way beyond that stage, regardless of the Horizon outcome. In flying to the Far East this week, he begins a spell which will net him more than US$3m (£1.9m) simply for turning up at the Korea Open, the BMW Masters and for an exhibition meeting with Tiger Woods.</p><p>The WGC Championship follows that, with McIlroy still to ensure he earns a place in the European Tour's Race to Dubai final in mid-November. At that event a year ago, McIlroy confirmed his status as then the best player in the world with Wozniacki on hand to tease him at a post-round press conference.</p><p>Despite his claims to the contrary, it is difficult to imagine more going wrong during the intervening months as has already been the case.</p><p>Yet McIlroy remains a decent, engaging character despite those who have sought to demonise his personality simply because he has endured a torrid professional spell. In one particularly fierce article, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/sports/golf/mcilroy-a-native-son-divides-ireland.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">published in the United States</a>, McIlroy was portrayed in what is actually a wholly unfair manner for anybody who knows him.</p><p>It should be remembered that the root cause for McIlroy's 2013 problems has been struggles on the golf course, not a switch into an alter ego. That must also be placed against both an exceptional 2012 and McIlroy's relative youth. Throughout his career, even as an amateur, McIlroy has never been super-consistent.</p><p>In that playing sense, McIlroy's superb driving deserted him in the first part of this year. His putting, which had improved dramatically last season, has also regressed. In a technical sense, McIlroy's swing has a tendency to move off plane – or line – which triggers poor shots in both directions and therefore blunts his confidence. Not only will McIlroy know all that, he will be determined to have it fixed by the time a new year arrives.</p><p>The logical assumption is that such work is tougher when there is too much noise in the background.</p><p>If there are consolations for McIlroy as he settles in Seoul today; at least for now he is thousands of miles away from distraction, and it would seem impossible to have another year quite like this one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419907840|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|5f9c76b90ffb813b4fc5abea270588d6fa6dcad3 -->",

He then overcame a 0-40 deficit in game seven by winning five straight points and went on to close out the set by holding to love.</p><p>Del Potro saved two match points at 5-4 in the decider to force the tie-break, but world No2 Djokovic held his nerve and clinched his 12th consecutive match win with a backhand winner down the line.</p><p>Del Potro, who booked his place at next month's ATP World Tour Finals in London by beating Nadal in the semi-final on Saturday, was disappointed to see his eight-match winning streak come to an end but found kind words for his opponent.</p><p>\"The match was really close and I think Nole (Djokovic) played some unbelievable points in the tie-break,\" he told atpworldtour.com. \"The match was so exciting. At Wimbledon we played another fantastic match against each other. It's a really bad loss for me now. I was really close to beating him after beating Nadal.\"</p><p>Djokovic was equally gracious in victory after securing his 15th Masters 1000 title. \"I have to start by congratulating Del Potro and his team for the fantastic week,\" the 26-year-old said on court after receiving the trophy. \"You're a great person and even a better player, I'm sorry that you lost today. You deserve this trophy equally.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419831091|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|c4101115fb5b7b3fb1e30ca0e5273d785e5e9fb3 -->",

Two forehands into the net give Djokovic two match points, the first of which goes to waste as he wafts a backhand long off a second serve. A serve-forehand combo from Del Potro saves the second and - look at this - there are men in Argentina football shirts running about in the stands celebrating. Djokovic then sends a forehand return long and after an insane rally, he knocks a backhand past the baseline.

He then complains to the umpire about pesky fans talking during the point. Djokovic will like seeing that. But he then misses an attempt at a forehand winner, as confirmed by Hawkeye. 15-all. Djokovic, though, is on the attack. He plays an approach shot, moves forward and puts the volley away for 15-30 and Del Potro then nets a forehand to make it 15-40. Djokovic can't take the first break point, though, stretching and netting a forehand and Del Potro then saves the second with a mind-boggling inside-out forehand down the line. Dearie me. He follows that up with an ace. He then wins an astonishing rally as a lob from Djokovic lands long, which almost compels Del Potro to go on a lap of honour around the court.

He keeps losing his balance and then he loses his racket trying to reach a lob from Del Potro. Deuce. That's all the encouragement Del Potro needs. He stays in the rally, bides his time and then goes through the gears, ratcheting up the power with his forehands to earn a break point. But Djokovic saves it with an ace out wide. &quot;Wow. Expect the unexpected,&quot; says Sky's Mark Petchey. Not entirely sure why. Djokovic then bellows at his box as Del Potro wallops a backhand long to give him the hold.

There haven't been many of those. But he doesn't hang on to a 30-0 lead for too long. A slice into the net from Del Potro, forced into conservatism by Djokovic's hunger and eagerness to romp forward, offers up a set point, which is saved with a trademark forehand. Del Potro then saves another set point, enjoying a slice of luck as a Djokovic backhand hits the tape and sits up nicely for the big forehand. And from there, Del Potro holds. He's on the board.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a627de4b0d2382acc064c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T10:08:21.677+01:00\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>First set: Djokovic* 5-0 Del Potro (* denotes server): </strong>This first set has run away from Del Potro. It's blink-and-you'll-miss-it tennis from Djokovic. He's just so fast. In this sort of form, few players can live with him.

Here follows the bleedin' obvious: Del Potro really cannot afford to lose this game. He really can't afford, for instance, to crunch a forehand into the net at 15-all. Djokovic makes Del Potro, who doesn't like to run around, run around and the Argentinian eventually cracks, his forehand flying long to make it 15-40. A backhand from Djokovic lands plum on the baseline and throws Del Potro off-balance, causing his forehand to drop into the net.

So what else to do than fight fire with a nuke? Djokovic sends a serve out wide on the first point and Del Potro reaches out that gigantic right arm to wrap his racket round a brilliant forehand return. 0-15. Del Potro is going to go away that easily and two Djokovic errors make it 15-40. An immediate chance to break back. The first break point is saved in emphatic style, though, a booming forehand, and so's the second with a preposterous backhand down the line. From there, Djokovic holds. A sloppy start to the game but a steely end to it.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a5e03e4b036d35b97e3ab\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T09:55:19.865+01:00\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>First set: Djokovic 2-0 Del Potro* (* denotes server): </strong>More please! The two trade venomous groundstrokes from the back of the court, before Djokovic injects some subtlety with a glorious, spinning drop-shot. But Del Potro reaches it, bends a forehand down the line and ... inches long. Hawkeye confirms it. Perhaps winded by all that running, Del Potro then throws in a double-fault to go down 0-30. He's let off the hook, though, Djokovic wonking a horrible forehand off in the general direction of the East China Sea, before making it 30-all. But Djokovic soon has a break point as Del Potro slaps a feeble backhand into the net. He misses a first serve. He makes a second serve. And Djokovic, slipping and sliding, sends a forehand wide. Deuce. They stay there for a while before Del Potro, with a whiff of predictability, blooters a forehand past the baseline after a mammoth rally. A second break point, then; another missed first serve. And this time Djokovic finds the line - by mere inches - with a pinpoint forehand from left to right. There's the early break.

Yes, whatever way you want to put it, Novak Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro spent a helluva long time on court in their staggering Wimbledon semi-final and here they are again in the final of the Shanghai Masters. It's not quite the same occasion and it won't last as long, you can be sure of that, but this should be good because they are good - you can be sure of that, too. Both men have recent wins over Rafael Nadal under their belt, Djokovic in the China Open last Sunday and Del Potro in the semi-final of this tournament yesterday. Djokovic is obviously the favourite though - he beat Del Potro at Wimbledon and beat the absent Andy Murray in the final of this tournamenbt last year.</p> <p><strong>Play begins:</strong> soon.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T09:33:43.522+01:00\">at 9.33am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419823672|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|920efe9244a2bd2c173b08ec992bd602fa3ba5c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Roger Federer has split with his coach Paul Annacone two days after he was dumped out of the Shanghai Masters.</p><p>The Swiss former world No1 and seven times Wimbledon champion said: \"After a terrific three and a half years working together, Paul and I have decided to move on to the next chapter in our professional lives.\"</p><p>The world No7 lost 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 to France's Gaël Monfils in Shanghai and has won only one trophy this season – on the grass of Halle, right before Wimbledon.</p><p>He insists he is not shocked about how his year has gone. \"I always knew that this year, after a very tough year in 2012, the Olympics, was going to be a bit of a quiet year. I expected myself probably not to be as successful and as busy playing matches and tournaments,\" he said after Shanghai.</p><p>Federer, the winner of a record 17 grand slams, is battling to qualify for next month's end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals for the 12th consecutive year.</p><p>He teamed up with Annacone, the former long-time coach to multiple grand slam winner Pete Sampras, in August 2010.</p><p>\"When we started together we had a vision of a three-year plan to win another grand slam title and get back to the No1 ranking. Along with many other goals and great memories, these two main goals were achieved,\" Federer said.</p><p>\"After numerous conversations culminating at the end of our most recent training block, we felt like this was the best time and path for both of us. Paul remains a dear friend, and we both look forward to continuing our friendship. I want to thank Paul for his help and the value he has added to me and my team.\"</p><p>Federer, who won his last grand slam title at Wimbledon in 2012 before claiming a silver medal at the London Olympics, lost in the Australian Open semi-finals to Andy Murray, fell at the last-eight stage to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the French Open and suffered a second-round defeat at Wimbledon to Sergiy Stakhovsky before losing to Tommy Robredo in the US Open fourth round. He last held the No1 ranking in October 2012 having taken it from Novak Djokovic that July.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419804305|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|fe794858c2106c838a74a5cb7179fdf95fb67479 -->",

Nadal, Djokovic and David Ferrer are the other confirmed participants.</p><p>Djokovic, meanwhile, could add another Chinese title to his name after another slick display of returning in Shanghai heaped too much pressure on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who unravelled with 35 unforced errors to lose 6-2 7-5.</p><p>The world No 2 and Australian Open champion was quick out of the blocks, racing into a 3-0 lead after breaking Tsonga to love in his opening service game.</p><p>The Frenchman looked like dropping another service game, but some heavy hitting helped him get on the board before a sumptuous backhand cross-court resulted in him breaking Djokovic in the next.</p><p>That was as good as it got for Tsonga, who is in a close race with Roger Federer, Stanislas Wawrinka, Richard Gasquet and Milos Raonic for one of the last remaining places at the ATP Tour Finals.</p><p>Djokovic claimed the next three games to wrap up the set as Tsonga's first serve percentage fell to 46, coupled with 14 unforced errors, in comparison to just four by the Serb.</p><p>A change of shirt and a renewed focus helped Tsonga stay on terms at the start of the second set before another misplaced volley handed Djokovic a break and a 4-2 lead.</p><p>The Frenchman broke back immediately as Djokovic returned to his chair to scream at the umpire after a couple of late calls by a line judge. But the Serb regained his composure and the set looked to be heading for a tie break with Tsonga serving at 5-6 before Djokovic raised his game once more.</p><p>Tsonga saved one match point with a booming forehand before wasting the chance to force a tie-break and Djokovic made him pay as he sealed victory at the second attempt with a powerful winner down the line.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419802454|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|95dc286c43909c9a37a5ea50f4921834a43ce527 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andy Murray has said the Wimbledon final on centre court was one of the toughest matches of his career but \"the best day of my life so far\".</p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Murray said his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-win-djokovic\" title=\"\">historic victory on Sunday</a> had finally sunk in, but admitted that he \"embraced\" rather than enjoyed crunch matches.</p><p>The tennis star, who on Sunday beat the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets to become the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said that around 45 minutes after he had won, he suddenly became \"so so tired\".</p><p>\"Yesterday was a long day, but the best day of my life so far.\"</p><p>Asked if he enjoyed playing the biggest matches of his career, Murray said: \"I'd say embrace rather than enjoy. It's tough to explain [...] if I had lost I wouldn't have enjoyed it, but I won.\"</p><p>He said the match against Djokovic \"was one of the most challenging matches I've played in my career&nbsp;… an unbelievable physical and mental challenge, so I don't know about enjoying it but you have to embrace that situation.\"</p><p>The Scot said he had raised his game and come back strong after losing against Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final last year. \"It was the hardest loss of my career. I was very emotional afterwards, but I just responded really well to it.\"</p><p>He said the pressure on him as Britain's No 1 was huge, which could make playing Wimbledon \"hard and stressful\", and added: \"We're programmed to hit tennis balls. That's the easy part.\"</p><p>\"One thing I can say is that I have always enjoyed the training aspect [...] working hard and trying to get better, but dealing with the pressure has been hard at times.\"</p><p>Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, denied \"photo-bombing\" David Cameron at the match when he raised a large Scottish flag behind the prime minister immediately after Murray's win.</p><p>Salmond told the programme he \"had no idea what the seating arrangements were\" and that since Murray was the first Scot to win Wimbledon since 1896 \"a few saltires hoisted does no harm at all\".</p><p>He insisted the All England Club did not have any problem with his celebration, and \"didn't mind a little bit of Scottish exuberance\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412365865|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|692bee410edf443506c81451dd09f33cba679f21 -->",

        "headline":"Wimbledon 2013: new generation threaten to shake up women's game",
        "body":"<p>The days when precocious teens dominated the upper reaches of women's tennis looked to be gone for good, given the increased fitness of the top players and the more physical nature of the sport – plus new rules to reduce the risk of burnout.</p><p>But a new generation is now threatening to make its mark at this year's Wimbledon, with Britain's Laura Robson and the hotly tipped American hope Madison Keys leading the way. Where there were just two teenagers inside the top 100 at last year's Wimbledon, now there are 11.</p><p>The youngest of all, the 16-year-old Croatian Donna Vekic, has already been compared by some to Maria Sharapova, who won her first Wimbledon title at the age of 17 and was the last teenager to win at the All England Club in 2004. Vekic turned heads by reaching the final at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham earlier this month, although she fared less well on Monday, losing to Petra Cetkovska from the Czech Republic.</p><p>From Monica Seles to Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova to Serena Williams, not forgetting Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger and Jennifer Capriati, youthful talents dominated women's tennis for decades – for many years you were nothing if you hadn't won a grand slam title by your 20th birthday.</p><p>Yet the flipside was a trail of stories of overbearing parents and coaches, psychological trauma and physical burnout.</p><p>For the past decade, the direction of travel has been in the opposite direction as the top 100 got steadily older. At 31, Serena Williams is the oldest No 1 player in the history of the game. But further down the ranks, there has been a clear shift.</p><p>\"I think we've had some reordering of the dominance in the past 12 to 18 months. The youth movement is coming,\" said Stacey Allaster, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief executive, of the changing of the guard.</p><p>Robson, now 19 and the highest ranked teenager on the WTA tour at 37, won a silver medal on Centre Court last year in the Olympics mixed doubles alongside Andy Murray and has claimed several big-name scalps in the past year.</p><p>But she has just changed coaches, linking up with Murray's former trainer Miles Maclagan on a temporary basis, and faces a tough draw in the shape of world No 10 Maria Kirilenko.</p><p>Keys, from Rock Island in Illinois, is already ranked 52 and is one of a crop of youngsters who the American public hope will assume the mantle of the Williams sisters. She plays British No 2 Heather Watson on Tuesday.</p><p>Robson's best friend, the 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, was among those to progress at Wimbledon on Monday.</p><p>And the most eye-catching victory was by a 19-year-old Puerto Rican, Mónica Puig, who defeated the Italian fifth seed Sara Errani in straight sets to provide the first shock of the fortnight on her senior Wimbledon debut.</p><p>The German Annika Beck, ranked 54, and the Spaniard Garbiñe Muguruza, ranked 59, are also highly rated.</p><p>Vekic has already reached two senior finals, most recently the Aegon Classic, and is ranked 64 in the world despite not turning 17 until Friday.</p><p>David Felgate, the coach who helped Tim Henman to four semi-finals at Wimbledon and has coached Vekic since she was 11, said: \"Her biggest attributes are her heart and her head. It's still harder than it was 10 years ago for the really young players to get to the top. But at the moment we've got a decent crop.\"</p><p>The last teens, male and female, to win a grand slam were Maria Sharapova and Rafael Nadal in 2006, who won the US Open and French Open respectively.</p><p>While there is little sign of anyone emerging in the men's game to change that statistic, in the women's game it is not impossible to imagine the old order being eventually challenged by the new.</p><p>Not that the likes of Serena Williams and Sharapova are likely to take the challenge lying down. Allaster said that while the number of teenagers had grown sharply in the past year, the number of players over 30 in the top 100 was also going up, showing the extent to which players were increasingly playing on beyond their 20s.</p><p>The WTA age restrictions, dubbed the \"Jennifer Capriati rules\", were put into place in the wake of problems the American notoriously faced after becoming a top 10 player at the age of just 14 in the early 90s, including an arrest for shoplifting.</p><p>Andrea Jaeger and Jelena Dokic were others who initially burned brightly but had to endure high-profile off-the-court issues in the glare of the public eye.</p><p>The restrictions limit the number of senior tournaments a young player can take part in and Felgate believes it is time they were reviewed.</p><p>\"It's a strange rule because the tour only allows so many tournaments but Donna could, if she wanted to, go and play a load more junior tournaments as well. I'd like to see the rule looked at so that if you get to a certain ranking, they could allow for a couple more tournaments,\" he said.</p><p>Restricting the number of tournaments can increase the pressure on young players because it ratchets up the pressure on them to perform, he said: \"All the intentions are in the right place, but it's worth looking at again.\"</p><p>It was widely assumed that rule changes introduced to protect younger players, combined with the way the game has changed and become more physically demanding, would mean it took longer than ever for young players to become established.</p><p>That has been the case in the men's game, where there is only one player under 20 in the top 100.</p><p>\"If people want to say good things then that's very nice,\" said Felgate of Vekic. \"None of it has changed what she has to improve and there are other very good young players out there, even younger than Donna, who haven't come to the fore yet.\"</p><p></p><h2>Teenagers in the WTA top 100</h2><p><strong>38 </strong>Laura Robson (GB), 19</p><p><strong>52 </strong>Madison Keys (US), 18</p><p><strong>54 </strong>Annika Beck (Germany), 19</p><p><strong>59 </strong>Garbiñe Muguruza (Spain), 19</p><p><strong>64 </strong>Donna Vekic (Croatia), 16</p><p><strong>65 </strong>Mónica Puig (Puerto Rico), 19</p><p><strong>66 </strong>Eugenie Bouchard (Canada), 19</p><p><strong>82 </strong>Elina Svitolina (Ukraine), 18</p><p><strong>85 </strong>Lauren Davis (US), 19</p><p><strong>90 </strong>Yulia Putintseva (Kazakhstan), 18</p><p><strong>100</strong> Caroline Garcia (France), 19</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411474284|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|2d085eabaed3b9cbc58891f3f3be5c9f03589e99 -->",

The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs.</p><p></p><p>\"However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate.</p><p></p><p>\"Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.\"</p><p></p><p>Lloyd's brother, John, is a BBC tennis pundit and colleague of Castle's. The pair, both former No 1 British men's tennis players, are expected to feature in the corporation's coverage of Wimbledon, which started on Monday.</p><p></p><p>The BBC refused to say whether Castle personally paid damages to Lloyd or whether the bill was footed by licence fee payers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411460795|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|b78670750ea6426de07da3838beffbd87505be28 -->",

        "headline":"Judy Murray: lack of free courts is keeping tennis elitist",
        "body":"<p>Andy Murray's mother has called for tennis's governing body to introduce more \"free courts\" around the country to widen the game beyond its \"middle-class and elitist\" base.</p><p>On the eve of Wimbledon, Judy Murray, Britain's Fed Cup captain, said she was worried about a dearth of new talent after it emerged that several schemes to improve free-to-use public courts in deprived urban areas had failed to materialise.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tennisforfree.com/\" title=\"\">the charity Tennis For Free (TFF)</a> agreed a partnership last year \"to improve the places where people play tennis and the programmes on offer to encourage takeup of the game\".</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/03/lta-funding-sport-england-tennis\" title=\"\">following cuts to the LTA budget</a>, seven new schemes in areas including Tower Hamlets in east London and Glasgow have not gone ahead, although one has been established at Devonport Park, Plymouth.</p><p>Murray, who is a patron of the charity, said: \"TFF gets into areas you don't associate with the game. We, as a country, have got to be prepared to get our hands dirty. TFF is a small charity trying to put tennis where it has never been before and to have attractive, affordable public courts is crucial.\" Britain has never had stars with origins like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/jun/15/venus-serena-williams-film\" title=\"\">those of the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, </a>who started playing on the public courts of Compton, Los Angeles. The pair have since gone on to win 23 grand slam singles titles.</p><p>Speaking at the recent Edgbaston women's tournament, where she was coaching Britain's under-12s team, Murray said: \"Places like <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/sport/sports-development/tennis/tenniscourts/kelvingrove-park/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow</a>, where TFF already operates, are incredibly busy and successful. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/dec/08/judy-murray-fed-cup-team-captain\" title=\"\">When I was appointed Britain's Fed Cup captain</a> it made me realise our talent pool has been very small because so few girls play. I realise it is very difficult to turn around a derelict area into a tennis site, but we need to deliver more.\"</p><p>The TFF website says there are 2,594 free UK public tennis courts and 16 free park coaching programmes.</p><p>Baroness Billingham, president of Oxford LTA and a member of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/olympic-paralympic-legacy/\" title=\"\">House of Lords Olympic legacy committee</a>, said the partnership was a lost opportunity. \"It is a complete cop out by the LTA and absolutely wrong,\" she added. \"As far as the governing body is concerned, a few hundred thousand of new money is a drop in the ocean, as they get £60m a year in Wimbledon profits and public money.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.labourlords.org.uk/angela-billingham\" title=\"\">Billingham, a former Wimbledon player</a> who captains the parliamentary tennis team, said she was proud of a \"five-year campaign\" to remove LTA chief executive Roger Draper. \"I hope the new chief executive is at least someone who understands grassroots tennis and the LTA do have the opportunity to save hundreds of thousands on the salary,\" she said.</p><p>Murray said of her experience at TFF: \"What immediately struck me was how welcoming, sociable and fun it all was. Based on what I know of tennis in this country, that's not always the case. The game here is still very middle-class and elitist. I loved the fact that parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters were all joining in and helping. I left absolutely uplifted, thinking this is exactly what we need throughout the country.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/17/sport-england-funding-olympic-cycle\" title=\"\">Sport England revealed last year that it was withholding £10.3m of funding</a> because it believed the LTA's plans to expand participation were inadequate.</p><p>An LTA spokesman said: \"We work with a range of partners across the public and commercial sector to deliver free and affordable tennis, and we recognise the valuable work that Tennis For Free do in making tennis more accessible.\"</p><p>The LTA is spending \"a few thousand\" in refurbishment work at courts at centres such as Brodie Park, Glasgow, and Christchurch Park, Ipswich. However, TFF trustee Patrick Hollwey said: \"We are not being given a grant by the LTA. In fact, we still have to pay for coaches and equipment ourselves.\"</p><p>The charity has lost patience with the LTA and wants to raise £750,000 from private sources to try to launch 50 venues over the next three years.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411362301|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|e6d3c0d51e4d854f577b3eb15c0e7d7dae6ac8ed -->",

        "headline":"Wimbledon to mark 40 years since Billie Jean King sexism victory",
        "body":"<p>Equal opportunity laws in the US were still two years away [see footnote] when Billie Jean King barricaded 63 of her colleagues in a room at the Gloucester Hotel in London and emerged triumphantly waving legal papers that led to the formation of the Women's Tennis Association 40 years ago.</p><p>The WTA has announced plans for more than 20 of the 23 women who have since been ranked number one to gather at a glitzy event on the middle weekend of Wimbledon, which begins on Monday, to commemorate what became not only a seminal sporting moment but a key staging post in the battle for equality.</p><p>\"What started as a few women and a dollar has grown to thousands, living the dream – our dream. We were athletes who wanted to compete – and along the way we made history, determined to win, not just for ourselves, but for women everywhere,\" says King in a WTA campaign to mark the milestone.</p><p>Against a febrile backdrop in the summer of 1973 King, who won the fifth of her six Wimbledon singles titles that year, called a meeting of her fellow players amid widespread and intense frustration at sexism and inequality in the sport.</p><p>Particularly angered by a tournament in Los Angeles where the women's champion earned a sixth of the prize money of the men, King became in 1970 one of a group of players – The Original Nine – who each signed nominal $1 contracts with World Tennis publisher Gladys Heldman to compete in a newly created Virginia Slims Series.</p><p>Three years later in London she got everyone in the room, told fellow player Betty Stove to lock the door and emerged clutching legal documents that were drawn up by Larry King, the tennis player's then husband.</p><p>\"If we hadn't had Billie, our sport wouldn't be where it is today. She was the catalyst, the dreamer, the person who said 'we will do this and we will be successful'. She is as active today in the WTA as she was in 1973,\" said Stacey Allaster, the WTA chief executive, recalling how the pioneering players of the 1970s would have to drum up publicity for their own tournaments in small towns across America.</p><p>Later in 1973, King would beat Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match in the US dubbed \"the battle of the sexes\".</p><p>King, the daughter of a firefighter from Long Beach, made her Grand Slam debut aged 15 in 1959 and two years later neighbours raised $2,000 so she could play at Wimbledon. There she won the women's doubles at her first attempt, the first of 39 Grand Slam titles that included 12 singles triumphs. She retired from competitive singles in 1983 having seen the sport transformed.</p><p>Amid a passionate debate about the amount of coverage and profile afforded women's sport, most recently reanimated here following London 2012, tennis is one of only a handful of sports in which women can genuinely claim equality of opportunity and potential financial reward.</p><p>Prior to the formation of the WTA in 1973, the annual prize money available to professional female tennis players was around $2m. Today it is $118m (£75m) across the WTA's 54 tournaments in 33 countries and the four Grand Slams.</p><p>Those original nine players will be present alongside most of the number ones of the past 40 years, from King to Serena Williams.</p><p>\"I was lucky enough to meet the original nine last year in Charleston. It's thanks to Billie Jean King that we have everything in professional sport that we have today. It's amazing,\" said Martina Hingis, who has won five Grand Slams and will also be present.</p><p>\"It was only the second or third time that they had all got together. Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were there too. All these great tennis players, who did so much for the game, in one place.\"</p><p>Hingis, now a coach, said King was a \"real leader\", a \"trooper\".</p><p>Allaster said that without King and her colleagues, the riches and opportunities on offer today would not exist. \"They set the course. Today's players know the debt they owe Billie and the original nine and all the generations that have come before them to make tennis the number one sport in the world for women,\" she said.</p><p>\"Part of my job is to educate them. Every player's meeting we start with a photo of the original nine or a picture of Billie. I don't want anyone to ever forget their courage.\"</p><p>But although there is now equality of prize money at the four Grand Slams, which took until 2007 at Wimbledon, there are other tournaments where there is still a big gap, said Hingis.</p><p>\"It's 2013. But the men still generally make a lot more. At least there's equality at the Grand Slams but at all the other tournaments, there's still a gap.\"</p><p>King passed the baton of WTA president to Evert, whose rivalry with Navratilova took women's tennis to new heights.</p><p>Evert said the women's game \"started as a small intimate family and evolved into a big business\".</p><p>\"It started with one sponsor in Virginia Slims and turned into hundreds of sponsors vying for a position in sponsorships,\" she said. \"The prize money, exposure, the fan base, sponsorships, media and even the level of tennis greatly improved. Also the tour became more international.\"</p><p>The women's game has come under fire in recent years for, variously, not producing enough characters and dominant players to rival a golden period for the men's game or, conversely, becoming too predictable and dull.</p><p>Allaster argues that the balance is now about right, with a host of young players from around the world coming through to challenge the leading players including Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka and Agnieszka Radwanska.</p><p>\"We've got 11 teenagers in the top 100. We've got 12 players who are more than 30. We've got this nice mix of the current generation, the future stars and some dominance and rivalry at the top. When Serena and Venus were winning everything, people wanted more depth,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then we had the depth and people wanted the personalities and the rivalries. Now I feel we have both. To have Serena as the world number one, probably playing the best tennis of her life, is great.\"</p><p>She said the emerging markets in China, India and the Middle East offered huge opportunities for the sport, in terms of new talent and potential commercial return, but growth had to be carefully managed.</p><p>Radwanska, the Pole who reached the Wimbledon final last year, said the women's tour was getting \"better and better every year\".</p><p>\"We can see that a lot of things have changed in the last 10 or 20 years. I think it's great. I think we can really see that the women's game is bigger than before. We can see more matches on TV and people are more interested in women's tennis,\" she said.</p><p>Allaster said that while the sport had hugely evolved since the events of 1973, today's players still felt a kinship when it came to the big issues and insisted the future of the sport was secure. \"They are individual athletes but when the time comes for them to get together on an issue, they are committed to each other,\" she said.</p><p>\"I truly believe we have the best female athletes in the world. I'm blessed with the most marketable assets in the world. They're smart, they're super strong and they're fun. They engage well with their fans and that's a fantastic base for us to build on.\"</p><p>For Evert, King's hotel room revolution blew open the doors for those who followed, enabling a professional tennis career that provided \"the opportunity for a woman to compete at the highest level, to be proud of her physical and mental strength and to take advantage of the opportunity to be a positive role model\".</p><p>• This footnote was appended on 24 June 2013: A number of state and federal laws relating to equal opportunities were passed before 1975 in the USA; the particular equal opportunity law that was two years away when the WTA was formed was Article IX, which requires gender equity in educational programmes that receive federal funding; while Article IX itself was enacted in 1972, its implementing regulations - which covered, among other things, school and college athletics - were not signed into law until 1975.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411185264|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|a52f1779f78c2bfabc0032c1ae0e299c490b761c -->",
