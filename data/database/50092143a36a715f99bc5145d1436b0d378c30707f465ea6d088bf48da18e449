NOT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO. These are the words of Death, one of Terry Pratchett’s ingenious comic creations in his Discworld novels. Death has a booming, unamused voice (always in capitals, never in quotation marks), and is the permanent straight man in the comic chaos around him. He goes about his morbid business on a horse called Binky, whose hooves throw up sparks on every street cobble. Death is a skeleton, with eyes like two tiny blue stars set deep within the sockets. He wears a black cloak, carries a scythe and, at the end of a day’s work, loves to murder a curry. At the point of contact with his latest client, he usually spends a few moments having a courteous word or two with the recently deceased, until they fade away.</p> <p>Now Death has gained a most illustrious client, for Pratchett himself has died, aged 66, after suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The exchange is no doubt unamused but courteous on one side, amusing but rueful on the other, but of fervent interest to both parties. It’s a conversation that millions of Pratchett fans would ache to overhear. Would Death dare to speak in capitals to Sir Terry Pratchett?</p> <p>Pratchett was, and will remain, one of the most popular British authors of all time. In the modern age, only the career of JK Rowling, creator of Harry Potter, is comparable. The facts of Pratchett’s success are impressive: the sheer number of books he has sold (some 80m copies worldwide), and the number of reprints, translations, dramatisations on television and stage, audio versions and spin-offs, plus awards and honorary doctorates galore. Then there’s an inestimable amount of Discworld spinoffery: chess pieces, wizardly hats, cloaks and T-shirts, leathern bags, pottery figurines, fantastic artwork, magic clobber of every kind including dribbly candles – all made by and sold to fans. His signings at bookshops were legendary: a queue stretching down the street was de rigueur, and although Pratchett worked quickly at the signatures, he was unfailingly friendly to everyone who turned up. He was open to readers: he answered emails (or some of them, because the volume of incoming messages was spectacular) and he went to Discworld conventions (almost all of them). He was a nice man, unpretentious and with a wry manner.</p> <p>Pratchett was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, son of David and Eileen. He described himself as an omnivorous reader of books from the local library, making up for his lacklustre years at High Wycombe technical high school. He wrote his first story while still at school: The Hades Business, originally published in the school magazine. It became his first professional sale when it was picked up later by the magazine Science Fantasy. He went into local journalism, working on the Bucks Free Press, and later on the Western Daily Press and Bath Chronicle. While working as a journalist, he wrote innumerable short stories for the newspapers under pen names.</p> <p>Not long after the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979, he worked as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, and was paid to issue public information about the safety of three nuclear power stations. His nuclear masters had presumably assured him that British reactors were not the sort that melted down. He sold his first few books at this time. He left the CEGB to become a full-time writer in 1987, when offered a deal for the next three Discworld books.</p> <p>Such a multi-book contract for an almost unknown writer indicated that something special was going on. From the outset his career had unusual qualities. Pratchett’s first fantasy book was The Carpet People, written when he was 18; he rewrote it 30 years later, having revised and reversed his ideas about the importance of kings and wars. It was originally published in 1971 by a local publisher, Colin Smythe Ltd, based in Gerrards Cross. Smythe published the next two or three novels, licensing other editions in British paperback and in the US, but as Pratchett’s popularity grew it became clear to everyone that a larger publisher would be better equipped to promote his books. Smythe stepped aside as publisher and became Pratchett’s agent instead. Thereafter, hardbacks appeared from large publishers, beginning with Gollancz.</p> <p>Most of Pratchett’s books are set on Discworld, a flat, circular planet where the seas perpetually pour over the sides. Curious sailors who noticed that other ships seemed to disappear over the horizon, and went out to explore, discovered that they truly did disappear. The disc is supported, as if in Hindu mythology, by four large elephants, and they are resting on the back of a frost-covered turtle (gender unknown, although naughty people have tried to find out by building a gantry over the edge and climbing down for a quick peek), which swims sedately through space.</p> <p>At first, Discworld was used as a background for a series of comic sendups of other fantasy cliches but, as Pratchett himself said, if that was all, he would have run out of steam after a couple of books. Discworld constantly evolved, and part of its fascination for readers was the way in which the background became deeper, more complex and in some cases darker, but nonetheless remained a background. Forty Discworld novels appeared. The emphasis was always on the comedy, the foibles and peccadilloes of the characters, a gentle cynicism about the ways of the world, a joy in puns, a love of irritating footnotes, a relish for the bathetic puncturing of the bombastic – and above all an irrepressible and infectious silliness.</p> <p>In a publishing world where popular success often equates to ill-written or hackneyed work, Pratchett’s novels, although in a racy, readable style, were constantly witty, with many cultural, vernacular and literary references. You never quite knew where the next association was coming from: you would find sideways references to HP Lovecraft, William Shakespeare, Beachcomber, Sellar and Yeatman, Thomas Hughes, Peter Shaffer (a good joke about Salieri), JRR Tolkien, Egyptology, vampirism, dragons.</p> <p>The name of the Welsh area of Discworld (very Welsh) has a sly reference to Dylan Thomas: Llamedos. People on Discworld often get things a bit muddled: a fad for Australian-style bush hats goes wrong at first, until the pioneer realises he should remove the corks from the bottles. A vampire gets a job as a press photographer, but inconveniently turns to dust when his flashgun goes off.</p> <p>In The Light Fantastic (1986), a librarian is turned into an orangutan by an errant spell. It suits him: people give him a lot of bananas, and clambering up to retrieve books from high shelves becomes a doddle. The orangutan was so popular with readers that he reappeared in most of the books that followed. That in turn led to Pratchett’s own passionate involvement with the Orangutan Foundation. In 1995 he went to Borneo with a TV crew and made a highly praised film about the endangered animals.</p> <p>The humour of the novels was likable and liked: most of Pratchett’s books sold on word of mouth, and the many conventions thrown in his honour were happy occasions. He gave his readers memorable hours of talks, interviews and jokes.</p> <p>Then, at the end of 2007, following what he thought was a mild stroke, Pratchett was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, a form of Alzheimer’s. The onset was early (he was still in his 50s) but also slow. Higher intellectual capacity was not immediately affected. He was able to go on writing, but typing at a keyboard became a problem. He soon learned there was no cure, nor any realistic hope of one within his expected lifetime, and that Alzheimer’s, so widespread, so destructive not only of the sufferers but also their carers, was a Cinderella disease. UK government support for Alzheimer’s research was running at about 3% of the funding for cancer research. Pratchett immediately donated $1m to Alzheimer’s Research UK, subsequently becoming a patron.</p> <p>His last years were astonishingly active. He continued to write fiction, learning to dictate rather than type, and a last Discworld novel was completed and delivered last summer. In July, he had to cancel a planned appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention – it was the first time he had ever missed the event.</p> <p>Three novels in collaboration with Stephen Baxter were also completed in this period, as well as collections of essays and short stories. In 2010 he wrote and introduced the BBC Richard Dimbleby lecture, which was an impassioned plea for the right of assisted suicide. The lecture was read for him by Tony Robinson, whom the author introduced as a “stunt Terry”.</p> <p>He was appointed OBE in 1998, and knighted in 2009. He remarked that now everyone would know that he was married to a lady, something he had been aware of for many years – he and Lyn Purves were married in 1968. Their daughter, Rhianna, is also a professional writer of many years’ standing. He is survived by both.</p> <p>• Terence David John Pratchett, novelist, born 28 April 1948; died 12 March 2015</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10185201","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2257071","internalContentCode":"455872656","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Bestselling author of the Discworld novels, which combined fantasy with wit and an irrepressible silliness","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Christopher Priest","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T17:15:03.702Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426177385252/terry-pratchett-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5501bc79e4b04d0e8019f3e1","newspaperPageNumber":"39","internalStoryPackageCode":"85079","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-26T16:18:00+00:00","standfirst":"Bestselling author of the Discworld novels, which combined fantasy with wit and an irrepressible silliness","linkText":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-03-13T00:06:52.410Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/terrypratchett","webTitle":"Terry Pratchett","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/terrypratchett","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/terrypratchett","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"author","id":"author/terry-pratchett"}]},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fantasy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fantasy","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/FIC009"}]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/FIC"}]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email"}]},{"id":"society/alzheimers","webTitle":"Alzheimer's","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/alzheimers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/alzheimers","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/health","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/christopher-priest","webTitle":"Christopher Priest","r2ContributorId":"43435","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/29/1301401255908/Christopher-Priest-003.jpg","firstName":"christopher","lastName":"priest","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Christopher Priest is a British novelist.

had to buy a suitcase on a book tour. It had four wheels and a mind of its own. I went right, it went left. I went straight on, it veered in random directions. And because I was in America and Homeland Security searched it every time I flew, whenever I opened it, my clothes were configured differently. Inevitably, I christened it The Luggage, after Terry Pratchett’s sapient pearwood invention, an object generally announced by the patter of its many feet, and characterised by its ever-changing and apparently random contents. </p> <p>And that for me is the key thing about Pratchett’s fantasy. It always has reality stitched into it, so people like me who don’t read much fantasy feel at home in his world of magic, monstrousness and mortality. We recognise our own chaotic lives, the exaggerated characteristics of the people we know and the institutions that make up our world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8c24b7cd088f121cf3e24a31f35c483561ccf8ae\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426200542236/0b40f0b4-6ee3-46ce-b91c-27705ceba660-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Val McDermid: Even Pratchett’s silliness is entertaining.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Val McDermid: Even Pratchett’s silliness is entertaining.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hartley / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking as a writer of genre fiction, there are few sentences that cause more irritation than “these books transcend genre”, but if it has any meaning at all, it is this: because of that obvious interconnectedness between the world we inhabit and the world Pratchett invented, the Discworld novels found a readership that stretches well beyond people who would consider themselves fans of fantasy fiction. I always read – and sometimes reread – Pratchett on book tours. They are the perfect antidote to being alone and far from home.</p> <p>I love the Discworld novels for so many reasons. They satirise our world and its institutions with an unsparing savagery – everything from the coming of the railways to the internet via religious intolerance and radicalisation – but they don’t make us despair because there are always glorious characters with their hearts in the right place who bring us comfort: Sam Vimes, Tiffany Aching, Death, Captain Carrot, Moist von Lipwig, Rincewind and of course, the Patriarch himself, Lord Vetinari. </p> <p>And then there’s the breathtaking inventiveness of it all. Who but Pratchett could have come up with the belligerent blue midget warrior tribe, the Nac Mac Feegles, whose fantasy Scottishness has always made me giggle out loud in public places? Or the festering stews of Ankh-Morpork, capital of the empire and a compendium of all that was hideous about city life before we discovered hygiene and street lighting? Or Death, who SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS and decides for the duration of one book that he’d like to take a holiday?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett-a-life-in-pictures\">Terry Pratchett – a life in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes it spills over into silliness, but even the silliness is entertaining. Take the Discworld itself, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants who are in turn standing on the shell of a giant turtle. The physics and geography that this generates provided its creator with endless opportunities to entertain us. And let’s not forget that he turned libraries into fun palaces and librarians into creative, acrobatic resources. The library at the Unseen University resembles the Bodleian Library reimagined by Escher. </p> <p>The other aspect of his work I enjoyed was his ability to write with warmth without tipping over into sentimentality. Any sign of that creeping in and you could be sure a large bucket of ice cold water was about to be tipped over someone’s head. Probably yours, dear reader.</p> <p>His Alzheimer’s was the cruellest possible blow to a mind so inventive, so rich and so funny. With his passing, the world is a less fantastic place.</p> <p><em>Val McDermid is a crime writer best known for her series of suspense novels featuring the character Dr Tony Hill</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2257254","internalContentCode":"455877829","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Pratchett found an audience that ran well beyond fantasy fans.

<p>The announcement came in typically irreverent manner on the author’s Twitter feed, with a series of tweets beginning in the voice of his character, Death: “AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.”<br /></p> <p>“Terry took Death’s arm,” the following tweet read, “and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night.”<br /></p> <p>Pratchett’s publisher, Larry Finlay, paid tribute to one of the world’s “brightest, sharpest minds”.<br /></p> <p>“In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him,” Finlay said. “As all who read him know, Discworld was his vehicle to satirise this world: he did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humour and constant invention.”<br /></p> <p>The author died at his home “with his cat sleeping on his bed, surrounded by his family” on Thursday, said Finlay.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/terryandrob/statuses/576036599047258112\">

He pulled out of a planned summer Discworld festival earlier this year, saying “the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me”.<br /></p> <p>With more than 75m copies sold around the world, Pratchett became one of the UK’s most-loved writers after the publication of his first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, in 1983. The 40th, Raising Steam, was released last year, with the writer completing recent work using voice-recognition software.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/12/without-terry-pratchett-world-less-magical-discworld\">Without Terry Pratchett, the world is less magical | Andrew Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recently teamed up with the science fiction writer Stephen Baxter for the “Long Earth” series of novels, the fourth of which – The Long Utopia – is due out in the summer.</p> <p>The announcement of his death unleashed a tide of sympathy from around the world. David Cameron <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/576050623361245185\">tweeted:</a> “Sad to hear of Sir Terry Pratchett’s death, his books fired the imagination of millions and he fearlessly campaigned for dementia awareness.”</p> <p>The author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/576057397359157248 \">Neil Gaiman, a friend and collaborator, tweeted</a>: “I will miss you, Terry, so much.”</p> <p>The novelist AS Byatt, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/28/byatt-edinburgh-loves-terry-pratchett\">a longtime champion of Pratchett’s work</a>, told the Guardian: “No writer in my lifetime has given me as much pleasure and happiness. He could do knockabout for schoolboys (and girls) but he was also subtle and wise and very funny in the adult world. I loved him because almost all the characters he didn’t like slowly grew more real, more interesting, more complicated perhaps to his own surprise. </p> <p>“He could write evil if he needed to, but if he didn’t his characters surprised us and him. His prose was layered: there was a mischievous surface, and a layer of complicated running jokes, and something steely and uncompromising that turned the reader cold from time to time. He was my unlikely hero, and saved me from disaster more than once by making me laugh and making me think.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett-a-life-in-pictures\">Terry Pratchett – a life in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Booker prizewinning Canadian writer Margaret Atwood <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood/status/576053117432782848\">added her voice, tweeting</a> that she was “Very sad to hear of the death of #terrypratchett. I vastly enjoy his playful, smart #Discworld books.”</p> <p>Born in 1948, Pratchett left school at 17 to work on his local paper, the Bucks Free Press. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing\">Speaking to the Guardian in 2011</a>, he argued that “there can be no better grounding for a lifetime as an author than to see humanity in all its various guises through the lens of the reporter for the town. All the court cases, such crimes as there were. You got to know the coppers, they told you stuff – for a young man with a pencil, you could do what you wanted, really.”<br /></p> <p>He began writing a series of stories for the newspaper’s children’s corner about a tribe of people called the Munrungs living on a world called Carpet, which became his first novel, The Carpet People, published in 1971. But it was the novel he wrote while working as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, The Colour of Magic, which landed him a six-book deal and allowed him to write full time. In 1996, he became the UK’s top-selling and highest-earning author.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79f94fa871f1283a95a70070148bd2e1d63883a8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426183444674/d1c4e3c1-4512-4f07-8546-0fd33484dd02-286x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Terry Pratchett enjoys a half pint of Badger Ale in his local pub The Queen’s Head, Broad Chalke, Wiltshire, in 2012\" width=\"286\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Pratchett enjoys a half pint of Badger Ale in his local pub The Queen’s Head, Broad Chalke, Wiltshire, in 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The characters of his fantastical creation, Discworld, inhabit a world held up by four elephants balanced on the back of a giant turtle. It is a world peopled by incompetent wizards, upside-down mountains, slow-witted barbarians and a wry incarnation of Death. Begun as a cheerful parody of fantasy authors from JRR Tolkien to Ursula K Le Guin, Pratchett’s ambitions gradually expanded to encompass life, death and humanity’s place in the universe – though the jokes kept coming.<br /></p> <p>“The further back you go the more juvenile they appear,” he told the Guardian in 2011. “There’s funny and joking, the two are different … As things progressed, both with adult and junior books, I found that in subtle kinds of ways, without being preachy at all, you could suggest rather interesting things.”<br /></p> <p>According to Neil Gaiman, who co-wrote 1990’s Good Omens with him, Pratchett’s writing is powered by “fury … it’s the fury that was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2013/may/02/terry-pratchett-science-discworld-video\">the engine that powered Discworld</a>. It’s also the anger at the headmaster who would decide that six-year-old Terry Pratchett would never be smart enough for the 11-plus; anger at pompous critics, and at those who think serious is the opposite of funny; anger at his early American publishers who could not bring his books out successfully.”<br /></p> <p>After his diagnosis in 2007 this anger shifted its focus, Gaiman continued, turning towards “his brain and his genetics and, more than these, furious at a country that would not permit him (or others in a similarly intolerable situation) to choose the manner and the time of their passing”.<br /></p> <p>Pratchett became an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/terry-pratchett-assisted-suicide-tribunal\">eloquent advocate for assisted dying</a>, arguing for a “strictly non-­aggressive tribunal that would establish the facts of the case well before the assisted death takes place” .<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6048bc2d9425054294722d4adeecb5ad279a5d8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d6048bc2d9425054294722d4adeecb5ad279a5d8/0_0_2047_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Pratchett with his OBE.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Pratchett with his OBE.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I would like to die peacefully with Thomas Tallis on my iPod before the disease takes me over,” he continued, “and I hope that will not be for quite some time to come, because if I knew that I could die at any time I wanted, then suddenly every day would be as ­precious as a million pounds. If I knew that I could die, I would live. My life, my death, my choice.”<br /></p> <p>Pratchett was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/31/new-year-honours-list\">knighted for services to literature</a> in the 2009 new year’s honours and he received the World Fantasy award for life achievement in 2010. But for Gaiman no honour could do justice to his lifetime’s work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett-in-quotes-15-of-the-best\">Terry Pratchett in quotes: 15 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He wrote: “As Terry walks into the darkness much too soon, I find myself raging too: at the injustice that deprives us of – what? Another 20 or 30 books? Another shelf-full of ideas and glorious phrases and old friends and new, of stories in which people do what they really do best, which is use their heads to get themselves out of the trouble they got into by not thinking?”<br /></p> <p>“I rage at the imminent loss of my friend,” Gaiman continued, “And I think, ‘What would Terry do with this anger?’ Then I pick up my pen, and I start to write.”<br

NOT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO. These are the words of Death, one of Terry Pratchett’s ingenious comic creations in his Discworld novels. Death has a booming, unamused voice (always in capitals, never in quotation marks), and is the permanent straight man in the comic chaos around him. He goes about his morbid business on a horse called Binky, whose hooves throw up sparks on every street cobble. Death is a skeleton, with eyes like two tiny blue stars set deep within the sockets. He wears a black cloak, carries a scythe and, at the end of a day’s work, loves to murder a curry. At the point of contact with his latest client, he usually spends a few moments having a courteous word or two with the recently deceased, until they fade away.</p> <p>Now Death has gained a most illustrious client, for Pratchett himself has died, aged 66, after suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The exchange is no doubt unamused but courteous on one side, amusing but rueful on the other, but of fervent interest to both parties. It’s a conversation that millions of Pratchett fans would ache to overhear. Would Death dare to speak in capitals to Sir Terry Pratchett?</p> <p>Pratchett was, and will remain, one of the most popular British authors of all time. In the modern age, only the career of JK Rowling, creator of Harry Potter, is comparable. The facts of Pratchett’s success are impressive: the sheer number of books he has sold (some 80m copies worldwide), and the number of reprints, translations, dramatisations on television and stage, audio versions and spin-offs, plus awards and honorary doctorates galore. Then there’s an inestimable amount of Discworld spinoffery: chess pieces, wizardly hats, cloaks and T-shirts, leathern bags, pottery figurines, fantastic artwork, magic clobber of every kind including dribbly candles – all made by and sold to fans. His signings at bookshops were legendary: a queue stretching down the street was de rigueur, and although Pratchett worked quickly at the signatures, he was unfailingly friendly to everyone who turned up. He was open to readers: he answered emails (or some of them, because the volume of incoming messages was spectacular) and he went to Discworld conventions (almost all of them). He was a nice man, unpretentious and with a wry manner.</p> <p>Pratchett was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, son of David and Eileen. He described himself as an omnivorous reader of books from the local library, making up for his lacklustre years at High Wycombe technical high school. He wrote his first story while still at school: The Hades Business, originally published in the school magazine. It became his first professional sale when it was picked up later by the magazine Science Fantasy. He went into local journalism, working on the Bucks Free Press, and later on the Western Daily Press and Bath Chronicle. While working as a journalist, he wrote innumerable short stories for the newspapers under pen names.</p> <p>Not long after the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979, he worked as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, and was paid to issue public information about the safety of three nuclear power stations. His nuclear masters had presumably assured him that British reactors were not the sort that melted down. He sold his first few books at this time. He left the CEGB to become a full-time writer in 1987, when offered a deal for the next three Discworld books.</p> <p>Such a multi-book contract for an almost unknown writer indicated that something special was going on. From the outset his career had unusual qualities. Pratchett’s first fantasy book was The Carpet People, written when he was 18; he rewrote it 30 years later, having revised and reversed his ideas about the importance of kings and wars. It was originally published in 1971 by a local publisher, Colin Smythe Ltd, based in Gerrards Cross. Smythe published the next two or three novels, licensing other editions in British paperback and in the US, but as Pratchett’s popularity grew it became clear to everyone that a larger publisher would be better equipped to promote his books. Smythe stepped aside as publisher and became Pratchett’s agent instead. Thereafter, hardbacks appeared from large publishers, beginning with Gollancz.</p> <p>Most of Pratchett’s books are set on Discworld, a flat, circular planet where the seas perpetually pour over the sides. Curious sailors who noticed that other ships seemed to disappear over the horizon, and went out to explore, discovered that they truly did disappear. The disc is supported, as if in Hindu mythology, by four large elephants, and they are resting on the back of a frost-covered turtle (gender unknown, although naughty people have tried to find out by building a gantry over the edge and climbing down for a quick peek), which swims sedately through space.</p> <p>At first, Discworld was used as a background for a series of comic sendups of other fantasy cliches but, as Pratchett himself said, if that was all, he would have run out of steam after a couple of books. Discworld constantly evolved, and part of its fascination for readers was the way in which the background became deeper, more complex and in some cases darker, but nonetheless remained a background. Forty Discworld novels appeared. The emphasis was always on the comedy, the foibles and peccadilloes of the characters, a gentle cynicism about the ways of the world, a joy in puns, a love of irritating footnotes, a relish for the bathetic puncturing of the bombastic – and above all an irrepressible and infectious silliness.</p> <p>In a publishing world where popular success often equates to ill-written or hackneyed work, Pratchett’s novels, although in a racy, readable style, were constantly witty, with many cultural, vernacular and literary references. You never quite knew where the next association was coming from: you would find sideways references to HP Lovecraft, William Shakespeare, Beachcomber, Sellar and Yeatman, Thomas Hughes, Peter Shaffer (a good joke about Salieri), JRR Tolkien, Egyptology, vampirism, dragons.</p> <p>The name of the Welsh area of Discworld (very Welsh) has a sly reference to Dylan Thomas: Llamedos. People on Discworld often get things a bit muddled: a fad for Australian-style bush hats goes wrong at first, until the pioneer realises he should remove the corks from the bottles. A vampire gets a job as a press photographer, but inconveniently turns to dust when his flashgun goes off.</p> <p>In The Light Fantastic (1986), a librarian is turned into an orangutan by an errant spell. It suits him: people give him a lot of bananas, and clambering up to retrieve books from high shelves becomes a doddle. The orangutan was so popular with readers that he reappeared in most of the books that followed. That in turn led to Pratchett’s own passionate involvement with the Orangutan Foundation. In 1995 he went to Borneo with a TV crew and made a highly praised film about the endangered animals.</p> <p>The humour of the novels was likable and liked: most of Pratchett’s books sold on word of mouth, and the many conventions thrown in his honour were happy occasions. He gave his readers memorable hours of talks, interviews and jokes.</p> <p>Then, at the end of 2007, following what he thought was a mild stroke, Pratchett was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, a form of Alzheimer’s. The onset was early (he was still in his 50s) but also slow. Higher intellectual capacity was not immediately affected. He was able to go on writing, but typing at a keyboard became a problem. He soon learned there was no cure, nor any realistic hope of one within his expected lifetime, and that Alzheimer’s, so widespread, so destructive not only of the sufferers but also their carers, was a Cinderella disease. UK government support for Alzheimer’s research was running at about 3% of the funding for cancer research. Pratchett immediately donated $1m to Alzheimer’s Research UK, subsequently becoming a patron.</p> <p>His last years were astonishingly active. He continued to write fiction, learning to dictate rather than type, and a last Discworld novel was completed and delivered last summer. In July, he had to cancel a planned appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention – it was the first time he had ever missed the event.</p> <p>Three novels in collaboration with Stephen Baxter were also completed in this period, as well as collections of essays and short stories. In 2010 he wrote and introduced the BBC Richard Dimbleby lecture, which was an impassioned plea for the right of assisted suicide. The lecture was read for him by Tony Robinson, whom the author introduced as a “stunt Terry”.</p> <p>He was appointed OBE in 1998, and knighted in 2009. He remarked that now everyone would know that he was married to a lady, something he had been aware of for many years – he and Lyn Purves were married in 1968. Their daughter, Rhianna, is also a professional writer of many years’ standing. He is survived by both.</p> <p>• Terence David John Pratchett, novelist, born 28 April 1948; died 12 March 2015</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10185201","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2257071","internalContentCode":"455872656","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Bestselling author of the Discworld novels, which combined fantasy with wit and an irrepressible silliness","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Christopher Priest","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T17:15:03.702Z","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426177385252/terry-pratchett-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5501bc79e4b04d0e8019f3e1","newspaperPageNumber":"39","internalStoryPackageCode":"85079","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-26T16:18:00+00:00","standfirst":"Bestselling author of the Discworld novels, which combined fantasy with wit and an irrepressible silliness","linkText":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-03-13T00:06:52.410Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","sectionName":"Books","tags":[{"id":"books/terrypratchett","webTitle":"Terry Pratchett","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/terrypratchett","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/terrypratchett","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"author","id":"author/terry-pratchett"}]},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fantasy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fantasy","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/FIC009"}]},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"bisac-prefix","id":"bisac-prefix/FIC"}]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email"}]},{"id":"society/alzheimers","webTitle":"Alzheimer's","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/alzheimers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/alzheimers","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/health","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","webTitle":"Obituaries","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/christopher-priest","webTitle":"Christopher Priest","r2ContributorId":"43435","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/29/1301401255908/Christopher-Priest-003.jpg","firstName":"christopher","lastName":"priest","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Christopher Priest is a British novelist.

He published his first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, in 1983. The 40th, Raising Steam, was released last year, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing\" title=\"\">new work still coming thick and fast despite a diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer’s in 2007</a>. But <a href=\"http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/philosophy-and-terry-pratchett-jacob-held/?K=9781137360151\" title=\"\">Philosophy and Terry Pratchett</a>, published on 3 December, is the first study to explore the philosophical implications of Pratchett’s imaginary world, which is perched on the back of a turtle.</p> <p>Edited by philosophy professors and Pratchett fans James South and Jacob Held, the collection of essays examines questions including “Plato, the Witch, and the Cave: Granny Weatherwax and the Moral Problem of Paternalism”, “Equality and Difference: Just because the Disc Is Flat, Doesn’t Make It a Level Playing Field for All”, “Hogfather and the Existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard”, and “the Importance of Being in the Right Trouser Leg of Time”.</p> <p>South, associate professor of philosophy at Marquette University, is adamant Pratchett’s novels “hold up to sustained philosophical reflection”.</p> <p>“Pratchett is a very smart man, a gifted writer, and understands as well as any philosopher the power of storytelling and the problems humans face in making sense of their lives and the world they live in,” South said. “Or, as Death puts it so well: ‘DO NOT PUT ALL YOUR TRUST IN ROOT VEGETABLES. WHAT THINGS SEEM TO BE MAY NOT BE WHAT THEY ARE.’ This is a truth that Pratchett relatedly acknowledges and tries to get his readers to acknowledge as well.”</p> <p>For Held, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Central Arkansas, the best satire “understands the world it interrogates and offers a new or novel take or window onto that world”.</p> <p>Pratchett’s character Death “is profoundly Kantian,” Held continued. “He speaks to the need for a rational faith or belief in values like dignity, or even an afterlife … Then you have Carrot and Vimes, or the relativist versus the moral absolutist. So much of Pratchett’s writings deal with value in the world, its origin, its origin in our beliefs, in our desire and need to value the world, and how it needs to be rigorously maintained through our practices.”</p> <p>The academics have not approached Pratchett about the book, South saying they “figured he’d think it was all a bit of nonsense taking his work seriously in this way”, although adding that “secretly, I think he’d be pleased”.</p> <p>“But, then I think about some of his expressed views about philosophers, especially in Small Gods and wonder what he really makes of us,” said South, citing Pratchett’s dictum that “whenever you see a bunch of buggers puttering around talking about truth and beauty and the best way of attacking Ethics, you can bet your sandals it’s all because dozens of other poor buggers are doing all the real work around the place.”</p> <p>“Of course, some of these observations hit close to home,” South added.</p> <p>The book is aimed at both fans of Pratchett and philosophers, and South hopes it will “enrich people’s appreciation of the impressive accomplishment of Pratchett’s imagination and skill”.</p> <p>“If Pratchett is sometimes accused of literature, I hope this book makes the case that he can be accused of philosophy as well,” said the academic.</p> <h2>Pratchett on philosophy</h2> <p>“Take it from me, whenever you see a bunch of buggers puttering around talking about truth and beauty and the best way of attacking Ethics, you can bet your sandals it’s all because dozens of other poor buggers are doing all the real work around the place.”</p> <p>“The philosopher Didactylus has summed up an alternative hypothesis as ‘Things just happen. What the hell.’”</p> <p>“One of the recurring philosophical questions is: ‘Does a falling tree in the forest make a sound when there is no one to hear?’ Which says something about the nature of philosophers, because there is always someone in a forest. It may only be a badger, wondering what that cracking noise was, or a squirrel a bit puzzled by all the scenery going upwards, but someone.”</p> <p>“I used to think that I was stupid, and then I met philosophers.”</p> <p>“’What’s a philosopher?’ said Brutha. ‘Someone who’s bright enough to find a job with no heavy lifting,’ said a voice in his head.”</p> <p>“His philosophy was a mixture of three famous schools – the Cynics, the Stoics and the Epicureans – and summed up all three of them in his famous phrase, ‘You can’t trust any bugger further than you can throw him, and there’s nothing you can do about it, so let’s have a drink. Mine’s a double, if you’re buying. Thank you. And a packet of nuts. Her left bosom is nearly uncovered, eh? Two more packets, then!’”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9822368","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2200808","internalContentCode":"452758011","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Two

I’m going to tell you something you may not know. Some people have encountered an affable man with a beard and a hat. They believe they have met Sir Terry Pratchett. They have not.</p> <p>Science fiction conventions often give you someone to look after you, to make sure you get from place to place without getting lost. Some years ago I ran into someone who had once been Terry’s handler at a convention in Texas. His eyes misted over at the memory of getting Terry from his panel to the book-dealers’ room and back. “What a jolly old elf Sir Terry is,” he said. And I thought, No. No, he’s not.</p> <p>Back in February 1991, Terry and I were on a book signing tour for <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/bbc-radio-4-to-air-dramatization-of-neil-gaiman-terry-pratchetts-good-omens_b90103\" title=\"\">Good Omens</a>, a book we had written together. We were in San Francisco. We had just done a stock signing in a bookshop, signing the dozen or so copies they had ordered. Terry looked at the itinerary. Next stop was a radio station: we were due to have an hour-long interview on live radio. “From the address, it’s just down the street from here,” said Terry. “And we’ve got half an hour. Let’s walk it.”</p> <p>This was a long time ago, in the days before GPS systems and mobile phones and taxi-summoning apps and suchlike useful things that would have told us in moments that no, it would not be a few blocks to the radio station. It would be several miles, all uphill and mostly through a park.</p> <p>We called the radio station as we went, whenever we passed a payphone, to tell them that we knew we were now late for a live broadcast, and that we were, promise-cross-our-hearts, walking as fast as we could.</p> <p>I would try to say cheerful, optimistic things as we walked. Terry said nothing, in a way that made it very clear that anything I could say would probably just make things worse. I did not ever say, at any point on that walk, that all of this would have been avoided if we had just got the bookshop to call us a taxi. There are things you can never unsay, that you cannot say and still remain friends, and that would have been one of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d32b9d47-0c69-44e5-97a1-fa0184275aae\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411569637450/8014e139-0de8-4702-b207-ab24f009228f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Beneath any jollity there is a foundation of fury.

Terry Pratchett is not one to go gentle into any night, good or otherwise.’ Photograph by Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We reached the radio station at the top of the hill, a very long way from anywhere, about 40 minutes into our hour-long live interview. We arrived all sweaty and out of breath, and they were broadcasting the breaking news. A man had just started shooting people in a local McDonald’s, which is not the kind of thing you want to have as your lead-in when you are now meant to talk about a funny book you’ve written about the end of the world and how we’re all going to die.</p> <p>The radio people were angry with us, too, and understandably so: it’s no fun having to improvise when your guests are late. I don’t think our 15 minutes on air were very funny. (I was later told that Terry and I had both been blacklisted by that San Franciscan radio station for several years, because leaving a show’s hosts to burble into the dead air for 40 minutes is something the powers of radio do not easily forget or forgive.)</p> <p>Still, by the top of the hour it was all over. We went back to our hotel, and this time we took a taxi. Terry was silently furious: with himself, mostly, I suspect, and with the world that had not told him that the distance from the bookshop to the radio station was much further than it had looked on our itinerary. He sat in the back of the cab beside me white with anger, a non-directional ball of fury. I said something, hoping to placate him. Perhaps I said that, ah well, it had all worked out in the end, and it hadn’t been the end of the world, and suggested it was time to not be angry any more.</p> <p>Terry looked at me. He said: “Do not underestimate this anger. This anger was the engine that powered Good Omens.” I thought of the driven way that Terry wrote, and of the way that he drove the rest of us with him, and I knew that he was right.</p> <p>There is a fury to Terry Pratchett’s writing: it’s the fury that was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2013/may/02/terry-pratchett-science-discworld-video\" title=\"\">the engine that powered Discworld</a>. It’s also the anger at the headmaster who would decide that six-year-old Terry Pratchett would never be smart enough for the 11-plus; anger at pompous critics, and at those who think serious is the opposite of funny; anger at his early American publishers who could not bring his books out successfully.</p> <p>The anger is always there, an engine that drives. By the time Terry learned he had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/02/terry-pratchett-cancel-appearance-alzheimers-discworld\" title=\"\">a rare, early onset form of Alzheimer’s</a>, the targets of his fury changed: he was angry with his brain and his genetics and, more than these, furious at a country that would not permit him (or others in a similarly intolerable situation) to choose the manner and the time of their passing.</p> <p>And that anger, it seems to me, is about Terry’s underlying sense of what is fair and what is not. It is that sense of fairness that underlies Terry’s work and his writing, and it’s what drove him from school to journalism to the press office of the SouthWestern Electricity Board to the position of being one of the best-loved and bestselling writers in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-79e2f0df-9252-49b1-b395-b8ac14308de0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411569922167/4a5b9814-3113-451a-b071-8d554c91fb67-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Any Terry Pratchett book is a small miracle' ...

Photograph: Frank Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s the same sense of fairness that means that, sometimes in the cracks, while writing about other things, he takes time to punctiliously acknowledge his influences – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/19/pressandpublishing.television\" title=\"\">Alan Coren</a>, for example, who pioneered so many of the techniques of short humour that Terry and I have filched over the years; or the glorious, overstuffed, heady thing that is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/10/miscellany\" title=\"\">Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</a> and its compiler, t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Cobham_Brewer\" title=\"\">he Rev E Cobham Brewer</a>, that most serendipitious of authors. Terry once wrote an introduction to Brewer’s and it made me smile – we would call each other up in delight whenever we discovered a book by Brewer we had not seen before (“’Ere!’ Have you already got a copy of Brewer’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Of-Miracles-Imitative-Realistic/dp/116295969X\" title=\"\">A Dictionary of Miracles: Imitative, Realistic and Dogmatic</a>?”)</p> <p>Terry’s authorial voice is always Terry’s: genial, informed, sensible, drily amused. I suppose that, if you look quickly and are not paying attention, you might, perhaps, mistake it for jolly. But beneath any jollity there is a foundation of fury. Terry Pratchett is not one to go gentle into any night, good or otherwise.</p> <p>He will rage, as he leaves, against so many things: stupidity, injustice, human foolishness and shortsightedness, not just the dying of the light. And, hand in hand with the anger, like an angel and a demon walking into the sunset, there is love: for human beings, in all our fallibility; for treasured objects; for stories; and ultimately and in all things, love for human dignity.</p> <p>Or to put it another way, anger is the engine that drives him, but it is the greatness of spirit that deploys that anger on the side of the angels, or better yet for all of us, the orangutans.</p> <p>Terry Pratchett is not a jolly old elf at all. Not even close. He’s so much more than that. As Terry walks into the darkness much too soon, I find myself raging too: at the injustice that deprives us of – what? Another 20 or 30 books? Another shelf-full of ideas and glorious phrases and old friends and new, of stories in which people do what they really do best, which is use their heads to get themselves out of the trouble they got into by not thinking? Another book or two of journalism and agitprop? But truly, the loss of these things does not anger me as it should. It saddens me, but I, who have seen some of them being built close-up, understand that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/10/terry-pratchett-interview-dragons-at-crumbling-castle\" title=\"\">any Terry Pratchett book is a small miracle</a>, and we already have more than might be reasonable, and it does not behoove any of us to be greedy.</p> <p>I rage at the imminent loss of my friend. And I think, “What would Terry do with this anger?” Then I pick up my pen, and I start to write.</p> <p>• Extracted from Neil Gaiman’s introduction to A Slip of the Keyboard: Collected Non-fiction by Terry Pratchett, published by Transworld at £20.

I was sufficiently clever to read some books about it, and I learned that the chances of making any kind of living writing fantasy and science fiction is remote…  but if I got a job on a newspaper they'd have to pay me every week.</p><p>I went round to the local paper to find out more, and they told me they had a job right then! Well, journalist jobs were hard to come by, and I didn't want to miss out. I ran away from school, and I told my parents I'd been given a job. They were pleased that I'd found work that didn't involve getting my hands dirty.</p><p><strong>What did you like about being a journalist?</strong><br />The first day I was a little journalist I was sent out with a real journalist and I saw my first dead body, and it was an extremely dead dead body. When you are a journalist, you see the world, the nasty bits and the good things. You see democracy in progress or no progress whatsoever. You learn about people and get into people's worlds which you'd never get into otherwise. It turns a boy into a man, and it grew me up. </p><p><strong>What did you read when you were a child?</strong><br />I wasn't a reader until I was given a copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781840113525\">The Wind in the Willows</a> when I was 10. I'd never seen anything like it, and I read it straight through, thinking: this book is seriously weird! The rat, mole and badger all change sizes constantly. A toad drives a motor car, and the horse that pulls the caravan is the only animal in the whole story who can't talk. I didn't understand – and I fell in love with that, with the suspension of disbelief the story demanded.<br />\t<br />It was just a few years later I read <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007488360\">The Lord of the Rings</a> in a single 25 hour sitting… By then I was mad for fantasy, reading with the kind of speed you can only manage in your early teens.</p><p><strong>Why do you think fantasy so accessible to both children and adults?</strong><br />You start with the fairytales and the fairytales segue way up as you get older and you start realizing, if you are growing up, that fairytales aren't exactly the same as what's really going on and what's happening around you. And if you're paying attention, you ask why and look for more stories to help find out.</p><p><strong>What is the appeal of fantasy and science fiction for storytelling?</strong><br />We like the idea of \"What if?\" Because even back to Neanderthals you had to be inquisitive and think about the future being different from what it is now, otherwise you'd be toast. All the time the human race asks \"What if?\" Sooner or later it happens that someone will say that's the future. We make these things up, it gives us a vocabulary of ideas for the world being not exactly like it is now.</p><p><strong>Which of the books that you've written is your favorite?</strong><br />I don't know about \"favourite,\" but the four Tiffany Aching books, starting with <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780385612548\">The Wee Free Men</a>, are very close to my heart.</p><p>Lots of girls – and some boys – say they like Tiffany because she is real, and she gets on with things and doesn't complain until it is necessary and does the job that is in front of her all the time. Some of these notions seem old-fashioned these days, but I got them from people I knew when I was growing up. And of course, lot of Tiffany's story is set in Chalk country – the countryside I lived on then and live on now.</p><p><strong>What advice do you give to children who want to be writers, and how does it differ from what you tell adults who want to be writers?</strong><br />I tell aspiring young writers to keep a diary and keep it going whenever you can. I wish I'd done that. I've done it occasionally and I fall out of it. But it should be a proper old time diary including, \"What I thought about when this happened\" and \"This is how I felt that happened…\" Remember who you've been, and who you've met, and all the funny faces you've seen.</p><p>I tell adults that the nice thing about being your own boss is that you can't be sacked.</p><p>• Terry Pratchett's new book <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/dragons-at-crumbling-castle-and-other-stories/9780857534378\">Dragons at Crumbling Castle</a> is published on 11 September 2014.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","showInRelatedContent":"true","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2123606","internalContentCode":"441624767","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Terry Pratchett shares a first look at the cover of Dragons at Crumbling Castle and tells us about his life as a cub reporter before he became a best selling author</p>","allowUgc":"false","lastModified":"2014-08-20T19:11:07Z","headline":"Terry Pratchett: I started writing my new book when I was 17-years-old","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/10/terry-pratchett-interview-dragons-at-crumbling-castle","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/10/terry-pratchett-interview-dragons-at-crumbling-castle","sectionName":"Children's books","tags":[{"id":"childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","webTitle":"Children's books","type":"blog","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/childrens-books-8-12-years","webTitle":"Children's books: 8-12 years","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-8-12-years","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/childrens-books-8-12-years","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/teen-books","webTitle":"Teen books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"books/terrypratchett","webTitle":"Terry Pratchett","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/terrypratchett","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/terrypratchett","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"author","id":"author/terry-pratchett"}]},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","sectionName":"Books","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email"}]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"childrens-books-site/series/childrens-books-author-q-as","webTitle":"Children's books: author Q&As","description":"Celebrated children's books authors discuss the inspirations behind some of their best-loved works","type":"series","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/series/childrens-books-author-q-as","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/series/childrens-books-author-q-as","sectionName":"Children's books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}]}]}}
