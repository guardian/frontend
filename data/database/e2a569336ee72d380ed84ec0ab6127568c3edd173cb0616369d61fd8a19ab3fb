made a video plea for Islamic State (Isis) to spare the life of British hostage Alan Henning.</p> <p>Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release.</p> <p>The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\" title=\"\">Yazidi minority women</a> in Iraq.</p> <p>In the video released on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\" title=\"\">Faisal begged for Henning’s life</a> and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law.</p> <p>There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics. Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge.</p> <p>In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/race.world\" title=\"\">who was jailed in 2003</a>, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> <p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic … the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> <p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person … Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> <p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday</a> for her husband to be released.</p> <p>Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party.</p> <p>“I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87964392-116d-403d-959d-125c41bfc9c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411554442256/e53ad63e-f201-4996-bf11-b08a17eb2492-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/radical-preachers-isis-islamic-state-online-conference\" title=\"\">the Guardian recorded a live online talk</a> in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said.</p> <p>The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”.</p> <p>He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”.</p> <p>Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\"

It is a dangerous mission, but I am confident that the CDF [chief of the defence force] has put in place all possible measures to minimise risk.”</p> <p>The prime minister confirmed he had briefed the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, on Australia’s military involvement and welcomed Shorten’s support on national security – an area in which he said the government and the opposition should “stand shoulder to shoulder”.</p> <p>Shorten said he was confident Australian military forces were capable of working out the rules of engagement and said he did not believe the involvement would increase the danger to Australia.</p> <p>“I don’t believe if we did nothing there would be no threat of terrorism in the world,” Shorten said. “This is a sensible decision in a difficult set of circumstances.”</p> <p>Six Australian F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft are in the Middle East to take part in airstrikes, though cabinet has given approval for eight. The Super Hornets will join the Wedgetail early warning and control aircraft and a refuelling aircraft already supporting coalition operations over Iraq.</p> <p>Abbott rejected the statement that Australia was “at war”, saying it was an “essentially humanitarian mission”.</p> <p>“I know that you’d love to have that headline, but it’s not strictly accurate,” he said. “Yes, we are engaged in combat operations, but these are combat operations against an insurgency, in support of the legitimate government of Iraq. So we are not in combat against another country.”</p> <p>The Greens and others have been critical of the government’s refusal to set out any end strategy. The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said Abbott was sending Australians to another war in Iraq “with a claim that following the United States is in our national interest”.</p> <p>“The Greens stand with those Australians who are asking why is it in Australia’s national interest to join in another war in the Middle East without a clear strategic objective or risk assessment?” Milne said. “How will this war make us safer? Won’t it make us a bigger terrorism target and a more attractive recruiting ground for jihadists?”</p> <p>Abbott said Australia had long been a terrorist threat, as shown by the Bali bombings in 2002, which killed 88 Australians.</p> <p>Asked how the government would know when the mission had been successful, Abbott said: “We will know that we are succeeding, when Isil [Isis] are in retreat, not in advance. </p> <p>“We will know that we are succeeding when the Iraqi government is restoring a modicum of control over its own cities and towns. </p> <p>“We’re not trying to build liberal pluralism in Iraq, we’re not trying to create a shining city on a hill, we are simply acting as part of the US-led coalition in support of the legitimate elected government of Iraq. That’s all we’re doing.”</p> <p>The chief of the defence force, Mark Binskin, said Australian special forces would be working on the ground, but behind the lines with Iraqi forces in concentrated units.</p> <p>“They will be helping Iraqi forces with the planning and coordination of operations,” Binskin said. “It’s not envisaged that we will be engaged in combat operations ourselves but we will be advising and assisting the Iraqi forces as they, the Iraqi forces, engage in combat operations.”

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ADF/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The federal government has approved air combat operations in Iraq to fight Islamic State extremists.<br /> </p> <p>The decision to send in Super Hornets as part of a US-led mission came after a meeting of the national security committee and cabinet in Canberra on Friday.<br /> </p> <p>“Today cabinet has authorised Australian air strikes in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government in support of the Iraqi government,” Abbott said.<br /> </p> <p>“Also, subject to final legal documentation, cabinet has authorised the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to advise and assist Iraqi forces.”<br /> </p> <p>Six Super Hornets, a Wedgetail surveillance aircraft, a KC-30 refueller and a special forces contingent have been pre-deployed to the United Arab Emirates.<br /> </p> <p>Australia ended its military commitment to Iraq in July 2009, after six years of war involving more than 20,000 personnel.<br /> </p> <p>He warned the mission would be “quite lengthy” and would be months rather than weeks.<br /> </p> <p>“I want to assure the Australian people this will be as long as it needs to be, and as short as it possibly can be,” he said.<br /> </p> <p> Abbott said only Iraq could defeat IS, but Iraq would not and should not be alone.<br /> </p> <p>Abbott warned it would be a dangerous mission.<br /> </p> <p>But he said he is confident the defence force has all possible measures to minimise risk in place.<br /> </p> <p>“It is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the Isil [Islamic State] death cult,” Abbott said.<br /> </p> <p>“It is absolutely in Australia’s national interests that this mission go ahead.”<br /> </p> <p>Abbott says opposition leader Bill Shorten has given his full support.<br /> </p> <p>Defence minister David Johnston said the Iraqi government was “gratefully welcoming” of Australia’s role.<br /> </p> <p>“The skill, commitment and professionalism of our uniform personnel is simply first class,” he said.<br /> </p> <p>“They will do a very good job for us.”<br /> </p> <p>Defence force chief, Mark Binskin, said the air task group and commando unit were “potent”.<br /> </p> <p>“The team is well trained, they’re well equipped, they’re well prepared,” Air Chief Marshal Binskin said.<br /> </p> <p>“The air traffic group’s been flying supporting missions and some training missions over Iraq for the last couple of days and we’re ready to get on with the job.”<br /> </p> <p>The prime minister again refused to rule out potential involvement in Syria and cautioned against trying to predict future missions.<br /> </p> <p>“Let’s focus on what’s being done today rather than speculate on what might be done in months or years to come,” he said.<br /> </p> <p>Success would be evident when the Iraqi government was restoring control over its own cities and towns and when Islamic State was in retreat.<br /> </p> <p>“If we could degrade them to the point where they no longer existed that would be obviously the best possible result.”<br /> </p> <p>But Abbott warned that Australia was not at war.<br /> </p> <p>“I know that you’d love to have that headline, but it’s not strictly accurate,” he told reporters.<br /> </p> <p>“Yes, we are engaged in combat operations. But these are combat operations against an insurgency in support of the legitimate government of Iraq.<br /> </p> <p>“We’re not trying to build liberal pluralism in Iraq, we’re not trying to create a shining city on a hill.”</p>","wordcount":"545","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-06T02:15:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-10-03T03:02:28Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-03T03:22:29Z","internalComposerCode":"542e11c4e4b066557aa0d873","internalPageCode":"2169158","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-04T06:16:49Z","productionOffice":"AUS","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/425e5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"226","internalShortId":"/p/425e5"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2014/oct/03/australian-government-approves-air-strikes-targeting-islamic-state-in-iraq","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/03/australian-government-approves-air-strikes-targeting-islamic-state-in-iraq","webTitle":"Australian government approves air strikes targeting Islamic State in Iraq","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-03T03:22:29Z","sectionName":"Australia news","sectionId":"australia-news","type":"article","id":"australia-news/2014/oct/03/australian-government-approves-air-strikes-targeting-islamic-state-in-iraq","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"australia-news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news","editions":[{"id":"australia-news","webTitle":"Australia news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2169047","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-3fe2ee32-87c8-41b2-80d0-6181987d7df7","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412273791657/An-RAF-Tornado-GR4-return-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"An RAF Tornado GR4 returning to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus","caption":"An RAF Tornado GR4 returning to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.

Photograph: Cpl Neil Bryden/RAF/Mod/Crown Co/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>David Cameron has flown to the RAF base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, from which British pilots are launching air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) targets in Iraq, announcing that he was to send a further two Tornado GR4 planes to supplement the six currently operating.</p> <p>The prime minister also disclosed that, as the Guardian revealed on Thursday, the RAF 2 squadron based in Cyprus is to operate for longer than April next year, the date they were due to be replaced. The decision represents a minor triumph for the air force, which has been arguing about the importance of air power in conflicts in the Middle East.</p> <p>Tornados brought into service in 1991 during the first Gulf war are due to be disbanded by 2019 in a staged process, but some squadrons due to be taken out of service earlier are now to be reprieved.</p> <p>A new class of Eurofighter Typhoon is to replace the current fleet, but the new class is not yet able to load Brimstone missiles effective against small- and medium-sized targets such as Isis vehicles.</p> <p>Britain is believed to be considering whether to help train the moderate Syrian opposition, a plan proposed by former chief of defence staff Lord Richards before he retired last year but previously rejected by ministers.</p> <p>Strengthening Syrian forces allied to the moderate opposition, as well as Iraqi troops, is seen as a vital step towards defeating Isis, and to this end the government is planning to send British troops to train the Iraqi army. It is unclear whether they will be trained in Iraq or neighbouring countries such as Jordan, or the Gulf states.</p> <p>A small number of British military personnel are already on the ground in northern Iraq supporting Kurdish peshmerga.</p> <p>Cameron’s decision to fly to the airbase suggests he believes the campaign is not likely to end soon. He said he had come to Cyprus to thank the pilots personally for the dangerous work they were undertaking, and went on: “Less than a week into combat operations in Iraq, I wanted to come here to thank our troops for the vital work they’re doing to defeat these barbaric Isil terrorists who threaten security not just in Iraq, Syria and the region, but on the streets of Britain too.”</p> <p>The air strikes by US and UK aircraft are understood to have forced a change of behaviour in Isis fighters, who now have much less freedom of movement. However, intelligence gathering on Isis has shown they are extremely well-organised, with their own shura – or councils of elders – regional governors, and welfare networks.</p> <p>Britain currently has seven combat capable air squadrons compared with the 15 the French air force has. The RAF had 30 combat squadrons at the time of the first Gulf war, and for years has been protesting its contribution to military conflicts in uncontested air space is invaluable.</p> <p>The ageing Tornados – some older than 30 years – have flown as many as 30 surveillance operations over Iraq since mid-August, but were only given political clearance to launch air strikes against Isis forces, mainly in northern Iraq, after MPs voted a week ago for the use of force so long as it does not extend to Syria.</p> <p>The RAF has so far launched strikes on four sorties against Isis assets such as pickup trucks, normally on the advice of Kurdish forces on the ground. The planes may be old, but they are equipped with modern radar and infra-red sights capable of giving highly detailed information on targets.</p> <p>Government sources said the dispatch of the extra Tornados did not signify an increase in the tempo of attacks, but was a move to build the overall resilience of the strike force now that it is clear that the air campaign may be a long one. The prime minister added: “Obviously, these operations are just one element of our strategy. We are also working hard to deliver a training package for Iraqi forces with advisers in Iraq now to assess their needs.”</p> <p>The RAF has argued that the precision of the Brimstone missile is unique as it is capable of hitting a car moving at 70mph from seven miles away.</p> <p>RAF Akrotiri is the UK’s Permanent Joint Operating Base that supports ongoing operations in Afghanistan and has been in service 30 years, used as a forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East and for modern radar infrared sights jet training.</p> <p>Cameron has visited Akrotiri before during RAF operations to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya three years ago. As many as 20 Tornados were operating during the Libya campaign where the US took a more backward role and focussed on air surveillance.</p> <p>Britain and Saudi Arabia are the only two countries that operate Brimstones, that are thought to cost £100,000 each.</p> <p>RAF 2 Squadron is normally based at RAF Marham, Norfolk. It has 12 crews based there.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"28","wordcount":"820","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2014-10-02T18:04:33Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-02T19:00:08Z","internalComposerCode":"542d93b1e4b075120190c4ee","internalOctopusCode":"9596728","internalPageCode":"2169047","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:32:47Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-03T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/425a2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"47","internalShortId":"/p/425a2"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/oct/02/tornados-iraq-mission-cameron-visit-cyprus-airbase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/02/tornados-iraq-mission-cameron-visit-cyprus-airbase","webTitle":"More Tornados to join Iraq mission says Cameron on visit to Cyprus airbase","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-02T19:00:08Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2014/oct/02/tornados-iraq-mission-cameron-visit-cyprus-airbase","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2168225","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-f3870f9c-cec0-4ee0-8034-e0da8dd46a27","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/10/1/1412182738545/Isis-conflict-001.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Isis conflict","caption":"A Syrian-Kurdish woman weeps in the south-eastern town of Suruç, Turkey, after crossing the Syrian border.

The mandate, submitted on Tuesday by the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, also allows for foreign troops to transit through Turkey and calls for the establishment of a so-called security zone of up to 20 miles inside neighbouring Syria, in what is being cast as a pivotal moment in a war threatening three countries.</p> <p>But hours from the parliamentary ballot, doubts remained over Ankara’s intent, with some observers and MPs suggesting the proposed mandate merely rubber-stamps an existing policy and has been dressed up to look like a decisive shift. Kurdish groups in Turkey and Syria also accuse the ruling Justice and Development party of wanting to use the buffer zone as a means to occupy Kurdish-Syrian enclaves across the border.</p> <p>Others, however, believe President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is determined to move against Isis, but will do so only if pressure on the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, is also increased.</p> <p>Also central to Turkish calls for a buffer zone is the fate of the tomb of the founder of the Ottoman Empire Osman I, marked as Turkish territory by the 1921 Turkey-France border accord and now protected by Turkish troops on Syrian soil near the town of Manbij.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map of tomb\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1412184244009/Tomb-map.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For the past year, the tomb has been surrounded by Isis forces, who have faced up to about 50 Turkish special forces troops that were deployed more than six months ago when security concerns moved Ankara to recall the comparatively inexperienced conscripts that had been guarding the shrine.</p> <p>While Isis units have not advanced, they have sprayed graffiti over checkpoints leading towards it. In March, Isis warned in an internet message that they would “raze the tomb” but no such attack has since been launched. The tomb of Osman has been a ready barometer of the accommodation reached between Turkey and Isis since it first gained a foothold in Syria and then Iraq.</p> <p>It is also symbol of a relationship now at a crossroads, with Erdoğan suggesting repeatedly in the past week that the country’s military would get directly involved, possibly with ground troops.</p> <p>Kurds on both sides of the border have warned that such a move might imperil the ongoing peace process between the Turkish government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party, with Cemil Bayik, co-chair of the Kurdish political umbrella organisation KCK, saying it would spell the end of the peace efforts.</p> <p>“The [peace] process would be over, war would restart,” Bayik told the Turkish daily Radikal. “Because a buffer zone is directed against us. We cannot negotiate peace with a [state] that tries to take our gains in Rojava (Western Kurdistan – Syria) from us. That would be treachery against our people.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"18","wordcount":"507","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2014-10-01T16:56:44Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-01T17:05:30Z","internalComposerCode":"542c324ce4b0cd82a095e737","internalOctopusCode":"9591969","internalPageCode":"2168225","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-17T08:18:18Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-02T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>For almost nine months after aid worker Alan Henning was kidnapped by Islamic State (Isis) militants, his devastated friends and family remained silent. Strongly advised by the Foreign Office (FCO) not to issue any public appeals, they were forced to keep their grief private. It was, said Al-Fatiha Global, the Islamic relief organisation Henning travelled with to Syria, an “extremely distressing and difficult time compounded with the fact that we could not publicly appeal or discuss the situation openly in order to safeguard the efforts to secure his release.”</p> <p>Only when Henning appeared as a jumpsuit-clad hostage in a propaganda video 10 days ago did his kidnap become public. Until then, said the charity, it had been advised “to keep the matter confidential as part of a media blackout in order to minimise any detriment to his wellbeing and the efforts to secure his release.”</p> <p>Henning’s family in Salford, terrified for his safety, agreed to say nothing in public following his kidnap on 27 December last year. “They are just normal, nine-to-five working people. They’re terrified and thought, ‘well, if the Foreign Office say we shouldn’t say anything then we won’t,’” said a friend of Henning’s, who asked not to be named.</p> <p>He said the family had even been discouraged from attending a vigil on Wednesday night in Bolton, organised by Henning’s friends, the Bolton Interfaith Council and the Bolton Council of Mosques. They wanted to attend, it is understood, but were told it wasn’t worth the risk.</p> <p>Though Henning lived in Eccles, Salford, he had many friends in Bolton. At the vigil, attended by around 100 people of all faith groups, two of Henning’s youngest supporters urged the terrorists to release the man they call “Uncle Gadget” because he is good at fixing things. Ayesha Majid, 11, said: “He is nice, kind and funny. He used to help us pack the ambulances for the convoys.” Aliyah Amir, also 11, said: “Please pray for him, and Uncle Gadget, if you are listening to this, we hope you will return to us safe and sound. Please free Uncle Gadget.”</p> <p>Many members of the congregation, including one baby, were wearing white T-shirts saying “Free Alan ‘Gadget’ Henning”. Prayers were read out, including one by Ibrahim Kala of the Bolton Council of Mosques. He said: “The Holy Qur’an expounds that we as humans are all the same no matter what our colour or background. We become better humans through our actions and our deeds alone. Let it be known that the barbaric actions reported are not commendable actions in Islam and are not supported by us.”</p> <p>A security expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Henning’s wife and two children will have been advised to say nothing even after the video emerged. “I’m sure that Scotland Yard’s hostage negotiation unit, which takes charge in these situations, will have told the family not to. They’ll have said, ‘you’re playing into the terrorists’ hands, you’re giving them the publicity they crave, it’s counterproductive’ and so forth,” said the expert, whose firm has extensive experience in kidnap response. But by Saturday, the 47-year-old’s wife, Barbara, appeared to have had enough. She issued her first statement, via the Foreign Office, saying her husband had gone to Syria as an aid volunteer with his Muslim colleagues: “When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need,” she said. “His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion.”</p> <p>The terrorists responded by sending her an audio file of Henning “pleading for his life”. In a second statement, also released via the FCO, she implored Isis to listen to the Muslim clerics who have made their own video messages telling them that Islam would forbid his murder. “I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear. He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much-needed aid.</p> <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment, and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning was told her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>The BBC had also been asked by the FCO to abide by the blackout relating to Henning’s abduction. Catrin Nye, a reporter for the BBC’s Asian Network, had interviewed Henning last year as he prepared to go on a convoy to Syria, and discovered a week after his kidnap what had happened. The BBC agreed not to go public, only breaking the embargo when Isis posted the video on 14 September.</p> <p>The FCO does not comment on individual kidnap cases, nor discuss the tactics it employs to try to ensure the safe return of Britons abducted abroad. But it is understood that the logic behind media blackouts is that very often when someone is taken, the FCO and police do not know who has taken them, where they have been taken and why, nor what demands may be made for their release.</p> <p>“The logic of a blackout is to give the hostage negotiation unit the freedom to see what they can do, whether to try to rescue the hostage via local sources, or, in more exceptional circumstances, whether to send in the army to get them. They also try to figure out what pressure can be put on the hostage takers to release them,” said the security expert. Given the lack of available information, particularly in the early days, weeks and months following an abduction, it is impossible to assess the possible counterproductive impact of any publicity. That’s why families are strongly advised to stay silent, though there is nothing the FCO can do if they are determined to go public.</p> <p>Consular staff in London are in constant touch with Henning’s family, as well as police liaison officers from Scotland Yard.</p> <p>There is also the fact that modern terrorists such as Isis are media-savvy and will keep close track of any response in the hostage’s home country. Providing a running commentary of what is happening can play right into their hands and improve their bargaining position.</p> <p>In rare circumstances, the FCO may decide that publicity could aid a hostage’s release, and will coordinate that with the family, if they are willing – though most families have no desire to see their loved ones splashed on the front pages of the newspapers unless they believe it is the only thing that could save them.</p> <p>Henning travelled to Syria with Al-Fatiha Global a few days before Christmas last year. The convoy was transporting life-saving medical equipment, including defibrillators, to a hospital in Idlib, in north-western Syria.</p> <p>On Christmas Day he was recorded by friends on the convoy in a fast food restaurant in Turkey, near the Syrian border. In the video, other volunteers praise him for taking part in a convoy delivering aid and so missing Christmas with his family.</p> <p>One says: “He sacrificed, he sacrificed his family, yeah. He could be with his friends and family back home. But he’s on his way right now to deliver ambulances and aid to Syria to help our brothers and sisters. Big respect to this guy.”</p> <p>Henning says: “It’s all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually get to where it needs to go. That makes it all worthwhile. No sacrifice we do is nothing compared to what they go through on a daily basis.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"11","wordcount":"1322","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2014-09-24T19:10:30Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-09-24T19:19:46Z","internalComposerCode":"54231726e4b0890991c42c61","internalOctopusCode":"9563490","internalPageCode":"2164165","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:34:51Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

made a video plea for Islamic State (Isis) to spare the life of British hostage Alan Henning.</p> <p>Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release.</p> <p>The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\" title=\"\">Yazidi minority women</a> in Iraq.</p> <p>In the video released on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\" title=\"\">Faisal begged for Henning’s life</a> and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law.</p> <p>There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics. Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge.</p> <p>In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/race.world\" title=\"\">who was jailed in 2003</a>, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> <p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic … the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> <p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person … Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> <p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday</a> for her husband to be released.</p> <p>Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party.</p> <p>“I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87964392-116d-403d-959d-125c41bfc9c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411554442256/e53ad63e-f201-4996-bf11-b08a17eb2492-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/radical-preachers-isis-islamic-state-online-conference\" title=\"\">the Guardian recorded a live online talk</a> in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said.</p> <p>The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”.</p> <p>He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”.</p> <p>Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNKt1UqDPL4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Video posted by Abdullah el-Faisal calling for the release of British hostage Alan Henning,</figcaption> </figure>","wordcount":"649","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2014-09-24T10:03:29Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-09-24T10:23:34Z","internalComposerCode":"542296f1e4b0d56aeceb070c","internalOctopusCode":"9561209","internalPageCode":"2163688","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-06-14T12:18:05Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4xpvg","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"92","internalShortId":"/p/4xpvg"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/24/radical-cleric-islamic-state-release-british-hostage-alan-henning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/radical-cleric-islamic-state-release-british-hostage-alan-henning","webTitle":"Radical cleric urges Islamic State to release British hostage Alan Henning","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-24T10:23:34Z","sectionName":"World news","sectionId":"world","type":"article","id":"world/2014/sep/24/radical-cleric-islamic-state-release-british-hostage-alan-henning","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"world","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world","editions":[{"id":"world","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":" Abbott warns Australia's Iraq mission will be dangerous and 'quite lengthy' ","lastModified":"2014-10-02T23:00:00Z"}]}}
