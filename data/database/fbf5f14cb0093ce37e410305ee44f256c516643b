He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Missiles are poor law enforcers. They rarely kill the right people. They cause vast destruction, wrecking the lives of civilians and increasing their dependency on their oppressors. Missile attacks are mere displays of power, usually as a spectacular alternative to a ground assault. Their military ineffectiveness makes them susceptible to mission creep.</p> <p>Already Obama has shifted from threatening a &quot;surgical punitive strike&quot; to a massively destructive one, intended to aid the insurgency and thus assist in regime change. This happens to be against international law. More to the point, such missile attacks did not &quot;work&quot; in Serbia, Iraq or Afghanistan. They merely served as a prelude to chaos on the ground and pressure for ground intervention.</p> <p>If Obama means to achieve regime change in Syria he should be ready to invade. Since he lacks the will and the means for this, he is merely heading for a second humiliation. He should back off and deploy diplomacy and humanitarian relief instead. It is not much, but it is better than bombing.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-522da2f5e4b03cba712fa114\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T11:29:09.966+01:00\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>If you've not read it yet, my colleague, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/american-syria-rebels\">Martin Chulov, has sent a fascinating story from the north of Syria</a>, where Islamist militants fighting Assad's forces have something of a mixed reaction to the prospect of US involvement in the conflict:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While Syria's mainstream rebels are enthusiastically welcoming talk of an American attack as a chance to break the stalemate, the jihadist groups among them see things through a very different prism, in which my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend.</p> <p>All across the north, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on a war footing; a rank and file convinced that an old foe is coming their way and that if and when the US air force does attack, they will have little trouble staying out of its way.</p> <p>&quot;There are many among us [who] fought in Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; said a second jihadist, a 26-year-old softly spoken Saudi, who called himself Abu Abid. &quot;Our emir knows how to deal with them.

Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US secretary of state has said that President Bashar al-Assad has one week to hand over his entire stock of chemical weapons to avoid a military attack, but said he had no expectation that the Syrian leader would comply.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry\">John Kerry</a> also said he had no doubt that Assad was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in east Damascus on 21 August, saying that only three people are responsible for the chemical weapons inside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> – Assad himself, one of his brothers and a senior general. He said the entire US intelligence commnity was united in believing Assad was responsible.</p> <p>Kerry was speaking alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\">William Hague</a>, who was forced to deny that he had been pushed to the sidelines by the House of Commons decision 10 days ago to reject the use of UK force in Syria.</p> <p>The US Senate is due to vote this week on whether to approve an attack and Kerry was ambivalent over whether Barack Obama would use his powers to ignore the Senate, if it were to reject an attack.</p> <p>Kerry said the US had tracked the Syrian chemical weapons stock for many years, adding that it &quot;was controlled in a very tight manner by the Assad regime … Bashar al-Assad and his brother Maher al-Assad, and a general are the three people that have the control over the movement and use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>&quot;But under any circumstances, the Assad regime is the Assad regime, and the regime issues orders, and we have regime members giving these instructions and engaging in these preparations with results going directly to President Assad.</p> <p>&quot;We are aware of that so we have no issue here about responsibility. They have a very threatening level of stocks remaining.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-522da110e4b03cba712fa112\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T11:21:04.603+01:00\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In Geneva, the UN's high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has been saying there seems little doubt chemical weapons were used in Syria, while not speculating on who might have used them. She also warned of the dangers of outside military intervention.</p> <p>AP quotes her as telling the UN human rights council:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The use of chemical weapons has long been identified as one of the gravest crimes that can be committed, yet their use in Syria seems now to be in little doubt, even if all the circumstances and responsibilities remain to be clarified...</p> <p>The international community is late, very late to take serious joint action to halt the downward spiral that has gripped Syria, slaughtering its people and destroying its cities.

Kerry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chemical weapons in Syria ... are controlled in very tight manner by the Assad regime.
