        "body":"<p>Dario Franchitti has been hospitalised after a huge accident at the IndyCar Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. The accident, which also injured 14 spectators, comes nearly two years after fellow British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In both accidents the cars went airborne and into the catch fencing.</p><p>Franchitti's Ganassi car caught the back end of Takuma Sato at turn five on the final lap of the race and was sent upwards and slid along the fence before returning to the ground. Both cars scattered debris across the track, and the remaining competitors were forced to weave through the broken equipment under caution, as had been the case two years ago.</p><p>The driver, a three times winner of the Indianapolis 500, was removed from the car and taken to hospital where he has been examined and diagnosed as suffering from concussion, a fractured right ankle and a fractured vertebra. Franchitti will not require surgery, although he will be kept in hospital overnight.</p><p>With positions fixed at the moment of the accident, the race was won by Will Power, who had suffered a broken back in the crash at Las Vegas and admitted it was similar to that incident. \"I just saw Dario's car and him sitting in it with a lot of damage, and yes, that's what it reminded me of,\" Power said. \"I hate seeing that. We try to keep these cars on the ground.\"</p><p>Fellow driver Scott Dixon agreed. \"The smells and the visuals, for me, and even talking to Will, you have the remnants of Vegas popping into your head with you coming around the corner and you can't drive through it because there's a field of debris,\" he said.</p><p>IndyCar is likely to investigate the crash thoroughly since, in the wake of Wheldon's death, extensive efforts were made to reduce the chances of the cars leaving the track and hitting the catch fencing. Wheldon, a two-times Indianapolis 500 winner, had been testing safety features on the designs for the 2012 season before he was killed and when the new chassis was launched it was given the prefix DW in his honour.</p><p>The spectators were believed to have been injured by a piece of the catch fencing that was knocked loose into the nearby grandstand, rather than parts of the car itself.</p><p>A statement from the race promoters read: \"An IndyCar official and IndyCar driver, Dario Franchitti, along with two fans were transferred to an area hospital for evaluation. Eleven fans were additionally evaluated on site.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213562|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7a9d0d37bfb4e5dfd6d77e39fb80b0ddf53e0e1d -->",

        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel cruises to another victory at Korean Grand Prix",
        "body":"<p>At least there was no booing from the fans for Sebastian Vettel on Sunday after he had completed another unruffled trip to the chequered flag. It will certainly not concern him that, well, there were not that many spectators to witness him move to within touching distance of a fourth consecutive world championship. He will be aware that the title will put him among the greats – only Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher have also won four in a row, but the sport might yet be troubled by his dominance, especially if he wraps up the title at the next race in Japan.</p><p>After taking the flag in Yeongam, that he will take the title seems inevitable. He can do it at Suzuka with a victory allied to Fernando Alonso finishing outside the top eight. But if not there, then surely soon. This was his fourth consecutive win and he made a similar charge at a similar time last year, taking four in a row with Singapore, Japan, Korea and India. At the end of that sequence his lead over Alonso was only 13 points – it is now 77.</p><p>When, not if, then and while the team principal, Christian Horner, is not expecting Red Bull to do it in Japan, he is unequivocal in his praise for the champion-in-waiting. Asked whether people might put Vettel in the same bracket as Fangio and Schumacher, he responded: \"Should he win four titles in a row, they will have to.\"</p><p>The \"should\" was politic more than anything as he added that Vettel would, indeed, be alongside the greats. \"He has got to be right up there, he has got to be,\" he said. \"The level that he is performing at is unbelievable in many respects. What has been really impressive is that he has continued to grow and get better as he has gained more experience. To have won the ratio of races he has is remarkable.\"</p><p>That ratio is 34 wins from 115 starts, and character has been crucial, argues Horner. \"He is hugely self-critical,\" he said. \"He is always looking at areas where he can improve. He'll look at this race and look at areas where he could have been stronger. It is that inward-looking [approach] that keeps propelling him forward.\"</p><p>That inexorable motion has put him in an extraordinary position, but while fans may like to see a closer fight it would be churlish to deny his skill. Certainly he has the best car but Mark Webber, who has been pedalling the same Red Bull alongside Vettel for the three championships he has won already, only really came close in 2010.</p><p>Perhaps of more concern is that such dominance can be off-putting. Vettel is not only being mentioned alongside Schumacher in reference to his titles but now also to the period of the latter's pre-eminince when, of his seven world championships, five were won consecutively for Ferrari between 2000 and 2004.</p><p>Indeed Lewis Hamilton, who made another feisty push to only yield a fifth place, noted a comparison between the two German drivers. \"Personally I feel for the fan because I remember the period when Michael Schumacher was winning,\" he said. \"I remember waking up in the morning to watch the start of the race, going back to sleep, and then waking up when it ended, because I already knew what would happen. I am pretty sure a lot of people were doing that today.\"</p><p>Which is a fair comment. There are few fans of any sport who would not prefer to see a nail-biting fight, but part of that equation is the opposition providing the challenge and at the moment they simply cannot match Red Bull.</p><p>Instead tyres have again become a talking point in the dirty air behind Vettel's acceleration to the title, particularly after Sergio Pérez's right-front delaminated mid-race here. Earlier in the weekend Alonso's criticism of the rubber was met cuttingly by Pirelli's Paul Hembery saying: \"I can only suggest he goes to ask the soon-to-be four-times champion how to get the best from the same tyres.\" A remark for which he subsequently apologised.</p><p>But Alonso continued on Sunday,  stating: \"We know the tyres are on the limit in terms of quality.\" To which Webber added: \"Pirelli will put the puncture of Pérez down to a lock-up but the reason the drivers are locking up is because there's no tread left.\"</p><p>Yet Pirelli, which has come in for so much criticism this season, is merely doing what was asked of it, providing rubber offering more stops and more strategy decisions. Indeed, Alonso acknowledged this amid his critique. \"These are tyres that won't last a lap, but as we said on Saturday, we have zero problems with the performance,\" he noted. \"It's us who haven't adapted to these 2012 tyres. It's up to us Ferrari, or the drivers, to improve.\"</p><p>Which is another fair point, certainly to Pirelli. The tyres are, after all, the same for everybody and it is up to the teams to maximise performance. Vettel and Red Bull have done so and that is why they go to Japan with the chance of clinching the championship there, as they did in 2011. But for Vettel, the job in hand remains. \"Our target is to win the championship,\" he said. \"Not to win it in one place in particular.\" The focus that Horner so admires and that has brought his driver to the very fringe of joining an extraordinarily exclusive club.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189456|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7fa6cbb05789d87844109d26db35c76e16473bb5 -->",

        "body":"<p>What might have been a routine victory for Sebastian Vettel was interrupted by two safety car periods in Yeongam but that the German would take his third consecutive win at the Korean Grand Prix, and his eighth of the season, was never really in doubt. He was again completely dominant from the off and although Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean were within five seconds when they followed him home, their proximity was more a factor of the laps run under yellows than raw pace. It leaves Vettel on 272 points in the drivers championship, 77 points ahead of Fernando Alonso, who finished in fifth. </p><p>It had, at least, not been the incident-free procession that looked likely up to the first round of pit stops. Lewis Hamilton, who had started alongside Vettel, was unable to match him from the off and was dropped by the world champion on the opening lap into turn one and was then passed by Grosjean on the long drag down to turn three. Neither could catch Vettel however and he quickly opened up a three second gap to Grosjean. </p><p>Positions remained the same through the stop until McLaren's Sergio Pérez locked and then suffered an explosive right-front tyre delamination on the back straight. It was reminiscent of some of the incidents that caused such concern over tyres and safety in the early part of the season, and which had thought to have been solved when Pirelli changed the structure of the tyre in the wake of the blow outs at Silverstone and then subsequently reverted to the 2012 construction. </p><p>The incident brought the safety car out on lap 32 and Vettel immediately took advantage and dived into the pits. The safety car remained out for five laps leaving 18 laps to the finish. With the medium tyre lasting approximately 18 laps it was unclear whether Vettel and Grosjean would make it to the flag without having to stop again. Hamilton's woes, however, had continued from staying out too long on wearing tyres and having to pit just before the safety car was deployed. </p><p>Any question over whether there would be a fight to the finish on worn rubber however was answered when Adrian Sutil lost it at turn thee. He spun backwards into Mark Webber, who had been moving forcefully through the pack from 13th on the grid. The crash caused an oil fire and brought out the safety car again.</p><p>The three laps the safety car remained on track was enough to ensure Red Bull's grip would last and while Raikkonen passed Grosjean at the restart, Vettel once again opened up a comfortable five second gap, which he maintained to the end. Untroubled and unruffled in a drive he described as \"very smooth\" his march to the championship appears inexorable and he can actually take the title with a win at the next race in Japan if Alonso finishes outside the top eight.</p><p>Hamilton lost a further place to the Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg, who had been performing very strongly all weekend, and took fourth after holding the British driver's late charge in the final laps. Alonso, who had struggled for pace, battled hard for sixth chased by Nico Rosberg who lost time due to his front wing coming loose. </p><p>McLaren's Jenson Button moved up the field to take eighth, followed by Felipe Massa who had clipped his Ferrari team-mate on the opening lap. Alonso escaped fortunately unscathed from the incident but it sent Massa back to 21st. Pérez and Esteban Gutiérrez made up the final points positions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419173427|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c802ae8a93ff79d8903c7cecb33feca7e0cb1051 -->",

        "headline":"Old masters McLaren pay price for taking a turn for the worse",
        "body":"<p>There is a rather beautiful photographic spread in the current issue of the FIA's in-house magazine <em>Auto</em> depicting Bruce McLaren in his M2B, a car built of a balsa and aluminium alloy, quite radical for the time, at the Monaco Grand Prix in 1966 under the headline \"Golden Moment\". It is featured to mark the 50th anniversary the team he founded is celebrating this year but on track 2013 has yet to offer a single golden moment, let alone a reason to celebrate. These are testing times for a team used to being at the sharp end of the Formula One grid.</p><p>Even historical statistics are now lining up to pass judgment. McLaren have scored at least one podium finish in every season since 1980 when Alain Prost and John Watson wrestled with the uncompetitive M29 and M30. The best the team have managed this year was Jenson Button's fifth place in China; his team-mate Sergio Pérez is 10th and Button 11th on the grid for Sunday's Korea Grand Prix. Only five races remain afterwards and so that unattractive landmark from 33 years ago looks dangerously close to being repeated.</p><p>None of which, of course, has gone unnoticed by the team who have endured fierce scrutiny and considerable criticism in an anniversary that has become an <em>annus horribilis</em>. Much of it stems from the team's decision to design an entirely new car for this season rather than evolve last year's which had finished strongly. \"From finishing last year with the quickest car to work hard over the winter and have a car that was not performing was disappointing, which is probably an understatement,\" admitted Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's principal.</p><p>To an extent, however, as Whitmarsh points out, the decision on the new car had already been made before that late surge. \"We started last year strongly,\" he said. \"Mid-year we were fighting with others and that was about the time when we chose the specification of this year's car. Then, during the end of last year, development went quite well, the car was the strongest in the last races but by that time we had to make a commitment to specification of this year's car. If you were making that decision at the end of the year, it might have been different because we had a very strong car.\"</p><p>Equally, with the choice made there is also the attraction to the racer's instinct of the promise of a new machine but which always also holds the chance that it can go wrong. \"There's always a natural optimism, enthusiasm and passion for what you are doing so a number of fresh and new concepts were incorporated in this year's car,\" said Whitmarsh. \"You believe in them. You believe in them when you did them and you tend to believe in them until you are proven wrong.\"</p><p>Which they were, but none of which hindsight-based analysis offers any consolation to the team or its leader. \"I can rationalise it, I can understand it, but it doesn't make it any easier,\" he admitted.</p><p>There is, nonetheless, no sense of panic at McLaren: this is a team who have won 12 drivers' championships and 182 races and endured tough times before, coming through the winless and pole-less period of 1994-1996 with the Adrian Newey-designed championship-winning MP4/13 of 1998; lessons learned from longevity that have not been lost.</p><p>\"You can't have a strong year every year, unfortunately,\" said Whitmarsh. \"But people do expect it, don't they? We have no right to be there. The fact is there are 11 teams here who have every right and the ambition to be on the podium and winning races.\"</p><p>His problem is McLaren are expected to be winning by the fans and by themselves; there is no right but in a team of such pedigree there will always be expectation. Looking ahead – which began some time ago, with resources long shifted in favour of development of the 2014 car – he believes this experience will only spur on greater efforts. \"In my experience motivation in a race team is easier to maintain in adversity than it is in success because people become complacent in success,\" he said. \"And in a team like this there is a big motivation to come back and fight strongly next year.\"</p><p></p><p>Watson, who would go on to win four grands prix for the team after 1980, believes to fight strongly there must be a focal point of leadership. \"I went to the 50th anniversary dinner a month ago,\" he said. \"The loyalty among people who were there from 50 years ago to the present day is almost unique in Formula One but there is something this year the company has failed to do.</p><p>\"Nobody in the team is allowed to be bigger than the team itself, which has worked in the past but right now I think they need one person who can drive and motivate and generate the ability of the people, and there <em>are</em> many outstanding people there. I think they need that one Adrian Newey-style person.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/11/sebastian-vettel-italian-grand-prix\" title=\"\">Newey is, as Whitmarsh has previously pointed out, a \"scarce resource\"</a>  and insists the team are making changes but he is tight-lipped on the detail in terms of personnel. \"We've been recruiting in the technical team,\" he said. \"There are some yet unannounced that will be headline-grabbing when they are announced.\" He is also optimistic that with the new powertrains likely to be crucial next year, Mercedes will deliver one of the best on the grid, before the team renews their partnership with Honda in 2015.</p><p>The rule changes will level the playing field for everybody, making predictions, let alone guarantees of success, extremely difficult but certainly McLaren now need no further incentives. \"It's been a kick up the backside for the team,\" he admits. The usual result of which is, fittingly, to propel one forward, which Whitmarsh knows is the very essence of racing. \"Even good years, you quickly forget, that's the nature of Formula One. It always amazes me how, even if it has just won for you, the old car is quickly forgotten, it's a very focusing sport. You don't dwell on the past.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419138348|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9cd649fee7884fa541e8248d618731f434c65ccf -->",

        "headline":"McLaren could afford Fernando Alonso in 2014 despite loss, team say",
        "body":"<p>McLaren would be \"delighted\" to welcome back Fernando Alonso and, in the wake of the news that the team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mclaren-f1-team-group-loss-2012\" title=\"\">had made £2.5m pre-tax loss last year</a>, said that they could afford to put the Ferrari driver back in one of their cars.</p><p>The McLaren Group losses were partly due to salary costs for the drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton alongside additional race and wind tunnel costs, amounting to a £6m loss from the racing part of the business but also largely due to the end of their commercial deal with Daimler. McLaren made a £19.7m pre‑tax profit in 2011.</p><p>However, Martin Whitmarsh, the team principal, is unequivocal that this would not prevent McLaren from hiring Alonso, who spent one difficult year with McLaren, alongside Lewis Hamilton in 2007. \"We could afford to bring Alonso here next year,\" he confirmed. \"In all probability for 2014 the die is set but who knows in the future. I shouldn't be stoking wild rumours of his return in 2014 but would we welcome him back, be delighted to have him back in the team? Of course we would.\"</p><p>The subject has been under discussion since the Singapore Grand Prix when Whitmarsh said that any of the teams would want Alonso and McLaren's managing director, Jonathan Neale, noted that there was \"a lot going on behind the scenes. We want a strong driver lineup\".</p><p>Alonso's firm response – \"I repeat it more or less every weekend and I keep repeating it – I love Ferrari and I will stay at Ferrari until the end\" – certainly suggests there is little to no chance of him moving for 2014 but Whitmarsh was keen to leave the door open, adding: \"We would love to have him back.\"</p><p>The team are unlikely to finish better than fifth in the constructors' championship this year, meaning their revenue from the sport will be down, but Whitmarsh insists that: \"We have great financial security and fiscal strength. We have changed our relationship with Daimler, which has made a big difference but it's clear that in the future we have a strong partnership ahead of us which puts us in a good position.\"</p><p>On the track, Sebastian Vettel starts Sunday's race from pole, after a dominant performance in qualifying, setting the fastest time in Q3 with his first run. He was two-tenths ahead of Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton and Mark Webber was third but will start in 13th after a 10-place grid penalty.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419139980|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f571abb053b65043620ad68634b43b3c93423e8a -->",

        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel qualified his Red Bull on pole for Sunday's Korean Grand Prix at the Yeongam circuit, his early pace in the final session so good he was able to cruise in at the end of Q3, without setting a second time. Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes joins him on the front row, the fifth time the pair have shared the slots this season, with Mark Webber in third but he will receive a 10-place grid penalty moving him to 13th.</p><p></p><p>It is the German's sixth pole of the season, and his fourth in a row as Red Bull continue their current dominance. Indeed, earlier in the week the team were batting away speculation that their car may be breaking the rules, especially after Vettel's performance at the last race in Singapore but here they simply reconfirmed that the other teams are merely playing catch-up.</p><p>He had also been quickest in the morning's final practice session after Hamilton topped both Friday's runs and now starts from the best possible position on a circuit that is tricky for overtaking, although the rain predicted for the afternoon may yet play a role and Vettel's rivals will be hoping for anything that might bring them closer to him.</p><p></p><p>Vettel, running on the option super-soft tyres, led the opening of Q3 with a time of 1.37.202, two-tenths clear of team-mate Mark Webber and then the German went out last, the best position from which to watch his opponents for the final quick lap and they could not oust him. Despite moving up a position on his second run, Hamilton could come no closer than two-tenths to Vettel, whose time remained the quickest as he saved his tyres and cruised into the pits at the end of the lap.</p><p></p><p>Webber will start the race in 13th place after he was penalised with a 10-place grid penalty after receiving his third reprimand of the season when he hitched a lift back to the pits on Fernando Alonso's car at the end of the Singapore Grand Prix. It puts Roman Grosjean in the Lotus in third, Nico Rosberg in fourth; Fernando Alonso in fifth; Felipe Massa in sixth; Nico Hulkenberg in seventh; Esteban Gutiérrez in eighth; Kimi Raikkonen in ninth and Sergio Pérez up in to the 10th.</p><p></p><p>McLaren's Jenson Button and his team-mate Pérez went out in Q2, in 12th and 11th spots respectively, with Button suggesting on his radio that he had been held up at the end of his final hot lap by one of the two Lotus cars. \"We got screwed a little by the Lotus, I don't know which one, at the end of the lap,\" he said. A driver his team subsequently identified as Raikkonen. \"It's been tricky behind traffic all day,\" he said afterwards. \"It's a pity, I think we lost about a tenth and a half, which would have put us through.\" Vettel topped the timing at the end of the session from Hamilton, Webber and Hulkenberg with Alonso pushing to make fifth.</p><p></p><p>Raikkonen, led Q1 from Rosberg and Hulkenberg but there was disappointment for Williams, who had brought upgrades to the race and were optimistic about making moves forward. However, they were unable to translate them into an improvement in pace and were knocked out ahead of both Caterhams and then the two Marussia cars.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419127226|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e9d252294578a3cbe84320b099d89040df5a91d4 -->",

        "headline":"Korean Grand Prix hit by empty stands as future of race is discussed",
        "body":"<p>Practice attendances are generally not particularly high and the stands in Korea, which attracted a sparse dotting of spectators in Yeongam on Friday, were never going to be packed with the 80,000 fans seen at Silverstone this year. But those are figures this circuit will not equal, even on race day. Largely unloved, it seems, in Korea and possibly now unwanted, the future of the Korean Grand Prix remains in doubt before this weekend's race.</p><p>The circuit remains listed as a provisional date on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/27/new-jersey-mexico-f1-2014\" title=\"\">an already packed 2014 calendar which currently includes 22 races</a> and has yet to negotiate a return next year with Bernie Ecclestone. Ironically the track is popular with many drivers because of its grippy surface and the lack of sponsor-based work they have to do here, with the sunshine and pleasing scenery adding to the mix.</p><p>But the lack of fan support is an issue. The swathes of empty grandstands that could happily seat thousands are noticeable, with Lewis Hamilton rather cuttingly observing: \"You just have to try and draw inspiration from the empty seats. They could at least put cardboard cut-outs of people in there, so you could look out at them …\"</p><p>His former team-mate Jenson Button also bemoaned the lack of support for the venue, which is three-and-a-half hours from Seoul. \"It's always sad when there are no fans at a race because they make for the atmosphere,\" he said. \"The sport wouldn't exist if it wasn't for them.\"</p><p>Now in its fourth year, the race's location is not enough alone to explain the relatively poor numbers that attend. Spa is a four to five-hour drive from Calais – and Le Mans even further – yet British and other European fans attend both events in their thousands. Quite why Formula One has yet to take any grip on the consciousness of the Korean public and whether it will in future is something the organisers will be asking while looking to renew their contract.</p><p>Equally, the sheer number of proposed races on next year's calendar may yet pose a threat to the race continuing. The man responsible for the logistics of shifting Ferrari's equipment across the globe, the team manager, Massimo Rivola, said in reference to the currently proposed triumvirate of races at Monaco, New Jersey and Montreal, with only one week between each, that: \"It's going to be almost impossible to do it. To be honest, I'm still hoping we come back to the 20 races as per the current sporting regulation. At the moment the calendar is not the best calendar possible, in terms of logistics.\"</p><p>The future, then, is undecided but for this year, in Friday practice it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/04/lewis-hamilton-korean-grand-prix\" title=\"\">Hamilton who topped the timesheets in both sessions</a>, with Sebastian Vettel taking the second-place slots. After the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, had refuted speculation that their car is enjoying some form of illegal advantage in the wake of Vettel's dominant win in Singapore, stating on Thursday that: \"Any suggestion of traction control is purely either mischievous on behalf of the others, or wishful thinking\", Vettel himself was happy to be mischievous after practice, quipping that he expected the pace to improve: \"Once the traction control is switched on\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419115457|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|70abcac7aaa8cbc62755fb2655a89e74c547bd7a -->",

        "body":"<p>There is little sentimentality in Formula One at the best of times. The sport is a distant relative of that from the days when teams operated out of garages on a shoestring and funding often existed in inverse proportion to enthusiasm. Yet that bygone spirit remains imprinted in the DNA of the Williams team and literally so in its founder's closest relative, Claire Williams, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/27/claire-williams-deputy-principal-formula-one\" title=\"\">who became deputy team principal this year</a>. But, well, there is little room for sentimentality and her baptism has been one of fire that has resulted in the team struggling painfully to build on the signs of promise from last season.</p><p>The story of her father, Sir Frank Williams, is well known – the humble beginnings of the team in the mid-1960s, doing business from a phone booth, what he described as \"hard work and hand-to-mouth stuff\", to the extraordinary highs of nine constructors' crowns and seven drivers' titles in the 80s and 90s and the lows of the tragic deaths of Piers Courage and Ayrton Senna. Through it all, even after the car accident that left him paralysed, Sir Frank was the team's rock. Now Claire is alongside him, poised to secure his long-term legacy.</p><p>The 37-year-old joined the team in 2002 as a communication officer and this year has combined her work as commercial director with becoming deputy team principal. Alongside the huge workload of combining two jobs (she will not be at this weekend's Korean Grand Prix after pursuing commercial imperatives across the world), Williams already bears a difficult responsibility. A victory in Spain last year was their first since 2004 and this season they have only one point. While these days no team can exist from hand to mouth, she is nonetheless determined there will be no shortage of hard work. \"I like a challenge and I've always been brought up to believe that you have to fight for what you want in life,\" she says. \"Success doesn't come easy, winning races is difficult. If I had just been handed that role with a winning race car, where's the fun in that? Frank fought from nowhere and I believe when success does come it will be even better because you've fought hard for it.\"</p><p>A palpable enthusiasm, tinged with determination, is marked by her business-like references to her father by his name. \"When I started at Williams 12 years ago, I made a conscious decision to call him Frank in the office. You want to be professional and you want to be seen as your own person at work.\" Which illustrates how keen she was to succeed within the team her father had originally opposed her joining, at the minor cost of occasional lost familial traits. \"Sometimes I forget and I call him Frank by mistake when I've not switched into home mode and my mother used to tell me off a lot. But when we're together, by ourselves or when we are at home he is definitely 'Dad'.\"</p><p>It is this combination of professionalism and closeness that makes Williams F1 a family affair that is unique to the grid and one of the team's key strengths. \"We are listed on the Stock Exchange but the majority and controlling shareholder is Frank,\" she says. \"Because of that, Williams and the Williams family is a big part of who we are. That's what a lot of people recognise us for – being a very family-orientated, welcoming team. That's one of the reasons I was put in to the deputy principal role – in order to maintain that into the future.\"</p><p>Which to a certain extent is job done. The more serious issue facing Williams, however, is returning the team to competing at the sharp end of the grid but her first day in the new job could not have been more testing. \"We did think last year we were making inroads but unfortunately when we got to Australia this year we were slightly stunned with our performance. Even in the final test in Spain we were thinking, what's going on?\" she says of the sluggard opening to the season.</p><p>Which meant she was in at the deep end in one of the hardest gigs in F1, dealing with a recalcitrant car. \"We had to very quickly regroup and decide what we were going to do because it was at the point where if we had allowed it to continue we would have been in big trouble.</p><p>\"Of course it's difficult but it's difficult for everybody in the team and you don't think about that, you just focus completely on what you can do to make the changes that you need to in order to turn it around. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom before you get clear sight of what you need to do and I think that's what happened,\" she says.</p><p>The focus now, as with other teams such as McLaren, is firmly on next year's car. \"We can move it forward,\" she insists. \"It's just so painful to see, you go to every race weekend and you see everyone making all the effort and then to come away with no reward is excruciating for everybody.\"</p><p>Yet this is a pain borne with the stoicism that has helped ensure she has reached such an elevated position, pointing out: \"We are fighters at Williams, so we'll keep fighting. Going racing is brilliant and we're still there. For an independent team like Williams that has had to fight for its survival every single year, getting sponsorship dollars to keep us racing, it's no mean feat to have achieved what we have achieved.\"</p><p>Which is the essence of the Williams spirit – and 36 years on it is as strong as ever. \"I believe that you fight for your own successes, in whatever small way or big way that is,\" she says. \"Of course that's a personal perspective, I'd love the team to be really successful at the moment but if this is the way that it's got to be, this is the way it's got to be. When you're faced with a challenge you work even harder or you just buckle.\" Don't expect anyone to be walking away from this fight.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419102568|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|1ee5815f0cd0c3c5d0f351ed758074ed1b5f3e21 -->",

        "headline":"Lewis Hamilton on the double in practice for Korean Grand Prix",
        "body":"<p>Lewis Hamilton completed a practice double ahead of the Korean Grand Prix to raise his hopes of winning another race this season.</p><p>After setting the fastest lap in the opening session around the Korea International Circuit on the medium-compound tyres, Hamilton repeated the trick in the second 90-minute run on the supersofts. On both occasions Hamilton had Sebastian Vettel in close attendance, suggesting the battle for pole position in qualifying will again be between the duo.</p><p>From 13 races so far this year only three drivers have sat on pole, with Hamilton and Vettel taking five apiece, with the former's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg claiming the other three. Hamilton seemingly has the edge on this occasion, with his best lap of the day 1min 38.673sec, finishing 0.108sec ahead of Red Bull's triple world champion Vettel.</p><p>With the Briton 91 points behind Vettel in the championship standings and seemingly out of the title race, Hamilton has made it his mission to win at least one more event this season to add to his lone success in Hungary. At least Hamilton ended Vettel's domination of Fridays because for the first time in six grands prix the latter had to content himself with being second best at the end of the opening two sessions.</p><p>Certainly, it appears to be a Mercedes versus Red Bull contest as the top four in both sessions came from the two teams. The only change in the order from practice one to practice two saw Rosberg move ahead of Mark Webber as third quickest, the German 0.124sec off the pace and the Australian 0.171sec down.</p><p>The best of the rest was Ferrari's Felipe Massa, just under half a second behind Hamilton, followed closely by Lotus' Romain Grosjean. The duo's more experienced team-mates, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, were seventh and eighth.</p><p>Alonso, 60 points adrift of Vettel in the title race, will again be feeling a vast improvement is required if he is to have any hope of challenging the German in the race.</p><p>As for Raikkonen, he at least managed to get back out on track after giving his mechanics a tough lunch break by crunching into a tyre wall in the final minute of the first session. After losing control of his car in the final corner, locking up and sliding sideways into the barrier, with typical Raikkonen understatement he radioed back to the team: \"I hit a wall!\"</p><p>Jenson Button and Adrian Sutil completed the top 10, with the latter's Force India team-mate Paul di Resta 11th. Di Resta sat out the opening session in favour of the reserve James Calado, but despite missing out on track time, the Scot managed to finish one thousandth of a second behind Sutil, and 1.334sec behind Hamilton.</p><p>Britains's Max Chilton brought up the rear, finishing just under five seconds off the pace in his Marussia.</p><p>For the sprinkling of fans in the predominantly empty grandstands, they were treated at the start of FP1 and end of FP2 by displays from the Korean Air Force.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419045374|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|e4b6ededea3c92c2d6db5758eb8ea0008253965f -->",

Plans drawn up for the event, due to be unveiled on Thursday night, suggest it would be watched by 120,000 people in grandstands along a three-mile route and attract a global television audience in the tens of millions, generating as much as £100m for London's economy.</p><p>Ecclestone said the popularity of the event meant it would pay for itself. \"With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the OK and everything was fine, I think we could do that,\" he told the Times. \"Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic, good for London, good for England – a lot better than the Olympics.\"</p><p>The plans come at a time when governments around the world are queuing up to buy the rights to stage a grand prix for up to £30m per race.</p><p>Global design practice Populous study has examined the feasibility of staging a London Grand Prix.

        "body":"<p>Human rights activists fear further bloodshed and a violent crackdown by authorities in Bahrain after race organisers gave the green light to next weekend's Formula One grand prix in the troubled Gulf kingdom.</p><p>As the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) said it was satisfied that all proper security measures were in place for the race on 22 April, Nabeel Rajab, from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), said: \"I'm afraid we might see local people who will be killed in the coming days because of the F1.\"</p><p>Anti-government protesters have called for the event to be cancelled, arguing that it lends legitimacy to a regime which continues to perpetrate human rights abuses.</p><p>The FIA, the sport's governing authority, confirmed  that it would go ahead, with beefed-up security, after receiving reassurances.</p><p>John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of the Met who is in Bahrain advising on police reform, wrote to the FIA president, Jean Todt, to say he felt safer living in Bahrain \"than I have often felt in London\".</p><p>Bernie Ecclestone, 81, the F1 supremo, speaking at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, said of Bahrain: \"I know people who live there, and it's all very quiet and peaceful.\"</p><p>The comments provoked a storm on social media sites as local activists said there were fears of a clampdown on protesters to prevent disruption to the event.</p><p>Pictures emerged of Ecclestone's image being burned in Bahrain posted on a Facebook page called \"Pearl Family Circle – Martyrs' Square\".</p><p>Protests by members of the majority Shia against the Sunni government of the Al-Khalifa royal family take place on an almost daily basis, mostly confined to villages away from the capital where groups have clashed with police using water cannon, teargas, stun grenades and plastic bullets.</p><p>Activists say there have been more than 70 deaths, 20 from teargas suffocation, since February 2011, when the Bahrain uprising began, with an estimated 600 \"political prisoners\" currently detained.</p><p>Civil unrest has escalated in recent weeks, in part due to concerns for the health of imprisoned activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, now 65 days into a hunger strike, being held in a military hospital.</p><p>On Monday, seven policemen were wounded by a homemade bomb outside the capital in what the interior ministry called an \"act of terrorism\", and an explosion in Manama on Thursday night damaged two cars.</p><p>The funeral of Ahmed Ismaeel, 22, described as a citizen journalist by activists, who was shot by a drive-by gunman, was reportedly attended by thousands.</p><p>A planned protest outside the British embassy today by a group calling itself the February 14 Youth Coalition, named after the date of the beginning of the uprising, may also raise tensions.</p><p>A BCHR report said an average of 15 villages were teargassed as collective punishment every night as the Shia majority continue to oppose the Sunni monarchy and call for the implementation of reforms</p><p>\"We are very concerned for our safety. The FIA have got security companies and bullet-proof cars for their drivers and F1 teams,\" said Dr Ala'a Shehabi, a British-born Bahraini academic and activist. \"Who's going to be protecting the Bahrainis who are going to be locked up in their villages, and prevented from protesting, given that they are going to be extremely angry and provoked by the F1?</p><p>\"There's going to be popping champagne corks, live concerts and parties, in the middle of the island, which is a huge provocation to the families of victims who have been killed, and those of hundreds of political prisoners.\"</p><p>She said the comments by Yates had made people very angry. \"To say everything is fine and dandy. Of course it is. The guy's living in his compound, earning a salary that's more than he ever used to dream of in the UK, loving the weather and thinking: 'This is great, why are people even on the streets protesting?\"</p><p>\"And I'm even more surprised at Ecclestone's remark. Because I've spoken to him. He knows about my own personal case, and how my husband was tortured, ambushed, kidnapped, subjected to a military trial and in jail for 10 months.\"</p><p>The BCHR said it had received reports of injuries caused by birdshot allegedly fired by police in villages on Thursday night. \"All the villages in Bahrain last night were turbulent. They are protesting against the F1, and the government wants to hide that from the media,\" said Rajab. \"That's the reality of Bahrain now.\"</p><p>The Guardian was unable to verify Rajab's claims.</p><p>There have been reprisals by groups loyal to the ruling royal family. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IRrsOdhrssc#!\" title=\"\">video posted on YouTube</a> purports to show Bahraini police officers doing nothing as a Shia-owned supermarket was looted  earlier this week, and was condemned by the human rights group Bahrainwatch as demonstrating \"the continuing culture of impunity among the country's security forces, despite claims of reform by the government\".</p><p>Amnesty International, in advance of the publication on Tuesday of its report \"Flawed Reforms, Bahrain fails to achive justice for protesters\", said: \"Holding the grand prix in Bahrain in 2012 risks being interpreted by the government of Bahrain as symbolising a return to business as usual.</p><p>\"The international community must not turn a blind eye to the ongoing human rights crisis in the country.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388678455|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|cd24b8303d481b6918b1068d45132b16aa3bebdf -->",

        "headline":"Chris Lawrence obituary",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.lawrence-tune.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Lawrence</a>, who has died of cancer aged 78, was a development engineer and racing driver who won more than 100 races. His prowess as a tuner of engines helped revive the fortunes of the Morgan sports car in 1962, when his famous Plus 4 racer won its class in the Le Mans 24-hour race at an average speed of 94mph. He masterminded Morgan's return to Le Mans in 2002 and 2004 with the Aero 8 sports car, his last major project.</p><p>Born in Slough, Berkshire, Chris was the only child of William Lawrence and Joan Sanderson. He inherited an affinity for golf and motorcycles from his father. A naval tradition within the family dictated that he went to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon, aged 17, and he gained a degree in engineering on HMS Thunderer.</p><p>He had already progressed from motorcycles to his first Morgan, a three-wheeler with no reverse gear that he persuaded his mother to buy for him. In 1952, Chris competed in his first event, in an elderly 750cc MG special. On leaving the navy, he moved on to a works trial MG that he assembled from parts. Later this morphed into the Rotacks MG on a new chassis, built in a cellar in Swiss Cottage, north-west London. When it became obvious that it was too big to emerge from the cellar in one piece, it had to be disassembled and rebuilt in the street. This glass-fibre-bodied MG special made more demands on Chris's driving and his burgeoning engineering ingenuity, but was not sufficiently competitive to get him a win.</p><p>The turning point was the acquisition, in 1958, of a used Morgan Plus 4, registered TOK 258, for £650. Teaching himself the theory and practice of camshaft profiles, combustion chamber design and \"squish\" area, Chris gradually increased the power output of the Morgan's humble two-litre Triumph TR2 engine (originally designed for the Ferguson tractor) from 95bhp to 156bhp. It was in this form that it won the two-litre class at Le Mans in 1962 as an official Morgan factory entry.</p><p>By then Chris had formed Lawrence Tune, based in Acton, west London, where he built his own Deep Sanderson cars – which raced at Le Mans in 1963 and 1968 – and tuned Triumph engines for customers. He raced in Britain and Europe most weekends. There was a brief foray into Formula 1 in the new three-litre formula in 1966 with a Ferrari-engined Cooper and a twin Mini-engined Deep Sanderson, but it was the Monica project, an exotic luxury saloon car built for a French industrialist, Jean Tastevin, that would come to define the second half of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s for Chris.</p><p>Chris designed the entire car, which was named after the patron's wife, Monique. The convoluted development process generated 25 prototypes as the Monica's luxury ambitions and weight increased. Chris, creating the car with his team in a large railway arch in Chiswick, made frequent trips to France, squabbling with Tastevin's French engineers as tensions grew about the Monica being \"too English\".</p><p>The finished Monica of 1974 was a graceful, refined and sophisticated 150mph vehicle and a remarkable effort for a man who had very little experience of luxury road cars. Its only true shortcoming was mistiming; in the wake of the oil crisis, the market for thirsty, expensive cars had collapsed; in the end, only 10 true Monica production cars were built in France. Bernie Ecclestone, then a car dealer, bought the last three at less than half-price.</p><p>Chris escaped the economic gloom of mid-70s Britain for California, where he set up Lawrence Tune West, preparing English classic sports cars for historic racing events. The California adventure lasted 15 years. In his autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/unclassified/9781900113045/morgan-maverick\" title=\"\">Morgan Maverick</a> (2008), he was candid about the colourful deals and unhappy customers he left behind as a result of the collapse of the old car market and his own sometimes poor business sense.</p><p>Back in the UK, in the early 90s, he began working for the Wiltshire sports car firm Marcos, and managed and engineered an assault on Le Mans in 1995 with a team of LM600 cars before taking a job with Morgan. He regarded the development of the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1971479,00.html\" title=\"\">Aero 8 Morgan</a> as the greatest achievement of his engineering life and was creating a second Le Mans version of the car for 2004 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2003. He settled down to retirement in Herefordshire the following year and swapped the Aero 8 that Charles Morgan, the company's managing director, had given to him as a retirement present for a brown Monica registered KUM 999.</p><p>It was at around this time that I first got to know Chris. Although a seemingly curt and blustery character, he was extremely kind and helpful, and more than happy to find some rare parts for my Monica through his many French contacts. His achievements were recognised at a tribute day at Goodwood Motor Circuit in 2005.</p><p>Chris is survived by his third wife, Carrie, and two sons, Gordon and Steve, from his first marriage. A daughter, Joanna, predeceased him.</p><p>• Christopher John Lawrence, racing driver and car designer, born 27 July 1933; died 13 August 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/379181346|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|87cffb7e63619dd0046952462b72a8c18017c6e3 -->",

        "body":"<p>William Boddy, who has died aged 98, was the editor of <a href=\"http://www.motorsportmagazine.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Motor Sport</a> magazine from 1936 to 1991. His career spanned 81 years in total; he wrote his first piece for Motor Sport in 1930 and filed his final column for the magazine a week before he died, still working on a typewriter and making copious handwritten corrections to his copy.</p><p>Boddy – known as Bill, or as \"WB\" to generations of devoted readers – was possibly the longest-serving working journalist in Britain, and probably the most important single figure in the development of the vintage and classic car movement in Britain. He championed the cause of older vehicles through Motor Sport's pages when few seemed to be interested during the new car boom of the 1950s and 60s.</p><p>Boddy loved Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey, the world's first purpose-built motor-racing circuit, which he first visited as a boy in 1926. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of its history that was unsurpassed. His first article for Motor Sport was on the history of the circuit and he later wrote the definitive book on the subject. As early as 1934, he organised an event there for historic Edwardian racers. When the track was declared an industrial area in 1946, Boddy formed the <a href=\"http://www.brooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Brooklands Society</a>, which helped ensure that original buildings and the surviving parts of the track became listed.</p><p>Boddy was born in London. His father was killed in the first world war. On childhood holidays in Wales he had the opportunity to ride in limousines belonging to a wealthy relative, promoting his interest in motoring. He always loved facts and details and as a schoolboy in the 20s wrote endlessly to the motoring periodicals of the time pointing out mistakes. He even managed to get himself, aged 14, a 100mph demonstration ride in a new Mercedes. His first editorial position – after a brief stint as an assistant in a motorcycle shop – was on Brooklands Track and Air magazine, for which he wrote road tests, despite not yet having a driving licence: he wrote the tests by observing the cars' responses from the passenger seat.</p><p>After going freelance in the mid-30s, Boddy did most of his work for Motor Sport, a 10-year-old title that was rapidly going bankrupt. He was owed so much money when the magazine was taken over by the eccentric Wesley J Tee in 1936 that the new publisher promised to make the 23-year-old editor as long as he kept away from the creditors' meeting. Usually on the end of a telephone, Boddy somehow managed to keep the title going in his spare time throughout the second world war while working in the RAF, despite the fact that there was no motor racing or new cars to report on.</p><p>In the 50s and 60s, Boddy built up Motor Sport, with its distinctive green front cover, into an influential title despite having no particular plan. \"I  just thought I'd write about anything  that interested me,\" he explained \"Readers seemed to like it.\" The tradition of using only initials rather than authors' bylines was maintained on the insistence of Tee, who owned the title until his death in 1996.</p><p>Decades before there were dedicated classic car magazines, Motor Sport was a monthly bible for enthusiasts, stuffed with adverts for ageing exotica that could be bought for a few hundred pounds. But it was also the most influential magazine of its type in Europe, and the place to read about motor racing and new cars. Boddy wrote extremely frank road tests of the latest models that sometimes got him into trouble with several manufacturers. He also covered general motoring issues, most memorably campaigning against the introduction of the 70mph national speed limit in the 1960s. He was not afraid of unpopular causes and was a lone but prophetic voice championing the cause of the VW Beetle amid the anti-German atmosphere of the 50s.</p><p>Boddy went on 39 London-to-Brighton veteran car runs; helped form the <a href=\"http://www.750motorclubbrooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">750 Motor Club</a>, promoting low-cost motor sport for Austin Seven drivers; was a founder member of the <a href=\"http://www.vscc.co.uk/vsccweb/\" title=\"\">Vintage Sports-Car Club</a>; and promoted the 500cc racing movement, a low-budget form of motor sport which lead to Britain's domination of Formula 1. He was appointed MBE for services to sports journalism in 1997.</p><p>He married Winifred Holbrook in 1944. She died in 1998. Their three daughters survive him.</p><p>• William Charles Boddy, journalist, born 22 February 1913; died 7 July 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/378125666|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f037f96a3da6c8fb4329ca2e9eca1f6b43a048b6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel showed all the other Formula One drivers what they have to beat this season when he put in a stunning lap to grab his 16th pole position for Sunday's Australian grand prix.</p><p>\"We were not too slow,\" he said, with masterful understatement. \"We have done the first step. But we have zero points and it will be a long season.\"</p><p>There was a gasp of amazement in Albert Park as world champion Vettel, who had been fastest in Q1 and Q2, then dominated Q3 with a run which was 0.8 seconds faster than second placed Lewis Hamilton. And Vettel didn't even use reintroduced Kers system, which might have cut another half second to his time.</p><p>\"I was surprised by how well the tyres worked today - I had a good feeling with them,\" he said, modestly. But despite the German's domination there was still good news for Hamilton, who split the Red Bulls of Vettel and local hero Mark Webber to secure a front row place.</p><p>After looking hopelessly off the pace in testing in Barcelona earlier this month it was an heroic drive by the McLaren driver. His team-mate Jenson Button was fourth, ahead of Fernando Alonso, with the Lotus Renault of Vitaly Petrov sixth. But there was also room for the smaller teams in Q3, with Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) and Sebastien Buemi making it into the top 10.</p><p>Hamilton said afterwards: \"It's been a fantastic, superb effort by the team and there has been a huge improvement in the car. I never said it was a bad car but there was an issue with downforce.\"</p><p>But Vettel was the drive they were all talking about in Melbourne. Last year he won the world championship, to become the youngest ever driver, despite bad lack and a few errors made out of a lack of experience.</p><p>With more experience and a more reliable car he could prove unstoppable. But judging by the way he drove yesterday Hamilton just isn't in the mood to let that happen. And there is still much more to come from Webber.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/373053622|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|d31cf253f6eaf0499138e067eb61294a88dbc846 -->",

        "headline":"Surgeons fight to save the hand of Formula One star Robert Kubica",
        "body":"<p>The career of one of the most promising young Formula One drivers was hanging in the balance tonight after an accident in a low-key rally in Italy left him badly injured and having surgery to try to save the use of his right hand.</p><p>Robert Kubica, 26, who drives for the Renault team, was competing in a Skoda Fabia on the Ronde di Andora when he suffered a high-speed crash into a church wall and then a barrier shortly after the start. It took rescue crews more than an hour to extract Kubica from the wreckage. Unconfirmed reports from the scene suggest that part of the barrier speared through the car's footwell into the cockpit.</p><p>The Pole, who is a national hero in his homeland, suffered multiple fractures to his right leg, arm and hand. He was airlifted from the crash site in the village of Testico to the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure on the Mediterranean coast where he underwent lengthy surgery.</p><p>The main area of concern is the driver's right hand, which, although safe from amputation, is severely damaged and it is too early for doctors to give a prognosis on a full recovery. It is the same arm that was badly injured in a road accident in 2003 and left him with titanium bolts to support the shattered bones.</p><p>Kubica's manager, Daniele Morelli, said last night: \"The surgeons are trying to restore the functionality of the right hand. They must now think about the muscle function, but Robert has a very strong temper and will succeed.\" The Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that more surgery will be required after today's preliminary operation.</p><p>Kubica, who was due to start his fifth full season in Formula One in Bahrain next month, set the fastest time in testing last week and grand prix insiders regard him as one of the sport's supreme talents and a future world champion who could have earned anything up to $100m from his career as a driver. He made his debut for the BMW Sauber team in 2006 after eye-catching victories in the junior formulas, the traditional testing ground for emerging talent.</p><p>He hit the headlines in 2007 when he emerged almost unscathed from a terrifying high-speed crash in Montreal that was a testament to the strength of the modern Formula One car. A year later, and at the same track, he won his first, and so far only, grand prix. When BMW withdrew from Formula One at the end of 2009, unable to justify the cost after a dreadful season,  Kubica signed for the Renault team and achieved some strong results, including second in Australia and third at Monaco, considered the greatest test of a driver's skill.</p><p>The feeling was that this would be the year Kubica would take on the sport's elite on the track and would soon be able to match them in the earnings stakes. In the ultra-secret world of Formula One finance hard figures are difficult to come by but Renault are believed to paying Kubica $10m a year until 2012, with Fernando Alonso earning four times that much at Ferrari.</p><p>Modern Formula One drivers' contracts usually forbid them from taking part in \"high-risk\" activities for fear of injury but the drivers are famed for seeking adrenaline rushes away from the track and Kubica is far from the first driver to put his career – and life – in jeopardy pursuing high-risk hobbies.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Renault team, which is based in Enstone in Oxfordshire, would not comment on whether Kubica had sought permission to compete in the rally although he has taken part in club rallies for several years. It is thought the car he crashed today, a powerful model that competes in international events, was one he purchased two years ago.</p><p>In the first three decades of the Formula One world championship, which began in 1950, drivers regularly competed in various brands of motor sport when they were not competing in grands prix. Top drivers such as Stirling Moss, Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart travelled the world to race in anything that might take them to a win.</p><p>Since the 1970s Formula One drivers are very much that, only occasionally skiing or mountain-biking in the off-season to keep fit and satisfy their need for speed and even that has proved hazardous. Two years ago the Australian driver Mark Webber broke a leg when he was hit by a 4x4 while taking part in a bike race.</p><p>Tonight fellow drivers offered their support to the popular Kubica.</p><p>Britain's former world champion Jenson Button, who drives for McLaren said on his Twitter page: \"Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery.\"</p><p>Williams driver Rubens Barrichello tweeted: \"I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica. He is being operated right now. We all like him and he deserves all the best.\"</p><p>Sebastian Buemi of Toro Rosso said: \"All my support to Robert Kubica. I am with you man.\"They will also be very aware that just as Robert Kubica was about to join the elite of formula one, his career may well have been snatched away from him by his desire to take part in one of the most basic forms of the sport.</p><h2><strong>The need for speed: previous accidents involving F1 drivers</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Mark Webber </strong></p><p>Breaks a leg when hit by a car mountain-biking in Tasmania before the 2009 season. Drives with steel rods in his leg.
