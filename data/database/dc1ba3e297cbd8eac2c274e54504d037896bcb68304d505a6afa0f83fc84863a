Contador – who won the 2007, 2009 and 2010 editions before being stripped of the latter after being found guilty of a doping offence – will also be on the start line in Utrecht on 4 July having been forced to withdraw from this year’s race through injury as the Italian Vicenzo Nibali claimed the title.</p> <p>Asked if he now has the edge over Froome following his victory at the Vuelta, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/contador-giro-tour-double-is-only-impossible-until-someone-makes-it-possible?ns_campaign=features&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=cyclingnews&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=features\" title=\"\">Contador told cyclingnews.com</a>: “One thing is sure. After Froome won the Tour de France in 2013, he was asked who his major rivals were for the future and he said Nibali, [Nairo] Quintana and maybe Contador if I could return to that level but that it was different now.</p> <p>“Well … that was one race. This year at the Tour we saw that I could be a favourite. When he was attacking this year, we saw that I could live with that, that I could go with him. So when he attacks and you know that inside you have more power, that gives you some security. An edge? I don’t know but security, yes.</p> <p>“But now it changes nothing. We all start 2015 at zero and we all have to go from there but of course there’s more confidence because you know you have the legs.”</p> <p>Contador has already indicated that he is also planning to attempt to ride the Giro D’Italia next season in an attempt to become the first man to win both Grand Tours in the same season since Marco Pantani in 1998.</p> <p>“When I saw that people said that the Giro and Tour were impossible to win together I took a step back and thought: ‘Well, it’s only impossible until someone makes it possible,’” he said.</p> <p>“Why do people think it’s impossible? I mean if I go to the Giro and win, and I then recover well why can’t I think take on the Tour? Of course, I know it’s going to be difficult but there’s a chance. That’s my opinion, and that’s what’s in my head and motivating me.”</p> <p>In 2011, Contador attempted the Giro-Tour double for the first time and ended up winning in Italy before going on to finish fifth at the Tour. He was subsequently stripped of both results after testing positive for Clenbuterol the previous season.</p> <p>“You can analyse all you want but the difference, like I said, was that in 2011 the Tour wasn’t on the original plan. It was only at the last moment that I was sent to the Tour,” he said.</p> <p>“Day one, I had a crash and I lost around one minute 20 on all my rivals. Then it’s the team time trial and I lose another 40 seconds. So after two key days of racing I’m already two minutes down. That first crash wasn’t too bad and I almost win a stage against Cadel Evans but then just before the mountains I have another crash with [Vladimir] Karpets and my knee ends up looking like a mess and I say to Bjarne that I don’t think I can recover but he wants me to carry on.</p> <p>“So I keep on fighting and decide to just recover through the Pyrenees without attacking. I get through that part and lose just a bit of time but then in the Alps I have one bad day because of hunger knock on the Galibier. That’s where I lost the chance of winning.”</p> <p>Contador launched an attack the following day on the road to Alpe d’Huez before eventually being overhauled. But he believes that day was proof that the double can be done.</p> <p>“For me, that day was more important than a lot of my victories,” he said.</p> <p>“I didn’t win but it gave me a lot of heart. So if I hadn’t lost that time in the first week, and if we had a little bit of a stronger team then I could have been in for the overall win.”</p>","headline":"Alberto Contador: Chris Froome does not intimidate me any more","trailText":"Alberto Contador has thrown down the gauntlet to Chris Froome by insisting he is no longer intimidated by his great rival","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417616012027/Chris-Froome-006.jpg","wordcount":"744","commentable":"false","byline":"Ed Aarons","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-06T14:14:14Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/03/alberto-contador-chris-froome-rivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/03/alberto-contador-chris-froome-rivals","tags":[{"id":"sport/alberto-contador","webTitle":"Alberto Contador","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/alberto-contador","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/alberto-contador","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chris-froome","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/giro-d-italia","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia","description":"Full coverage for all years of the Giro d'Italia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/giro-d-italia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/giro-d-italia","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ed-aarons","webTitle":"Ed Aarons","r2ContributorId":"61586","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/18/1395152556994/Ed-Aarons-003.jpg","firstName":"ed","lastName":"aarons","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ed Aarons is Guardian Sport's deputy news editor</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ed-aarons","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ed-aarons","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"2ac79f8d02fcd1f3d7b71fec81a573aa709ab665","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417616017911/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417616017911/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","source":"  Tim de Waele/Corbis","photographer":"Tim De Waele","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Chris Froome","suppliersReference":"61852427","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Tim De Waele/  Tim de Waele/Corbis","caption":"Alberto Contador, right, tracks Chris Froome at this year’s Vuelta a España.

Wiggins to head development team</a>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Contracts for new professionals with UCI World Tour teams are like hen’s teeth, but the 21-year-old Welshman Owain Doull has confirmed to the Guardian that he has turned down a deal with the top French team Europcar in order to focus on his Olympic ambitions on the track. Doull is expected to line up for Great Britain in the team pursuit on Friday at the London World Cup, probably in the man four slot.</p> <p>Europcar are led by the top Frenchmen Thomas Voeckler and Pierre Rolland, and already boast one leading track rider in Bryan Coquard. “It was going to happen but I made a decision myself,” said Doull. “I’m going somewhere else, and in terms of my future over the next few years it’s probably a better decision. I’m not going to step up [to the World Tour] this year. I really want to turn pro but maybe a team like that isn’t the best place to go if you’re not sure you are ready.”</p> <p>Doull has yet to confirm his plans for 2015 but it seems likely that, in common with the bulk of the Great Britain men’s endurance squad, he will race for the new team being set up around Sir Bradley Wiggins. The Guardian understands that further details on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-team-sky-british-cycling-olympics-rio\" title=\"\">“Team Wiggo”</a>, as the venture is already nicknamed, should be revealed in the next couple of weeks, but the team pursuit duo Andy Tennant and Mark Christian have already been named for the team and Steven Burke – a London 2012 gold medallist – is also expected to figure. The team’s objective will be to combine racing primarily the British calendar with building the pursuit squad around Wiggins in the run-in to Rio.</p> <p>Doull, a product of the Great Britain academy, rode for Wales at this year’s Commonwealth Games, having won gold in the team pursuit at last year’s European championships, and landed two further gold medals in World Cup rounds last winter. This year, on the road, he won the Triptyque des Monts et Châteaux, a top under-23 stage race in Belgium. He finished 19th in the under-23 race at the road world championships in Ponferrada, Spain; one advantage in turning down a World Tour contract is that he will be eligible for next year’s under-23 race in Richmond, USA.</p> <p>In common with the rest of the Great Britain men’s endurance squad Doull received a dressing down from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/29/shane-sutton-gb-london-track-world-cup-cycling\" title=\"\">the team head, Shane Sutton</a>, after this year’s track world championships in Colombia in late February. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/03/shane-sutton-team-gb-world-track-championships\" title=\"\">Sutton publicly questioned the squad’s collective talent</a>, which hurt according to Doull. “At this level no one likes to be doubted. You take it to heart a bit but then you’ve got to crack on. There’s no greater challenge than when you’ve got a point to prove. It wasn’t very nice at the time but it’s changed me quite a lot and made me more determined if anything. I hadn’t had anything like that before. It was a bit of a shock. We all knew we weren’t in a great place, although we’d had a good year up to then. Come the worlds we got a few things wrong, tried some different stuff like altitude tents. Across the board we all underperformed.”</p> <p>Doull accepts that with Wiggins returning to the squad competition for a place in Rio is likely to be intense, although if the four-times Olympic gold medallist does make the final squad – something Sutton keeps insisting is not a given – the team pursuit will become one of the most high-profile events in the Games. “It’s going to be a challenge but I’ll commit fully. You have to take the positives from what I’ve done before. I was in some doubt about whether to continue on the track or focus on the road but I had quite a good Commonwealth Games and that changed my mind.”</p> <p>Wiggins has yet to confirm his plans for next year – his final deal with Team Sky is in the offing but has taken a long while to be thrashed out – but he seems likely to move to the Great Britain team from late next spring once he has ridden the Paris-Roubaix one-day Classic. A source close to Wiggins indicated that rumours he might attempt the Giro d’Italia next year could well prove unfounded.</p> <p>Asked about the current state of play with his former protege, Sutton said: “Brad has already walked through the door. We don’t expect to see him until late spring, but we know he’s going to come in after the Classics and will be ready to dial into the track. There’s a lot of talk about him and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/30/matthias-brandle-hour-record\" title=\"\">the hour record</a> and that will be good for us because he will be on the track.”</p> <p>Sutton added that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/18/sir-bradley-wiggins-not-picked-great-britain-london-track-world-cup\" title=\"\">Wiggins will not be racing in London this weekend</a> because he needed a break after the season, but “he’s back in training on the road and he will be ready to go. If you look at the way he trained for Roubaix last year, he virtually did it all himself, turned up and the performance was there for everyone to see.”</p>","headline":"Great Britain’s Owain Doull shuns Europcar to focus on Olympic pursuits","trailText":"The British cyclist Owain Doull has revealed he has turned down a contract with the UCI World Tour team Europcar to focus on reaching Rio 2016 with the Great Britain track team","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417530767903/Owain-Doull-006.jpg","wordcount":"858","commentable":"false","byline":"William Fotheringham","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T14:37:10Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/02/owain-doull-great-britain-cycling-europcar-track-olympics-rio-2016","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/02/owain-doull-great-britain-cycling-europcar-track-olympics-rio-2016","tags":[{"id":"sport/bradleywiggins","webTitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/bradleywiggins","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/williamfotheringham","webTitle":"William Fotheringham","rcsId":"GNL069141","r2ContributorId":"16575","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/william_fotheringham_140x14.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"fotheringham","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>William Fotheringham is the Guardian's cycling columnist</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamfotheringham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/williamfotheringham","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"4e3a0b75ec148737af25cd577c24c76b1e833d7d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417530774276/Owain-Doull-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417530774276/Owain-Doull-011.jpg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Owain Doull","suppliersReference":"78769324","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","caption":"Owain Doull was part of the Great Britain squad that was criticised at the world championships in February.

Next year’s race will include only 14 kilometres of individual time trial, on the opening day in the Dutch city of Utrecht.</p> <p>However, the Team Sky rider has now <a href=\"http://www.chris-froome.com/news/42-froome-to-prioritise-tour-in-2015\" title=\"\">confirmed on his personal website</a> that he has now had a change of heart.</p> <p>“Of course, together with the team, we’ve had to prioritise some events over others, but the Tour will remain my main focus for 2015,” wrote Froome. “The concept of doing all three Grand Tours in a season has got appeal but having said that, I know how hard it is to do two Grand Tours while targeting the overall win. At this point in my career I feel that the Tour takes priority. There may come a time at some point down the line where other races may take preference, but for 2015, it’s the Tour.</p> <p>“There is no doubt that this Tour de France is going to be a tough test, but I enjoy the challenge and there’s no reason why I would be any worse off than any of the other contenders. It is our responsibility as a team to adapt accordingly so that we can be as competitive as possible there,” Froome added.</p> <p>“It’s a climber’s Tour next year so I’m going to have to work extra hard in the mountains and spend less time on practising time trialling. It’s also going to be important to be as light as possible, so our nutrition will play a key role. There will be new tests for me as an individual, that’s what I’m looking forward to.”</p> <p>Froome was unable to defend his title last year after withdrawing during the fifth stage following a series of crashes which caused hand and wrist fractures. Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali went on to take the Tour in Paris.</p> <p>Having returned to finish second behind Spain’s Alberto Contador at the Vuelta in August, he is now back in training before the new season and is targeting the Ruta del Sol on 18 February as his first race of the new year.</p> <p>He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time off, and now I am concentrating on preparing myself mentally and physically for the season ahead. I’ve started training in the warm weather in South Africa where I have been able to get some decent miles in on the bike.”</p>","headline":"Team Sky’s Chris Froome confirms he will ride the 2015 Tour de France","trailText":"Chris Froome has confirmed he will make winning next year’s Tour de France his main target despite initially hinting that he may concentrate his efforts elsewhere","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417519842247/Chris-Froome-006.jpg","wordcount":"461","commentable":"false","byline":"Ed Aarons","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T11:31:21Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/02/chris-froome-tour-de-france-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/02/chris-froome-tour-de-france-2015","tags":[{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chris-froome","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/tour-de-france-2014","webTitle":"Tour de France 2014","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tour-de-france-2014","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tour-de-france-2014","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ed-aarons","webTitle":"Ed Aarons","r2ContributorId":"61586","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/3/18/1395152556994/Ed-Aarons-003.jpg","firstName":"ed","lastName":"aarons","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ed Aarons is Guardian Sport's deputy news editor</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ed-aarons","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ed-aarons","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport/news","webTitle":"News & features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"0c8f5728bf7ec11dc36baef2aced4b70693fe4ef","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417519848778/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417519848778/Chris-Froome-011.jpg","source":"AP","photographer":"Laurent Cipriani","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Chris Froome","suppliersReference":"PDJ125","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Laurent Cipriani/AP","caption":"Chris Froome's defence of his Tour de France title ended on stage five due to injury.

It would be an exaggeration to say that for Great Britain’s cyclists the road to Rio will begin when the flag falls on the first race at the velodrome in the Olympic Park, but the timescale does not lie: the midpoint in the Olympic cycle is past, and the countdown is on.</p> <p>For the new man at the helm of British Cycling, Shane Sutton, the World Cup is about “managing expectations”. It is an intriguing cocktail: the high-profile nature of the London event, its evocative location in the Pringle, its timing in the season and the background of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/03/shane-sutton-team-gb-world-track-championships\" title=\"\">February’s world championships, the worst in terms of results in recent years</a>. “The riders will want success in front of their home crowd but ultimately it’s about Olympic qualification, so it’s about securing points and if wins come on the back of that then fantastic,” Sutton says.</p> <p>“Everyone is going to be living off what happened in London [in 2012] and the public will expect, but that’s part and parcel of elite sport. We were a force in London, and we want to be a force in Rio, but this is part of the pathway to get there. A lot of people are in heavy work still and this isn’t something we can taper for, given we want to go and have a successful Worlds. We can’t be at our optimum. There’s a lot of people doubting us after what happened in Colombia, but we can see a trend and we will be competitive across the board.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">The 57-year-old Australian took over from Sir Dave Brailsford</a> in mid-April after two Olympic cycles as Brailsford’s right-hand man. In some ways the succession seems like a poisoned chalice. Expectations remain sky high after the London Games but that ignores certain facts. Part of the London gold rush was dependent on two riders at the end of their careers – Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. Brailsford and Sutton’s intense focus between Beijing and London, first on setting up Team Sky and then getting through the home Games, was not conducive to long-term thinking. Between 2008 and 2013 there was a brain drain, with several key coaches – Scott Gardner at sprint, Matt Parker and Dan Hunt at endurance – leaving for other sports.</p> <p>That helps explain, in part, the disaster that was the world championships in Cali. Although the women won five medals – with two golds for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/27/shane-sutton-joanna-rowsell-spoty\" title=\"\">Joanna Rowsell</a> – for the first time since 1998, the men returned empty handed, outshone by the Irish, who have no velodrome and minimal funding. Sutton puts that down to the remaining hangover from the Olympics. “It was tall building [syndrome]. They had to get themselves so high for London that when it finished they crashed and burned because they’d given everything. It’s taken a while to bounce back from that.</p> <p>“We sat down and looked at ourselves and re-addressed our philosophy. I said we needed to freshen up and we’ve done that. I’ve seen changes. I wouldn’t say the riders weren’t committed but after the success in London there were a lot of distractions. The riders have a certain amount of earning potential and limited time to capitalise on that. We always said the best time for that was the two years after the Games and then they need to start on the road to Rio.”</p> <p>The changes have come apace. Heiko Salzwedel, one of the best endurance coaches in the world who worked wonders on small budgets with Switzerland and Denmark, has been persuaded to return for a third spell in Britain, with “a clean sheet of paper” to work off. Below him, the endurance coaches have been reshuffled, with Paul Manning returning to supervise the women. A new sprint coach, Justin Grace, has been added to the team. A new mountain bike coach is being sought. Further down the ladder the talent development system has been revised.</p> <p>In the short term, Sutton wants his coaches to be “Rio ready” by New Years’ Day, with all the structures in place for the run-in to the Olympics. He also has very specific problems to contend with. A replacement is urgently needed for Hoy in the Man Three position in the men’s team sprint, although Callum Skinner, another Scot, has recently made promising strides. In the women’s sprint, Becky James appeared certain to take over from Pendleton after taking four medals at the 2013 Worlds in Minsk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/25/becky-james-2016-olympics-injuries-surgery-rio\" title=\"\">but she has been ruled out at least for this season with a severe knee injury</a>, and her return date is unknown.</p> <p>Alongside the sprint conundrum, there are the small matters of managing Sir Bradley Wiggins’s return to the track midway through next year – with the foundation of “Team Wiggo” to include the bulk of his fellow potential team pursuiters – and persuading Mark Cavendish or Ben Swift to take a brief break from professional road racing to ride the omnium. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/26/mark-cavendish-never-taken-tour-de-france-for-granted-interview\" title=\"\">Cavendish has said he feels he could win the omnium, but is undecided</a>.</p> <p>“The ball is in their court,” says Sutton. “When you see the way Cav has been whizzing round Ghent and Zurich I’m sure it has whetted his appetite. All he needs to know is that GB is there for him.”</p> <p>Sutton’s long-term goal is “a full British coaching structure by the time I call it a day” – and currently he has his eyes on continuing to Tokyo in 2020, which is “not far away”. In the medium-term, he is looking to expand the women’s endurance academy and possibly return it to its former Belgian base. He would also like to see the men’s under-23 academy return to Europe.</p> <p>“We need to go back to the structure that worked in the past. We need to scour the world and find the right person. It needs to be done abroad because you take away the home comforts and they just have to ride their bikes.”</p>","headline":"Shane Sutton takes long-term view in order to repeat Team GB’s

Rowsell has Olympic, world and Commonwealth titles<br />• ‘Jo has been the best sportswoman in Britain this year’<br /><a

shortlist</a>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The British Cycling technical director, Shane Sutton, has expressed his disappointment that Joanna Rowsell, who currently has a full house of Olympic, world, European and Commonwealth Games pursuit titles, has been left off the shortlist for the BBC sports personality of the year.</p> <p>The 25-year-old from Surrey has been a mainstay of the Great Britain team pursuit squad since 2008, and helped the trio to a gold medal in the London Olympic Games and further golds at the world and European championships this year. She has also branched out into the individual side of the discipline, landing the world title in Colombia back in February and the Commonwealth gold in Glasgow this July.</p> <p>“To me Jo has been the best sportswoman in Britain this year,” said Sutton, who took over from Sir Dave Brailsford at the head of the British cycling squad earlier this year. “There is no question. It’s out of our control but as far as her performances are concerned, I don’t think any other sportswoman has matched what she has achieved.”</p> <p>Together with Laura Trott, Rowsell has been at the heart of the Great Britain women’s team pursuit squad’s international dominance in recent years. The squad are unbeaten at world championship level since 2011, and currently hold the world records at the current distance of 4,000m with four riders, and the 2012 Olympic distance of 3,000m with three riders.</p> <p>“She has been a leading light for us,” added Sutton, who recently named Rowsell in the British women’s endurance team for next weekend’s World Cup at the “Pringle” in London’s Olympic park. “The thing about Jo is, she has her goals in place and no one hits goals like she can hit them. She pulled out of Mexico, the last World Cup, in order to prepare for London and she did a big block on her own.”</p> <p>Speaking at the cycling team’s base in Manchester on Thursday – where several members of the team appear to be suffering with flu which it is hoped will not affect their form for London – Sutton concluded, “She picks the ball up and runs with it herself. It’s something that a lot of the other athletes here need to look at; how Jo prepares herself, how she achieves things in the long term through sheer dedication to her goal. She does what it takes and gets the job done.”</p>","headline":"Shane Sutton slams Joanna Rowsell’s omission from Spoty shortlist","trailText":"The British Cycling technical director, Shane Sutton,

In Cavendish’s case, that is given greater urgency by two factors: he’s racing on the road in just eight weeks and he missed a vital part of 2014 due to a dramatic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/06/tour-de-france-mark-cavendish-crashes-in-first-stage-video\">first-day crash in the Tour de France</a>.</p> <p>On Sunday the Manxman and his partner Iljo Keisse finished a close-run second in the Ghent Six after five frenetic nights and one afternoon, belting around ’t Kuipke – or “the hipbath” – as Ghent’s tiny, vertiginous bowl is known. At 167m it is roughly two-thirds the size of a standard indoor velodrome, a hard place to ride even for someone who has raced here before.</p> <p>“It took me 20 minutes to settle down from being dizzy,” Cavendish said after an initial training session. In the battle with eventual winners Jasper De Buyst and Kenny De Ketele, Cavendish’s lack of track racing – in recent years at least – counted against him, although the pair held the lead going into Sunday’s final session. “It took me three or four days to get into a good rhythm,” he added. “I was trying to get my track legs back. We couldn’t pick up the points early on that the other guys did, and it put us on the back foot, chasing all week.”</p> <p>Cavendish and Keisse continued their winter campaign on Thursday in the four-day “Six Day Nights” meeting in Zurich. This brief foray into the Sixes is a new departure for Cavendish, who was a regular on the circuit as an amateur; until Ghent he had never raced a Six-Day as a professional.</p> <p>When you realise that the total distance covered each day can be up to 100km, and bear in mind that pedalling speed is vital for a sprinter such as Cavendish, the benefits of riding the Sixes seem obvious, particularly with the 2015 season so close; Cavendish will kick off on 19 January in Argentina. “I had to get riding again,” he says. “I had a forced three-week break where I should have been getting the fittest I can be in the season. Ghent gave me a short-term focus so that I’m not thinking I’ve got weeks and weeks to get fit. With Zurich, it’s a good block of work.”</p> <p>After ending his season at the Tour of Britain in late September, Cavendish took a far briefer break than usual, before putting in long spells at his training base in Tuscany, where he can ride in better weather than at his Essex home. It is all time away from his partner Peta and their daughter Delilah, but the 29-year-old says his motivation has been rebooted since the moment he hit the tarmac in Harrogate.</p> <p>“[Crashes] happen to everyone, but this was the first Tour de France I’ve missed since I turned pro,” reflects Cavendish. “I’ve never taken [the Tour] for granted, it’s just given me a new lease of life. I just missed it so much, winning more than anything, the emotional rollercoaster, the spectacle that it is. It’s bigger than cycling. It’s something you can’t put into words. It’s made me not want to retire. I wasn’t ever thinking about retiring, but you start to think of the future, this has made me completely focus on cycling again. It’s not like I’ve lost any desire, but it’s made me more intense about it.”</p> <p>This was the most serious pile-up of Cavendish’s career but he is matter-of-fact about it. When you pick yourself up off the Tarmac, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/21/mark-cavendish-back-bike-after-crashing-out-tour-de-france\">as he did in Harrogate</a>, “it hurts, physically and emotionally but I’m a professional bike rider. I have a job to do. I can’t sit and rest because I have to get out and perform for my team as soon as possible. It was just about getting back as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“It was a grade four ligament separation – all four A/C joint ligaments were torn. The shoulder blade was sticking out. For a normal person the recovery is 12 weeks or something – six weeks in a sling before they can start physio. I was back on the bike on the turbo in 10 days – still in pain – and then it was just work, work, work trying to get to race again. It wasn’t difficult, it was just hard work. I had to work every hour of every day to get it back quick. It was time-consuming, but I had nothing else to do.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f91b2911f1cc4e746f8286af97938543e9b9d00e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416999841504/bd0f841b-0407-4107-9f41-5696229fc701-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish in action during a round of the madison on day five of the Ghent Six at de Kuipke in Ghent, Belgium.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Cavendish in action during a round of the madison on day five of the Ghent Six at ’t Kuipke in Ghent, Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cavendish’s precise plans for 2015 have yet to be detailed, but a return to the Tour de France must be on the cards. There is also speculation about a possible attempt at a second world road race title. His old mentor Rod Ellingworth, who put together the plan that took Cavendish to the rainbow jersey in Copenhagen – and is likely to look after the men’s elite road team until Rio – has his eyes on Cavendish as a possible leader in the 2015 race in Richmond, Virginia, as well as Doha in 2016.</p> <p>Cavendish is clearly keen. “I’d like to win the Worlds again in the next couple of years [but] you have to remember that Copenhagen was four years to plan and it took a lot of everybody’s energy and time. I don’t know how it works now, especially with the majority of guys riding for Sky. I don’t know if it will work as well as it did last time.”</p> <p>As Cavendish acknowledges, there is another British contender now in Ben Swift, who finished 12 this year: “We’ve definitely got the riders and I don’t think it’s just me who’s got the ability to be the winner out of the British team. I’d definitely like to give it a crack.”</p> <p>Cavendish is more reticent when it comes to another potential target: Rio. Along with wearing the yellow jersey at the Tour de France, an Olympic gold medal is now the only major achievement lacking from his record. Cavendish tried the Madison in Beijing but his partner Bradley Wiggins was off form, while the road race in London did not produce the sprint finish he and Ellingworth had targeted.</p> <p>He could be favoured by a change in format in the track omnium, now heavily weighted towards the points race, a discipline that suits Cavendish. The new man at the helm at British Cycling, Shane Sutton, has the Manxman on his shortlist of possible candidates, and told the Guardian: “He has the potential to win the omnium. He knows my feelings and my belief in his ability, but it’s not just about me and Mark having a chat – where does this fit in his world?”</p> <p>On the one hand, Cavendish is adamant that this winter’s return to the Sixes does not mark a return to the track in the future. “It has nothing to do with Rio,” he said flatly before starting Ghent. That is backed up by the fact he will not be racing for Great Britain in the London World Cup in 10 days, or in the world championships in Paris in February.</p> <p>On the other hand, he is open to the possibility, but as Sutton says, it depends on how it dovetails with Omega-Pharma-Quickstep’s need for road race success.</p> <p>“I’m sure I could win it if I put myself to it, but I’ve worked hard with Omega-Pharma to build a team around sprint performance, the team really look after me and do everything they can to make sure that I have what I need to win; my job is about giving back [for] their investment,” Cavendish says. “I’d like to win it, being a British athlete and the Olympics being big in Britain, but the day job comes first. It can be easily talked about. I’d just have to call [OPQS head] Patrick [Lefevere].”</p> <p>Another possible target for the future may be the one-day Classics; Cavendish has already won Milan-San Remo and was not far off a repeat victory this year, but others may be within his register. “It definitely interests me and I’m definitely in the best team to do it, the best environment to learn,” he says. “These are the races I grew up dreaming of, but at the moment we [OMP] have so many guys who can win them that it doesn’t make sense for me to go in out of desire, unless I can go and do a job.”</p> <p>Next year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/06/tour-of-britain-mark-cavendish-marcel-kittel\">the battle in the sprints</a> in the major Tours could be enthralling, with Cavendish seemingly rejuvenated, and the star of this year’s Tour, Marcel Kittel, likely to improve. That is for the future, however; Cavendish has never liked discussing potential rivals. “It’s the same as always, regardless of who’s there,” he insists. “I just want to win. It doesn’t matter who I’m beating. I just keep looking at it like that.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 27 November 2014 to correct the spelling of ’t Kuipke.</p>","headline":"Mark Cavendish: ‘I’ve never taken the Tour for granted.

It’s a big step towards the sport reaching its full potential. The teams involved in creating Velon have come together with a powerful shared vision to optimise the sport and develop new ways for it to grow.</p> <p>“If the teams unite and work collectively to make cycling better to watch and easier to understand, it’s to everyone’s benefit. It will encourage more fans to follow the sport.”</p> <p>The group will push for changes to the race calendar to develop a “season-long story” which engages fans beyond individual races. Velon has already been working behind the scenes, and played a key role in the introduction of on-bike cameras this season in order to enhance television coverage.</p> <p>Jonathan Vaughters, the chief executive of Slipsteam Sports and the soon to be rebranded Team Garmin-Sharp, said: “There has been a group of teams collaborating for some time about how we can – by working together – shape the future of the sport.</p> <p>“Facilitating the use of on-bike cameras during racing was our first major step and now, as a formal cooperative, we will be able to continue to create even more opportunities to grow the sport we all love and make it more accessible to our fans. This is particularly exciting for our organisation as we look ahead to 2015 as Cannondale-Garmin Pro Cycling.”</p> <p>Graham Bartlett, formerly of Uefa, Nike and Liverpool, is the chief executive, with a brief to develop innovative ideas which will grow the sport and create a more stable economic model for teams.</p> <p>“The existing sponsor-only business model is fragile for all teams,” Bartlett said. “We need to change this to a more rounded one with fans at the heart of it. Investing in new technologies generates greater excitement and brings the sport closer to its supporters.</p> <p>“What we’re trying to build will hopefully create a virtuous circle where it’s easier for fans to engage with teams and riders, and gives the teams greater incentives to maintain credibility.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/11/chris-froome-team-sky-tour-de-france-2015\" title=\"\">Team Sky’s Chris Froome said</a>: “As we can see from official figures the popularity of cycling continues to grow. More people want to ride and as we saw from the incredible support in the UK this year at the Tour de France more want to be involved in the sport. With the development of Velon, it will allow the teams to work together and help find new innovations to grow the sport, keep fans excited and attract new followers.”</p>","headline":"Team Sky among founders of group out to lead cycling revolution","trailText":"Cycling’s leading teams have created Velon – a UK-based joint venture intended to drive development and growth","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416906576344/Dave-Brailsford-006.jpg","wordcount":"491","commentable":"false","byline":"Press Association","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T09:13:25Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/25/team-sky-velon-cycling-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/25/team-sky-velon-cycling-development","tags":[{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/team-sky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/team-sky","references":[]},{"id":"sport/dave-brailsford","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/dave-brailsford","references":[]},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chris-froome","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"0feda130858a7fa58faf8597036ed6a7b30de779","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416906581796/Dave-Brailsford-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416906581796/Dave-Brailsford-011.jpg","source":"Simon Wilkinson/Rex","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Dave Brailsford","suppliersReference":"3890982j","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Simon Wilkinson/Rex","caption":"Dave Brailsford has played a key role in the creation of Velon which sees 11 pro cycling teams join forces.

Olympic athletes were ostensibly amateurs until the 1988 games in Seoul, while the first ever Socceroos World Cup squad was a motley mix of miners and milkmen. Rugby union only reneged on the sport’s commitment to its “first principle” of “amateur status without compromise or qualification” in 1995, and to this day nominal amateurism persists in American college sports.</p> <p>Historian Tony Collins observed: “For almost a century and a half amateurism had defined the morality of sport. Even professional sport had genuflected to the supposed ethical superiority of the amateur ethos.” Yet, as Collins continued, “no significant sport in the world described itself as amateur by the end of the twentieth century.”</p> <p>Despite its short history, the dominance of money in sport has been overwhelming. Kobe Bryant will earn more than US$23m ($26.4m) this NBA season, while Manchester United star Wayne Rooney pockets £300,000 ($540,000) every week. Football juggernauts Real Madrid and Barcelona enjoy half-billion dollar revenues, and even state-team cricketers reap the benefits of the sport’s commercial success.</p> <p>For every Bryant and Rooney, though, there is also a Melissa Breen or Mark Tupalski. Witness Breen compete at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and it is easy to assume that Australia’s fastest woman is a full-time athlete. Similarly, watch the extravagance of the Tour de France and it seems logical that competitive cyclists like Tupalski spend all day, every day training.</p> <p>Yet the glitz and glamour of these television broadcasts often hide an unfortunate truth: away from the bright lights of the AFL or NRL, many Australian sportsmen and women dedicate their lives to athletic pursuits without significant remuneration. Whether they are at the top of their field in a code without adequate funding, or desperately trying to secure that lucrative overseas contract, such athletes are forced to balance work, life, sport and study commitments.</p> <p>Speak to these “semi-professionals” – with the phrase used in a solely descriptive rather than pejorative sense – and almost in unison they are keen to dispel one common misconception. </p> <p>“People just assume that we train and compete full-time – I don’t think they realise that racing does not really pay the bills,” declares road and mountain bike cyclist Tupalski. Breen, a sprinter who in February broke the longstanding Australian 100 metre record, shares a similar anecdote. At a Christmas party last year, her father’s colleague was shocked to learn that Breen spends several hours every day coaching to complement the small amount of funding she receives from Athletics Australia.</p> <p>Without extravagant pay cheques, these athletes must supplement their training schedule with employment or education, a difficult juggling routine as they attempt to dominate their chosen sporting arena.</p> <p>Take Tupalski. Despite competing for Avanti Cycling on the road and Torq on the dirt, the 24-year-old is mainly self-funded, necessitating part-time employment at a bike shop in Canberra.</p> <p>“An average week would be working Monday to Thursday,” Tupalski explains. “I’m normally up at 5am, leave at 5.45 to get to the morning bunch and ride until 7am. Then I have an hour to fill, so I’ll usually do a lap of the lake before heading to work. After 5.30pm I’ll ride home, and throw in a high intensity session on the way.”</p> <p>With a race every second or third weekend, the cyclist then spends most Fridays preparing to travel on Saturday and compete on Sunday. A late return home follows, before heading straight back to work the next morning. “Rinse and repeat,” Tupalski adds with a wry smile.</p> <p>Although their stories differ, speak to other semi-professional athletes and the same theme stands out: an ever challenging balancing act. Holly Houston, a midfielder with W-League side Canberra United, works three days a week to allow sufficient time for training and recovery, but admits even that workload can prove difficult.<br /></p> <p>“It is a challenge – I know for me I have a very supportive family, but some people struggle so much that they find they cannot continue to pursue the game for the love of it,” she acknowledges. While Houston is loath to complain – she instead praises Canberra United’s understanding approach and moderate stipend – the lack of a full-time wage forces her to make tough decisions.</p> <p>“You don’t really have a life – you choose sport instead,” she adds. “Myself and many others have to miss out on a lot of things: family birthdays, friends’ weddings, engagement parties. But I guess that’s the sacrifice you make to pursue something you love and enjoy.”</p> <p>For Paralympic middle distance runner Michael Roeger, meanwhile, there are not enough hours in the day as he attempts to juggle training, employment and study commitments. Although the 2014 male para-athlete of the year enjoys top tier funding, he also works at the Australian Sports Commission to support his ambitions on the track.</p> <p>“Everyone wants more money, but in reality that’s not going to happen, so I’ve managed to get a good part-time job, and I’m studying at university as well,” Roeger says over coffee at the Australian Institute of Sport on a brief lunch break. “I think I manage it well: two sessions most days, work and then a bit of university in the evenings.”</p> <p>Another consistent theme across these interviews is the precarious nature of the small amount of funding that semi-professional athletes do receive. Particularly with Olympic sports, where the bulk of financial support is determined by performances in one or two races per year, small margins can have thousands of dollars worth of consequences.</p> <p>“In 2012 I lost all my funding, and just like that you have no income,” admits Ben Treffers, a gold medal winning swimmer at the recent Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. “A fraction of a second can have a huge impact in financial terms. In 2013 I was 0.01 seconds off the necessary time, and so I missed six months’ funding. Those fine margins make it so critical to perform, and given you only swim in a few qualifying races a year, there is a lot of pressure not only to compete on an international stage but also to secure your financial future.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b565afd3-2470-4ba4-aa76-7280efb204f2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/24/1416796993448/c5f95ccc-3a14-4202-a557-26200916cb48-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ben Treffers of Australia celebrates after the Men's 50m Backstroke Semi-final 2 at Tollcross International Swimming Centre during day three of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 26, 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland.

Aside from a training schedule that rivals their full-time colleagues, these athletes balance work, study and life commitments yet still find the energy to break records and win medals.</p> <p>They do so because they love their chosen sporting pursuit. Without a large salary to buy their commitment, this dedication is what drives them out of bed at 5am the morning after a full day of competition. It keeps them in the pool with exam study on their mind, and it inspires them to front up at training after an exhausting day in the office.</p> <p>“I’ve chosen to do this because I love sprinting, and that love overrides most things most of the time,” Breen concludes. “I enjoy what I’m doing right now, and I hope I never have to live ‘the normal 9am-5pm life’. I’m extremely happy running, and hopefully one day that pays the bills.”</p> <p>Even if it does not, Breen – like so many other semi-professional athletes – will be satisfied in the knowledge that she is doing what she loves.</p>","headline":"Sport's semi-pros: how part-time work funds the hope of permanent success","trailText":"<strong>Kieran Pender: </strong>From winning medals one day to juggling work and study commitments the next, life on the fringe of professional sport is a challenge","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/24/1416796663729/05561863-cc68-4fc1-a7d1-510b693e47ac-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1300","commentable":"true","byline":"Kieran Pender","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-27T13:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/24/sports-semi-pros-part-time-work-enables-full-time-success","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/24/sports-semi-pros-part-time-work-enables-full-time-success","tags":[{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/australia-sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/athletics","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kieran-pender","webTitle":"Kieran Pender","r2ContributorId":"58155","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376449457978/Kieran-Pender-003.jpg","firstName":"kieran","lastName":"pender","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kieran Pender is a Canberra-based sports writer.

a former professional cyclist and a vice president of the UCI, Gaudry can change women’s cycling for the better. How is she using that influence and will the future be brighter for the sport?<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Tracey Gaudry has been there and done it all. She is a multiple national champion who has ranked third in the world, won World Cups, the Tour de Snowy and the Trophée d’Or Feminin, where her name is written in the <em>palmares</em> alongside Emma Johansson, Marianne Vos and Elisa Longo Borghini. She is a successful businesswoman, the CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.amygillett.org.au/\">Amy Gillett Foundation</a>, head of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanian_Cycling_Confederation\">Oceania Cycling Confederation</a> (OCC) and vice president of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the international body that governs cycling.</p> <p>“I have experienced a great ride in cycling over 20 years,” she says. From the high of being ranked top three in the world to the low of crashing in a road race at the Olympics, Gaudry saw life as a top professional from the inside before moving into cycling advocacy with the Amy Gillett Foundation and becoming the first ever female president of the OCC in 2012. “I am fortunate to bring a wide range of professional skills as well as cycling experience into the space,” she says of her election. Then another first: Gaudry was elected as one of Brian Cookson’s three vice presidents in September 2013. <br /></p> <p>She is part of a group of women – alongside the likes of Kristy Scrymgeour who sits on the UCI’s professional cycling council, Wiggle-Honda team owner Rochelle Gilmore and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeTourEntier\">Le Tour Entier</a> co-founder Emma Pooley – who are finally dragging women’s cycling into the 21st century. At the time of her election, Gaudry said: “I’ll be standing alongside, as a lieutenant, to a president who I know is collaborative, who I know is not afraid to seek advice on difficult questions and on simple questions. He has accepted feedback openly and I welcome that philosophy.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea29e771fef98a888c69dcb2d20d5bf2f3f55be7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416582541602/cce7da48-f0e1-4467-9820-782a79054035-460x341.jpeg\" alt=\"Gaudry\" width=\"460\" height=\"341\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Dunne (left), Tracey Gaudry (centre) and Jeannie Longo (right) in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MARCOS TOWNSEND/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/oct/10/brian-cookson-interview-the-uci-president-discusses-womens-cycling\">When I spoke to Cookson</a>, he was keen to point out that he is a “listening president”. Does Gaudry still stand by her statement, one year on? “Those are statements I made then and will make them again today,” she says. Her roles in the OCC and UCI put her “inside the tent, working as part of a team to change the game, which was needed, to progress good initiatives that were already in place.” She prefers being able to work from the inside as opposed to agitating from the outside and credits Cookson with demonstrating his strengths as a president who “listens and digests, much more than he speaks”. She feels her role is to provide guidance to help him “form the right views and make the right decisions so that, when you do speak, you’re ready, you’re armed, you’re knowledgeable and you have a trusted team alongside you”.</p> <p>So are women’s voices finally being heard at the UCI? Gaudry thinks they are but concedes that there is a long way to go. As she points out, her presence at the heart of the UCI is challenging “114 years of history when there has not been a female voice – that’s a lot of history to start and think about how we might adapt the culture, adapt the conversation, bring a new perspective into an existing conversation.” She is equally clear that lobbying for action on the women’s sport should not come from women alone. “It’s about bringing everyone along for the journey, and for me it’s about lining up alongside my management committee colleagues and encouraging a conversation across the UCI and looking at elevating women in positions of significance and influence.” The really great news, Gaudry says, is that this approach is beginning to bear fruit: “It’s not only the women on the commissions putting forward proposals and opportunities to develop women in cycling, it’s the blokes as well.”</p> <p>Gaudry points out that all of the UCI commissions have people of great experience, expertise and knowledge: “And guess what? More of those people are women these days.” She says women have “a lot to offer, not just the women’s side of cycling but cycling as a sport, to grow it as a way of life and a great activity for everybody.” She points out that the UCI is at the head of a worldwide system of 179 national federations that represent thousands of clubs, across five continents. “There are many ways to foster the involvement of women and to promote the role of women and to achieve great outcomes all the way up and down the spectrum of cycling.”</p> <p>What about the Women’s Commission, the much vaunted body set up by Cookson after his election? Gaudry says it does not “decide everything that happens for women in cycling”. Instead, the commission takes proposals from other parts of the UCI and works “to understand what they’re striving to achieve, to bring that together and build an argument and a proposal for some of the more significant changes and investments we’d like to make in women’s cycling.”</p> <p>I wonder whether one of those “significant changes” is the much-debated minimum wage for professional women cyclists. With Cookson admitting he has failed in his manifesto pledge to deliver the minimum wage, and still clearly entertaining doubts about levels of remuneration for women riders, what is Gaudry’s opinion on this thorny issues? Does she agree with the common opinion that a minimum wage will simply see teams collapse or re-register as amateur teams? Is the minimum wage even the most important issue the women’s sport needs to tackle? Gaudry says the whole environment of cycling needs to change and, while some teams are making great steps to achieve that change, there are still “some conditions that haven’t improved a hell of a lot since I retired, so there’s an absolute personal commitment to moving forward.”</p> <p>For Gaudry, the picture is very much bigger than a minimum wage – it’s about making the environment more supportive for women cyclists. It’s up to the UCI to ensure that events are delivered and promoted well “so the stage women are racing on is set for them to perform at their very best”. Gaudry talks about “professionalising the duty of care” to women riders – ensuring that races are safe as well as spectacular – and looking closely at the team environment “so women are not only protected but challenged, so they can be tested to the extent of their capability.”</p> <p>Gaudry is pushing to raise standards and conditions: “Remuneration is one element, but it also includes housing and transport.” She uses the example of non-European athletes who cannot just go home on a weekend or between races. She wants teams to ensure that their medical and coaching facilities are sound, that equipment is properly maintained and that athletes have robust contracts with their teams.</p> <p>The expectation seems to be that weaker teams will fold if equal pay structures are created, but doesn’t that run the risk of sacrificing the opportunities of women who are involved in the sport now for their potential opportunities in the future? Gaudry says this view is “exactly right” and that the UCI want to “raise the bar in a way that is substantial and real, not undercooked and token.” She says that talks have been underway for some time with teams to determine just what that bar looks like “so we don’t set the bar so high that the system breaks – because, if you set it so high that all the teams folded, you wouldn’t have an environment or system.” To ensure that the top women’s teams appear in the top races, the UCI are working with team managers, owners and event organisers “to develop a model so that, when we do put it into the marketplace it has been socialised and tested with the teams, so everyone knows what’s coming and can prepare for that.”</p> <p>That model will take the form of a two-tier system. Work on its implementation has been ongoing this year. “The serious work started in July when the Women’s Commission met in the afterglow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/may/12/alfonsina-strada-giro-italia-woman-grand-tour\">La Course</a>,” Gaudry says, referencing the historic one-day race that saw women compete on one of the most iconic stages in cycling, the Champs-Élysées. The two-tier model will be implemented over the next two to three years, developing a series of top-tier and second-tier events, all at UCI level, including one-day events and stage races.</p> <p>As well as her roles with the UCI and the OCC, Gaudry is also the CEO of the Amy Gillett Foundation, which was set up by Gillett’s husband after her untimely death in 2005. Gillett and five of her Australian team-mates were on a training ride in Germany when tragedy struck – a young driver piled headlong into the group of cyclists. Five were injured, Gillett was killed. Her death sent shockwaves through Australia and the foundation, born from the tragedy, advocates for safe cycling in Australia. With a stated intention to be “a catalyst for change, focused on what should be, rather than what is,” they’re a good fit for Gaudry. <br /></p> <p>Her tone brightens when she talks about her work with the foundation. “It is a relatively small organisation, which enables us to be agile and nimble. It’s really important to be principled, to be robust in your mission and what you’re striving to achieve, to have strong governance so that structures underpinning your work are sound.” She says that both the foundation and the UCI “are well and truly focused on their community and the stakeholders who are important to achieving their respective missions and visions,” but she highlights an important, and telling, difference between the organisations: “The foundation advocate for a lot of change, so if you think about that from the UCI’s perspective it’s a little bit like the Le Tour Entier group, who are advocating change and calling out to the UCI to take up the task and the challenge and deliver that change.” As a member of the UCI management committee, she says it’s good to know what it’s like being on the “other side of the fence – I respect advocacy and I respect the power and good intent, when it’s well directed, of organisations and groups advocating for better outcomes.”</p> <p>The UCI faced criticism recently for their failure to file paperwork that would have guaranteed paracycling’s participation in the Rio Paralympics. Gaudry is open about the UCI’s failure to submit the application on time, saying there were “unfortunate reasons” behind it. She accepts that the UCI “didn’t deliver to the standard we expect of ourselves” but says the situation “is not a demonstration of a lack of commitment – we’re working very hard to ensure cycling plays a big part in the Paralympic Games.”</p> <p>If paracycling seems to be taking the outsider role in the “great cycling family” that women’s cycling once assumed, there’s no denying it has been a great year for the women’s sport – and not just on the road. Gaudry is keen to celebrate that success. “Let’s reflect on the fact that women’s cycling didn’t start this year,” she points out “it has been growing in various forms for four decades now.” She points to the abolition of the maximum age and the fact that all the women’s World Cup races were televised “and this year there was a different winner in every single race just showing the depth of talent in the women’s field”.</p> <p>The World Cup also introduced new categories to showcase different styles of racing and different stories from the women’s peloton. Then came the Women’s Tour in Britain and La Course. Finally she highlights the fact that “significant” investment from the UCI ensured that all the broadcast events actually happened. She says the trick is to celebrate what the sport has achieved, then ensure that next year “we raise the profile of more events on the women’s road calendar”. <br /></p> <p>That calendar, Gaudry says, was approved at the end of September and the 2015 World Cup series will consist of some “amazing” existing and new one-day races, as well as stage races that are growing in profile. The UCI is also working to ensure that all major women’s UCI road events receive significant TV broadcasting. The work with key stakeholders is already underway and there is, she says, “a sense of urgency inside the UCI because of how important that is for the sport, for women’s cycling and for the movement of cycling worldwide.”</p> <p>But just how robust is the current state of women’s cycling, bearing in mind that a big team like Lululemon is struggling, that Specialized are pulling back on their investment in the sport, that some teams have not been paying wages, and that Anna Solovey, who won the silver medal in the world championship time trial, has just returned from a doping ban? “Gee, that sounds like the men’s team environment,” she says. “They sound like problems you might see at pro-continental level or continental level on the men’s circuit.” She says these are challenges the sport has to face “across the board – let’s not try and badge every problem because it’s in the women’s environment – we’re working to improve the standard all around.”</p> <p>We shift the focus again to Gaudry’s homeland to talk about her former team-mate Cadel Evans. The recently retired rider has announced the Great Ocean Road Race – the men’s event has been awarded a 1.1 ranking by the UCI. The elite women’s event is not recognised by the UCI. Gaudry says the UCI did not receive an application for a women’s race but that the organisers are determined that, when such an application is made, the event will be delivered to the same quality and standard as the men’s event. She says the organisers were determined to deliver an excellent event and to “ensure that they could do an event well in year-one and that the right foundation and investment is there to consider a UCI double header in the future.”</p> <p>Our time is nearly up and I ask Gaudry one final question: what does the future of women’s cycling look like and when will we see it delivered? Gaudry talks first about the future for women’s road cycling, pointing out the work being done across all the cycling disciplines, including coaching and development programmes worldwide. The timing, Gaudry says, looks like this: in December there is a women’s World Cup seminar, which will take place in Switzerland and bring together World Cup race organisers with organisers of other major races “to plan to maximise the profile of all the major women’s events throughout 2015, to build on the great work that was done this year.” <br /></p> <p>The seminar will examine the concept for a professional women’s road series and develop its structure, possibly in two tiers, to be ratified in terms of rules, regulations and protocols during 2015, for implementation in 2016. Beyond that, Gaudry says, “We’re also continuing the conversations we’re already having with women’s team owners, organisers and selectors to look at the structure of women’s teams in the top-tier of women’s races and to set the arrangements for those teams during 2015 so that we can implement an improved structure in 2016.” The women’s and road commissions within the UCI are working “intensively” with event organisers and team owners “to establish a platform which literally - in the space of one season - will truly raise the standard.”</p> <p>Across the broader spectrum, Gaudry points out, “one of the great benefits we have in place is that some of the newer disciplines of cycling - mountain biking, BMX, cyclocross - we have a greater level of equity in place already because those disciplines are very largely built around a stage and a platform where men’s and women’s events are conducted together.” For those disciplines, Gaudry wants to continue build a higher profile so that all events benefit. It’s also about extending the length of women’s races “if that is feasible and what the women want”. Looking outside of the racing environment, it’s about “bringing more women into cycling - as directors, as coaches”.</p> <p>It has been said of Gaudry that, when she enters a room, she owns it. I reflect on the fact that changing that 114 years of history must be like turning the proverbial supertanker - but if there’s a woman who can take the helm and force through the changes that she, the stakeholders and the fans so desperately want to see in the sport, it is Tracey Gaudry, the woman who has been there, done it and got a drawerful of T-shirts.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://100tours100tales.wordpress.com/\">This article appeared first on 100 Tours 100 Tales</a><br />• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinagirl\">Follow Suze Clemitson on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p>","headline":"Tracey Gaudry interview: cycling's most powerful woman discusses the sport","trailText":"As a former professional cyclist and a vice president of the UCI, Gaudry can change women’s cycling for the better.

Nibali turned 30 last week and, reaching that milestone during a landmark year for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/27/vincenzo-nibali-tour-de-france-win\" title=\"\">Tour de France winner</a>, it seems natural he should remember his boyhood on the last day of his holiday. Sicily is a long way from Dubai, where Nibali is on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, but the memories tumble through him.</p> <p>For a while, at least, it hardly matters that his romantic story from the past is framed by a bleakly familiar backdrop of cycling controversy. We can even briefly set aside the uncomfortable fact that Nibali’s triumphant Tour has since been tainted by four positive drug tests for riders associated with his team, Astana, which is managed by Alexander Vinokourov, who was suspended for two years himsel after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/30/cycling.tourdefrance3\" title=\"\">blood doping in 2007</a>.</p> <p>“It’s true that my hero was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/16/guardianobituaries.cycling\" title=\"\">Marco Pantani</a>,” Nibali says as he recalls a compatriot who won both the Giro and the Tour in 1998 – a year scarred by the infamous Festina affair, which reduced the sport to a circus of cheating. Nibali was only 13 then and he struggled to understand the problems that engulfed his icon after Pantani’s immersion in doping led to isolation, depression and his eventual death.</p> <p>Everything that is tawdry and tragic about professional cycling can be found in the fate of Pantani, who died in 2004. But for the teenage Nibali, racing around Messina in Sicily, Pantani was simply <em>Il Pirata</em> (The Pirate). “I was only really interested in having fun,” Nibali says, “which meant cycling with my cousin and friends. Everyone wore the bandana like Pantani. Everyone wore his yellow shoes and kit.</p> <p>“All us kids had fun imitating Pantani. We loved his image but his style of climbing and sprinting fascinated us – and the way he kept his hands so low on the handlebars. We loved that cool style of riding.”</p> <p>I had heard that Nibali, as a boy, sold photographs he had taken of amateur races in Messina so he could buy a replica of Pantani’s skull-and-crossbones saddle. “Yes,” he exclaims in English before switching to Italian. “Absolutely. I did it so I could buy the saddle and other components. Then my dad started taking pictures of us riding and we could sell those too. It helped because the cost was really high.”</p> <p>Nibali’s extraordinary triumph this year marked the culmination of a long journey of sacrifice. In Sicily there had been few opportunities for an aspiring cyclist. Nibali had to leave home at 16 to travel to Tuscany and carve out a new life in the unforgiving world of road racing. It has taken him 14 long years but he is now only the sixth rider to have won all three grand tours (joining Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Alberto Contador). He had already conquered the Vuelta a España in 2010 and a snowy Giro d’Italia in 2013. In this summer’s Tour de France he finished 7min 37sec clear of the second-placed rider, Jean‑Christophe Péraud.</p> <p>“[Chris] Froome and Contador were ahead of me at the Critérium du Dauphiné [in June],” Nibali says, “but I arrived at the Tour in peak form. I did fantastic altitude training and I could feel it. Boom. I was in great shape. It was the first time I’d prepared for just one race and we saw the impact from the start.”</p> <p>Nibali’s face lights up as he remembers “the amazing first two days in Yorkshire. The crowds were incredible but they made the roads even narrower. There was stress – but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/06/tour-de-france-2014-vincenzo-nibali-late-attack-win-stage-two-video\" title=\"\">winning in Sheffield was beautiful</a>. I took the yellow jersey for the first time and I was very happy. Even if it seemed a bit soon I knew the significance. On that stage Froome attacked first – and then Contador came. I closed them down because we’d discussed it as a team. It was very important to win that day and take control, with your team car in front, for the cobble stage.”</p> <p>His stage two victory in Sheffield featured a clinical attack that suited his nickname. The Shark dominated the rest of the race. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/jul/09/tour-de-france-2014-chris-froome-crashes-out-stage-five-video\" title=\"\">Froome fell twice and retired</a> during the brutal fifth stage across 10 miles of rain-slicked cobbles while Nibali looked astonishingly controlled. “In the morning I was scared. But the first <em>pavé</em> was easier and gave me confidence. By the time I hit the third stretch, the really tough one, I felt ready. The rain meant you needed special bike-handling but it became better. I felt fantastic … afterwards.”</p> <p>Nibali always regarded Contador as his main rival – but he was in charge of the race when the Spaniard crashed on stage 10 and broke a leg. It is hard to believe either Contador or Froome could have beaten Nibali. He rode with supreme conviction and skill in one of the year’s great sporting performances – which made the subsequent controversy surrounding Astana so galling.</p> <p>Nibali should be credited for allowing over half of our two hours together to concentrate on doping. He shakes his head and grimaces when asked to describe his feelings after hearing last month that one of his nine team-mates at the Tour, <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/10/news/maxim-iglinskiy-doping-case-takes-gloss-astanas-stellar-worldtour-season_348318\" title=\"\">Maxim Iglinskiy, had tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO in early August</a>.</p> <p>“Apart from the obvious reaction – anger – my main feeling was that this was unbelievably stupid. It did not make any sense. He had just renewed his contract. He did not have a massive goal to chase. Our sponsors in Kazakhstan weren’t happy at all. We were in Kazakhstan the week after [at the Tour of Almaty] and there was such a feeling of betrayal because he is a Kazakh rider.”</p> <p>At the time Nibali said: “The mother of the imbecile is always pregnant.” He smiles sadly. “We say this in Italy but it sums up my feelings perfectly. The great things we’re trying to achieve can be jeopardised by a single rider. That’s why it’s so upsetting. One mistake can ruin so much. But I believe cycling is the cleanest sport because of all the doping controls.”</p> <p>Iglinskiy’s brother, Valentin, had already been suspended in September after failing a test for EPO. “Same family,” Nibali shrugs. The problem for Nibali is that Maxim Iglinskiy, if not his brother, was part of his Tour team. “Yes,” Nibali concedes. “But he was not part of my training team. I have a training team of seven and he was never part of it. The two other members of the team are chosen at the last minute. They are like a filler.”</p> <p>Did he speak to Iglinskiy after the positive result? “No,” Nibali exclaims. “He disappeared.”</p> <p>Nibali would love to win some of the Classics and it must infuriate him that, in 2012, he finished second to Iglinskiy in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. “Yes, yes,” Nibali says, raising his hands helplessly. “It’s normal to feel that. But the past is the past.”</p> <p>Last month, a third Astana rider, Ilya Davidenok, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">tested positive, this time for anabolic steroids</a>. “This guy is not from our team,” Nibali insists. “Astana has a satellite team of youngsters. It’s a completely different team. I dug up a little info on him because I didn’t even know who he was. I discovered he was racing with the Kazakh national team. So only the brothers were really associated with Astana and the Kazakhstan federation has been very tough on them. It’s right that they should.”</p> <p>On Wednesday it was announced that a second rider for Astana’s reserve team, Victor Okishev, had <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/11/news/fourth-astana-rider-turns-doping-positive_353629\" title=\"\">tested positive for steroids in May</a>. The catalogue of failed drugs tests could have severe ramifications for Astana in 2015.</p> <p>Does Nibali feel bitter that he has been tainted by association? “No. I’m just surprised. Today we have a biological passport, regular doping control, race controls. If you are doping, you will be caught. Even if the technique of doping can be advanced you will still be caught in another four years. It makes me laugh. Risking and cheating today is for stupid people.”</p> <p>Did he have any doubts signing for Vinokourov, the general manager? “No. I didn’t actually sign with Vino. I signed with the team owner and with Giuseppe Martinelli [Astana’s team-manager] who I know well. The key thing is that they agreed I would take my whole group. This gave me the opportunity to lead my own team.”</p> <p>Nibali smiles when asked if there is anything he could do differently. “If I think too much about the doubters it would not be good.”</p> <p>He is still tied to his deeply flawed hero, for Pantani was mentored and managed by Martinelli at Carrera and Mercatone Uno. During this year’s Tour de France <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/martinelli-believes-nibali-can-win-the-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Martinelli defended his reputation</a>. “I’ll never deny my past with Marco,” Martinelli said, “because I’ve pretty much nothing to worry about.”</p> <p>Pantani and Nibali are also linked by Emilio Magni who worked as a doctor at Mercatone Uno. Is Nibali still working with Magni? “Yes. He comes from [Nibali’s former team] Liquigas and I’ve been working with him only as my nutritionist. Magni just advises me what I need to eat – and when. He’s the key guy when it comes to weight and getting it down.”</p> <p>Magni and Nibali were both at Fassa Bortolo, before joining Liquigas – whom the rider represented until joining Astana in 2012. A judicial inquiry into doping at Fassa Bortolo was held in 2001 but Nibali stresses that Magni’s good reputation is completely intact. “In 2006 I started with Magni and I took him to Liquigas and I have been with him since. That’s all.”</p> <p>In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/liquigas-cannondale-deny-bertagnollis-dr-ferrari-claims\" title=\"\">Liquigas denied claims by one of their former riders, Leonardo Bertagnolli</a>, that he was given permission by team management to work with Dr Michele Ferrari – one of cycling’s most notorious figures. There have also been recent internet rumours that Ferrari might be in contact with people on the fringes of Nibali’s team. It is an allegation Nibali has quashed in the past.</p> <p>Nibali shakes his head when I ask him if he has ever met Ferrari himself. “No,” he says emphatically. How does he respond to the suggestion that members of his group might have met Ferrari recently? “Maybe in the past they did – but, for sure, not now. I don’t know anything about them seeing him.”</p> <p>Nibali moves on to safer terrain and confirms that his 2015 season will begin in February with the <a href=\"http://dubaitour.com/\" title=\"\">Tour of Dubai</a> – which he rode last year. “It’s great that cycling is becoming more international. And, for me, it’s especially good to start the year in Dubai. I like the race. The weather is perfect and in Europe, in February, you can’t really train. I will start very happily here in Dubai.”</p> <p>Will he consider an audacious attempt to emulate Pantani – the last man to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year? “It’s not decided yet. The chances are that Fabio Aru [his team-mate] will do the Giro and I’ll focus on the Tour. But I don’t want to close the door on the Giro yet.”</p> <p>Is it still possible to win both in the same year? “Nothing is impossible. Maybe it’s possible for older riders with the right approach. I think it’s doable but next year they have chosen a very hard Tour route.”</p> <p>He is more amused in dismissing the Russian team owner Oleg Tinkov, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/vuelta-a-espana/oleg-tinkov-offers-e1m-top-riders-ride-three-grand-tours-139113\" title=\"\">who offered €1m to cycling’s top four riders</a> – Nibali, Contador, Froome and Nairo Quintana – if they race all three grand tours in 2015. “I want to have a life and see my family too. I can understand the fans’ dream but the chance of anyone competing for all three is almost zero.”</p> <p>There is still time for Nibali to remember his tribute to Pantani after winning the Tour. “I decided near the end of the season to go to the Pantani museum and give them one of my jerseys. Not many people know I received a yellow jersey from Marco’s mother. It meant such a lot to me. It was the same when I went to the museum. I learned a lot about Marco that I didn’t know – that he liked painting. It was very good and touching to remember how much he meant to me as a kid.”</p> <p>Is Pantani still his hero – despite everything? “At the time he was my hero because he won the Giro and the Tour in the same year. It’s difficult to change your view of that hero even when you grow up. I was a kid but I saw the slow decline. I don’t really know what happened but, as a fan, it looked [as] if Pantani was a scapegoat. Everyone pointed a finger at him. That’s our general perception in Italy.”</p> <p>Nibali makes no further mention of Pantani or the Iglinskiy brothers as, after our interview, he charms everyone at a press conference to announce the new route of the Tour of Dubai. Late that afternoon, driving around Dubai with his wife, Rachele, and daughter Emma, it is striking to see Nibali at his most relaxed. In the back seat he blows raspberries on Emma’s neck, making her squeal with delight. The problems of cycling, and the enduring questions around Astana, recede briefly. Even the thought of turning 30 seems to please him – especially as the future seems more crammed with meaning than the fact that he has already won every grand tour.</p> <p>“I don’t think about it,” Nibali says in the fading desert sunlight. “Maybe later I will enjoy the significance but not now.

looks forward to and the fact that this event is taking place in the Lee Valley VeloPark makes this event extra special for us.</p> <p>“The crowd support during London 2012 was phenomenal and gave the

She will do so at the second round of the innovative and increasingly popular Revolution series in Manchester on Saturday. The event is designed to give fans the chance to see Britain’s best cyclists in action, across various disciplines including the longest lap race – which combines male and female riders. Elinor Barker and Amy Roberts compete alongside Roswell and tickets are available at <a href=\"http://cyclingrevolution.com/\" title=\"\">cyclingrevolution.com</a>.</p> <h2>GRUDGE MATCH ...</h2> <p>Tony Bellew looks for some payback against Nathan Cleverly three years since the latter successfully defended his WBO light-heavyweight title. They fight again, this time at cruiserweight on Saturday (Sky Sports Box Office, 6pm). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/16/nathan-cleverly-tony-bellew-boxing\" title=\"\">Their previous meeting also in Liverpool, in October 2011</a> was explosive and the fighters have been ratcheting up the tension in the buildup to the rematch, with Bellew noting that his opponent “will not want to enter a boxing ring after I have finished with him”. To which Cleverly countered :“There will be no final bell in this fight, it’s going to be brutal. Expect fireworks”. Indeed.</p> <h2>BOXING OLYMPIANS ...</h2> <p>Not so much a grudge match as the resumption of professional rivalry for the 2012 Olympic gold medallist Katie Taylor who continues her battle with Russia’s two-time Women’s World Champion Sofya Ochigava at the World Boxing Championships in Korea on Saturday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/katie-taylor-ireland-gold-medal-olympics\" title=\"\">Taylor beat Ochigava in the finals at London</a> and the 2012 world championships but only after a close fight, which is likely to be the case again here. Savannah Marshall, who experienced joy and despair in 2012 when she became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/19/savannah-marshall-boxing-world-champion\" title=\"\">Britain’s first women’s world boxing champion</a> with victory over Elena Vystropova but then, hampered by injury, was knocked out in the first round at the London games, is also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/31/savannah-marshall-hartlepool-boxing-south-korea\" title=\"\">a strong contender to defend her middleweight title</a>.</p> <h2>CUP CONCLUSION ...</h2> <p>Roger Federer has been in fine form this season and he will need to maintain that to have a shout at the only title to have eluded him. The one that got away is the Davis Cup and he and Switzerland have their chance against France in Lille (from Friday, Eurosport, 12.45pm). It will be a tough gig. Playing on clay in front of an expected home crowd of 27,000, France have five players from the world’s top 30 to choose from and defeated Davis Cup champions Czech Republic 4-1 in the semi-finals.</p> <h2>BIG MONEY FINAL ROUND ...</h2> <p>One last good walk spoiled for the cream of Europe’s golfers this week as the top 60 earners reach the final of the Race for Dubai at the DP World Tour Championship (from Thursday, Sky Sports 4, 8am). Finishing on a high will be important but so are the big beans on offer in the UAE. Rory McIlroy is on course to break the season prize money record he set when he won this event in 2012. He finished that year with £4,389,800. This season, with two majors under his belt, he has amassed £4,295,610. The total prize money on offer in Dubai is £5,104,250, including £850,688 for the winner.</p>","headline":"The Agenda: Jo Rowsell heads to Manchester for Revolution series","trailText":"Britain’s top cyclists will compete in round two of the Revolution series, while Tony Bellew faces Nathan Cleverly in Liverpool","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2014/11/15/1416067610425/Track-cycling---mens-team-006.jpg","wordcount":"541","commentable":"false","byline":"Giles Richards","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-18T16:09:37Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/15/the-agenda-jo-rowsell-manchester-revolution-series","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/nov/15/the-agenda-jo-rowsell-manchester-revolution-series","tags":[{"id":"sport/series/the-agenda","webTitle":"The Agenda","description":"Your guide to the week's best sports events, shows and new products.

UCI","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-14T11:58:58Z","sectionName":"Sport","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2014/nov/14/women-cyclists-pay-minimum-wage-uci-brian-cookson","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43azy","standfirst":"<p>• Premature to pass that rule, claims Brian Cookson<br>• Lizzy Armitstead had called for minimum wage</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Forcing professional cycling teams to pay female riders a minimum wage could be “counterproductive” and result in more women being paid nothing, according to the head of cycling’s governing body, the UCI.</p> <p>Last month the Olympic silver medallist and Commonwealth champion Lizzie Armitstead said it was “pretty crazy” that the best female cyclists in the world had to hold down <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/watch/tv-shows/sportswomen/news/9527167/lizzie-armitstead-calls-for-minimum-wage-for-female-cyclists\" title=\"\">part-time jobs to survive</a>.</p> <p>She called on the UCI to introduce a minimum wage – something the current UCI president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/24/cycling-brian-cookson-uci-pat-mcquaid\" title=\"\">Brian Cookson, promised to bring in within a year of his appointment</a> last September.</p> <p>But 14 months into the job Cookson, who was head of British Cycling for 16 years before joining the UCI, says he has been advised by women within the UCI that it would be “premature to pass that rule at this moment in time”.</p> <p>At the same time he suggested women’s races should be allowed to get longer and harder in order to make them more exciting to watch and ride.</p> <p>Speaking at an event at the Rapha store in Manchester on Thursday evening, Cookson said: “The women who have been involved in the Women’s Road Commission have told me that the result of that would not be 500 women suddenly being paid the minimum wage; they’ve told me that actually most of the teams that currently present themselves as professional teams would fold or re-register as amateur teams, so they wouldn’t end up paying those women anything at all anyway.”</p> <p>He added: “It’s a bit of a chick and an egg [situation], I’m told, and passing a simple rule at this point in time could potentially be counterproductive. But it does remain an important objective.”</p> <p>The minimum wage for male UCI World Tour cyclists is €35,000 (£27,800) per annum, with the average salary reported at €265,000 (£210,500) in 2012, according to Ernst &amp; Young. Discount the big earners and this figure would probably equate to €125,000-150,000 (£99,000-120,000), <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/a-blueprint-for-womens-road-cycling\" title=\"\">according to an estimate from Steve Beckett</a>, former head of cycling at British Sky Broadcasting. Female elite cyclists reportedly earn just €20,000 (£16,000) per annum – and those are the lucky ones.</p> <p>Cookson suggested women’s cycling should be split into two divisions – one “genuinely professional, which we will insist does pay a minimum wage”, and a “lower level”, which would not.</p> <p>“There is nothing to stop a women’s team from paying parallel salaries to men’s teams if they can do it, if they can raise the sponsorship. Passing a rule won’t do that,” he said.</p> <p>Women’s races could be made more difficult in order to make them more exciting to ride and watch, suggested Cookson. Currently UCI rules prevent elite women from riding more than 140km in a stage, compared to the maximum distances of 240-280km for men.</p> <p>He said: “There is no reason why women’s road races should not be harder and longer. Most women’s races are well within the distances in the regulations and it’s certainly something that we could look at.”</p> <p>But he suggested there can be an “over-simplistic knee-jerk reaction” to the problem. He said the original demand last year from <a href=\"http://totalwomenscycling.com/road-cycling/sportives/timeline-la-course-by-le-tour-de-france-came-31206/\" title=\"\">Le Tour Entier pressure group</a> – led by the four-time former Ironman world champion Chrissie Wellington with multiple world champion cyclists Marianne Vos and Emma Pooley – for a women to ride the same, full Tour de France route as the men was unrealistic.</p> <p>“I don’t think that would work,” he said. “The Tour de France organisers tried it to a lesser extent before and it was a disaster. If you suddenly did it one year it would be counterproductive, it would put back the development of women’s cycling … I would like to see a week-long women’s Tour de France, a challenging event, some mountain stages and so on. I think these things need to be changed incrementally.”</p> <p>He added: “People say: ‘Why don’t you insist that there is a women’s team associated with every men’s team?’ Well I don’t want women’s sport to always be secondary to men’s sport.

It has become an issue because of the popularity of cycling – in a way it takes headlines and awful accidents to really get the attention of the people that can make these decisions that can improve the environment for cycling,\" he said.</p><p>\"I remember [former Olympic champion] Chris Boardman saying change is painful and takes time and it's not going to be an easy process and I think he's absolutely right. To get to the stage where we're like Holland, Denmark or Germany where cycling is integrated into road provision, where there are plans put into place for cycling, where there are bike paths, junctions that are thoughtful for all traffic users, that will take time.\"</p><p>A huge surge in cycling popularity in recent years has resulted in almost half of the British population now owning a bike, more than 3 million people cycling at least three times a week and 750,000 people commuting to work on bikes, up from 90,000 in 2001, according to the census.</p><p>Hoy, who was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chris-hoy-more-cyclists-will-die-before-action-is-taken-by-mps-9537545.html\" title=\"\">speaking to the Independent on Sunday</a> at the launch of his own range of bikes, said  the conversation had changed as cycling safety moved up the agenda.</p><p>\"When the people in power realise the benefits of cycling in terms of reducing congestion and improving the health of the nation it seems like an obvious thing to do – but then I'm a cyclist. You want everyone – cyclists and drivers – to get from A to B as safely as possible,\" he said. \"Just the very fact that it's being discussed in the national press is a good start – we are getting somewhere but there is still a massive way to go.</p><p>\"We are a very congested small island, but all the more reason to putting cycling at the forefront. We can reduce the number of other vehicles on the road and get more bikes on the road.\"</p><p>In 2012, more than 3,200 cyclists were seriously injured on the road. There were 122 deaths including 13 children – a five-year high. Figures for 2013 are due in the coming weeks, and cycling safety groups will be pushing for further measures to make Britain's roads safer.</p><p>Speaking before the Tour de France, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/19/tour-de-france-yorkshire\" title=\"\">which begins on 5 July  in Yorkshire</a>, Hoy questioned why  former team-mate Bradley Wiggins  was being left out of the Tour de France lineup.</p><p>\"Everyone's disappointed. Everyone would love to see Bradley racing in the UK in the Tour but I suppose what we don't know is what goes on behind the scene with managers and inter-team relationship,\" he said.</p><p>\"Dave [Sir Dave Brailsford, the former British Cycling performance director now Team Sky general manager] must have decided the best chance of winning the Tour was with someone other than Bradley, which seems amazing when you think about it: how can you leave out someone with his pedigree and performance?\"</p><p>He added: \"But there's always method in Dave's madness. It's not to say he couldn't win it with Bradley, absolutely not, all teams would be crying out for someone like Bradley on their team but Dave has made that call with Chris Froome and the team around Chris that he feels can best support him to win the tour. It is a shame for the fans but sport is ruthless.</p><p>\"If Chris Froome is in yellow on the last day on the Champs Elysée I think people will forget that and say it was the right call to make.\"</p>","headline":"Chris Hoy: Britain has long way to go to become a cycling nation","trailText":"Olympic gold medallist says UK lags behind Denmark, Germany and Netherlands on cycling safety and calls on politicians to act","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402844404276/-Sir-Chris-Hoy-006.jpg","wordcount":"647","commentable":"true","byline":"Alexandra Topping","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-18T15:07:21Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/15/chris-hoy-cycling-safety-britain","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/jun/15/chris-hoy-cycling-safety-britain","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/chrishoy","webTitle":"Sir Chris Hoy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/chrishoy","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexandratopping","webTitle":"Alexandra Topping","r2ContributorId":"19530","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/alexandra_topping_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"topping","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alexandra Topping is a news reporter for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexandratopping","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alexandratopping","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","webTitle":"UK news","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-439479824","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/15/1402844395745/-Sir-Chris-Hoy-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","displayCredit":"true","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Bryn Lennon","altText":" Sir Chris Hoy","suppliersReference":"157112374","height":"54","credit":"Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","caption":" Sir Chris Hoy: 'It takes awful accidents to get the attention of the people that can make decisions that can improve the environment for cycling.'

The leader of the race wears a pink jersey, and so Hunter's ewes, selected from her flock of 350 because they were already well bonded with their lambs, had to be pink, too.</p><p>\"The Giro has never been here before and it's a big thing for us,\" says Hunter who, as well as running two family farms, sits on the local Moyle district council. \"The people who are going to come will be buying our milk and our beef, but they are also part of our future.

Never can a nation have been more grateful. Gerry Adams's arrest last week in connection to a notorious Troubles-era murder may have convulsed the media and political establishment, but for weeks now, in parts of the province, conversation has focused around \"the Giro\" and how best to prepare for it.</p><p>In Ballyhackamore, east Belfast, past which the riders will pedal twice on Friday evening's opening time trial event, several cafes, the hairdresser, optician's and even surveyor's office have pink window displays declaring \"Benvenuti\". The village of Bushmills, on the coastal route for Stage 2 on Saturday, has been festooned with pink bunting and chequered pink flags, while the village butcher has painted a cyclist on its window being chased by one of its home-bred Charolais bulls, which you can buy inside ready-filleted.</p><p>The cricket club in Armagh, through which the race will pass on Sunday's cross-border Stage 3, finishing in Dublin, has been given permission from the Northern Cricket Union to play in pink, rather than the regulation white. (The city's Catholic and Protestant cathedrals have also joined in moving their Sunday morning services to accommodate the race.)</p><p>Schools and churches have been festooned with ribbons, monuments have been painted pink, public buildings from Belfast city hall to Carrickfergus's Norman castle to the Ulster Museum will be illuminated with pink projections. At one point, there was even talk of Kilroot power station, situated on the mouth of Belfast lough and along the race route, belching out pink smoke, according to the local assembly member Alastair Ross.</p><p>Yorkshire may be hosting the start of the Tour de France in June, but that county already has its dales, its Brontës and, in York, the second-most popular city in England for tourists.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-436122407'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399311759303/A-sheep-with-dyed-pink-wo-013.jpg' alt='A sheep with dyed pink wool ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A sheep with dyed pink wool. Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>For Northern Ireland, still struggling to establish a post-Troubles identity 16 years after the Good Friday Agreement, a cycling race broadcast to 165 countries (and a potential audience of up to 800 million people) is a very big deal indeed – even if, with Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish giving the Giro a miss in favour of the Tour de France, only a tiny proportion of spectators will be able to name a single competitor.</p><p>\"This is the biggest event we have ever had in Northern Ireland,\" says Ross who, as private secretary to Arlene Foster, the province's trade and investment minister, was part of the initial delegation that travelled to Italy in 2012 to woo race organisers RCS Sport.</p><p>Last year's G8 conference, held in County Fermanagh, brought the world's news media to the province, \"but it wasn't something that local people got involved in,and it wasn't something everyone would necessarily be near. This race covers so much of Northern Ireland geographically and allows so many people to interact with it.\"</p><p>The Northern Ireland government paid £3m for the right to host the event, says Ross, and committed to a promotional campaign to support it. \"But already in terms of publicity we have had more than 10 times that in return.\"</p><p>But for all the enthusiasm, this is a part of the world where even the most carnivalesque parade has a capacity to turn political. There was early discontent when the race route was announced when it became apparent that while (mostly Protestant) east Belfast was well served, much of (mostly Catholic) west Belfast would be bypassed by the riders. \"What we will see is all other parts of the city being touched and being seen worldwide except west Belfast, and it is just not good enough,\" said local Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey.</p><p>Representatives from south Down, also a majority Catholic area, were similarly aggrieved that the race would bypass the Mourne mountain area.</p><p>Ross says the final decision on the route was taken by RCS Sport – it was their decision, for instance, to take the time trial up the steep mile-long driveway to the parliament buildings at Stormont –  but that \"from a tourism point of view we just wanted to make sure our main tourist locations were shown off\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-436122411'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399310539957/Giro-dItalia-009.jpg' alt='Giro d'Italia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A tractor and bicycle have been painted pink on the Giro d'Italia 2014 route via the Causeway Coastal Route. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>More serious was a bitter dispute over paramilitary murals, several of which will be passed by the riders along the route. Politicians from all parties struck a deal in February to remove campaign posters for the local and European elections from the route, in order to show the province \"in the best possible light\". But when Anna Lo, an assembly member for the cross-community Alliance party, suggested murals showing masked gunmen could also be painted over, she was met with a furious response that included, from some quarters, vicious racist abuse (Lo was born in Hong Kong and is a longstanding campaigner for ethnic minorities in the province).</p><p>East Belfast has an Alliance MP, Naomi Long, but after the party voted with nationalists to stop the union jack being flown every day from Belfast's city hall, sparking protests in December 2012, it is wildly unpopular in the area's loyalist estates. Last Tuesday evening, the party's Newtownards Road constituency office, past which the riders will cycle on Friday, was firebombed. The large pink cycle in the office window on the morning following the attacks was accompanied by panelling over the broken windows and scorch marks.</p><p>\"The abuse I have got [since the flags protest] is taking a toll,\" says Lo. \"I have a lot of really foul abuse, really degrading abuse online. I have been having threats made against me, picked up by the police. There was also a spent bullet and a photograph of me sent to a Sunday paper. My stand is still the same, that I am not going to be silenced by the bullies, but it is relentless.\"</p><p>She doesn't regret her comments on the murals on the race route, however. \"Not at all, no. I stand by it. It's a great occasion for Northern Ireland to showcase what a beautiful place it is and that we have moved past the days of the Troubles. But there is still a small element of people here who are stuck in the past and only really concerned about sectarian politics.  Many local people themselves don't like the murals, she says, but fear intimidation if they speak out.</p><p>\"The first time we heard anything about the Giro was when Anna Lo popped up to say 'We don't want these images of paramilitarism being displayed around the world',\" says David Stitt. The former loyalist prisoner who now runs Charter NI, a community organisation promoting education and peacebuilding among working class Protestant communities He condemns the firebombing and abuse directed at Lo, but passionately disagrees with her. \"Those murals have been there for 25 years. To us, that's part of our culture. The conflict is part of our history here and you just can't airbrush it away.\"</p><p>As he notes, the murals are themselves a major tourist attraction, even if locals benefit little from the tour buses that frequently pause outside his office window, which is also on the race route.</p><p>\"The Giro d'Italia coming through here, it's a good start. But it'll showcase in this area the fact that there's no infrastructure here,\" says Stitt, who claims the tourist and business development at the Titanic quarter, in the east Belfast docklands that were once this area's major employers, have seen millions spent in their area from which local people are effectively locked out. More work needs to be done, he says, to ensure the dividends of the peace process reach the communities that were worst affected by the Troubles.</p><p>And yet, despite inevitable bumps in the road, the race's arrival in the province represents progress that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago, according to Ross. After passing the heart of loyalist east Belfast, where the Presbyterian church has hoisted a bright pink cycle at its front window, the riders will race to the Catholic Lower Ormeau Road, passing the memorial to five people shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in 1992. In the windows of the Hatfield House bar, next door, are two pink bicycles, and the tricolour flags flying from its flagpoles are not Irish, but Italian.</p>","headline":"Northern Ireland gears up for Giro d'Italia cycling race","trailText":"<p>Even the sheep are getting a makeover to welcome cyclists passing through the province in illustrious road race</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399310535045/Giro-dItalia-004.jpg","wordcount":"1619","commentable":"true","byline":"Esther Addley","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-08T17:31:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/05/northern-ireland-giro-italia-cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/may/05/northern-ireland-giro-italia-cycling","tags":[{"id":"uk/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Ireland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/northernireland","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/estheraddley","webTitle":"Esther Addley","rcsId":"GNL004644","r2ContributorId":"15635","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/26/addley_esther140x140.jpg","firstName":"esther","lastName":"addley","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Esther Addley is senior news writer at the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/estheraddley","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/estheraddley","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-436122406","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399310532111/Giro-dItalia-001.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"Guardian","photographer":"Martin Godwin","altText":"Giro d'Italia","height":"54","credit":"Martin Godwin/Guardian","caption":"A tractor and bicycle have been painted pink on the Giro d'Italia 2014 route via the Causeway Coastal Route.

The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p>","headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn","trailText":"<p><strong>Andrew Mulligan</strong> watches Jacques Goddet preside over the annual national jamboree that is the Tour de France</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372335911794/Sunbathing-Tour-de-France-005.jpg","wordcount":"684","commentable":"true","byline":"Andrew Mulligan","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-07-27T11:20:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/29/jacques-goddet-director-tour-de-france-cycle-race","tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/tourdefrance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/tourdefrance","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/france","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/agenda","webTitle":"Agenda","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/agenda","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","webTitle":"The New Review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/from-the-observer-archive","webTitle":"From the Observer archive","description":"Historic articles from the Observer archive.

Obree, described as a genius by Sir Chris Hoy, possessed huge natural talent and drive, but a series of factors – not least his refusal to touch the drugs then prevalent in the sport – cut short his career in the 1990s and he slipped into relative obscurity and intermittent depression.</p><p>Now at 47, he plans to try for the world human-powered land speed record on a machine which he rides head first, just above the ground. If that wasn't enough, the bike was almost entirely built in his kitchen from recycled parts, including metal from an old saucepan.</p><p>The idea that a self-built steel-framed creation, which Obree estimates cost around £1,000 to build, could tackle the 82.8 mph record set in 2009 by a Canadian rider using a computer-modelled, carbon fibre-shelled recumbent machine, seems ludicrous. But this is well-trodden ground for Obree, one of the more creative, bloody-minded and enigmatic characters in British sport.</p><p>The Ayrshire-based rider achieved fame from seemingly nowhere in July 1993 when he broke the world one-hour cycle distance record at a Norwegian velodrome, using a self-built bike, Old Faithful. This incorporated a self-created, highly aerodynamic tuck position as well as, famously, ballbearings borrowed from a washing machine.</p><p>Obree retook his record the following year, also winning a track world championship title on Old Faithful. When cycling's governing body, the UCI, outlawed the tuck stance, Obree came back with an equally creative alternative, the stretched out \"Superman\" position, to win another world title.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531352'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372165923377/Graeme-Obree-1996-Olympic-010.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree 1996 Olympics' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree competes during the preliminary round of the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

It is arguably paradoxical to describe a man whose autobiography, The Flying Scotsman, was made into a film staring Jonny Lee Miller, as an unsung hero, but Obree never notched up the titles and fame of his peers, such as Chris Boardman.</p><p>Obree's sole Olympics, in 1996, saw him exit in the preliminary rounds. His career with a French professional road cycling team lasted one day. Obree has always maintained he was sacked when he made it clear he would not use drugs.</p><p>He has endured a turbulent personal life, affected by self-criticism and depression, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Obree came out as gay a couple of years ago, something he says has contributed to his happiness. His decision to do so is still relatively unusual in professional sport.</p><p>He reinvented himself as an author and a speaker, and just over two years ago began plotting an attempt at the human-powered bike speed record. Rather than adapt one of the feet-first recumbent bikes traditionally used for such bids, Obree, typically, started from scratch.</p><p>The result is the Beastie, in which the rider lies face down and head forward, with his or her feet powering a pair of narrower push-pull levers rather than conventional pedals.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531353'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372166249301/Graeme-Obree-001.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree' width='220' height='424' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree on the sea front in Ayrshire in 2007. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"The idea came from first principles,\" Obree said. \"The widest part of the body is the shoulders, so if you think about a teardrop shape it makes sense to have that at the front, and the feet‚ with the push-pull, meaning they just miss each other at the narrowest part, at the back.</p><p>\"The first thing I had to do was the basic outline of the structure. The body's the one thing you can't change. Everything else was built around that mechanically.\"</p><p>The Beastie was built mainly in Obree's small flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with excursions to a friend's workshop. The steel frame came primarily from old bikes, and as many other components as possible were recycled. Stainless steel from an old saucepan became part of a shoulder rest.</p><p>Such a process was necessary, given the innovative design. Obree said: \"It was one of those things where I didn't know exactly what I wanted until I could see how it came into shape. If you're building it yourself you can make all the fine changes as you go along. If it's done by someone else, when it comes back you'll go: 'Oh, that's wrong,' and it could take weeks to fix. But doing it myself, in my own flat, the same process could take an hour.\"</p><p>Obree has tried out the machine once, wobbling to a modest 30mph or so on a runway at Prestwick airport, without the aerodynamic fairing, as he got used to the low-slung machine's twitchy ride. \"The main thing was, once I was launched I could hold a relatively straight line,\" he said. \"That's good to know. I'd say the test was pretty successful in terms of mechanical parts working. The skin's fine, the bike's steerable, nothing fell off.\"</p><p>In September Obree and the Beastie will decamp to a super-smooth, high altitude road in Nevada for the annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge. He is promising nothing. \"All I can do is go and give it a good punt,\" he said. However, a record would bring renewed recognition.</p><p>The temptation is to create a narrative in which this would be vindication for a man denied the celebrity of Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins thanks to petty officialdom and the endemic drug taking of early 1990s cycling. <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/36717-graeme-obree-interview-part-2-doping-olympics-uci-regulations-and-future-projects\" title=\"\">Obree, typically, doesn't see it that way</a>.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways I wouldn't like to be as famous as Bradley Wiggins. I think that would be totally awful, actually, getting stopped in the street everywhere. I get it occasionally but it's quite polite, it's nice. It's not a crowd of people around you, like Chris Hoy gets. I wouldn't want that level of fame.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Obree says he is glad the post-Lance Armstrong cycling era is more ready to hear his story: \"I've got no regret about not taking drugs. But I obviously wonder how I'd have got on at the Tour de France. That was what I was lined up for. But that wasn't my overriding goal from the start, my goal was a world record, so I got that, and the world championships. The Olympics got away, obviously. And it would have been great to get Olympic gold and, say, a Tour de France stage win. But hey ho.</p><p>\"And you know what? I escaped with my health and my honour. In a lot of ways I don't have any regrets.\"</p><p></p><h2>An innovative man</h2><p>To get a sense of the extent to which Graeme Obree likes to re-think the very fundamentals of his sport, consider his self-penned 2012 training manual, The Obree Method. Inside is an entire chapter about how to adapt your breathing so as to absorb more oxygen (it's all to do with the out-breaths).</p><p>Craig MacLean, who competed on the velodrome for Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, recalls first meeting Obree at track competitions in the early 1990s.</p><p>\"He thinks about everything in a very unconventional way. There's some ideas about training he gave me which I still use today. Cycling is almost like a big experiment for him.</p><p>\"He was a bit of a maverick around that era. Cycling was very much a traditional sport ‚you only ever rode fixed gear in the winter and you had to do a certain number of miles before you were allowed back on your normal road bike, all these things that had been around since the dark ages. But he always did things differently.\"</p>","headline":"Flying Scotsman Graeme Obree returns with beastly bid at another world record","trailText":"Cycling's unsung hero to take on human powered speed contest on the Beastie, which he built from recycled parts in his kitchen","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3gp28","wordcount":"1223","commentable":"true","byline":"Peter Walker","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-06-28T14:13:20Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jun/25/flying-scotsman-graeme-obree-cycling-beastie","tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"sport/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","references":[]},{"id":"environment/bike-blog","webTitle":"Bike blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on all things cycling - in the UK and around the world","type":"blog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/world-records","webTitle":"World records","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world-records","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world-records","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peterwalker","webTitle":"Peter Walker","r2ContributorId":"19159","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/peter_walker_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"walker","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Walker is a reporter for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>,  a position he has held since late 2006.

That's all I can say.\"</p><p>Winfrey's network OWN said Armstrong agreed to a \"no-holds-barred\" interview. \"Amstrong will address the alleged doping scandal, years of accusations of cheating and charges of lying about the use of performance-enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career,\" the network said in a statement.</p><p>The interview is set to air Thursday at 9pm eastern time in the US on the Oprah Winfrey Network and will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/09/lance-armstrong-interview-oprah-winfrey\">streamed live internationally on Oprah.com.</a></p><p>Armstrong has continued to maintain his innocence, but is facing several legal challenges, and has lost millions of dollars in sponsorship deals and endorsements.

But as for so many other tarnished public figures, the journey of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong will next week end opposite Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Winfrey has confirmed that Armstrong, who in October was stripped of all his titles and labelled a \"serial drug cheat\" by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), will seek redemption on her show.</p><p>In a 90-minute interview from his home in Austin, Texas, he will speak publicly for the first time about the doping revelations that led to a lifetime ban from sport. It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2am UK time.</p><p>It is the first time Armstrong has given an interview since he lost his titles, was dropped by sponsors and pilloried by the public for his part in a doping conspiracy that spanned more than a decade and was described in excoriating detail in a 202-page report by Usada.</p><p>Within hours, bookmakers were offering odds on which words Armstrong would use in the interview, with Ladbrokes quoting 1-4 on \"apologise\" and evens on \"confess\". They were offering 8-11 on Armstrong breaking down in tears.</p><p>Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/19/travis-tygart-us-anti-doping-lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview last month</a> that he hoped an Armstrong confession could yet act as a powerful symbol for drug-free sport.</p><p>But others, including another former cycling drug cheat who has since become a respected anti-doping campaigner, immediately voiced concerns that a stage-managed talkshow was not the right forum to discuss claims that as recently as October Armstrong's lawyer was dismissing as a \"one-sided hatchet job\".</p><p>\"Only Lance would get to have his moment of truth, if that's what it will be, in front of Oprah Winfrey,\" said British cyclist David Millar, who was banned for two years in 2004 for injecting EPO at a time when doping was rife in the professional peloton.</p><p>\"It is not sitting in front of a judge or a disciplinary hearing being properly questioned about the things he has done wrong. I doubt very much it will be a proper interrogation,\" added Millar, who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency's athletes commission. \"My biggest concern is that it will be completely stage-managed, that he will just be 'given the ball', and that it will all be about his emotions rather that concentrating on exactly what he did wrong.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Oprah show said Armstrong was not being paid to appear and that Winfrey was free to ask any question she wanted. \"No payment for the interview. No editorial control, no question is off limits,\" the spokeswoman said in an email.</p><p>The Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), which will show the programme, is a joint venture between Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Discovery Channel. Discovery was the headline sponsor of Armstrong's team between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>It was that network's logo that was emblazoned on his shirt when he won his seventh Tour in 2005 and claimed it as a victory over \"the people that don't believe in cycling, the cynics and the sceptics\". Discovery was a vocal supporter of Armstrong and one of the last sponsors to distance itself from the Texan once Usada's damning evidence was published.</p><p>Former colleagues and rivals immediately began speculating on whether Armstrong would use the programme as a platform for contrition or an attempt to shift the blame. Armstrong had previously told a US tribunal that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs, opening up the possibility that he could perjure himself if he now admitted doping.</p><p>The Texan is at the centre of several ongoing legal disputes, while the Sunday Times is suing him for the repayment of a libel settlement the newspaper was forced to pay him over doping allegations.</p><p>Many fear Winfrey will give Armstrong an easy ride, recalling her interview with Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones, in which the weeping American sprinter claimed she took performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally.</p><p>Kathy LeMond, wife of the US Tour de France winner Greg, tweeted: \"@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview. I know people that can help you.\"</p><p>Since Usada published its \"reasoned decision\" in October, ratified some weeks later by cycling's much criticised global governing body, the UCI, Armstrong has been deserted by a succession of high-profile supporters and sponsors, including Nike, and lost millions of pounds' worth of endorsements. He has also stepped down from his position as chairman of Livestrong, the charity he established to help fellow sufferers after winning his battle with testicular cancer.</p><p>Reports in the US at the weekend suggested he was considering making a confession and wanted to negotiate with the World Anti-Doping Agency over his ability to compete in the field of triathlon and running events.</p>","headline":"Lance Armstrong breaks his silence and agrees to appear on Oprah","trailText":"<p>Intense speculation that cyclist will admit doping in interview to be streamed on chatshow star's website</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/9/1357759324861/Lance-Armstrong-005.jpg","wordcount":"808","commentable":"true","byline":"Owen Gibson, chief sports correspondent","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2013-01-12T19:26:00Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/09/last-summit-lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2013/jan/09/last-summit-lance-armstrong-oprah-winfrey","tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/lance-armstrong","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","webTitle":"Oprah Winfrey","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oprah-winfrey","references":[]},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/cycling","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/us-television","webTitle":"US television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/us-television","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/us-television","references":[]},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/television","references":[]},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/us-sport","references":[]},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","references":[]},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owengibson","webTitle":"Owen Gibson","rcsId":"GNL481697","r2ContributorId":"16214","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682482177/Owen-Gibson.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png","firstName":"owen","lastName":"gibson","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Gibson is the Guardian's chief sports correspondent.
