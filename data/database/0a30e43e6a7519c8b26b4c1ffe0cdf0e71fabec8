        "body":"<p>Only one of three Burgess brothers will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy in Salford on Saturday. Sam Burgess, the eldest and most established of the three siblings included in the squad, has been named at loose-forward with George, one of the 21-year-old twins, on a seven-man interchange bench.</p><p>Tom Burgess, who only forced his way into the South Sydney team late in the National Rugby League season and was therefore a surprise inclusion in the England squad, is one of two players, along with Zak Hardaker of Leeds, who drop into a Knights team to face Samoa in the first part of a double header at the City of Salford Stadium.</p><p>Perhaps significantly, Hardaker is listed at centre, rather than at full-back, where he has played all season for Leeds – suggesting that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him as a possible contender for that position, which has become a problem area since the loss of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed through injury.</p><p>McNamara has switched Carl Ablett, another Leeds player who has spent most of the season in the second row, to the centre against Italy, where he will be partnered by Huddersfield's Leroy Cudjoe, with the fourth centre contender, Kallum Watkins, on the interchange bench.</p><p>Other eye-catching and potentially significant selections are Tom Briscoe ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing and Michael McIlorum ahead of James Roby at hooker. But McNamara will be anxious to avoid giving too much away to Australia's coach, Tim Sheens, who has chosen not to arrange a warm-up game in the run-in to the tournament opener, between England and the Kangaroos, at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday week.</p><p>Two members of England's 24-man squad were not considered – Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who has played only two matches in the past two months because of achilles problems, and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood, who is suspended.</p><h2>England team to play Italy, Saturday 4.30pm</h2><p>S Tomkins (Wigan); Briscoe (Hull), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ablett (Leeds), Hall (Leeds); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (Leeds, capt); Graham (Canterbury), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), S Burgess (South Sydney). Interchange: Charnley (Wigan), Watkins (Leeds), Widdop (Melbourne), Burrow (Leeds), Hill (Warrington), Roby (St Helens), G Burgess (South Sydney).</p><p>England Knights (v Samoa, Saturday 2pm): Makinson (St Helens); Thornley (Wigan), Jones (St Helens), Hardaker (Leeds), Cockayne (Wakefield); Sarginson (London Broncos), Powell (Wigan); T Burgess (South Sydney), Hodgson (Hull KR), Taylor (Wigan), Ferres (Huddersfield), Whitehead (Catalan Dragons), Crosby (Wigan).

        "headline":"World Cup in push for record crowds at Millennium Stadium double-header",
        "body":"<p>World Cup organisers have stepped up their big push for the opening ceremony and double-header in Cardiff on Saturday week, and are increasingly confident of approaching or even beating the 41,271 crowd attracted to the first game of the successful 1995 tournament at Wembley.</p><p>Taking the launch well away from league's northern heartlands, as part of a deal with the Welsh Assembly under which Wales are co-hosting the tournament with England, was always a risk, albeit with the bonus of the roof at the Millennium Stadium to avoid a repeat of the damp squib at Twickenham that set the tone for the mostly miserable World Cup when it was last staged in Europe 13 years ago.</p><p>England will again kick off the tournament against Australia, this time followed by Wales's opening game against the World Cup debutants Italy, and ticket sales have remained some distance behind those for the other two major events – the semi-finals at Wembley, which will also be played as a double header on 23 November, and the final at Old Trafford the next Saturday, which is almost guaranteed to be sold out. But they had already started to pick up considerably before advertising was stepped up after the Super League Grand Final, and are now understood to have passed the 34,157 who watched the opening ceremony of the last World Cup, in Sydney five years ago.</p><p>The tournament's television deal with the BBC has delivered an unexpected benefit as, in addition to the regular Saturday afternoon kick-offs favoured by the terrestrial broadcaster – but generally eschewed by Sky – the corporation has allowed organisers to incorporate a Strictly Come Dancing section in the opening ceremony, including the former Great Britain wing Martin Offiah.</p><p>The ceremony will be hosted by Gethin Jones, <a href=\"http://www.barla.org.uk/news/Details.asp?id=589\" title=\"\">who once played for the St Helens amateur team Blackbrook in his role as a Blue Peter presenter</a>, and will also include the former Wales and Crusaders centre Gareth Thomas, one of more than 1,500 performers, as well as Catrin Finch, a former royal harpist – definitely a rugby league first.</p><p>\"We've promised to put on the greatest show rugby league has ever seen,\" said Sally Bolton, the World Cup's general manager, with the first official announcements of ticket sales expected on Thursday.</p><p>However the England and Wales squads have happily shouldered their share of the responsibility for providing the tournament with an upbeat launch, in the style of 1995 when England's victory over Australia at Wembley set the tone for a memorable month to celebrate the code's centenary. England's coach, Steve McNamara, will give a hint of his plans for Cardiff on Thursday when he names a 20-man squad for Saturday's warm-up game against Italy, after a 10-day training camp in South Africa.</p><p>Wales have been no further than Colwyn Bay, but their coach Iestyn Harris was especially pleased by the performance of Warrington's Bridgend-born centre Rhys Evans in a trial match on Tuesday night. Evans only recently agreed to play alongside his twin brother Ben, a second-row now with Bradford, having previously made himself available for England, and Harris said: \"Rhys gives us some pace in the backs and a little bit of movement that we perhaps didn't have before. He's settled into the team extremely well and I thought he looked really sharp.\"</p><p>Harris's options will be further boosted by the arrival of Tyson Frizell, a 22-year-old former Australia rugby union schools forward who represented his Welsh ancestry twice in the 2011 Four Nations series, and has made an unexpectedly quick recovery from injury to join the World Cup squad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420151113|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|dbe0e66667a7e99c6a999a163fd4388c59b26ef5 -->",

The Italy game could be especially significant for Widdop, who has made an unexpectedly quick recovery after suffering a dislocated hip in June but has made only two appearances in four months. \"I was there at the game when he suffered the injury and I didn't think he had a cat in hell's chance,\" said McNamara. Now he has the chance to press his claims either as a half-back option or possibly at centre.</p><p>McNamara will select 20 of his 24-man squad to be used in a game likely to be played with unlimited interchanges, meaning it will not have full international status.</p><p>Two more players are likely to drop into the England Knights team who will face Samoa in a potentially intriguing curtain-raiser, along with Brett Ferres, the Huddersfield forward who was taken to South Africa as cover in case any members of the original 24 are injured before the tournament.</p><p>Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who played his first match in more than a month in the Super League Grand Final on 5 October, was not considered, to give him an extra week to ensure a full recovery from his achilles problems, and the Warrington forward Ben Westwood is serving a one-match suspension for punching Blake Green at Old Trafford.</p><p>\"None of our Australian-based players were available for the tournament we had at the end of last year [against Wales and France] or the Exiles match we had in June, so it is important that we fit them back in,\" said McNamara. \"We're excited about playing a game. We don't play enough games as England as it is and Italy will be completely new opposition for us.</p><p>\"We've done some quality work out here in South Africa. That was the whole purpose of getting away. But it was important for us to play a game.</p><p>\"Each international team has their own way of preparing – Australia's is different from quite a few countries but that's not saying it's right or wrong. It's important for us that we come back from South Africa and play on the Saturday afternoon, because that gives us a seven-day turnaround before Cardiff and our whole tournament is based around Saturdays, so we can get into that routine.\"</p><p>The England squad will fly back into Manchester on Wednesday, with the Kangaroos due 24 hours earlier. They have not organised a warm-up match, with Sheens happy that an intense practice session will prove as valuable as England's game against an Italy team who will be making their World Cup debut – also at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday week, against Wales in the second match of the opening double-header – and who McNamara admits are very much an unknown quantity.</p><p>They include several recognisable and high-calibre names, led by Anthony Minichiello, the Sydney Roosters full-back who was a Grand Final winner against Manly last weekend and won 19 Australia caps between 2003-05. He is relishing the opportunity of playing alongside his younger brother Mark, a second-row with the Gold Coast Titans, and Italy also include the St Helens forward Anthony Laffranchi and the Newcastle Knights prop Kade Snowden in a team boasting plenty of senior experience.</p><p>But they have suffered a major blow to what was already fragile credibility, given their almost total reliance on Australians and a corresponding lack of authenticity – partly as a result of a split between two domestic competitions in Italy – with the late withdrawals of Terry Campese, Vic Mauro and Craig Gower, the latter a former Italy rugby union international.</p><p>Other warm-up games next weekend include New Zealand against the Cook Islands in Doncaster, with a possible appearance by Sonny Bill Williams following his late decision to make himself available for the Kiwis' title defence; Scotland versus Papua New Guinea in Featherstone; and France against the United States in Toulouse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929973|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|139393515864fe768b882751bc2d5108d4f9e0b5 -->",

But I understand, with the situation of staying in league, that might not be an option. </p><p>\"But it's good to have made my intentions clear for the next three years. I wanted to put it all out there as I am overhearing what I am going to do as everyone else.\" </p><p>Controversy is never far from Williams and even his decision to play in the upcoming league World Cup involved a backflip on his original plan and another player being dropped.</p><p>With Williams also hoping to feature in the New Zealand sevens team at the 2016 Olympics, he said he had decided to put his boxing career on hold. </p><p>\"I won't have the time to box in the next three years,\" he said.  The NZRU had better luck in their negotiations with All Blacks No8 Kieran Read and lock Sam Whitelock, who on Sunday announced they had committed to playing on with the national team and Canterbury Crusaders until 2017.<br /> <br />\"The fact that two world-class players in Kieran and Sam have re-signed for four more years is a huge positive for the All Blacks,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said in a news release. </p><p>\"Not only are they part of the current success of the team, but it means we have a nucleus of experienced players to take the team into the future beyond 2015, which is fantastic.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419814857|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|03be43a8a5a7f90493f5b681c15f6dfd6c87b086 -->",

        "body":"<p>Wigan have welcomed suggestions from Australia that they will be offered the chance to become the first British team to play a World Club Challenge fixture in Sydney for almost 40 years.</p><p>The Super League champions have enjoyed home advantage in each of the 14 games against Australasia's champion club team since the challenge was revived in 2000. But now the Sydney Roosters, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\" title=\"\">won the National Rugby League Grand Final by beating Manly last weekend</a>, are said to be receptive to the idea of hosting the fixture.</p><p>\"We would love to go to Sydney,\" said Wigan's chairman, Ian Lenagan. \"Wigan were the last British club to play in Australia, with that great win against the Broncos in Brisbane in 1994, so this would be an elegant way to celebrate the 20th anniversary. The practicalities aren't marvellous, but we would be delighted to find a way around them.\"</p><p>The Roosters were the last Sydney team to stage the challenge, when they were known as Eastern Suburbs and beat St Helens 25-2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1976.  That was the first World Club Challenge, and since then it has been held only once in Australia – when Wigan claimed their famous victory in Brisbane in 1994.</p><p>English clubs – most often Leeds, who have played in five of the last six games – have regularly urged the Australian authorities to show more enthusiasm for the concept, rather than complaining about the odds being stacked against them when they swapthe southern-hemisphere summer for a one-off game in February in the north of England.</p><p>That has not stopped Australian dominance of the fixture, with four wins in the last five years. But Andrew Hill, the NRL's general manager, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph: \"There is a strong consideration for the game to be played in Australia.\"</p><p>Hull have made a rare signing from English rugby union, recruiting Tom Biggs, a Bath wing who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens team but was born in east Yorkshire, on a three-year contract.</p><p>Sam Burgess has welcomed the surprise inclusion of Sonny Bill Williams in New Zealand's World Cup squad. The South Sydney forward, who is currently in South Africa with his younger twin brothers Tom and George at England's training base in Potchefstroom, has relished <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-dhEcvkY7U&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">two clashes with Williams in derbies between the Rabbitohs and the Roosters this season</a>.</p><p>\"He's one of the best players in the world so I'm certainly looking forward to that,\" said Burgess. \"I'll stick within the structure here and hopefully not go stray far out and go looking for him. But if it arises in the middle of the game, I'm sure neither me nor him will shy away from the confrontation.\"</p><p><em>• England will kick off their Rugby League World Cup 2013 campaign against Australia on 26 October at the Millennium Stadium.

The  29-year-old wing, who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens teams, fits with the declared intention of the club's chairman, Adam Pearson, and newly promoted coach, Lee Radford, to emphasise homegrown talent in the squad, following the successful models of Wigan and Leeds.</p><p>Biggs, who is from Beverley, attended Hymers College in Hull, and has supported the black and whites all his life, said: \"I think it is a big challenge in a sport that I've never played before, but it's one that I'm really excited about.\"</p><p>Radford, who has taken over from Peter Gentle after the Australian was sacked following an emphatic play-off defeat at Huddersfield, said: \"Tom looked very comfortable and competent playing in rugby union, but it was his enthusiasm about the prospect of leaving that to join Hull FC and the challenge in store that excited me.</p><p>\"He could quite easily remain set on his current deal in union, but he was keen to have the opportunity to test himself in rugby league and play for us.</p><p>\"He is a local lad and an FC supporter, which you can see means a lot to him, and we're hoping we can nurture that enthusiasm to help him make a positive transition into our sport, which I am sure he will excel in.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419533795|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|72af60ebfa9394c6a8e209f85f5d0a1a73c82f84 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rugby league's rift deepened on Wednesday when the players' union backed the revolt led by the Wigan owner, Ian Lenagan, whose actions were then roundly condemned by a rival chairman as \"self-centred\".</p><p>Evidence that the game is in danger of tearing itself apart over plans for a major restructuring surfaced when the Halifax chairman, Michael Steele, launched a stout defence of the Rugby Football League, while 1eagu3, the body representing Super League players, gave its robust support to the rebellion.</p><p>Ernie Benbow, the chief executive of 1eagu3, welcomed the decision of the governing body to postpone Wednesday's extraordinary general meeting which was expected to ratify a convoluted proposal to introduce two divisions of 12 teams, dividing into three of eight after 23 rounds, from 2015.</p><p>The RFL bowed to pressure from a majority of disgruntled Super League clubs, led by Lenagan, to put off any decision on restructuring until after the World Cup.</p><p>In a statement, 1eagu3 said: \"We are delighted that sense has prevailed and the EGM to vote in the RFL's preferred restructuring proposal has been postponed following a revolt by a majority of the Super League clubs.</p><p>\"The league structure is not the central problem. There is nothing inherently wrong with the wonderful, simple yet totally enthralling, compelling and thrilling sport of rugby league.</p><p>\"Given the expertise delivering clear commercial success at some of the games' top clubs we would urge those Super League clubs in that category to show leadership, take charge of the commercial strategy, grasp the opportunity and move the game forward with vision.\"</p><p>A poll of Super League players overwhelmingly rejected the RFL's preferred restructuring option and 1eagu3 says it detailed its opposition in a formal written submission on 5 September, arguing that the extra matches would increase the burden on players.</p><p>Benbow said: \"The game as a whole is seriously under-sold and undervalued.</p><p>\"The players, our members, are often neglected but are indeed the crown jewels in the process of moving the game to a level at which it deserves to be.</p><p>\"We welcome this pause for further debate and consultation. On the main issue within the game, the lack of revenue, almost all [97% of members in a recent player poll] felt that the marketing of the game is simply not good enough.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Steele said his club were ready to vote for the RFL's proposals after being fully consulted throughout the review process and claimed Lenagan demonstrated a lack of understanding in claiming in a letter to other Super League clubs that they were being undermined by the process.</p><p>In a statement, Steele said: \"At all times, throughout that process, we have been aware of, and supported, the purpose of the exercise which is to create a vibrant, player-focused structure which serves the whole game from children playing in community clubs to the outstanding professional athletes in the English national side.</p><p>\"As such, we were content to support the adoption of the review conclusions and move on from the EGM to their implementation in time for the 2015 season.</p><p>\"There is nothing in Mr Lenagan's letter of objection which leads us to alter that conclusion. Indeed, we find his analysis self-centred and wrong.</p><p>\"Contrary to his assertions, rugby league does not belong to a minority of successful Super League clubs, neither is the review over-hasty or misdirected. It represents a genuine attempt to secure long-term growth of the greatest game to the benefit of all who play it, support it or watch it.</p><p>\"We find it surprising that an active chairman of a leading club can have reached this point with as little understanding as Mr Lenagan claims.</p><p>\"We look forward to the reconvening and successful conclusion of the EGM after the delivery of a memorable RLWC 2013.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419530126|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|f609fec1bce77c42e7914e7ceebd183355d156db -->",
