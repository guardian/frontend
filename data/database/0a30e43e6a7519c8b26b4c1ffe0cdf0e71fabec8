But in what was a gripping grand final (a shade off a classic, I'd argue, given the number of errors) they found a way to win. That's premiership quality. Their resolve – which netted coach Trent Robinson a premiership in his rookie year, won nice-guy captain Anthony Minichiello a long-awaited second title, and showed Sonny Bill Williams is either a common denominator in success (All Blacks, Chiefs, now Roosters) or has a knack for knowing which ride to hitch his wagon to – looked even more impressive when the final stats came out. The Roosters made more errors (12-6), missed more tackles (27-22), completed fewer sets from more possessions (22/35 or 63% to Manly's 23/28 or 82%), made fewer line breaks (3-5), fewer tackle breaks (22-27), and they lost the penalty count 2-5.</p><p>So how did they win? David Williams's horror night helped (see below) but it was in the back end of the game that they scored the bulk of their points suggesting Manly's grueling final series, and the extra 37 tackles they had to make on Sunday night, became a factor. But still the Roosters had to find holes and capitalise. And that's what they were able to do, with the three players who made the difference late on being their three new signings: Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings. Nice bit of business, that.</p><h2>James Maloney had a great claim for man of the match</h2><p>Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans had a wonderful grand final but it's surprising to say the least that he won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground ahead of Maloney. The Roosters' five-eighth was instrumental in his team winning the premiership, which you'd have to think is the main criteria in selecting the Clive Churchill medallist. His pinpoint cross-field bomb set up the Roosters' opening try to Daniel Tupou, his midfield burst following a Williams offload helped create the Roosters' third, and it was his grubber kick into the Manly in-goal that Jennings swooped on in the 73rd minute to score the match-sealer. Throw in his four out of four conversions and a penalty goal and his being overlooked becomes baffling. Still, if he's actually bothered, he should be consoled by his premiership ring. </p><h2>Manly were unlucky</h2><p>Plenty will argue that Manly used up their allocation of luck when awarded a penalty try just after half-time. Perhaps they're right. Jamie Lyon was certainly tackled without the ball but could you say without any doubt that he would have scored after collecting the bouncing ball (which at this time was grubbering surreptitiously away to his left, like someone trying to sneak out of a party before his mates see him)? I couldn't. <br /> <br />Nevertheless many other decisions went against Manly, some critical. An early knock-on from Mitchell Pearce on his own 20m was let go; Kieran Foran was called for a knock-on with the refs missing Pearce's strip; Jared Waerea-Hargreaves's head-butt (though gentle, like a horse nuzzling for affection) was not deemed worthy of penalising (meaning Maloney kicked a penalty goal from in-front for Manly holding the player down too long); Jennings's touch on a Lyon grubber kick should have resulted in a Manly ball 10m out from the Roosters' line a minute from half-time; and Maloney's pass to Minichiello prior to the Shaun-Kenny Dowall match-leveller was clearly forward. It would have for made compelling TV but Geoff Toovey did well to stop his head from exploding in a rain of goop against the Perspex walls of his viewing box.</p><h2>Williams and Jennings made timely interventions</h2><p>Given he makes hairy-eared commentators swoon like girls at a One Direction concert it feels almost blasphemous to say that for the first 60 minutes of the grand final Sonny Bill Williams was close to the worst player on the field. Up until that point his contributions included a collection of passes that hit the turf, a knock-on 15m out from his own line (which gifted Manly possession which they used to score their opening try), and a bad read in defence that created space for Manly's third try. It seemed that all his earnest conversations with the heavens were being ignored. Perhaps God was watching Big Momma's House on Nine's digital dumping ground, Go! </p><p>Or perhaps not. Because on the hour mark Sonny Bill's fortunes changed. First he angled a hit-up back inside at Cherry-Evans and his half-bust made room for his big right paw to finesse the ball into Maloney's midriff. It put Maloney on the long run that set up the Kenny-Dowall try and regain the lead for the Roosters. Later, Williams burst through the guts of the Manly line like a bird's eye chilli and it was soon after that Jennings – who'd been anonymous in attack – scorched through the in-goal before diving full-length to brilliantly touch down Maloney's kick. Cometh the hour etc etc.</p><h2>Tupou and Williams: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times</h2><p>If the AFL aren't scared off after the Israel Folau debacle they could do worse than look at Roosters winger Daniel Tupou. Unlike Folau, whose enormous frame was put on breeze blocks by Greater Western Sydney's trainers and stripped back to bare bones, Tupou already has the feline lines of an Aussie Rules footballer. And he can leap and mark  (with grace) as he showed with his try over his opposite winger David Williams on Sunday, which was a carbon copy of his try last week over Akuila Uate. Oddly, however, Williams didn't even attempt to jump. Instead he looked up at Tupou like he was an eclipse of the sun. And as we all know you're not supposed to look at an eclipse.<br /> <br />The scenario almost repeated itself 13 minutes into the second half when a high ball plummeted Williams's way with Tupuo preparing his leap. Utterly rattled, Williams only had eyes for Tupou and the ball hit the Sea Eagle without him even attempting to catch it. This led to a drop out and in the next set Mitchell Pearce put Aidan Guerra into a hole and the Roosters clawed the score back to 18-14. Finally, with the game on the line, when Maloney's grubber was bobbling through the Manly in-goal, Jennings ran an opponent who seemed to pull up, as if believing the ball was going to run dead. What player? David Williams. Sport can be cruel.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419203200|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|48725d877df984d581bf8f8c3653452ab2268aa0 -->",

        "headline":"Sean O'Loughlin's return for Wigan decisive in win over Warrington",
        "body":"<p>Sam Tomkins was selected some years ago as the face of England's challenge for the 2013 World Cup, but even Wigan's full-back believes that Sean O'Loughlin will be a more significant figure in a successful home challenge. This stirring, occasionally torrid, Wigan triumph – their first Super League and Challenge Cup double, and the greatest comeback in 16 Grand Finals – confirmed the place of the low-profile loose forward among the cream of British rugby league's most famous club.</p><p>He has now lifted four trophies in eight seasons as the Wigan captain – two more than Andy Farrell, his illustrious brother-in-law who also graced the cherry-and-white No13 shirt, hoisted during a slightly longer spell leading a less authentic Wigan team. But O'Loughlin's contribution to this latest victory invited comparisons with another recent Wigan wonder and former team-mate, Kris Radlinski, who enjoyed his finest hour when winning the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match in the Challenge Cup final at Murrayfield in 2002 after spending much of the previous week in hospital on a drip because of an infected foot.</p><p>O'Loughlin's appearance at Old Trafford was not quite as unexpected – he did not attend the pre-match walkabout in carpet slippers, as Radlinski, now the club's football manager, did in Edinburgh 11 years ago. But only eight days earlier, before Wigan's semi-final win against Leeds, he posed in the tunnel for a photograph with a young supporter with his right foot still in a protective boot.</p><p>The 30-year-old had not played for five weeks since lifting the Challenge Cup, and that was his only appearance since 2 August. Shaun Edwards, another Wigan great, had marvelled on Grand Final eve about the fitness and athleticism that O'Loughlin showed to give his usual complete performance at Wembley, but if anything his contribution at Old Trafford was more significant. He handled slickly, tackled strongly, even carried the ball up like a prop when required, before floating a long pass to allow Pat Richards to mark his farewell appearance with a stroll to the corner.</p><p>As the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane, reflected over a pint of lager an hour or so after the final hooter: \"That's what the players say about Lockers – he's like a front-rower, a back-rower, a half, he can do everything. He does things people don't notice, carries the ball strong, always the right thing at the right time.</p><p>\"He's been immobile for five weeks, he's only run with us for a couple of days, so to go out and perform on a stage as intense as that is an absolute one-off. As a man and a character he'll never surprise me. I hold him in really high regard.\"</p><p>O'Loughlin confirmed that he had been in a dilemma for much of the week, worrying that taking a risk with his achilles at Old Trafford might rule him out of a second consecutive World Cup. \"But you don't get many chances to play in finals, and with a lot of boys leaving, things like that, you want to be part of it. Luckily I think I've come through all right and I can get involved with the World Cup now. Missing the last one was tough to take.\" Assuming he passes a final fitness test with the England medical staff, O'Loughlin will fly out to the training camp in South Africa  with Tomkins, Lee Mossop, Liam Farrell, Josh Charnley and Michael McIlorum, the latter two having claimed opportunist tries in Wigan's second-half onslaught.</p><p>It could be an interesting meeting at the airport with Ben Westwood, the Warrington second-row who is also in the squad and set the tone for a memorably bloody Grand Final by whacking Blake Green with a short right in the second minute of the match.</p><p>Green, a chunky Australian stand-off who has proved an inspired signing from Hull KR, recovered to win the Harry Sunderland award for man of the match despite blurred vision from a spectacular shiner. But Wane was not exactly waxing lyrical about what he would regard as routine rugby league courage.</p><p>\"Stopping down after a whack in his eye … he needs to get up and carry on,\" growled the Wiganer's Wiganer. \"He said he couldn't see anything out of his eye. But in big games like that I expect him to carry on, and he did, got the man of the match, did some good things. But I do expect it as well, if I'm honest with you. You wouldn't want me to tell you lies.\"</p><p>He was equally blunt about the Westwood punch, which will be studied by the disciplinary authorities  with the possibility of a suspension that could affect his World Cup prospects. \"It happens,\" said Wane. \"People get injured, you get borderline tackles because people are throwing their bodies in – there's that much at stake. That's what makes finals something a bit different, a bit special.\"</p><p>Sport does not come any less sanitised than that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419180941|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|78e57e231f68c31f59b08eb41a61a05c91188ef7 -->",

After it gets past a point in a season, if he decides not to stay, that's a huge hole you can't fill anyway. You can't find that type of player at this time of year, usually.</p><p>\"That's the risk you take with a player like that. He's proved a lot of people wrong this year. We just decided to back him and we'll do the same again. He can make a huge difference to a team.\"</p><p>Lyon's penalty try came three minutes into the second half and the decision looked like it would change the course of a contest during which his Manly side had endured the rough end of some first-half calls.</p><p>Instead, Williams set up a try which lifted the tricolours back into the game and the centre Michael Jennings touched down just millimetres short of the dead ball line, with seven minutes remaining, to secure victory.</p><p>The penalty try was one of a number of contentious calls at the end of a finals series that started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/cronulla-sharks-north-queensland-cowboys-nrl\">a seven-tackle try eliminating North Queensland</a>.</p><p>Lyon chased Daly Cherry-Evans's kick before he was pulled down by rival Mitchell Aubusson. \"I've got a try, I want to check the penalty try,\" referee Shayne Hayne told video officials Ashley Klein.</p><p>Six minutes later, centre Steve Matai added to Manly's total with a converted try but just as Geoff Toovey's side appeared set to take control, the Roosters responded with a try to Aidan Guerra.</p><p>From the opening seconds, when Manly's Glenn Stewart staggered out of an attempted tackle on Sam Moa and received medical attention before continuing, it was a grand final full of incident and controversial officiating.</p><p>Sea Eagles players claimed Sydney Roosters prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves had head-butted Justin Horo in the 33rd minute. There was definitely contact, but no classic butting action, and a previous penalty to the tricolours stood.</p><p>A penalty against Eagle Matt Ballin for tackling in the air was also open to question, as was a decision to award the Roosters a scrum feed when Jennings appeared to play at the ball before it went into touch.</p><p>It was almost written into the plot that the trend should continue and when Williams released James Maloney in the 60th minute, the pass to captain Anthony Minichiello drifted forwards – but went undetected – before Kenny-Dowall scored.</p><p>Well-known for his outbursts about refereeing this year, Toovey was measured post-match. \"Pretty tough on the big calls again tonight,\" he said. \"It was probably the lowest penalised game of the year.\"</p><p>Cherry-Evans was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match, a small consolation for someone who ended up on the losing side. </p><p>Australia back-rower Greg Bird tweeted: \"Am I the only person that finds it strange that every camera close up is on Sonny Bill. If he wins Clive I'll retire!\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419175726|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|a7058b3d3d97ab841a0a1d61d4860c40dc8ba268 -->",

I'd put them both as number one.\"</p><p>The inclusion of O'Donnell and particularly Cordner will provide a major boost for the Roosters. Cordner broke through for NSW Origin selection this year and was voted the Dally M second rower of the year. He was outstanding for the Roosters until he broke his ankle seven weeks ago.</p><p>Cordner was close to playing last week against Newcastle, and Robinson has indicated he'll play the 21-year-old if he's anywhere close to full fitness. </p><p>O'Donnell is an NRL veteran with grand final, Origin and Test experience.</p><p>He missed the Knights' final with a hamstring strain but has reportedly recovered. Dylan Napa and Isaac Liu are tipped to be the young Roosters to make way.</p><p>At Manly, young forward James Hasson and journeyman David Gower are vying to fill the vacant spot on the bench.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419159908|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|c57b021dc633319c3fc7fc3042a1cc361750a4d9 -->",

        "headline":"Wigan see off Warrington in X-rated Grand Final to complete double",
        "body":"<p></p><p>Wigan became the first team since St Helens in 2006 to complete the double of Super League and Challenge Cup, after a Grand Final that was free-flowing and compelling but which occasionally tiptoed the tightrope between tough and thuggish.</p><p>The tone was set in the second minute when Ben Westwood, Warrington's notoriously rugged forward, left the Wigan stand-off Blake Green on the ground needing lengthy treatment. That slightly undermined the Wolves' own understandable indignation when Wigan's second-row bruiser Harrison Hansen threw himself either recklessly or cynically at the legs of Stefan Ratchford when he was being held up by another Wigan defender – a possible example of the cannonball tackle that has caused much controversy in recent years.</p><p>Both transgressors escaped punishment, but the most significant difference between the incidents was in their outcome. Ratchford was forced limping from the field with ankle ligament damage, leaving Warrington, who had already lost their wing Joel Monaghan with a neck injury after an accidental clash with Pat Richards, to make hasty amendments to their backline, having selected four forwards for their interchange bench.</p><p>Within minutes of that incident Wigan, who had trailed 16-2 late in the first half, took the lead for the first time as Josh Charnley plucked the ball from the grasp of Chris Riley, who was filling in for Ratchford at full-back. Then Green, who played on with a nasty gash under his right eye, threw a couple of dummies to score himself, and Richards had the last word on his last appearance after seven seasons of distinguished service to the club with a simple try made by Sean O'Loughlin, the captain who made an inspirational return from an achilles problem.</p><p>To say that Warrington were left with double disappointment, after last year's Grand Final defeat by Leeds, would be a huge understatement. This was devastation, with their worry over Monaghan, who was taken to hospital with severe concussion, and fury over Hansen lending it an even more bitter taste.</p><p>\"I don't like those sorts of tackles,\" said the Warrington coach Tony Smith, who has regularly warned about their dangers for at least the last three seasons. \"We just tap people on the wrist about it. That's why it still happens, and that's what our players have to put up with.\"</p><p>Smith refused to identify the loss of Ratchford as decisive in an impressive show of dignity given the circumstances. \"That's ifs, ands and maybes,\" he added. \"Wigan were very good, relentless with what they did, they just kept banging away through the middle and then came up with the plays near our line.\"</p><p>Nor was Wigan's coach Shaun Wane, for whom this victory completed a significant personal double, in the mood to shower praise on Green for playing 78 minutes with blurred vision. \"I was pissed off he stayed down so long, to be honest,\" joked the no-nonsense former prop, who has always had a fervent reluctance to waste precious interchanges on namby-pamby backs. \"I knew he'd get up. I admire all the players so much for the mental toughness they've had to show all year, and again tonight.\"</p><p>He had a special word for O'Loughlin, who had not played for six weeks since aggravating an achilles problem in the Challenge Cup final win against Hull at Wembley in August, and for the three members of this team who will now head for pastures new.</p><p>Richards ended with 14 points and will not need to dwell on a couple of dodgy moments in the first half, and the prop Lee Mossop was typically forceful up front. Sam Tomkins, who had been at the centre of most pre-match attention before his big-money move to the New Zealand Warriors, was faultless, but mostly unspectacular. Perhaps he is saving his grand farewell for the World Cup final here at the end of November. He, Mossop and O'Loughlin will all fly to South Africa on Monday to join the England squad at their high-altitude training camp.</p><p>It was a measure of the depth of Warrington's squad that Smith felt able to omit Brett Hodgson and Trent Waterhouse, two compatriots whose vast experience includes both State of Origin rugby and Grand Finals in Sydney. His Wolves seized the chance to demonstrate the resolute defence that is usually overshadowed by the quality of their attack, restricting Wigan to a single Richards penalty in 20 minutes of dominance. Then they seized control of the match with a burst of three tries in six minutes, from Monaghan, Westwood and the outstanding Simon Grix.</p><p>The game began to swing back Wigan's way before half-time, first with Warrington's loss of Monaghan, who was carried off after damaging his neck tackling Richards in the corner. Wigan had been pressing again, and the Wolves finally cracked in the 39th minute when Darrell Goulding found a way through their left-side defence.</p><p>Richards made an unusual hash of the kick, leaving Wigan 16-6 behind at the break. But 13 minutes into the second half they were ahead, as Michael McIlorum caught the Wolves napping from acting half, then Goulding turned provider to lay on Charnley's try with a quick-thinking and delicate kick. After that, Warrington could find no way of turning back the cherry-and-white tide.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419151031|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ec3914817b7e77d088dd0f1e6dd3c7aa53cb1a2b -->",

        "body":"<p>It is quite a while since British rugby league has had a story as good as the Burgess brothers. The tale has been developing for a while, since Sam exploded on to the scene with Bradford Bulls in 2007 as the most exciting forward talent seen in the Super League for a decade or more, and has taken all sorts of unlikely twists in the five years since. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/04/sam-burgess-bradford-bulls-russell-crowe\" title=\"\">First, when he travelled to the Ashbourne set of Robin Hood to meet Russell Crowe and sign for the South Sydney Rabbitohs</a>; then when he was followed to Australia by his elder brother, Luke, and the twins, Tom and George, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/30/burgess-brothers-history-south-sydney\" title=\"\">the quartet making history when they teamed up for Souths against Wests Tigers in August</a>; and this week when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/england-burgess-brothers-world-cup\" title=\"\">Sam, Tom and George were included in England's squad for the World Cup</a> to leave Julie, the Burgess mother, feeling devastated for Luke.</p><p>They will not be the only siblings involved in the tournament. There are the Evans boys from Bridgend, Ben and Rhys, who will appear together for Wales for the first time since they moved north to Warrington as teenagers. Scott and Simon Grix, two Halifax lads who have been largely unsung heroes in the Super League this season for Huddersfield and Warrington respectively, will again turn out for Ireland, having shown such commitment to that cause in the last World Cup in Australia in 2008.</p><p>Anthony Minichiello, the former Australia full-back who will captain Sydney Roosters in the NRL Grand Final against Manly on Sunday, will team up with his younger brother, Mark, to lead Italy in their World Cup debut, with a high-profile opening fixture against Wales as part of the opening ceremony at the Millennium Stadium. As American Samoans, Joseph and Junior Paulo are eligible to represent the United States.</p><p>But Scotland are the only squad with two pairs of brothers: the Hull KR forwards Jonathan and Adam Walker; and the Hendersons, Ian and Andrew, whose story is almost as appealing as that of the Burgess boys. There were three of them, too, in the 2008 World Cup, but Kevin has not been selected this time after ending his professional career in England to work in the mines in northern Queensland.</p><p>At first the Hendersons' tale could be seen as a classic example of rugby league's combination of slack eligibility rules with the desperation to expand that so often brings the code into disrepute. All three boys were born in Torquay in the 1980s before moving to the central coast of New South Wales. Since then Ian has played in Bradford, Auckland, Parramatta and now Perpignan, for the Catalan Dragons – and for a while last year he even hoped to force his way into England's plans.</p><p>But their pride in their father's Scottish roots was unmistakable five years ago, shortly after he had been diagnosed with leukaemia. \"Dad was from Possil in Glasgow and he brought us up with that,\" said Andrew, now an adopted Yorkshireman who has played a key role in establishing Sheffield Eagles as the most successful club outside the Super League over the past three seasons. \"The heritage, the folk music, all of that. He was passionate about it and it meant a lot to him to see us playing for Scotland. He passed on the following year but at least he got to see us all play together.\"</p><p>The brothers played a key role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/05/irelandrugbyleagueteam-samoarugbyleagueteam\" title=\"\">Scotland's first World Cup win, against a Fiji team who would go on to reach the semi-finals</a>. Scotland's long-serving coach, Steve McCormack, now has many more options, with Peter Wallace, a half-back who was good enough to play in the State of Origin for New South Wales a few years ago, joining the squad to form a mouthwatering partnership with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/danny-brough-huddersfield-super-league-man-steel\" title=\"\">Danny Brough, the newly crowned Super League Man of Steel</a>.</p><p>\"It does look a great squad but it's going to need to be,\" said Henderson. \"Our first game is against Tonga and they're packed with NRL experience, and even the Italians look a pretty good side to me.\"</p><p>As Henderson says, these should be high-quality contests, with no questioning the commitment of the players involved to the cause they are representing, despite the lack of authenticity of their accents. They should also generate a decent atmosphere in Workington, where officials are confident of testing Derwent Park's modest capacity of around 8,000 – nothing spectacular, maybe, but significantly better than the gates of 4,000 and 2,000 attracted to the last two World Cup fixtures in Cumbria 13 years ago.</p><p>This tournament has been organised far more professionally than the 2000 version but Scotland playing two of their games in Workington, and the other, against the USA, in Salford highlights the weak links that will undoubtedly be exposed. In Scotland, as in Ireland, Italy and the USA, there is not a great deal of evidence of a cohesive development programme, or of significant progress being made. There is certainly an argument that the involvement of such teams undermines the credibility of the nations capable of supplying their own players – Wales, France and Papua New Guinea, as well as Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands and the big three of England, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>Perhaps it is best not to worry and just to sit back and enjoy the rugby. If all else fails, there will always be the Burgess boys.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419113175|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|19b87f62cadc63b3633fb2fbb13d206d676bd4bc -->",

But Tomkins is determined to keep such thoughts at bay until after the game.</p><p>\"No, it's not sunk in, I know it's not,\" he admitted in the staff training room of a Morrisons supermarket in Wigan on Tuesday teatime. \"I keep saying 'Yeah, yeah, I'm ready for my last game'. But I know after 80 minutes on Saturday I'll look round and all my best mates are there and it's the last time I'll play with them. It's a scary thought, but one I'm trying to not think about. I don't want to be going into this game full of emotion thinking about my last Wigan game and all that rubbish. I'll deal with that after the match.\"</p><p>Two weeks ago Wigan and Tomkins were finally ready to confirm the deal that had been widely mooted for months, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/23/wigan-sam-tomkins-new-zealand-warriors\" title=\"\">a move to the New Zealand Warriors </a>– although the details, specifically a world-record rugby league transfer fee of up to £700,000, were eyepopping.</p><p>The 24-year-old decided a while ago that the NRL, with its high profile and big money, was a better bet than following his elder brother, Joel, to rugby union – better to stick with a game in which he knows he excels, and exploit the opportunities it can offer, rather than start learning a new one.</p><p>But rather than follow the example of the England forwards Adrian Morley, Gareth Ellis, James Graham and now the four Burgess brothers, who have all moved to rugby league central in Sydney during the Super League era, Tomkins has chosen Auckland, a backwater by comparison, even if the apartment he has lined up will have very acceptable harbour views.</p><p>He explains that Dean Bell, the former Wigan captain who is now the general manager of the New Zealand Warriors, and Eric Watson, the London-based businessman who is the club's majority shareholder, sold him a dream. \"I wanted to go to a club that I feel comfortable at, that's going in the right direction, and to try something new,\" he said. \"The Warriors squad is full of absolute athletes, the potential they've got is huge to win stuff and I want to be a part of that.\"</p><p>His reputation, his transfer fee, his wages, and not least his accent will ensure that he is a marked man, and placed under major pressure, as soon as he arrives in Auckland in time for Christmas. Graham Lowe, a New Zealander who once coached Wigan, has helpfully suggested that <a href=\"http://www.sportinglife.com/rugby-league/news/article/480/8939177/-?\" title=\"\">Tomkins is not as good as the local he will replace, Kevin Locke</a>. Brad Fittler, the former Australia captain who is a more credible figure, has worried aloud about <a href=\"http://www.nrl.com/tomkins-a-gamble-fittler/tabid/10874/newsid/74827/default.aspx\" title=\"\">whether Tomkins has the size to handle the NRL</a> – although the example of Billy Slater, the brilliant Melbourne Storm full-back who was once a track jockey, suggests a little bloke can make it, provided he is very good and very tough.</p><p>Before all that, though, Tomkins has a couple of loose ends to tie up. On Monday he will fly to South Africa to join the England squad in their preparations for the World Cup, and what he hopes will be another Old Trafford farewell, in the final on 30 November. Tomkins has always shown a willingness to appreciate the bigger picture, and would therefore concede that an England World Cup win – unlikely, but not impossible – would be far more significant than anything that happens in Manchester on Saturday.</p><p>But even after his inevitable inclusion in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/england-burgess-brothers-world-cup\" title=\"\">England squad had been confirmed </a>on Tuesday – and for once overshadowed by the presence of three of those Burgess brothers – this has not been the week to ask Tomkins about his description of himself as \"England first, Wigan second\". He may have been born in Milton Keynes, and gone to primary school in Warrington – when he even cheered on his Grand Final opponents with Joel and Logan, his younger brother who is also in Wigan's Old Trafford squad – but he has been very Wigan indeed since Shaun Wane, now the formidable head coach, took him under his wing in the club's junior teams.</p><p>Since scoring five tries in an unforgettable debut against Whitehaven in 2008, he has made 151 senior appearances and has a 100% record in finals – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/02/wigan-st-helens-grand-final\" title=\"\">scoring a try in a 2010 Grand Final win</a> against St Helens, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/27/leeds-rhinos-wigan-warriors-challenge-cup\" title=\"\">making one for Joel in the Challenge Cup final against Leeds</a> the following season and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/24/hull-fc-wigan-warriors-challenge-cup-final\" title=\"\">returning to Wembley six weeks ago to win the Lance Todd Trophy</a> against Hull.</p><p>Wigan went into those games as warm favourites, whereas they are underdogs against a Warrington team who finished two places and six points above them in the Super League table, and have considerably more big-match experience, especially after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/06/warrington-leeds-grand-final\" title=\"\">losing 26-14 to Leeds at Old Trafford last year</a>. But so far, the Tomkins farewell tour is going absolutely to script. \"Are you trying to jinx me?\" he responded to that suggestion. \"But yeah, it'd be the fairytale ending to finish with a double. There's only us can do it this year – and there's no reason we can't.\"</p><p><em>Sam Tomkins was speaking on behalf of Heinz BIG Soup, official partner of the Super League</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419080293|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|9209f21d34422dcc89eb9d0112a518a2bbca33b1 -->",
