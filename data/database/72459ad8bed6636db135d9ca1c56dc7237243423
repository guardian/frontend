The state divide led to a number of cross-border skirmishes in the American civil war, which continued in the form of university football (gridiron) fans killing each other in the stands in the early 20th century. This is, of course, a hatchet long since buried, but even those of us who usually find regional pride to be infantile get prickly on this one against our own best judgment. Sporting KC originally played in a stadium on the Missouri side of the state line and continue to represent the city's metropolitan area, not the state of Kansas, which extends hundreds of miles west from the city.&quot; Duly noted.

Has the loss of David Gill affected their business savvy in terms of deal-making. Tobias Sindram suggests that there may still be a delay on Herrera to save Bilbao's face with their fans:&nbsp;&quot;Bilbao tried the same to prevent Javi Martinez from joining Bayern on his €40m buy-out-clause. It halted the transfer for a couple of days but in the end Bayern managed to get around it, I think. And rightly so: If a club does not want to lose their player on the amount agreed in his buy-out-clause, well, don’t agree to that particular buy-out-clause. To insist on the player depositing the sum himself is at best sneaky and should constitute an action in bad faith. Anyway, what happened to inserting fantastic zillion-Euro-buyout-clauses nobody (bar Real Madrid, maybe) would ever be willing to trigger? I think maybe Bilbao just insists on the personal buy-out by the player to appease their own fans: 'See, we fought to keep the player. And no, we never actually thought of selling him for the buy-out-clause we deliberately agreed on.' By the way, I don’t care if United buy Herrera or not.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224c2fbe4b03491b6ac853b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:58:37.682+01:00\">5.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">David Moyes keeps hitting his redial button</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's Andy Hunter, our Stanley Park correspondent:</p> <blockquote> <p>Everton rejected a third joint offer from Manchester United for Fellaini and Baines at the weekend - this time &pound;40m - and today a separate &pound;15m offer for Baines as Jamie Jackson has reported.

Manchester United’s ability to sign the midfielder will depend on their resolve to test the rules governing buy-out clauses in Spain and the response of the league and the tax authorities to their actions. <br />Here, it becomes very complicated in theory. <br />Every player in Spain has a formal rescission clause, registered with the league which fixes the amount at which a player can unilaterally end his contract and move to another club. That player deposits the amount stipulated in his clause (in Herrera’s case, €36m) with the league and is then free to move. <br />Clubs agreed in principle that if another club pays the buy-out clause they will sell at that total price, meaning that the player does not actually pay the money: it effectively becomes a transfer like any other. But when it is a hostile bid, two other scenarios open up: one, that the club accepts the buy-out fee but, as all Spanish companies do, adds VAT (at 21%). And two, when the club does not accept the fee at all, the player deposits the money at the league himself. <br />Of course, in practice Herrera does not have €36m lying around, so United could in theory pay the money on his behalf. Yet that could be challenge by both the tax authorities and the league itself as the player would strictly be liable for 50% income tax.<br />None of this has been tested and some experts believe United would face no legal challenge. And yet the whole transfer is complicated enough to cause a few headaches on both sides.</p> </blockquote> <p>My brain hurts. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224bc67e4b074ec23392220\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:32:14.205+01:00\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Libor rigging?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Aston Villa are holding talks with Lazio over a deal for forward Libor Kozak, Sky sources understand,&quot; says a persistent correspondent.

There will now have to be some serious talking between the France midfielder, his agents and Pardew. A public apology to fans for his recent strike seems called for on Cabaye's part. Then he needs to nail on his World Cup place by helping turn this into a much better than expected season for Newcastle. Pardew had hoped to sign another striker - so much for Joe Kinnear's boast about being the greatest Director of Football - but at least they did get Loic Remy in on loan from QPR. Considering five players were signed last January and Hatem Ben Arfa and Fabricio Coloccini are now fit again the lack of transfer business is probably far from a disaster.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224b63ee4b0b6f34d589f59\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:03:55.257+01:00\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Do my eyes deceive me or is <strong>Gareth Bale</strong> wearing a Livestrong wristband for his big day? &quot; writes Neil Graham.

Here's <strong>Sid Lowe</strong> with the inside track from Spain:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;Real Madrid are presenting <strong>Mesut Ozil</strong> as a man who pushed for an exit (essentially because he lacked stomach for competition and wants more money) but they are very happy that there is such a big bid for him. <br />&quot;If departures fall into place (Ozil, Kaka), Madrid will try again for <strong>Luis Suarez</strong>. Liverpool have so far been unequivocal that he is not going, though.<br />&quot;Athletic Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde yesterday said he didn't expect <strong>Ander Herrera</strong> to go. That's essentially because Athletic will demand the buy-out clause and not only have United not matched that (€36m euros), but if they do it would be liable to tax at either 21% (VAT) or over 50% (income tax because player would deposit money). There are ways round that but it is complex and we're into final day.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>And in other news, here's <strong>Gareth Bale</strong> coughing for Real Madrid's doctors:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/sep/02/real-madrid-fans-gareth-bale-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1958991\" data-video-name=\"Real Madrid fans on Gareth Bale as world's most expensive player arrives in Spain – video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/2/1378112936245/Real-Madrid-fans-on-Garet-005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-416312009\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/2/1378112936245/Real-Madrid-fans-on-Garet-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/2/130902bale1-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/9/2/130902bale1-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/9/2/130902bale1_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/9/2/130902bale1/130902bale1.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/2/130902bale1_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/9/2/130902bale1_vpx.webm\"></source> </video> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224559de4b0b6f34d589f2d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T10:16:10.823+01:00\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Under 13 hours to go …</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>It could be a busy 13 hours for West Brom</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/smadeley_star/statuses/374459743621742592\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Albion in talks about signing Stephane Sessegnon, Victor Anichebe and Fabio Quagliarella. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wba&amp;src=hash\">#wba</a></p>— Steve Madeley (@smadeley_star) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smadeley_star/statuses/374459743621742592\">September 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52245563e4b0b6f34d589f2c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T10:08:44.458+01:00\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Manchester United NOT in for Ozil</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Cool your engines, transfer tug-of-war fans.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/374458192425914368\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Just to put this one to bed, Man Utd are definitely not taking on Arsenal for Mesut Ozil. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MUFC&amp;src=hash\">#MUFC</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AFC&amp;src=hash\">#AFC</a></p>— Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DTguardian/statuses/374458192425914368\">September 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-522453fae4b074ec233921d8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T10:05:36.207+01:00\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's <strong>Andy Hunter</strong> on what to expect at Goodison Park:</p> <blockquote> <p>In stark contrast to Mark Hughes's behaviour during Manchester City's pursuit of Joleon Lescott, an episode that so incensed one David Moyes, the same David Moyes&nbsp;has refused to take no for an answer on <strong>Marouane Fellaini</strong> and <strong>Leighton Baines</strong> and Manchester United have persisted with late bids for the pair, although they have now accepted they could have more success with a separate offer for the Belgium midfielder. Fellaini may submit a transfer request should Everton refuse United's latest offer but if it meets or even surpasses &pound;23.5m - the buyout clause that expired on 31 July and is reactivated on 1 January - that would be unlikely.</p> <p>To illustrate how this is normal managerial practise,&nbsp;Roberto Martinez will step up his efforts to sign <strong>James McCarthy</strong> from Wigan today. Everton had a cut-price offer in the &pound;10m region rejected on Sunday but, having received encouragement from Wigan that they are open to an increased, bulk payment deal for the midfielder, they will return as the Fellaini transfer progresses. <strong>Fellaini to United and McCarthy to Everton?</strong> Who would have thought it when that was reported on Martinez's first day as Everton manager back in June?</p> <p>And so to <strong>Baines</strong>. He is the one Everton and their fans would be loth to lose and United's offers so far have not come close to the club's valuation of the England international and their most creative outlet. Everton need all the creativity they can find on the evidence of recent matches but an improved offer above &pound;15m for the 28-year-old would leave Martinez and chairman Bill Kenwright with a difficult decision to make.</p> <p>Everton remain in talks for <strong>Gareth Barry</strong>, though it needs a compromise with Manchester City on his &pound;120,000-a-week wages for that to go through.</p> <p>Martinez is also an admirer of <strong>Tom Ince</strong> but not of Blackpool's &pound;8m asking price.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224537be4b03491b6ac84f5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T10:01:26.808+01:00\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Will anything be happening at <strong>Manchester City</strong>?

It is also worth seeing if <strong>John Guidetti</strong> is still Blues striker come 11pm.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224523ae4b0b6f34d589f2a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:59:38.463+01:00\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">News from Scotland</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>An impressive level of enthusiasm from all concerned thus far, with <strong>Ewan Murray</strong> emailing in despite the Scottish transfer window closing two days ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>Worth remembering that the transfer window closed at midnight on Saturday, with the Scottish FA upholding the fine tradition of August meaning August (or, rather, they had previously issued a signing embargo to Rangers which ended on 31 August 2013).</p> <p>In practical terms, this situation&nbsp;offers a threat to cash-poor Scottish clubs who could have their best players targeted without the opportunity to replace them with anything other than free agents.

He looked relaxed at Anfield yesterday, as he sat next to Richard Arnold, United’s managing director. But if 11pm is reached and Moyes has not been handed at least one midfielder questions are sure to be asked both inside the club and by United fans.</p> <p>The prospect of singing Roma’s defensive midfielder <strong>Daniel de Rossi</strong> appear dashed after his manager, Rudi Garcia, was quoted as saying yesterday: “We spoke when he came back from his holidays. We said that if it got past a certain date he would certainly remain with us. He will stay here for the season and that satisfies me a lot.”</p> <p>There remains hope that Fellaini’s team-mate <strong>Leighton Baines</strong> could also be signed.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52245069e4b0b6f34d589f28\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:48:22.542+01:00\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tyneside watch</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> with what to watch out for in the north east today:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;<strong>Andrea Dossena</strong>, the Napoli left back is reported to be flying to the north east ahead of a medical at Sunderland with a view to a season long loan.

Whether Glen Johnson's ankle injury will have an impact on that thinking remains to be seen. </p> <p>Spare a thought too for Martin Skrtel, who was outstanding against Manchester United on Sunday having been brought in from the cold due to injury to Kolo Toure. Skrtel was told he could leave earlier in the summer then, with Liverpool short in defence, that he had to stay. His application was clearly not disturbed against United but now with Sakho and Ilori pushing him further down the pecking order his prospects appear limited once again.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52244cc6e4b03491b6ac84f3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:35:16.746+01:00\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Ozil has chosen to stay at Real Madrid'</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So says Spanish newspaper <strong>Marca</strong>, who tend to be on the ball when it comes to life at the Bernabeu.

The 20-year-old, who watched Sunday's 1-0 Premier League win over Manchester United from the directors' box at Anfield, penned his deal after undergoing a medical at the club's Melwood training ground.<br />Ilori, who becomes Brendan Rodgers' sixth summer acquisition following Kolo Tour&eacute;, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Simon Mignolet and Aly Cissokho, told the club's official website: &quot;It feels great being a Liverpool player – coming to the Premier League has always been a dream for me.<br />&quot;I'm going to try to achieve everything I can. I want to play as much as possible and we'll see what the future holds. I will give my all and try my best to help the team.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And some more early moves on deadline day:</strong><br />• Milan have confirmed they have reached an agreement to re-sign Brazil forward Kak&aacute; from Real Madrid on a two-year contract, subject to a medical.<br />• West Brom have secured the services of midfielder Morgan Amalfitano on a season-long loan from Marseille with an option to make the deal permanent.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:02:06.099+01:00\">at 9.02am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416272169|2013-10-14T15:54:48Z|dbaa6f9375239233c46fae9366462f68a3cf752b -->",

        "headline":"Everton keen to hand Leighton Baines improved, long-term contract",
        "body":"<p>Everton want to secure Leighton Baines on a new long-term contract before the transfer window reopens in January, as they attempt to ward off interest from Manchester United.</p><p>Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, rejected several bids for the England left-back throughout the summer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/leighton-baines-everton-manchester-united\" title=\"\">including a £15m offer on transfer-deadline day</a>. Everton recognise that the Premier League champions' prolonged pursuit placed Baines in a difficult position and intend to reflect the importance of a defender who turns 29 in December with improved, extended terms.</p><p>Everton are also conscious that United's failure to Fábio Coentrão from Real Madrid on Monday means David Moyes will be back in the market for a left-back in January, and they intend to open talks over a new deal with Baines and his representatives as quickly as possible. The left-back is believed to earn around £50,000-a-week at Everton. Whether they can convince him to extend a contract that has two years remaining at Goodison Park, is uncertain.</p><p>The Everton chairman admitted in June that securing Baines's long-term future was a priority, but United's perseverance prevented any negotiations with the former Wigan player. Roberto Martínez, the Everton manager, said: \"While the window is open I think it's the wrong time to speak about those things and so we hadn't discussed it. But now the window is closed we are going to look into all of the players in the squad and see where their contracts are up to. Then, individually, we will look to address that. It would just have created more instability if we had done that while the window was open.\"</p><p>Everton did sell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/manchester-united-everton-marouane-fellaini\" title=\"\">Marouane Fellaini to United for £27.5m</a> after the Belgium international submitted a transfer request but they hope the arrivals of Romelu Lukaku, James McCarthy and Gareth Barry will help encourage Baines to stay.</p><p>Martínez said: \"From having interest to a situation where you have to consider a move is very different. Leighton is a very special footballer and a special player for Everton and we are looking forward to him enjoying the challenge that lies ahead. The window is over and there is a good opportunity to concentrate on football. That's the way it should be.\"</p><p>Claims that waived bonuses account for £4m of the Fellaini fee have been denied by Everton, who insist they will receive the £27.5m in full from United.</p><p>The Everton manager believes his squad has been enhanced by the Monday's late business. \"I'm sure that every Evertonian will have good memories of Marouane and that's the way it should be,\" Martínez said. \"It has allowed us to improve the squad and make us a stronger team. It's all been done in the right way.</p><p>\"It's important that we have closed the window and are stronger than what we were when it started. Marouane has been a top and consistent performer for us and he leaves Everton with our best wishes. It was always the case when a club would match his valuation, he would be allowed to do that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416531059|2013-10-14T15:54:48Z|32d8f0304cbf36fb253b3d62459146b3a1dd0df9 -->",

However, the former England striker was unable to find a new club, and with West Ham failing to add a striker to their ranks despite a number of transfer deadline day targets, it emerged that Cole could make a swift return.</p><p>The Hammers confirmed an interest in re-signing the former Chelsea forward with a statement on their website on Tuesday, saying: \"The club are pleased to announce that popular striker Carlton Cole is also undergoing a medical today with a view to returning to the Boleyn Ground on a short-term deal.\"</p><p>The news of a potential deal was also greeted warmly by the captain, Kevin Nolan, but it now appears that Cole will remain a free agent and West Ham will make do with Andy Carroll, Ricardo Vaz Te and Modibo Maïga as their options in attack.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416600108|2013-10-14T15:54:48Z|8d816ee601c922a987576de2c76e1c4341e3f814 -->",
