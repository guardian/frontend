        "body":"<p><strong>What's so funny?</strong><br /> The fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/09/phill-jupitus-6-music\" title=\"\">Phill Jupitus</a> first made his name in performance poetry. In the mid-80s, Jupitus traded under the name Porky the Poet, an act that he never brought to the Edinburgh fringe. Until now.</p><p></p><p><strong>So it's the man from </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v0dz\" title=\"\"><strong>Never Mind the Buzzcocks</strong></a><strong> reading poems?</strong><br />Not quite. Jupitus's introductions to the poems take up more time than the poems themselves. The show is two parts anecdote to one part verse.</p><p></p><p><strong>I want my money back.</strong><br /> Good luck with that. The show is part of the Free Fringe. Or as Jupitus introduces it, \"it's not worth the money you're not going to give me.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Sounds like a good deal.</strong><br /> It is. While Jupitus's poems – some old, some new – don't attain the standard of his professed heroes <a href=\"http://www.johnhegley.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Hegley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/mar/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ivor Cutler</a>, they're usually enjoyable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Examples please.</strong><br /> His 80s-era ditty <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhLRO-WcTBA\" title=\"\">They're All Grown Up in the Beano</a>, about the adult lives of comic characters, is of its era in all the right ways: punchy, chippy, funny. His White Hunter, Black Vest is a droll vignette about a \"kitchen Hemingway\" swatting a fly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sounds like a great act to support, say, Madness or Billy Bragg.</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Funny you should say that. That's what Porky the Poet did in the 80s, as Jupitus relates here in both anecdote and verse. On Supporting Madness is a rhyming horror story about an unhappy tour he undertook with Suggs and co.</p><p></p><p><strong>Name dropper.</strong><br /> And some. The central section of the show is his extended tale (too extended – Jupitus doesn't half string it out) of meeting McCartney and the Stones. It's a relief when he ends the preamble, and recites the poems.</p><p></p><p><strong>And how's the newer material?</strong><br /> So-so. It's hard to see what his poem about George Stephenson's rejected inventions (\"the all-purpose, dog-mounted Frenchman botherer\"  etc) has to do with the \"mouth-feel\" – relish of words – that Jupitus claims to love in poetry. But there's a sweet closer about his friendship with Hegley. There were meant to be songs, too, but a guitar string broke.</p><p></p><p><strong>Songs, too? Now that's what I call value for no money. </strong><br />Give this man the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/ts-eliot-prize-for-poetry\" title=\"\">TS Eliot prize</a> immediately.</p><p></p><p>• Box office: 0131 226 4380.
