        "body":"<p>Qatari police have arrested multiple suspects in connection with the murder of a British primary school teacher in Doha, authorities in the country have said.</p><p>Lauren Patterson, 24, went missing in the early hours of Saturday 12 October and posts by her boyfriend James Grima on social media suggested she was later found dead.</p><p>Her death has not been confirmed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but, on Wednesday, the Qatari Ministry of Interior wrote on its website: \"The police has arrested the suspects of an European woman's murder. The case has been referred to Public Prosecution to complete further judicial procedures applicable in this regard.\"</p><p>After his initial Facebook posts reporting his girlfriend was missing, Mr Grima - who is from Malta - wrote on the site on Sunday: \"I can't believe that it had to end this way Lauren, I really don't. I was so happy that I had finally found someone that could change my life so much, and in such a positive way too … Rest In Peace, babe … I will always look up at the sky cause you always were the brightest star and always will be.\"</p><p>And he added:</p><p>\"I love you so much babe, I really do and I can't get over the fact that you were taken away so cruelly, it really breaks my heart to think about it.\"</p><p>Lauren Patterson's mother Alison, who was reported to be on her way to Doha to identify the body formally, wrote on Facebook on Monday: \"She was truly a remarkable girl, my rock, always there for everyone. I know she's in heaven now in her Daddy's arms.\"</p><p>Reports have suggested that Ms Patterson's body was found in a bin outside the Cigale hotel in central Doha but local newspaper the Doha News reported that no police cordon had been put in place and said employees denied a body was found nearby.</p><p>The Foreign Office said it was providing Lauren Patterson's family, from Chiselhurst in south east London, with consular assistance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198575|2013-10-17T13:09:54Z|ebd831713c34b9f64ea547dd680440dd9050bea1 -->",
