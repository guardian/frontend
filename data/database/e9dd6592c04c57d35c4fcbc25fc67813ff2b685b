        "body":"<p>US defense secretary Chuck Hagel on Tuesday presented an austere vision of American global leadership in the 21st century, conceding that &ldquo;imperfect outcomes may be the best we can expect&rdquo; for terrorism and other pressing international challenges.</p> <p>In a speech delivered to the Center for Strategic and International Studies that was tinged with ambivalence, Hagel pledged that the US would continue to embrace its role as a global superpower, rejecting both an &ldquo;inward&rdquo; turn among US politicians and a &ldquo;hubris&rdquo; that Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, called an &ldquo;insidious disease.&rdquo;</p> <p>Amid the backdrop of an international crisis for Washington over pervasive US surveillance, Hagel said that the US &ldquo;must make a far better effort to understand how the world sees us, and why. We must listen more. We must listen more.&rdquo;</p> <p>Terrorism, the pre-eminent focus of Hagel&rsquo;s three predecessors, received barely a paragraph&rsquo;s worth of attention in a 30-minute speech that mostly sought to frame US foreign leadership for &ldquo;what comes after the post-9/11 era.&rdquo;</p> <p>Hagel lumped together &ldquo;cyberactivists, terrorists and criminal networks, and non-state actors&rdquo; as part of &ldquo;short-term realities&rdquo; that the US will confront &ndash; but, he said, will not eliminate.</p> <p>&ldquo;We must manage through these short-term realities as we strategically engage these&nbsp;complex problems &ndash; staying focused on our long-term interests and long-term objectives and&nbsp;outcomes,&rdquo; Hagel said. &ldquo;Imperfect outcomes may be the best we can expect, working our way toward the higher ground of possible solutions and resolutions.&rdquo;</p> <p>All of which contrasts with an embattled National Security Agency, which is under Hagel&rsquo;s purview, that has recently come to argue that terrorism is a rising challenge. The NSA director, Keith Alexander, in answering the agency&rsquo;s critics, has been arguing that terrorism is &ldquo;the highest globally that it's been ever, over 15,000 people killed&rdquo; in 2012, as Alexander testified last week to a House panel.</p> <p>While the triumphalist rhetoric of the post-9/11 era was absent from Hagel&rsquo;s speech, he did not address the contemporary contours of US counter-terrorism operations, such as special operations raids, drone strikes and capture missions, which have been displayed by US military and CIA forces in the past month alone, in Somalia, Pakistan and Libya.</p> <p>The longer-term challenges Hagel outlined have been familiar themes of Obama administration speeches <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/10/175215.htm\">since former secretary of state Hillary Clinton declared</a> that America was in the midst of a &ldquo;Pacific century.&rdquo;&nbsp;Hagel hailed a &ldquo;renewed engagement in the Asia-Pacific region&rdquo; while pledging the US to accepting &ldquo;the astounding diffusion of economic power and sweeping demographic change,&rdquo; including the rising influence of nations such as China, Turkey, India, Indonesia and Brazil.</p> <p>Since Clinton&rsquo;s declaration, US officials have struggled to demonstrate how what used to be called the &ldquo;pivot to Asia&rdquo; is substantial, or has not been dwarfed by the military&rsquo;s immediate challenges in counter-terrorism.</p> <p>Hagel suggested that a forthcoming Pentagon study, known as the Quadrennial Defense Review, will revamp the US defense posture in light of persistent challenges, automatic budget cuts and diminished political will to engage in peripheral conflicts.</p> <p>Hagel did not outline the delay or cancellation of major weapons systems &ndash; such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the family of next-generation stealth attack jets that represent the most expensive weapons program in human history &ndash; but said the study will question &ldquo;the assumptions and scenarios that guide how the military should organize, train, and equip our forces.&rdquo; Hagel broached the politically treacherous subjects of a &ldquo;tiered readiness system&rdquo; for exhausted US troops and cutting pay and benefits for service members, which have represented the highest proportion of budget growth since 9/11.</p> <p>As an apparent guide to the &ldquo;imperfect\" solutions the US will offer in the future, Hagel pointed to the recent initial destruction of Syria&rsquo;s chemical weapon production equipment, an unexpected international development spurred by President Obama placing the US military on the precipice of bombing Syria.</p> <p>Hagel, who was lambasted before and during his Senate confirmation hearings for alleged softness on Iran, praised the &ldquo;diplomatic path&rdquo; to a potential resolution of the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s nuclear program, but said the US would not change its military posture in the Middle East during negotiations.</p> <p>&ldquo;We will maintain a strong and ready military presence in the Persian Gulf, and the broader Middle East, to deter Iran&rsquo;s destabilizing activities, and to work with and protect our allies and our interests,&rdquo; Hagel said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421716364|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|6b8ff868ad2f20f4e41963a6f585c4b47b166afb -->",

That is a balance that we do try to strike.\"</p><p>Kerry said Barack Obama had ordered a complete review of the NSA's activities. But Kerry said it was important that concerns over the NSA did not affect discussions about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/13/us-and-eu-transatlantic-trade-liberalisation\" title=\"\">Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a>. Some European officials have said the surveillance issue may have a negative impact on the negotiations.</p><p>\"This is about jobs, it's about the economy, it is about economic competition in a global community that competes, sometimes by rules that are very questionable and shaky,\" Kerry said.</p><p>Kerry, the most senior Obama administration official to visit Europe since revelations of NSA spying sparked outrage across the continent, emphasised that the US understood concerns.</p><p>\"We want to hear from our allies, we want to have this conversation,\" Kerry said. \"President Obama welcomes this opportunity to work with our allies. And, ultimately, if we get it right, which we will, we will not only alleviate the concerns but we can actually strengthen our intelligence relationships going forward.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421686568|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|f255ce92a0e07c596947ae8f000bf10fd813dac4 -->",

        "body":"<p>A clutch of disparate local elections on Tuesday were threatening to turn conventions on their heads across the US and force a revaluation of a Republican national strategy that has alienated big business.</p><p>In Virginia, the Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli was heading for defeat at the hands of his Democratic rival Terry McAuliffe. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2013/governor/va/virginia_governor_cuccinelli_vs_mcauliffe_vs_sarvis-4111.html#3\">Polls showed</a> the conservative attorney general at least six points behind in the once-reliably Republican state.</p><p>McAuliffe amassed an estimated $34m, <a href=\"http://www.vpap.org/committees/profile/money_in_donors/2577?end_year=2013&amp;filter_schedule=A&amp;start_year=2010\">including 37 personal donations</a> worth more than $100,000, to fund a series of television ads painting Cuccinelli as a hardliner with views on abortion and gun control that are thought to have deterred many moderate voters.</p><p>\"My opponent has spent money in large part lying about me,\" Cuccinelli complained to NBC on Tuesday, after raising only $19.7m, including just four large donations over $100,000.</p><p>The fundraising prowess of McAuliffe, a close ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has been a big theme on the campaign trail, where Cuccinelli claimed that the biggest source of Democratic funds was from rich backers who live outside the state.</p><p>But the lack of big-money support for conservative Republicans is a trend also apparent in other elections across the US on Tuesday, as leading business groups favour party moderates or Democrats over those conservatives driving confrontation in Washington.</p><p>The big win of the night for the GOP is expected in New Jersey's election for governor, where incumbent Chris Christie has made a virtue of reaching across the party divide to work with Democrats such as Barack Obama.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/alabama-tea-party-abandoned-runoff-election\">primary runoff election in Alabama</a>, the only US congressional seat up for grabs, the business community has rallied around moderate Bradley Byrne against Tea Party favourite Dean Young, in a test case of whether the recent government shutdown will reverse the trend toward conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives.</p><p>In New York's mayoral race, Bill de Blasio is expected to become the first Democrat to win control of America's largest city for two decades as a traditional Republican focus on law-and-order issues makes way for more liberal policy priorities.</p><p>Hundreds of other cities across the country are also electing mayors, including Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Houston, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Boston.</p><p>In Detroit, the city's financial woes are expected to result in a swing away from mainstream African American candidates in favour of suburban hospital executive Mike Duggan, who leads Republican police chief Benny Napoleon in the polls.</p><p>There are also 31 special ballot measures being voted in six states, including a food-labelling measure in Washington, minimum wage increases in New Jersey, casino expansion in New York and taxes on marijuana sales in Colorado.</p><p>But the state governor races in Virginia and New Jersey are expected to draw most attention, despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/election-night-2013-chris-christie\">comfortable poll leads</a> for Cuccinelli and Christie.</p><p>Cuccinelli said a last-minute surge of anger against President Obama's healthcare reforms may yet drive voters away from Democrats, but the best hope for Republicans is likely to be a low turnout in the off-year elections that typically fail to attract as much interest as polls in a presidential or congressional election year.</p><p>Polls close in Virginia at 7pm and in New Jersey at 8pm.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421723565|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|f4f55fa6cfa69b722235847fd4e26d52386b29c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Surrey police were told the News of the World had hacked voicemail messages of the missing 13-year-old Milly Dowler while the hunt for her was ongoing, the Old Bailey has heard.</p><p></p><p>A police officer who spoke to the Sunday tabloid's managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, was told the paper had information the Surrey schoolgirl had received a call from a recruitment agency in Telford, Shropshire informing her about job interviews at the Epson computer factory in the Midlands town, the jury in the phone-hacking trial was told on Tuesday.</p><p></p><p>Kuttner had contacted Surrey police on Saturday 13 April 2002 to say the newspaper had \"information that may assist the inquiry into the disappearance of Milly Dowler\", who was later found murdered.</p><p></p><p>In a statement read to the court DS Kevin McEntee said Kuttner told him: \"The News of the World are in possession of a recording of that message.\"</p><p></p><p>The statement added that Kuttner told him they had Dowler's mobile number and pin and the newspaper \"had confirmed with school friends this was her number\".</p><p></p><p>The jury was told the paper were told by the officer it might be a hoaxer. The paper made no secret of the fact it had hacked her voice messages.</p><p></p><p>A journalist from the News of the World, Ricky Sutton, also played a recording of one of the voicemails to Surrey police, the jury heard.</p><p></p><p>Mark Bryant-Heron, counsel for the prosecution said: \"Ricky Sutton played [redacted name of Surrey police employee] a recording of intercepted voicemail over the phone to her.\"</p><p></p><p>The court heard that Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the News of the World, was on holiday in Dubai at the time, and the paper was being edited by the deputy editor, Andy Coulson.</p><p></p><p>The first edition of the paper on Sunday 14 April carried a page 9 report headlined \"Milly hoax riddle\" that quoted verbatim from some of the voicemails left on her phone, the jury heard. By the second edition the story had changed to \"Missing Milly hoax outrage\" on page 30.</p><p></p><p>Between the first and second editions, Brooks was in contact with Coulson by text twice, the jury was told. She had also been in contact with the News of the World on the Friday and Saturday, including one call to the newsdesk lasting 38 minutes and 23 seconds at 5.15pm on the Friday.</p><p></p><p>Brooks made another call just after midnight on the Friday to the night desk, and spoke to the editors twice on the Saturday morning, the jury heard.</p><p></p><p>On the Saturday afternoon she made a call at 3.24pm to the editors' desk at the tabloid lasting 20 minutes and 31 seconds.</p><p></p><p>Police obtained a court order to access voicemails left on Milly's phone while she was missing, which were read out. One said: \"Hi Milly, it's just that we want you home, bye.\"</p><p></p><p>Bryant-Heron said there was TV noise in the background, someone could be heard saying \"I just called Milly to come home\", and another voice asked why. \"Because I did,\" replied the first person. Another voicemail said: \"Hi Milly, please come home. I miss you so much. It's David.\"</p><p></p><p>According to Kuttner's notebook, the Dowler story had cost the News of the World \"£2,000 – estimate\", the court heard.</p><p></p><p>Brooks and Coulson, who are both former News of the World editors, are facing charges relating to an alleged conspiracy to listen to mobile phone voicemails of politicians, celebrities and others in a trial involving eight defendants.</p><p></p><p>It is also alleged that Brooks and Coulson conspired to commit misconduct in public office, a charge also faced by the paper's former royal correspondent Clive Goodman.</p><p></p><p>Brooks is also face a charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with her husband Charlie, an allegation also faced by her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter and News International's head of security Mark Hanna.</p><p></p><p>Kuttner, the former managing editor of the News of the World and Ian Edmondson, the paper's former head of news, are also accused of being involved in the alleged phone-hacking conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>All eight have pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p><p></p><p>The trial continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421705128|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|697c5a0d9f956f28d5e5b6760d9a3b7086e4d730 -->",

There were no other injuries.</p><p>Investigators don't believe the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Richard Shoop, intended to shoot anyone when he began firing at the ceiling and elsewhere at the Garden State Plaza on Monday night shortly before the mall's closing time, Bergen county prosecutor John Molinelli said.</p><p>\"We think he went in with the intent that he was not going to come out alive,\" Molinelli said.</p><p>He said Shoop was known to authorities and had had a problem with drugs, but he did not elaborate.</p><p>The prosecutor said Shoop left an ambiguous note with his family. While Molinelli would not call it a suicide note, he said it did \"express that an end is coming. It could have been prison. … It could have been what he did last night. It gave his family reason to reach out to us.\"</p><p>Shoop's body was discovered around 3.20am Tuesday in a back corridor of the mall, deep within a lower level, in an area that is not accessible to the public, Paramus police chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said. Shoop did not work at the mall, he said, and police are still trying to determine why he went there.</p><p>Chaos erupted shortly before the mall's 9.30pm closing time when authorities said a man dressed in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet fired shots. Molinelli said the weapon, which was modified to look like an AK-47, belonged to Shoop's brother, who owned it legally.</p><p>Witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing hysterically for the exits and hiding places at the mall, which will be closed on Tuesday.</p><p>Jessica Stigliano, 21, who'd been in the food court, told the Associated Press that she had thought, \"Not many people run for their life, but that's what I'm doing right now.\"</p><p>Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the mall, which was put on lockdown. New Jersey state police landed a helicopter in the parking lot and Swat teams with K-9 units went through the mall and evacuated anyone who was still there.</p><p>Nick Woods was working in the Lego store when a woman ran by shouting that there was a shooting.</p><p>Woods said his supervisor locked them in a back room, along with a man and a child who ran into the store. When they finally peeked out two hours later, he said they saw police officers standing outside and Woods called the 911 emergency dispatch service to ask that the officers be told they were coming out.</p><p>He said the emergency operator told him she couldn't contact individual police officers and that he should walk out with his hands in the air.</p><p>\"I had to go out of the store shouting at the officers with my hands up, and they turned and pointed their guns at me,\" Woods said. \"It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\"</p><p>Joel Castaneda, 18, who was working at the Ann Taylor Loft store, also spent time locked in a back room. He said he heard several loud bangs and thought they were from construction at the mall, but then saw people running.</p><p>He said people rushed into his store and they locked themselves in a back room – employees and customers alike – where they pulled out cellphones to try to get news or reach loved ones.</p><p>Najde Waters, who works in customer service at H&amp;M, said when they heard shots his manager and store workers followed an action plan they'd rehearsed for just such a scenario.</p><p>\"We all prepare, like schools do. We have a plan where we all meet up in the back of the store and if we can exit together out the front we do, but in this case we had to exit out the back,\" Waters said.</p><p>He said they went to their meeting place near a light pole.</p><p>The mall, which has more than 270 stores, is located about 15 miles north-west of Manhattan.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707745|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|597bd706ce0841b5b0c41c7c9e4945f1824e438b -->",

        "body":"<p>Congolese rebels have surrendered  after a 20-month uprising, offering the best hope of peace for years in the country's war-ravaged east.</p><p>The M23 rebel group declared a ceasefire and said it was ready to disarm and demobilise troops and pursue a political solution to end the crisis.</p><p>\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo,\" the M23 leader, Bertrand Bisimwa, said.</p><p>The announcement came hours after Democratic Republic of the Congo government forces drove the rebel fighters out of their two remaining strongholds. \"Tshanzu and Runyoni were taken by the army around 3am,\" government spokesman Lambert Mende told Reuters. \"Many M23 fighters are surrendering. Militarily this is finished.\"</p><p>The Kinshasa government expects peace talks mediated by neighbouring Uganda to resume soon, Mende added.</p><p>Al-Jazeera showed pictures of  M23 military leader General Sultani Makenga's abandoned home in the village of Chanzu and quoted witnesses saying he had fled to neighbouring Rwanda.</p><p>The M23 is made up of fighters who deserted the Congolese army in April 2012 following a mutiny. Its name <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531\" title=\"\">is a reference to a 23 March 2009 peace deal</a>  the CNDP militia accused the Congolese government of betraying. Eight hundred thousand people have fled their homes since the insurgency began.</p><p>The rebels' capitulation marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/africa/a-reason-for-hope-in-congos-perpetual-war.html\" title=\"\">dramatic turnaround</a>. Less than a year ago they marched into and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/congo-rebel-m23-take-goma\" title=\"\">captured the major eastern city of Goma</a> and bragged  they were ready to march on the capital. UN peacekeepers were passive spectators and the Congolese army descended into a drunken, defeated shambles.</p><p>But the lightning reversal appears to be a vindication of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/un-force-democratic-republic-congo\" title=\"\">UN decision to create its first fighting force with a mandate to go on the offensive</a>. Tanks and helicopters from the 3,000-strong UN intervention brigade have supported a reorganised, better paid and more disciplined Congolese army in the recent advances.</p><p>Perhaps most crucially of all, the backing that the M23 received from Rwanda has virtually dried up in recent months, <a href=\"http://congosiasa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/as-m23-nears-defeat-more-questions-than.html\" title=\"\">regional analyst Jason Stearns blogged last week</a>. \"According to several reports from the frontlines, despite indications of some cross-border support in the Kibumba area, the M23 was largely left to its own devices,\" Stearns wrote. \"'The Rwandans just wouldn't pick up their phone calls,' one source close to the M23 leadership told me.\"</p><p>Rwanda has always denied the charge made by the UN's group of experts that it was providing military and logistical support to the M23.</p><p>African leaders meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, congratulated Congolese government forces and the UN peace enforcement mission in eastern Congo for \"recapturing M23 strongholds and restoring government control\".

He added: \"It doesn't happen overnight, it takes time.\"</p><p>After leaving Riyadh, Kerry will travel to Poland, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Morocco before returning to Washington.

        "headline":"Battle to end anti-gay job discrimination given boost in US Senate",
        "body":"<p>A landmark bill that would ban workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people passed a key vote in the US Senate on Monday, relying on support from a few initially reluctant Republicans.</p><p>The procedural vote to move to a Senate debate on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (Enda), viewed as a key test of support for the bill, passed the Senate by 61 votes to 30, one more than required.</p><p>But the prospects of the bill eventually becoming law were dealt a blow when the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, said he did not support it. \"The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,\" Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said.</p><p>Boehner had previously avoided committing to a position on the legislation, and his opposition was a setback for supporters of the bill.</p><p>Barack Obama strongly supports Enda, and, in an op-ed piece published by the Huffington Post yesterday, said millions of LGBT Americans currently went to work fearful of losing their jobs.</p><p>\"It's offensive. It's wrong. And it needs to stop because, in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fire-able offence,\" the president wrote.</p><p>Obama compared the battle over Enda to efforts to end discrimination against women and religious and racial minorities. \"Passing Enda would build on the progress we've made in recent years,\" he added. \"When Congress passes it, I will sign it into law, and our nation will be fairer and stronger for generations to come.\"</p><p>The procedural move in the Senate required 60 votes to ensure that conservative Republicans could not block it. In total, seven Republicans joined all the members of the Democratic majority, including three who appeared to hesitate.</p><p>The vote was delayed as Republican senators Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman met in the Republican cloak room, just off the Senate floor, where they were lobbied by the legislation's backers.</p><p>Those involved in the a last-minute attempt to persuade the Republican trio included Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, and his deputy, Chuck Schumer.</p><p>All three Republicans eventually voted for the measure, ensuring it scraped through, after apparently negotiating future amendments in exchange for their support.</p><p>The fact the vote received the backing of moderate Republicans, as well as Democrats from conservative states who in previous years might have felt obliged to vote no, revealed that social attitudes in the US are changing, though slowly.</p><p>Another wavering Republican Senator, Dean Heller, had announced earlier in the day that he would back the bill, which would make it illegal for a firm in any US state to sack an individual because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.</p><p>Heller, a senator from Nevada – which is one of 22 states to have banned workplace discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation – described his decision to support the bill as \"the right thing to do\". He added: \"This legislation raises the federal standards to match what we have come to expect in Nevada, which is that discrimination must not be tolerated under any circumstance.\" The Senate last voted on Enda in 1996, when it failed by one vote.</p><p>The proposed legislation has become a touchstone issue, revealing the fissure between the moderate and more conservative wings of the GOP.</p><p>Gay and transgender advocacy groups consider the bill a critical step towards equal rights in the US. They have had the support of Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who has tried to lobby colleagues to back the bill.</p><p>However, conservative Republicans have expressed discomfort with a bill that would afford new federal rights to gay and transgender people, claiming that, if enacted, the law would enable unwarranted lawsuits. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office – the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of Congress – found the existing state-level anti-discrimination laws had led to \"relatively few\" legal actions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421667733|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|3b791d75c4ed17c9cd7b6d72efe38a1be55ed739 -->",

        "headline":"Apple creates 2,000 jobs shifting production back to US",
        "body":"<p>Nearly a decade after the closure of its last US factory, Apple is to create 2,000 manufacturing, engineering and construction jobs at a new plant in Arizona.</p><p>The California technology titan is beginning to shift production back to its home market, with the creation of its second US plant in under a year. It is understood the renewable energy powered facility in Mesa, Arizona, will produce laboratory grown sapphire crystals of the kind used in the iPhone 5S fingerprint scanner.</p><p>The initiative is a joint venture with crystal growth equipment specialist GT Advanced Technologies, which said Monday it had signed a multi-year agreement with Apple to provide furnaces to make sapphire. The material, which has been used in watch faces, is more scratch-resistant than glass and may eventually be used to make Apple's screens.</p><p>\"Apple will have an incredibly positive economic impact for Arizona,\" said governor Janice Brewer. \"Their investment in renewable energy will also be greening our power grid, and creating significant new solar and geothermal power sources for the state.\"</p><p>Run with solar and geothermal energy, which uses heat from deep underground, the plant has been designed in collaboration with local utility Salt River Project.</p><p>The building will be owned by Apple, while the furnaces will be supplied by GT Advanced, with a $578 down payment from Apple which will be reimbursed over five years starting in 2015 and is understood to come with certain exclusivity rights.</p><p>Demand for industrially produced sapphire has rocketed since Apple began using the material to protect camera lenses in 2012, according to research firm IHS Suppli. The deal will help Apple secure control over a scarce resource.</p><p>Next month, the first Macintosh computer made in America since 2004 will go on sale. The Mac Pro, whose internal parts are contained in an unusual cylindrical shell, has been produced from a purpose-built plant in Austin, Texas, in a joint venture with contract manufacturer Flextronics which has created 1,700 jobs.</p><p>Apple closed its last American computer assembly plant in Elk Grove, California, in June 2004, having by then shifted much of its production to contract manufacturers in Asia. By then, the company had given up making its own products and outsourced the work to sub-contractors such as Foxconn.</p><p>But bad publicity surrounding the treatment of workers at the plants owned by Foxconn and other companies operating in China have led Apple to take more control over production.</p><p>Other companies have followed suit. Google, which now owns the Motorola smartphone group, has opened a site in Texas, where its latest smartphones are being assembled. Caterpillar, the construction and mining equipment maker, and General Electric, have been opening factories at home in recent years. Samsung has also opened a semi-conductor fabrication plant in Texas, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/16/apple-a5-chip-made-by-samsung\" title=\"\">it makes chips for Apple</a>.</p><p>\"We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction,\" Apple said in a statement. \"This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100% renewable energy from day one.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707511|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|07554360f884181f39e68db45fe71466bd570f38 -->",

We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

        "body":"<p>Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of the jailed members of the Russian punk collective Pussy Riot, is on her way to a prison colony in the heart of Siberia, according to relatives and lawyers.</p><p>Tolokonnikova's husband, Petya Verzilov, said he had received \"100% reliable\" information that she was being moved to a prison in the Krasnoyarsk region, four time zones and 2,000 miles from Moscow. The specific prison is not yet known, said Verzilov, but early indications suggest that it will be Prison No 50 in Nizhny Ingash, a further 200 miles from the regional centre of Krasnoyarsk.</p><p>Verzilov said he believed the move was punishment for Tolokonnikova's public statements, and decision had been taken to remove her from the media spotlight as much as possible.</p><p>\"They do not have the ability to put on the usual psychological or physical pressure they can use with inmates because of the high profile of the case,\" he said. \"So they have chosen this as the punishment instead.\"</p><p>Tolokonnikova was moved after going on hunger strike over conditions in her women's prison camp, located in the region of Mordovia. In an open letter, she described a slave-like forced-labour routine, with 17-hour working days and an array of sadistic punishments. The conditions she described were reminiscent of Soviet-era Gulag literature, and sparked a huge debate both inside Russia and internationally.</p><p>Tolokonnikova, 23, complained that after writing about the conditions, prison officials put her in an \"information blockade\". On 21 October the prison service said she was being moved from the Mordovia prison, but gave no other information, and neither Verzilov nor Tolokonnikova's lawyers have had contact with her since.</p><p>Russia's human rights ombudsman, Vladimir Lukin, said on Tuesday that he had been told by Russian prison officials that Tolokonnikova was in a \"satisfactory\" state of health and was being transferred to her new prison.</p><p>According to Russian law, relatives and lawyers are not provided with any access or information during prison transfers, which can take days or weeks to complete by train, and are only informed after the prisoner has reached their final destination.</p><p>Tolokonnikova and another member of Pussy Riot, Maria Alyokhina, are serving two-year sentences for hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, for their impromptu punk performance in Moscow's main cathedral in February last year. A third member of the group who stood trial, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on appeal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421715912|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|2ceaf8b0aae83c4a4fc49ff2b0a99c6a639c6d93 -->",

        "body":"<p>A court in Bangladesh has sentenced 152 people to death for their actions in a 2009 border guard mutiny in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, were killed.</p><p>Dhaka's metropolitan sessions court judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman also sentenced 157 others, mostly border guards, to life in prison while 271 people were acquitted. The extensive case involves 846 accused, and the verdicts are still being announced.</p><p>The mutiny on 25-26 February 2009 took place two months after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, took office. The  military was unhappy over the response of the government, which did not allow troops to attack the border guards' headquarters in Dhaka where military commanders were killed.</p><p>Hasina offered an amnesty to quell the revolt but rescinded the offer when dozens of bodies were found in sewers and in mass graves.</p><p>Bangladesh's military has staged 21  coup attempts. The amnesty offer and the government's handling of the case strained the military's relationship with Hasina, and she pledged to try those responsible.</p><p>The country's criminal investigation department investigated and pressed charges against 850 people with serious crimes including murder and arson. Four of the accused died and 20 were tried in absentia.</p><p>Human rights groups have criticised Bangladesh for the mass trial, saying it will not aid justice. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week said at least 47 suspects have died in custody while the suspects have had limited access to lawyers, and to knowledge of the charges and evidence against them. Bangladeshi authorities have denied the allegations.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683522|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|fadf59be6ee731d58563b29a3578a52d924d2fa4 -->",

        "headline":"SAC Capital agrees to plead guilty to insider trading charges",
        "body":"<p>SAC Capital has become the first hedge fund to plead guilty to insider trading after an extensive six-year dragnet by government regulators, who issued a warning to future \"Gordon Gekkos\" and imposed fines that totalled $1.8bn.</p> <p>\"No institution should rest in the belief that is too big to jail,\" said Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. \"That is a moral hazard.\"</p> <p>April Brooks, who heads the New York field office of the FBI, said the proposed settlement should act as a warning to \"those who venerate Gordon Gekko\", referring to the Machiavellian capitalist in the 1987 movie Wall Street who popularized the phrase \"greed is good\".&nbsp;</p> <p>SAC has agreed to a passel of penalties, which follow a July indictment by Bharara's office. It must pay a&nbsp;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&nbsp;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period &ndash; in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission &ndash; and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&nbsp;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds&rdquo;.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649512|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|b15f8198bc38f74a8aeae18e2e1f8b0e3391a68d -->",

        "body":"<p>A knife-wielding man hijacked a bus on Monday in rural Norway and killed the driver and two passengers before he was detained by authorities, officials said.</p><p>Police in Sogn and Fjordane county in western Norway gave few details about the suspect, but described him as a local resident originally from South Sudan. Police attorney Trine Erdal said the suspect was in his early 30s, not in his 50s as police had earlier reported.</p><p>The motive for the killings was not immediately clear.</p><p>The victims were two men in their 50s – the Norwegian bus driver and a Swedish passenger – and a 19-year-old Norwegian woman, Erdal said. All had been stabbed. There were no other passengers on the bus, she added.</p><p>The suspect was initially apprehended by rescuers from the fire department who were the first to arrive on what they thought was an accident scene, police said. The suspect was later arrested by police and taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts but was not seriously injured, Norwegian news agency NTB reported.</p><p>Oslo police said they called off the deployment of an anti-terror unit after receiving reports that the suspect had been arrested.</p><p>The same bus route was attacked in 2003 when an Ethiopian man stabbed to death a bus driver, NTB said. He had earlier that day killed a Congolese asylum seeker at a refugee centre.</p><p>Multiple killings are rare in Norway, though the country was shocked by its worst peacetime massacre two years ago when Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian rightwing extremist, killed 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648950|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|26443538d56b7b9a4625ad84f50f210672fb99c2 -->",

Global greenhouse gas emissions for 2010, the latest year for which data is available, stood at 50.1 gigatonnes.</p> <p>Although the report states the window for action is &ldquo;narrowing&rdquo;, the 2C target could still be achieved by implementing ambitious emissions reduction promises, tightening the rules of existing pledges and international co-operation on areas such as energy efficiency, renewables and fossil fuel subsidies.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/climate-change-abbott-emissions-target\">Climate Change Authority said</a> that Australia&rsquo;s 5% emissions reduction goal is &ldquo;not a credible option&rdquo; and should be increased, possibly to 15% or 25%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/28/australia-should-reduce-carbon-emissions-by-at-least-25-by-2020\">A separate analysis</a> by WWF found that Australia has already burned through two-thirds of its share of a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo; that would keep the temperature rise under 2C.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, UN Environment Program executive director, said that delayed action to reduce emissions would increase the rate of climate change-fueled impacts.</p> <p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;lock-in&rsquo; would slow down the introduction of climate-friendly technologies and narrow the developmental choices that would place the global community on the path to a sustainable, green future,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the stepping stone of the 2020 target can still be achieved by strengthening current pledges and by further action, including scaling up international co-operation initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, fossil fuel subsidy reform and renewable energy.</p> <p>&ldquo;Even agriculture can contribute, as direct emissions from this sector are currently responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; more if its indirect emissions are taken into account.&rdquo;</p> <p>Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who was recently accused of &ldquo;talking through her hat&rdquo; by Tony Abbott for linking bushfires to climate change, added: &ldquo;As we head towards Warsaw for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a real need for increased ambition by all countries: ambition which can take countries further and faster towards bridging the emissions gap and a sustainable future for all.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, increased national ambition will not be enough to meet the scientific realities of climate change, which is one reason why a universal new agreement &ndash; able to catalyse international co-operation &ndash; is urgently needed by 2015.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674669|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|29dcc5d7fae06a28883e688dcc1c5f408ac48a58 -->",

        "body":"<p>Doctors and psychologists working for the US military violated the ethical codes of their profession under instruction from the defence department and the CIA to become involved in the torture and degrading treatment of suspected terrorists, an investigation has concluded.</p><p>The report of the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centres concludes that after 9/11, health professionals working with the military and intelligence services \"designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees\".</p><p>Medical professionals were in effect told that their ethical mantra \"first do no harm\" did not apply, because they were not treating people who were ill.</p><p>The report lays blame primarily on the defence department (DoD) and the CIA, which required their healthcare staff to put aside any scruples in the interests of intelligence gathering and security practices that caused severe harm to detainees, from waterboarding to sleep deprivation and force-feeding.</p><p>The two-year review by the 19-member taskforce, Ethics Abandoned: Medical Professionalism and Detainee Abuse in the War on Terror, supported by the <a href=\"http://www.imapny.org/medicine_as_a_profession/interrogationtorture-and-dual-loyalty\">Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP)</a> and the Open Society Foundations, says that the DoD termed those involved in interrogation \"safety officers\" rather than doctors. Doctors and nurses were required to participate in the force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike, against the rules of the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association. Doctors and psychologists working for the DoD were required to breach patient confidentiality and share what they knew of the prisoner's physical and psychological condition with interrogators and were used as interrogators themselves. They also failed to comply with recommendations from the army surgeon general on reporting abuse of detainees.</p><p>The CIA's office of medical services played a critical role in advising the justice department that \"enhanced interrogation\" methods, such as extended sleep deprivation and waterboarding, which are recognised as forms of torture, were medically acceptable. CIA medical personnel were present when waterboarding was taking place, the taskforce says.</p><p>Although the DoD has taken steps to address concerns over practices at Guantánamo Bay in recent years, and the CIA has said it no longer has suspects in detention, the taskforce says that these \"changed roles for health professionals and anaemic ethical standards\" remain.</p><p>\"The American public has a right to know that the covenant with its physicians to follow professional ethical expectations is firm regardless of where they serve,\" said Dr Gerald Thomson, professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia University and member of the taskforce.</p><p>He added: \"It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice. We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.\"The taskforce says that unethical practices by medical personnel, required by the military, continue today. The DoD \"continues to follow policies that undermine standards of professional conduct\" for interrogation, hunger strikes, and reporting abuse. Protocols have been issued requiring doctors and nurses to participate in the force-feeding of detainees, including forced extensive bodily restraints for up to two hours twice a day.</p><p>Doctors are still required to give interrogators access to medical and psychological information about detainees which they can use to exert pressure on them. Detainees are not permitted to receive treatment for the distress caused by their torture.</p><p>\"Putting on a uniform does not and should not abrogate the fundamental principles of medical professionalism,\" said IMAP president David Rothman. \"'Do no harm' and 'put patient interest first' must apply to all physicians regardless of where they practise.\"The taskforce wants a full investigation into the involvement of the medical profession in detention centres. It is also calling for publication of the Senate intelligence committee's inquiry into CIA practices and wants rules to ensure doctors and psychiatrists working for the military are allowed to abide by the ethical obligations of their profession; they should be prohibited from taking part in interrogation, sharing information from detainees' medical records with interrogators, or participating in force-feeding, and they should be required to report abuse of detainees.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421563159|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|e1f5a3d71ad6e588863b856dd882757b855e1b48 -->",

Dressed in a dark suit and no tie, and still full of figure, he did not even look like a prisoner. And he tried not to sound like one, either.</p><p>\"What is happening now is a military coup,\" he bellowed shortly after entering the courtroom, in the hectoring tone that Egyptians came to lampoon during his year-long presidency. \"I am furious that the Egyptian judiciary should serve as cover for this criminal military coup.\"</p><p>They were his first words in public since 2 July, when he gave a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/egypt-morsi-army-deadline-expires\" title=\"\">rambling televised speech</a> the night before he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution\" title=\"\">deposed by the army</a> following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/30/mohamed-morsi-egypt-protests\" title=\"\">days of mass protests</a> in which millions of Egyptians had called for the military to intervene.</p><p>On Monday he resurfaced for the preliminary hearing of his trial for incitement to murder. And his reappearance sparked bedlam. Seven of Morsi's co-defendants chanted against the army who ousted him, local journalists shouted for his execution, and scuffles broke out between rival lawyers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646582'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383589283702/Mohamed-Morsi-in-a-cage-i-009.jpg' alt='Mohamed Morsi in a cage in a courthouse' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi stands in a cage on the first day of his trial in Cairo.

When he finally did appear, proceedings began in an orderly enough fashion. His co-accused gave a polite round of applause as he strode defiantly into the defendants' cage, flashing a four-fingered salute known as the Rabaa sign that has become a calling card for Morsi supporters.</p><p>But the trial quickly descended into farce, with the defendants' legal team chanting Morsi's name and crying \"the people demand the return of the president\".</p><p>Morsi's co-defendants added to the chorus with chants of \"down with military rule\", a slogan the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/26/egypt-revolution-muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> declined to use before Morsi's overthrow in a vain attempt to win over the army.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646583'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383580824155/bdc62ed2-4794-4200-8d2e-a4aa28dd67a4-460x276.jpeg' alt='A supporter of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi shouts to a police officer outside of a police academy compound were the trial of ousted President Mohammed Morsi is held in Cairo, Egypt.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A supporter of Mohamed Morsi shouts to a police officer outside  a police academy compound were Morsi's trial is being held. Photograph: Manu Brabo/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Incensed, a group of local journalists responded by shouting \"execution\", a reference to the death penalty some Egyptians hope awaits Morsi and his Brotherhood allies.</p><p>Then followed a scrum of journalists – foreign and Egyptian – who clambered over the court stalls and pushed past policemen to catch their first glimpse since July of Egypt's first democratically elected president.</p><p>He appeared well, even suave in comparison to his fellow defendants, who were clad in white prison tracksuits. He did not appear to have lost weight during his spell of incarceration. Other defendants had earlier spoken of a more difficult time in prison, with one claiming to journalists from inside the defendants' cage that most of them been tortured. The hair of Mohamed Beltagy, once a member of parliament, had turned from black to grey.</p><p>After the room quietened enough to let the presiding judge formally begin proceedings, each defendant rejected the legitimacy of the court, arguing that they had been imprisoned on political grounds. \"I am Dr Mohamed Morsi and I am the president of the republic,\" shouted Morsi, when asked to identify himself. \"This coup is a crime and treasonous, and the court is held responsible for it.\"</p><p>Another melee followed, with some journalists and policemen in the courtroom calling Morsi a traitor. One lawyer tried to throw a shoe, while others held up pictures of a reporter who was shot during street clashes last December – fighting that Morsi is now accused of inciting.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646584'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383560030391/Morsi-supporters-protest--006.jpg' alt='Morsi supporters protest outside court.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi protest outside the court where he is facing charges of inciting murder.

Those at the sit-in were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/morsi-power-grab-angers-opposition\" title=\"\">demonstrating against a new constitution</a> drafted by Morsi's allies.</p><p>The confrontation sparked night-long clashes that left at least 11 dead, some of them Brotherhood supporters, and began a spiral of political upheaval that led the army to overthrow Morsi in July following days of mass protests.</p><p>One of the reporters calling for his execution alleged that she had been tortured by Muslim Brotherhood members during the clashes in December.</p><p>Morsi and his co-defendants say they were arrested for political reasons as a result of July's regime change. But human rights lawyers acting for those who died last December reminded journalists during a break in proceedings that their charges were valid and predated Morsi's overthrow.</p><p>\"This is not a case that has been orchestrated,\" said Ragia Omran, a lawyer for the victims' families. \"It's important to note that we filed the charges on 5 December itself.\"</p><p>Pandemonium inside the court twice forced the trial's adjournment. Each time it reconvened, Morsi made a further speech. He spoke out four times in total.</p><p>\"This is not a court,\" he said in his fourth outburst. \"This court, with all due respect to the people in it, is not specialised to deal with the trial of the president of the republic. This is a coup. I am held against my will. The coup is treasonous and a crime, and I am president of the republic.\"</p><p>The defendants' outbursts led to unlikely exchanges between them and the judge, Ahmed Sabry Youssef, who tried to calm them in an avuncular fashion. \"Mohamed, you are not the one running the court,\" Youssef told Mohamed Beltagy, another Muslim Brotherhood member, after he disrupted proceedings. \"I am the one running the court.\"</p><p>During Morsi's final outburst, Youssef repeatedly told the former president \"malesh\" (\"never mind\") before giving up and leaving the courtroom for good. An official later announced that the next session would be on 8 January, and said Morsi would be sent to prison instead of being held incommunicado in a military facility.</p><p>Morsi refused to give the power of attorney to the lawyer secured for him by colleagues outside prison – Selim al-Awa, a prominent Islamist thinker who also ran for president last year. But one of the Brotherhood's legal team later grudgingly admitted that Morsi and his colleagues would have to engage with the trial.</p><p>\"The defendants don't want to recognise it, but this is the de facto court,\" said Bahaa Abdelrahman, a lawyer acting for Essam el-Arian, a senior Brotherhood official who was arrested last week. \"And we are going to have to deal with it.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421645663|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|fda35564a11f49d549ea866cb051e48f31289b65 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|e96e3aa7bbaed098fa2e2708b7443900d817483f -->",

        "headline":"Texas healthcare providers take abortion fight to US supreme court",
        "body":"<p>Women's healthcare providers in Texas took their battle over the legal right to abortion to the supreme court on Monday, filing an emergency request to strike down newly enacted restrictions they say will cause \" irreparable harm\" to those seeking abortions in the state.</p> <p>Scores of women seeking abortions in Texas have already been turned away and at least 14 clinics and surgery centres have been forced to shut down in the last few days as a result of an extreme state law, HB2, which came into effect late Thursday night, clinic staff said.</p> <p>A week ago, a US district judge put a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/texas-abortion-law-blocked-federal-judge\">temporary stop</a> on a requirement of the new law, that physicians who provide abortions have admitting privileges in local hospitals. The judge said it placed an undue burden on a woman seeking abortion and was therefore unconstitutional.&nbsp;</p> <p>But, in a surprise decision last Thursday, a federal appeals court allowed most of the provisions of the new law to go ahead, while a legal challenge over the restrictions moved through the courts.</p> <p>Louise Melling, the&nbsp;deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Last week&rsquo;s court decision allowing this extreme measure to take effect has already begun to hit the state of Texas like a tsunami, taking away vital health services from women. ... The women of Texas are counting on the supreme court&nbsp;to ensure they have access to the care they need.&rdquo;</p> <p>The admitting privilege provision in HB2 was part of a sweeping anti-abortion law, passed in July by the Republican-led Texas legislature that attracted national attention after state senator Wendy Davis held an 11-hour filibuster to block it in June. Although she was successful, the law was passed in a special session in the state.</p> <p>A panel of judges at the fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans ruled last Thursday that Texas can enforce the law while a lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward. Attorneys for the state argued that Texas has the right to put in place laws that discourage abortion and said opponents had not proven in court that the law could cut off access to abortions.</p> <p>The reproductive health groups, who are asking the US supreme court to reinstate the district court's injunction granted a week ago, cite evidence presented earlier to that court, showing the requirement for admitting privileges would prevent 20,000 Texas women who would otherwise have had an abortion from accessing one. The application said that other women will face delays in obtaining abortions, and will therefore face an increased risk of complications.</p> <p>The US supreme court&nbsp;on Monday dismissed another abortion case involving Oklahoma. The dismissal left intact an Oklahoma court ruling that invalidated a state law cracking down on the use of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486.</p> <p>At a press call organised on Monday by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights &ndash; who jointly filed a lawsuit against the law last month on behalf of more than a dozen women's health providers and their patients &ndash; staff said the law had already \"wreaked substantial harm\" on their patients.</p> <p>Ken Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood in Greater Texas, said they had to turn away 100 patients in two clinics over the last few days.</p> <p>Lambrecht said: \"Patients are scared, some are angry\". He said that, currently, one in three women in Texas is not able to access abortion services. He warned: \"Women will seek care whether its safe and accessible or not. We're fighting the fight to provide safe and accessible care in our centres.\"</p> <p>Marni Evans, one of the women turned away from a clinic in Texas after the latest legal twist in the case, spoke of the \"soul searching\" involved in her and her fianc&eacute;, John, coming to a decision to have the procedure and how traumatic it was to have that decision taken away, when her appointment was cancelled.</p> <p>Evans, 37, an independent consultant from Austin, Texas, told reporters during a conference call that, she is now considering flying to Seattle, where she used to live to have an abortion.</p> <p>\"The decision for me or for any women to have an abortion is not easy, it is complicated,\" she said. \"We can barely afford our own healthcare let alone have a child.\"</p> <p>\"I can't help but wonder what other less fortunate women will do,\" she said.</p> <p>Another health provider, Whole Woman's health, said that it had been forced to turn away 45 patients in one day alone.</p> <p>In striking down HB2 last week, Judge Lee Yeakel said: &ldquo;The&nbsp;admitting privileges provision of House Bill 2 lacks a rational basis and places an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion.&rdquo;</p> <p>On Monday, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the CRR, described the provision as a \"bogus law that attempts to&nbsp;do underhandedly what states cannot do directly &ndash; block women from accessing abortion service.\"</p> <p>The groups said that many clinics would be forced to shut down permanently, even if the lawsuit is decided in their favour, because many are small and would go out of business before the legal process is complete.</p> <p>The provision requiring admitting privileges for physicians at abortion facilities was part of a sweeping anti-abortion law, that also requires abortion clinics to meet heightened building standards, bans abortion after 20 weeks and requires strict adherence to federal guidelines in prescribing medicated abortion.</p> <p>In the application, addressed to Judge Antonin Scalia, to vacate the decision by the appeals court on Thursday, the Fifth Circuit's finding was described as an \"outlier\" because most of the courts who had looked at admitting privileges had found it to be unconstitutional.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421654646|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|1d107388b3fa6b7b2753f017f32316c43550364f -->",

        "body":"<p>Scientists are struggling to find the trigger for a disease that appears to be ravaging starfish in record numbers along the US west coast, causing the sea creatures to lose their limbs and turn to slime in a matter of days.</p><p>Marine biologists and ecologists will launch an extensive survey this week along the coasts of California, Washington state and Oregon to determine the reach and source of the deadly syndrome, known as \"star wasting disease\".</p><p>\"It's pretty spooky because we don't have any obvious culprit for the root cause even though we know it's likely caused by a pathogen,\" said Pete Raimondi, the chairman of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California.</p><p>Signs of the syndrome typically begin with white lesions on the arms of the starfish that spread inward, causing the entire animal to disintegrate in less than a week, according to a report by the Pacific Rocky Intertidal Monitoring Program at the University of California.</p><p>Starfish have suffered from the syndrome on and off for decades but have usually been reported in small numbers, isolated to southern California and linked to a rise in seawater temperatures, which is not the case this time, Raimondi said.</p><p>Since June, wasting starfish have been found in dozens of coastal sites ranging from south-east Alaska to Orange County, California, and the mortality rates have been higher than ever seen before, Raimondi said. In one surveyed tide pool in Santa Cruz during the current outbreak, 90-95% of hundreds of starfish were killed by the disease.</p><p>\"Their tissue just melts away,\" said Melissa Miner, a biologist and researcher with the Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network, a group of government agencies, universities and non-profit groups that monitor tidal wildlife and environment along the west coast.</p><p>Miner, based in Washington state, has studied wasting starfish locally and in Alaska since June, when only a few cases had been reported. \"It has ballooned into a much bigger issue since then,\" she said.</p><p>The syndrome primarily affects the mussel-eating Pisaster ochraceus, a large purple and orange starfish, but Raimondi said that at least 10 species have shown signs of the disease since June.</p><p>If the numbers of Pisaster ochraceus begin to decrease, mussels could crowd the ocean, disrupting biodiversity, he said.</p><p>In addition to on-site sampling, scientists in the coming months will use an interactive map to spot starfish wasting location patterns and help identify a driver for the disease.</p><p>Raimondi said he could not estimate, out of the millions of starfish on the west Coast, how many have been affected or could be in the future.</p><p>\"We're way at the onset now, so we just don't know how bad it's going to get,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421677955|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|49f0399120a9d213bed062e34bb26b1409d1d9b1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The bears that gather around Churchill waiting for the waters in Hudson Bay to freeze over are the most studied on Earth. Scientists have tracked their decline, linked to climate change, for more than 20 years. Conservation officials have tagged most of them. Locals have given them names – though some of those admittedly are less than complimentary: one of the large adult males is known as Lardass.</p><p>From Tuesday, anyone with a web browser can make their own observations of the polar bears of Hudson Bay, through <a href=\"http://explore.org/#!/live-cams/player/polar-bear-tundra-buggy-cam\" title=\"\">a series of live feeds installed by the group Explore.org</a> at a number of locations around the town of Churchill and along the shores of the bay.</p><p>The sites were chosen for their vantage points over the polar bears' typical routes as they undergo their annual migration from a summer of fasting on land to newly frozen sea ice.</p><p>The cameras were positioned: atop an enormous grain elevator in the Churchill port; inside a historic fur trading fort; on a research tower in a national park; at a tundra lodge; and on tundra buggies, the trailers mounted on monster truck-sized tyres used to transport tourists.</p><p>\"At Explore.org we can't solve global warming but our live cams can bring the world up close and personal with nature,\" said Charlie Annenberg, founder of Explore.org. \"Simply put, the citizens are now the scientists.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421715948'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383664214003/Polar-bears-on-live-webca-008.jpg' alt='Polar bears on live webcams in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Polar bears in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Photograph: Explore.org</figcaption></figure><p>The warming of the Arctic is extending the number of ice-free days in Hudson Bay, forcing the bears off the sea ice, and away from their main diet of ring seals, and on to the land.</p><p>\"Over time, as they return to the ice later and later, they return to the ice in poorer condition every year,\" said Martyn Obbard, a research scientist with the Ontario ministry of natural resources who studies the bears of southern Hudson Bay.</p><p>Capturing that journey on camera, and then live-streaming the video over the internet from a remote, sub-Arctic location, presents obvious challenges. There is no road system around Churchill, and no communications outside town. \"It's a cold place to work, the weather never co-operates and of course there are polar bears running around,\" said BJ Kirschhoffer, director of field operations for <a href=\"http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/\" title=\"\">Polar Bears International</a>, who worked with the Explore.org crew to help install the cameras.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421715949'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383664149401/Polar-bears-on-live-webca-008.jpg' alt='Polar bears on live webcams in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The sites were chosen for their vantage points over the polar bears' typical routes as they undergo their annual migration. Photograph: Explore.org</figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago, Kirschhoffer mounted a camera on a boom arm extending out of a tundra buggy. \"It provided a low, eye-to-eye view with a polar bear, but could move up and out of the reach of the bear,\" he said. The camera itself was mounted intside a protective plastic bubble.</p><p>\"This bear just wandered over and the camera was low,\" said Kirschhoffer. \"I didn't see it coming around the corner. It was very curious of the camera. It sniffed it for a moment. It opened its mouth, and then it put its canine teeth right on the plastic dome.\"</p><p>By the time he could react and get to the controls to raise the boom, there were two puncture holes in the protective dome. \"I still have the dome with the two little puncture holes in it, just perfectly sized for the canine teeth,\" Kirschhoffer said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421691176|2013-11-05T17:52:57Z|651f98de06331fa9c208f8502979f4489e6db478 -->",
