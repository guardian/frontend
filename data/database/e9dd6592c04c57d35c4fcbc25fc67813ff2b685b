        "body":"<p>Libya has demanded an explanation for the \"kidnapping\" of one of its citizens by American special forces, hours after a separate US military raid on a terrorist target in Somalia ended in apparent failure and retreat.</p><p>In Tripoli the US army's Delta force seized alleged al-Qaida leader Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known by his alias Abu Anas al-Liby and wanted for the 1998 bombings of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/aug/08/kenya.garyyounge\" title=\"\">US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> that killed more than 220 people.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/world/africa/a-terrorism-suspect-long-known-to-prosecutors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=1&amp;\">New York Times reported</a> that Liby was being held in military custody and interrogated on board a navy ship, the USS Antonio, in the Mediterranean.</p><p>But US navy Seals suffered a major setback when they launched an amphibious assault to capture an Islamist militant leader said to be Ahmed Godane, described as Africa's most wanted man and the architect of last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya-terror\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate shopping</a> mall in Kenya. The elite Seals were beaten back by heavy fire and apparently abandoned equipment that the Somali militants photographed and posted on the internet.</p><p>As dramatic details of Saturday's twin operations emerged, US secretary of state John Kerry insisted that terrorists \"can run but they can't hide\" <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/us-military-bases-africa\" title=\"\">, but faced growing questions about America's military reach in Africa</a> and the consequences of unilateral aggression.</p><p>Speaking in Indonesia on Monday, Kerry said the seizure of Liby complied with US law, the Associated Press reported. He said the suspect was a \"legal and appropriate target\" for the US military and would face justice in court. It was important not to \"sympathise\" with wanted terrorists, Kerry said.</p><p>Liby was captured outside his family home at 6.15am in Noufle'een, a quiet suburb in eastern Tripoli, according to witnesses, but there were conflicting reports over who took him. His brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press that Liby was parking when a convoy of three vehicles encircled his car. Armed gunmen smashed the car's window and seized Liby's gun before grabbing him and taking him away, the report said. The brother said Liby's wife saw the kidnapping from her window and described the abductors as foreign-looking armed \"commandos\".</p><p>But Liby's son Abdullah insisted Libyan forces were involved. Appearing on Tripoli's Nabir TV station, he said: \"The people who took my father were Libyan, not Americans – they spoke with Tripoli accents.</p><p>\"My mother was listening to the voices in the street and could see it all through the window. There were two cars and a bus with blacked-out windows and no number plates.\"</p><p>He said his father was dragged from his car and arrested while it was still moving, and the vehicle, driverless, continued driving empty down the road.</p><p>Liby, who was thought to be a computer specialist for al-Qaida and lived in Manchester in the UK during the 1990s, is believed to be 49 and on the FBI's most-wanted list with a $5m (£3m) bounty on his head. Pentagon spokesman George Little said he is \"currently lawfully detained by the US military in a secure location outside of Libya\".</p><p>Liby was expected eventually to be sent to New York for criminal prosecution, the New York Times reported.</p><p>Libya's government refused to say whether its forces were involved in the arrest and claimed it had not been informed in advance. A statement from the prime minister, Ali Zaidan, said: \"The Libyan government is following the news of the kidnapping of a Libyan citizen who is wanted by US authorities. The Libyan government has contacted US authorities to ask them to provide an explanation.\"</p><p>Thousands of miles away in Somalia, US special forces carried out a raid that was no less audacious but had a very different outcome. It was reportedly planned a week and a half ago in response to the Nairobi attack and came 20 years to the week after an American mission that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/01/black-hawk-down-reel-history\" title=\"\">infamously went awry</a> when Somali fighters shot down two Black Hawk helicopters.</p><p>Members of Seal Team Six – the unit that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan hideout in 2011 – swam ashore from speedboats before members of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab rose for dawn prayers, officials and witnesses said. They stormed a two-storey beachside house in Barawe said to be occupied by foreign members of al-Shabaab and battled their way inside, a fighter who gave his name as Abu Mohamed told AP. There was a heavy gunbattle at about 2.30am on Saturday, according to locals in Barawe, about 60 miles south of the capital Mogadishu. Mohamed Hassan, a schoolteacher, said: \"Nearly an hour before the morning prayer I heard dogs bark and I got up, but within minutes I heard small gun fire towards the direction of the beach. I raised my ears up as the shooting continued and continued. Soon it became like an exchange of fire. Then I heard one big explosion and two other explosions occurred. I could not go outside so I remained in my room to wait what was happening.\"</p><p>Hassan said the shooting he could hear was that of al-Shaabab's fighters because he understood the US forces were using silencer guns so no one could hear their shooting. \"In the morning, we saw people gathering near the house the US forces targeted and there was a lot of blood everywhere. The al-Shabaab fighters told us not to go to the direction of the house. I saw one dead and two others injured but they were not very critical.\"</p><p>No one in Barawe town could have imagined such an attack, he added, and they kept saying only \"white soldiers attacking Barawe town\". Local residents said late on Saturday that al-Shabaab deployed additional fighters in Barawe to keep guard at the beach where the navy Seals landed.</p><p>US officials told AP that the Seals encountered fiercer resistance than expected, so after a 15- to 20-minute firefight, the unit leader decided to abort the mission and they swam away.</p><p>A local resident, Haji Nur, said he saw military equipment which al-Shabaab claimed to have confiscated from the soldiers. \"I saw in the centre of the town a crowd of people gathering and looked at three rounds of M16 ammunition, one US-made hand grenade and one also a bulletproof jacket.\"</p><p>Al-Shabaab, which has a formal alliance with al-Qaida and claimed responsibility for the Nairobi mall killings that killed at least 67 people, posted what it claimed were pictures of the equipment on the web.</p><p>Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Mus'ab, a spokesman for al-Shabaab, said: \"Early on Saturday morning, around 2am, white soldiers attacked a house resided in by some members of the Mujahideen leaders in Somalia. They came from a waiting speedboat from warship and as they were approaching the house, our Mujahideen fighters repulsed them. They ran away. We chased them until they have reached the seaside where they urgently boarded their speedboats.\"</p><p>Mus'ab said one al-Shabaab member had died and claimed that the Seals lost a \"senior officer\". US officials said there were no US casualties in either the Somali or Libyan operation.</p><p>A resident of Barawe who gave his name as Mohamed Bile told the AP that militants closed down the town in the hours after the assault, and that all traffic and movements have been restricted. Militants were carrying out house-to-house searches, likely to find evidence that a spy had given intelligence to a foreign power used to launch the attack, he said.</p><p>A Somali intelligence official was quoted as saying that Godane, the al-Shabaab leader also known Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the target of Saturday's raid. Mohamed Ansari, a former al-Shabaab member now working with Somalia's counter-terrorism unit in Mogadishu, said: \"Godane is the only big fish in Barawe to hunt. Godane as the top leader of al-Shabaab and the only planner of the group's operations is seen as the mastermind of Westgate mall siege in Nairobi.\"</p><p>Unlike his Libyan counterpart, Somali prime minister Abdi Farah Shirdon welcomed the US intervention. \"We have close cooperation with the world, especially the western countries in the fight against al-Shabaab,\" he said in Mogadishu on Sunday. \"We welcome any operation to hunt the terrorist leaders and we are at the forefront. Al-Shabaab is a Somali problem, a regional problem and world problem.\"</p><p>The dual raids were a vivid of expression of how the <a href=\"http://www.africom.mil\" title=\"\">US has quietly been building its military capacity in Africa</a>. Kerry, who is in Indonesia for an economic summit, said: \"We hope that this makes clear that the United States of America will never stop in the effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror. Members of al-Qaida and other terrorist organisations literally can run but they can't hide.\"</p><p>But a diplomatic source focused on Somalia said: \"This is knee-jerk stuff and smacks of a massive failure of intelligence. Are extrajudicial killings and covert kidnapping raids the best way of dealing with the problem? Why is the international response so feeble?\"</p><p>But Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in South Africa, said that while it was in the interest of African governments to fight terrorism, he does not \"think the heavy-handed and unilateral way the US acts is helpful and it risks causing further instability, especially where there are weak governments like in Libya and Somalia\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191176|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|168dd9b5102916c0ad8e26061e0699b88c8410bb -->",

        "body":"<p>The United States and Russia are \"very pleased\" with progress in destroying Syria's chemical weapons stocks,&nbsp;US secretary of state John Kerry said on Monday. He offered some rare, if qualified, US praise for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Kerry, speaking at a press conference with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, said the Assad regime deserved credit for its speedy compliance thus far with the UN security council resolution calling for the elimination of the weapons. But Kerry stressed Assad was not yet off the hook.</p> <p>\"Let me be crystal clear,\" Kerry said, \"we're very pleased with the pace of what has happened with respect to chemical weapons.\"</p> <p>He noted that&nbsp;experts had started the process of destroying the stockpiles on Sunday, just over a week after the United Nations security council and the international chemical weapons watchdog acted.</p> <p>\"I think that was a terrific example of global co-operation, of multilateral efforts to accomplish an accepted goal and they have moved with equal speed to get on the ground in Syria and begin the operations,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think it is also credit to the Assad regime for complying rapidly as they are supposed to,\" Kerry said. \"We hope that will continue. Now, I am not going to vouch today for what happens months down the road. But it is a good beginning and we should welcome a good beginning.\"</p> <p>Kerry and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit (Apec) on the Indonesian island of Bali.</p> <p>Lavrov said the Assad regime, an ally of Russia's, was co-operating fully. He stressed that the Western- and Arab-backed opposition must also comply and must ensure that chemical weapons not fall into the hands of extremists. Russia has accused the opposition of being behind the chemical weapons attack on 21 August that most countries blame on the regime.</p> <p>\"The responsibility is not only on the Syrian government, but also on the opposition and all the states in this sphere should of course not allow these weapons to fall into the hands of non-state actors,\" Lavrov said.</p> <p>Kerry and Lavrov said they continued to make progress on preparations for an international conference to help set up a transitional government for Syria. The United Nations has said it would like to host the meeting in Geneva in mid-November. The meeting has been repeatedly delayed but Kerry and Lavrov said they hoped the rough date would hold.</p> <p>Lavrov said the Syrian government had agreed to take part in the conference and urged the US and other supporters of the opposition to convince Assad's foes to attend. The opposition is splintered and has been unable so far to produce a delegation that could go to Geneva.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213368|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|caa2bca19b173361ae61e3a02200b24dd039a062 -->",

        "headline":"Binyamin Netanyahu: occupation is not cause of conflict",
        "body":"<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyhau, has said there will never be peace with the Palestinians until they recognise Israel as a Jewish state, and has dismissed Israel's military occupation of Palestinian land and the growth of Israeli settlements as the root cause of the conflict.</p><p>In an uncompromising speech, Netanyahu insisted  the Palestinians must abandon their core demand of the right of refugees to return to their places of origin. \"Unless the Palestinians recognise the Jewish state and give up on the right of return there will not be peace,\" the prime minister said in an address at Bar-Ilan University on Sunday.</p><p>But, he added, even such recognition by the Palestinian leadership would be insufficient. \"After generations of incitement we have no confidence that such recognition will percolate down to the Palestinian people. That is why we need extremely strong security arrangements and to go forward, but not blindly,\" he said.</p><p>The tone of Netanyahu's speech will dismay those on both sides and in the international community who believe that renewed peace talks, brokered by the US, represent possibly the last chance for a deal to create a Palestinian state and  end  the decades-old conflict.</p><p>It will fuel suspicion that, despite his professed readiness to engage in peace talks, Netanyahu is unwilling to make an historic agreement involving Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, dismantling settlements and sharing Jerusalem as the capital of both states.</p><p>The prime minister's speech was delivered at the same venue where Netanyahu first acknowledged the need for a two-state solution to the conflict in 2009. That address was hailed by many commentators as a significant breakthrough by the Israeli leader, and was vehemently attacked by rightwingers as a dangerous concession.</p><p>In Sunday's speech, Netanyahu dismissed Israel's 46-year-long occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza as the root cause of the conflict, saying it was based in Arab rejection of Jewish immigration to what was Palestine.</p><p>\"When anyone is asked what is the source of the conflict, the standard answer is the occupation, the territories, the settlements. They say that the Israeli takeover of Judea and Samaria [the biblical term for the West Bank] following the [1967] Six-Day war to a large extent created the conflict, and I ask whether that is true,\" he said.</p><p>\"The conflict, if I have to choose a date when it began in earnest, began in the year 1921, on the day Palestinian Arabs attacked the immigrants' house in Jaffa. This attack, of course, had nothing to do with the territories or settlements. It was against the immigration of Jews to the Land of Israel.</p><p>\"Then came the partition plan in 1947, with the suggestion of an Arab state alongside a Jewish state. The Jews agreed, the Arabs refused. Because the issue was not then the question of a Palestinian state – the issue was and remains the Jewish state. Then 19 years later came the stranglehold around us aimed at uprooting us. And why? After all, then there was no occupation.\"</p><p>The Palestinians say that their goal in peace talks is an end to the Israeli military occupation and the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. They say they have long recognised the state of Israel, but formal recognition of it as a Jewish state would be to deny the existence and rights of the 20% of Israel's population that is Palestinian and to effectively abandon the right of return.</p><p>Peace talks resumed in July and are scheduled to last until next spring but are said to be progressing slowly. The US secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.549061\" title=\"\">John Kerry, said last month</a> that  talks would intensify and \"American participation should be increased somewhat in order to try to help facilitate [progress]\".  His comments strongly suggested that the two sides were making little headway.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419222374|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|b71feb7d35c75ec70ad7e4f8ac38c973b3a9db82 -->",

        "headline":"Republicans defiant over US shutdown compromise amid Treasury warning",
        "body":"<p>The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, on Sunday accused Congress of \"playing with fire\" as the White House and Republicans remained entrenched over the government shutdown and the extension of the debt ceiling.</p><p>Appearing on CNN's State of the Union during a tour of the Sunday talk shows, Lew said there was no option that would prevent the government from defaulting on its bills <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/republicans-debt-limit-treasury-economy\">should lawmakers refuse to vote to raise the debt ceiling before the 17 October deadline</a>. Senior Republicans, however, lined up to insist in response that they would not compromise in their attempt to dismantle or defund Obamacare, the president's signature healthcare reform.</p><p>\"There is no option that prevents us from being in default if we don't have enough cash to pay our bills,\" Lew said. Asked if President Barack Obama could bypass Congress and use other measures to raise the debt ceiling and avoid defaulting, Lew said the only available solution was through Congress.</p><p>\"The White House has spoken quite clearly to this,\" Lew said. \"The president does not have the authority to take action in that kind of a way. The president consulted with his lawyers, and that's the conclusion that he's reached.\"</p><p>The government will reach its borrowing limit on 17 October, Lew said. \"I'm telling you that on the 17th, we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire.\"</p><p>Lew repeatedly said that \"50 to 100\" members of Congress\" stood in the way of a resolution to the crisis which has now shut down the federal government for five days. Such politicians, he said, referring to right-wing Republicans, had \"changed the rules of the game\".</p><p>Lew was scheduled to appear on five Sunday news shows as the Obama administration sought to force Congress to take action. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/ted-cruz-texas-maverick\">Texas senator Ted Cruz</a>, one of the most outspoken voices against Obamacare, was among the Republicans who appeared to answer him. Cruz told CNN that Republicans should seek three things in exchange for passing a debt ceiling deal.</p><p>\"We should look for some significant structural plan to reduce government spending,\" he said. \"Number two, we should avoid new taxes. And number three we should look for ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/americans-blame-republicans-government-shutdown\">Recent polls have shown that more people blame Republicans than blame Obama for the shutdown</a>. In a signal of the toxicity of the shutdown as a political issue, the Republican candidate for the governorship of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/cuccinelli-shuns-cruz-limelight-97888.html?hp=t1\"> reportedly went to great lengths to avoid being seen with Cruz</a> when they both spoke at a gala in Richmond, Virginia, on Saturday night. </p><p>Cruz praised Cuccinelli as \"principled and fearless\" during his speech at Richmond convention centre. Cuccinelli did not mention Cruz during his remarks and avoided being photographed with the Tea Party favourite.</p><p>Asked by CNN's Candy Crowley if he thought he had \"damaged the Republican party brand\" – in light of reports of division over Cruz's actions, which have included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-speech-fault-lines-republicans\">a 21-hour Senate speech in a fruitless attempt to stop the passage of a budget bill without any provisions to defund Obamacare</a>, Cruz said: \"Not remotely.\"</p><p>The House speaker, John Boehner, has been criticised by some as being held hostage by a relatively small group of Tea Party-backed Republican members of Congress. Some have speculated that there are enough votes in Congress between Democrats and moderate Republicans to pass a \"clean bill\" – one without stipulations on dismantling Obamacare – <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/john-boehner-continuing-resolution_n_4053175.html\">if Boehner would bring it to the floor</a>. Lew repeated this idea on CNN and on NBC's Meet the Press.</p><p>On Sunday, however, Boehner attempted to shift the blame, insisting there were not enough votes in the House. Speaking on ABC's This Week, he said: \"There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR.\" Boehner added that the House would not pass a bill raising the debt ceiling without a provision related to Obamacare.</p><p>\"We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],\" Boehner said. \"The votes are not in the House … We are not going down that path.\"</p><p>The Kentucky senator Rand Paul, appearing on Meet the Press, completed the Republicans' united front. \"We've been putting out clean CRs all week,\" he said, referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/republicans-piecemeal-budget-votes-democrats\">the piecemeal legislation House Republicans have put forward to fund individual strands of government</a>, which on Saturday included a bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/05/house-representatives-pass-bill-reimburse-furlough-workers\">to assure furloughed federal employees of the reimbursement of lost pay</a>.</p><p>Paul said no one was \"winning\" from the shutdown and said House members had been \"wanting to fund government\" – apart from Obamacare. Asked why Republicans in the Congress had shut down the government over a bill that had passed both Houses, been signed into law by the president and then been upheld by the supreme court, Paul said it was \"Congress's job to oversee spending\".</p><p>\"It's not their obligation once something is law to never change it,\" he said. \"It's a silly argument for Democrats to say: 'Oh the law's been passed, we can never change it.'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187550|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|ede532707e2f444536e57604e5b63ab4d3f44668 -->",

        "body":"<p>Athletes and spectators attending the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February will face some of the most invasive and systematic spying and surveillance in the history of the Games, documents shared with the Guardian show.</p><p>Russia's powerful FSB security service plans to ensure that no communication by competitors or spectators goes unmonitored during the event, according to a dossier compiled by a team of Russian investigative journalists looking into preparations for the 2014 Games.</p><p>In a ceremony on Red Square on Sunday afternoon, the president, Vladimir Putin, held the Olympic flame aloft and sent it on its epic journey around the country, saying Russia and its people had always been imbued with the qualities of \"openness and friendship\", making Sochi the perfect destination for the Olympics.</p><p>But  government procurement documents and tenders from Russian communication companies indicate that newly installed telephone and internet spying capabilities will give the FSB free rein to intercept any telephony or data traffic and even track the use of sensitive words or phrases mentioned in emails, webchats and on social media.</p><p>The journalists, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, who are experts on the Russian security services, collated dozens of open source technical documents published on the <a href=\"zakupki.gov.ru\" title=\"\">Zakupki government procurement agency website</a>, as well as public records of government oversight agencies. They found that major amendments have been made to telephone and Wi-Fi networks in the Black Sea resort to ensure extensive and all-permeating monitoring and filtering of all traffic, using Sorm, Russia's system for intercepting phone and internet communications.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419182875'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381067839051/Putin-at-Olympic-flame-ce-009.jpg' alt='Putin at Olympic flame ceremony' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Putin at a Sochi Olympic flame ceremony in Moscow on Sunday. Photograph: Ivan Sekretarev/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The Sorm system is being modernised across Russia, but particular attention has been paid to Sochi given the large number of foreign visitors expected next year. Technical specifications set out by the Russian state telecoms agency also show that a controversial technology known as deep packet inspection, which allows intelligence agencies to filter users by particular keywords, is being installed across Russia's networks, and is required to be compatible with the Sorm system.</p><p>\"For example you can use the keyword Navalny, and work out which people in a particular region are using the word Navalny,\" says Soldatov, referring to Alexei Navalny, Russia's best-known opposition politician. \"Then, those people can be tracked further.\"</p><p>Ron Deibert, a professor at the University of Toronto and  director of Citizen Lab, which co-operated with the Sochi research, describes the Sorm amendments as \"Prism on steroids\", referring to the programme used by the NSA in the US and revealed to the Guardian by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. \"The scope and scale of Russian surveillance are similar to the disclosures about the US programme but there are subtle differences to the regulations,\" says Deibert. \"We know from Snowden's disclosures that many of the checks were weak or sidestepped in the US, but in the Russian system permanent access for Sorm is a requirement of building the infrastructure.\"</p><p>\"Even as recently as the Beijing Olympics, the sophistication of surveillance and tracking capabilities were nowhere near where they are today.\"</p><p>Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, which also co-operated with the research, said: \"Since 2008, more people are travelling with smartphones with far more data than back then, so there is more to spy on.\"</p><p>Wary of Sorm's capabilities, earlier this year a leaflet from the US state department's bureau of diplomatic security warned anyone travelling to the Games to be extremely cautious with communications.</p><p>\"Business travellers should be particularly aware that trade secrets, negotiating positions, and other sensitive information may be taken and shared with competitors, counterparts, and/or Russian regulatory and legal entities,\" the document reads.  The advice contains an extraordinary list of precautions for visitors who wish to ensure safe communications, such as removing batteries from phones when not in use and only travelling with \"clean\" devices.</p><p>Soldatov and Borogan have discovered that the FSB has been working since 2010 to upgrade the Sorm system to ensure it can cope with the extra traffic during the Games. All telephone and ISP providers have to install Sorm boxes in their technology by law, and once installed, the FSB can access data without the provider ever knowing, meaning every phone call or internet communication can be logged. Although the FSB technically requires a warrant to intercept a communication, it is not obliged to show it to anyone.</p><p>Tellingly, the FSB has appointed one of its top counterintelligence chiefs, Oleg Syromolotov, to be in charge at Sochi: security will thus be overseen by someone who has spent his career chasing foreign spies rather than terrorists.</p><p>Another target may well be gay rights, likely to be one of the biggest issues of the Games. Putin has said that competitors who wear rainbow pins, for example, will not be arrested under the country's controversial new law that bans \"homosexual propaganda\". However, it is likely that any attempts to stage any kind of rally or gathering to support gay rights will be ruthlessly broken up by police, as has been the case on numerous occasions in Russian cities in the past. Using DPI, Russian authorities will be able to identify, tag and follow all visitors to the Olympics, both Russian and foreign, who are discussing gay issues, and possibly planning to organise protests.</p><p>\"Athletes may have particular political views, or they may be openly gay,\" says Deibert. \"I think given recent developments in Russia, we have to be worried about these issues.\"</p><p>At a rare FSB press conference this week, an official, Alexei Lavrishchev, denied security and surveillance at the Games would be excessive, and said that the London Olympics featured far more intrusive measures. \"There, they even put CCTV cameras in, excuse me for saying it, the toilets,\" said Lavrishchev. \"We are not taking this kind of measure.\"</p><p>The FSB did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian, while a spokesperson for the Sochi Olympics referred all requests to the security services. But Russian authorities often express a belief that NGOs working on human rights and other issues have subversive agendas dictated from abroad, and the FSB apparently feels that with so many potentially dangerous foreigners descending on the Black Sea resort for the Olympics, it has a duty to keep an eye on them.</p><p>In the end, the goal is overarching, but simple, says Soldatov: \"Russian authorities want to make sure that every connection and every move made online in Sochi during the Olympics will be absolutely transparent to the secret services of the country.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418738377|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|734bc0785c4841957908b664685b1cd552721e04 -->",

        "headline":"Egypt: dozens of protesters killed as rival factions tear Cairo apart",
        "body":"<p>At least 51 people died in clashes across Egypt  as the country's two largest political factions gathered in rival commemorations of Egypt's participation in the 1973 war with Israel, a day of deep significance for many Egyptians.</p><p>Both opponents and supporters of the country's ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, rallied in their thousands – ostensibly to mark the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war which is viewed in Cairo as an Egyptian victory, despite ending in a stalemate that favoured Israel.</p><p>But rather than emphasising Egypt's unity, the different messages conveyed by each faction's demonstrations underscored divides. Morsi's supporters, whose marches filled highways in west Cairo, used the day to protest against his ousting, while his opponents took to Tahrir Square to praise General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's role in his overthrow. Deadly violence flared when tens of thousands of Morsi supporters tried to reach Tahrir Square. Soldiers, police and armed vigilantes blocked their path and started firing.</p><p>Arriving in west Cairo's Dokki suburb around 3pm, the marchers were met first by teargas, then rubber bullets and then live rounds, according to one witness who was at the front of the march.</p><p>\"It was three groups of armed people – police, army, and residents – attacking helpless protesters, who didn't even do much to fight back,\" said Mosa'ab Elshamy, a photographer known for <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosaaberising/sets/72157636261057216/\" title=\"\">his pictures at Cairo clashes</a>. \"Today's march was made up largely of families, lots of women, lots of children. Sometimes marches take things into their own hands, start trouble, break something. But today's march was really remarkably peaceful until the police just shot at them without any kind of trigger.\"</p><p>Some reports suggested that a number of marchers carried firearms, but Elshamy said the protesters, who included hardcore football fans unaffiliated with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, simply held their ground for three hours – throwing stones and burning tires – before retreating.</p><p>He added: \"As a couple of people were running away, they were gunned down, and they left quite a trail of blood.\"</p><p>Opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood argued the Islamists and others had sought a violent response in order to garner sympathy internationally, or to gain concessions during negotiations.</p><p>\"They are trying to make trouble everywhere so that at some point, the deal will be: fine, stop the trouble, what do you want?\" Alaa al-Aswany, one of Egypt's best-known authors and a fierce critic of the Brotherhood, argued in the buildup to the celebrations.</p><p>As the day wore on, Cairo became a tale of two Tahrirs – Tahrir Square in the east, where army helicopters flew over pro-military bands, and Tahrir Street in the west, where police and secular locals fired bullets and teargas on the pro-Morsi marches.</p><p>The juxtaposition highlighted Egypt's ideological divisions. \"Today feels like a second victory,\" said Mohamed Abdel Aziz, a cleaner wearing a picture of Sisi around his neck. \"We feel like we have won our country back from a gang that doesn't belong to Egypt.\"</p><p>Across town, protesters carrying yellow placards – in memory of those who died at several <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">summer massacres</a>  of Morsi supporters – had a different idea about what the day meant. \"Today is about saying no to the military coup, and bringing back liberty,\" said Saber Nafi, a pro-Morsi journalist.</p><p>What had been a festive afternoon quickly soured, with gangs of vigilantes and plain-clothed policemen in some streets attacking people suspected of being a foreigner, a journalist or a Muslim Brother.</p><p>Two liberal politicians – including <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/stabbed-egyptian-politician-decries-violence-215810533.html\" title=\"\">Khaled Dawoud</a>, a one-time spokesman for Egypt's main secular coalition – were attacked by Brotherhood supporters this weekend. Dawoud was spotted while driving through central Cairo, hauled from his car, and stabbed in his hand and twice in his chest. He is now recovering in hospital.</p><p>Clashes were reported in several other neighbourhoods in Cairo and across Egypt, though much of the country remained calm.

        "body":"<p>Italian divers have recovered 83 more bodies of migrants who died when a fishing boat with an estimated 500 people onboard sank within sight of the tiny island of Lampedusa.</p><p>Italy's integration minister, Congolese-born Cecile Kyenge, watched as soldiers transferred body bags from boats and on to trucks to be brought to the makeshift morgue. There the survivors were bidding farewell to the other 111 deceased fellow travellers who were recovered from the sea on Thursday.</p><p>Their coffins stood in three lines at the island's airport, each with a single red rose save for four children's caskets topped with teddy bears.</p><p>The divers went back into the sea on Sunday to look for some of the 200 people still missing, after a two-day suspension caused by bad weather. The latest death toll has been put at 194.</p><p>The migrants, mostly from Eritrea, were aboard a 20-metre (65ft) fishing boat that sank on Thursday after passengers panicked by flames set to draw the attention bolted to one side of the boat, capsizing it. Hundreds were flung into the sea – many could not swim – while others were trapped in the hull.</p><p>Survivors told rescuers they were in the sea for three hours; many clinging to empty water bottles to stay afloat, some were too weak to grab lifesavers thrown to them.</p><p>\"We cannot deal with this tragedy alone, but together with Europe. We must give answers to those who flee, need protection, and come here for help,\" Kyenge told reporters.</p><p>Earlier, Kyenge visited the survivors at a refugee centre in Lampedusa. Most of the 155 survivors remain at an overcrowded centre on the island, many sleeping in the open. Two have been transferred to hospitals in Sicily.</p><p>Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost point 70 miles from Tunisia, is a frequent destination for migrants trying to reach safe haven from Africa and the Middle East. Tens of thousands arrive there each year seeking refugee status in Europe.</p><p>Survivors have told authorities  that a boat with lights had circled them but did not communicate or  offer assistance.</p><p>A Dutch politician has called for an investigation into reports that a boat did not help the stranded migrants. There is no evidence that the  fishing vessel was in distress. <strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192828|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|149358dd2769dc57d54329fb480afaa375d3aa68 -->",

        "headline":"Cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ spying programmes, says Chris Huhne",
        "body":"<p>Cabinet ministers and members of the national security council were told nothing about the existence and scale of the vast data-gathering programmes run by British and American intelligence agencies, a former member of the government has revealed.</p><p>Chris Huhne, who was in the cabinet for two years until 2012, said ministers were in \"utter ignorance\" of the two biggest covert operations, Prism and Tempora. The former Liberal Democrat MP admitted he was shocked and mystified by the surveillance capabilities disclosed by the Guardian from files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>\"The revelations put a giant question mark into the middle of our surveillance state,\" he said. \"The state should not feel itself entitled to know, see and memorise everything that the private citizen communicates. The state is our servant.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">Writing in Monday's Guardian</a>, Huhne also questioned whether the Home Office had deliberately misled parliament about the need for the communications data bill when GCHQ, the government's eavesdropping headquarters, already had remarkable and extensive snooping capabilities.</p><p>He said this lack of information and accountability showed \"the supervisory arrangements for our intelligence services need as much updating as their bugging techniques\".</p><p>Over the past three months the Guardian has made a series of disclosures about the activities of GCHQ and its much bigger American counterpart, the National Security Agency. Two of the most significant programmes uncovered in the Snowden files were Prism, run by the NSA, and Tempora, which was set up by GCHQ. Between them, they allow the agencies to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries.</p><p>As a cabinet minister and member of the national security council (NSC), Huhne said he would have expected to be told about these operations, particularly as they were relevant to proposed legislation.</p><p>\"The cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ's Tempora or its US counterpart, the NSA's Prism, nor about their extraordinary capability to hoover up and store personal emails, voice contact, social networking activity and even internet searches.</p><p>\"I was also on the national security council, attended by ministers and the heads of the Secret [Intelligence Service, MI6] and Security Service [MI5], GCHQ and the military. If anyone should have been briefed on Prism and Tempora, it should have been the NSC.</p><p>\"I do not know whether the prime minister or the foreign secretary (who has oversight of GCHQ) were briefed, but the NSC was not. This lack of information, and therefore accountability, is a warning that the supervision of our intelligence services needs as much updating as their bugging techniques.\"</p><p>Huhne said Prism and Tempora \"put in the shade Tony Blair's proposed ID cards, 90-day detention without trial and the abolition of jury trials\".</p><p>He added: \"Throughout my time in parliament, the Home Office was trying to persuade politicians to invest in 'upgrading' Britain's capability to recover data showing who is emailing and phoning whom. Yet this seems to be exactly what GCHQ was already doing. Was the Home Office trying to mislead?</p><p>\"The Home Office was happy to allow the NSC and the cabinet – let alone parliament – to remain in utter ignorance of Prism/Tempora while deciding on the communications data bill.\"</p><p>The draft bill would have given police and the security services access, without a warrant, to details of all online communication in the UK – such as the time, duration, originator and recipient, and the location of the device from which it was made. The legislation was eventually dropped after splits in the coalition.</p><p>Proper scrutiny of the intelligence agencies was vital, said Huhne, and surveillance techniques needed to be tempered. \"Joseph Goebbels was simply wrong when he argued that 'if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear'. Information is power, and the necessary consequence is that privacy is freedom. Only totalitarians pry absolutely.\"</p><p>Huhne, formerly the energy and climate change minister, was jailed this year after he admitted perverting the course of justice over claims his ex-wife took speeding points for him. In February he was sentenced to eight months in prison but was released after serving 62 days.</p><p>His intervention comes as concern about the oversight and scrutiny of Britain's spy agencies grows. While former members of the intelligence community insist GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 operate with integrity and within the law, even they have questioned whether the oversight regime is fit for purpose following the Snowden revelations.</p><p>Over the last few days a former member of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, a former director of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><p>On Monday, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6 will add his weight to the calls for change. David Bickford told the Guardian Britain's intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high.</p><p>Bickford said the government should pass responsibility to the courts because of widespread \"dissatisfaction with the covert, intrusive powers of the UK intelligence and law enforcement agencies\".</p><p>\"Whether this is based on perception or reality doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"As long as government ministers continue to authorise the agencies' eavesdropping, telephone and electronic surveillance, and informant approval, the public will believe that there is an unhealthy seamless relationship between them.\" Bickford said it was time for ministers to \"step out of the equation and leave the authorisation of these highly intrusive methods to the judiciary\".</p><p>Bickford was drafted in to MI5 and MI6 following a series of scandals, including the furore over the book Spycatcher, written by the senior former MI5 officer Peter Wright. He worked for almost a decade until 1995 and still advises governments on countering international organised crime and terrorist money laundering.</p><p>Bickford said giving judges rather than cabinet ministers responsibility for authorising sensitive operations would \"reduce the risk of perception of collusion … and limit the room for accusations of political interference.\"</p><p>\"Government may argue that all this is unnecessary as there is adequate oversight of the agencies. However, that cannot substitute for independent judicial authority at the coal face.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, on Sunday, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) condemned the way the British government had threatened legal action against the Guardian newspaper unless it destroyed the copy of the Snowden files it had in London.</p><p>\"WAN-IFRA calls on democratic governments to recognise that acts of intimidation and surveillance against the press risk undermining the fabric of transparent, accountable governance,\" the organisation's board said in a resolution issued during its meeting on the eve of this week's World Publishing Expo in Berlin, Germany.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191378|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|97e66277386d874246389d16bfacc710ae299b9d -->",

        "headline":"North Korea's luxury ski resort opens for business",
        "body":"<p>The secretary-general of North Korea's ski association views the sprawling alpine landscape before him with unabashed pride. Facing a strong, cold wind, he points to a dip in the rugged, tree-covered mountains and says the sunrise  is a sight of unmatched beauty, worthy of the nation's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.</p><p></p><p>This is the Masik Pass ski resort, North Korea's latest megaproject and the product of 10 months of furious labour intended to show that the country, so often derided for its poverty and isolation, is as civilised and culturally advanced as any other.</p><p></p><p>The complex of ski runs, resort chalets and sleigh rides will  open formally on Thursday, though late last month the main hotels appeared to be little more than shells, potholes filled the access roads and foundations were still being dug for secondary buildings.</p><p></p><p>Who will ski here? Perhaps Kim Jong-un, who reportedly enjoyed the sport as a teenager studying in Switzerland. By the estimate of the ski official, Kim Tae Yong, there are only about 5,500 North Korean skiers in this country of 24 million – a skiing population of 0.02%.</p><p></p><p>Even so, as he sweeps his hand over the scene, the official displays no doubt that what his country really needs right now is a multimillion-dollar ski resort in the secluded depths of North Korea's east coast. Kim bristles at the suggestion Masik will be a playground for the nation's elite and a trickle of eccentric tourists. This, he says, is his country at work. It is proof of the great love of the great leader.</p><p></p><p>The narrow road to Masik Pass winds through rugged mountain terrain, small farming hamlets and lush foliage – beauty untouched by modern development. As the road turns to dirt, brightly coloured propaganda posters and ubiquitous slogans in blood-red letters come into view, followed by rows of barracks for workers – drab, hastily built shacks of stone carved out of the slopes along a clear flowing river.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that, hundreds, if not thousands, of soldier-builders in  olive uniforms – \"shock brigades\" assigned to especially urgent and difficult tasks – scour the slopes. Other workers pound at the stone with hammers. Young women march with shovels over their shoulders. Minivans equipped with loudspeakers blast patriotic music into the crisp mountain air.</p><p></p><p>Masik's ski runs – at the moment long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass – cut their way through the trees to converge at the hotel construction site below. Though two simple lifts have been installed, neither was working during a recent visit by  journalists; visitors drove to reach the top of the slope at Taehwa Peak.</p><p></p><p>As the showcase capital of Pyongyang, with its  amusement parks,  bronze statuary and countless marble-laden pavilions so amply demonstrates, North Korea has a tradition of diving into lavish, monumental projects, no matter their relevance to larger economic conundrums such as producing reliable electricity or adequate food.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With South Korea set to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, there is little doubt Pyongyang felt it had to do something lest it be outdone yet again by its prosperous southern brethren.</p><p></p><p>Ski chief Kim said Masik was floated as a potential venue for the 2018 Games, but Seoul turned that offer down. Kim – who began skiing as a child and competed in international cross-country competitions – vowed that with Masik as a training centre, North Korea will have a world champion of its own in just a few years' time. So far, it has won only two medals at the Winter Games – both in speed skating.</p><p></p><p>But North Korea has not forgotten that Kim has vowed that improving the economy is as important as nuclear weapons development.</p><p>Kim and his coterie of advisers have vowed repeatedly to lift North Korea's standard of living, which is among the world's lowest .</p><p></p><p>North Korea has focused on boosting tourism, providing the impoverished country with the accoutrements of a \"civilised\" nation and, most visibly, encouraging a broader interest in sports. The development of Masik Pass dovetails nicely with all three policy goals.</p><p></p><p>Sports are billed as a means of energising and mobilising the masses, or as North Korea's slogan-spinners say, \"the hot wind of sports blowing through Korea\".</p><p>All this is reflected in North Korea's otherwise head-scratch-inducing association with former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who had Kim's ear and received the red carpet treatment both times he visited this year.</p><p></p><p>In Pyongyang, a plethora of recreational sports parks, basketball courts and inline skating rinks have popped up over the past several months. While few North Koreans could afford a trip to Masik Pass, the leadership could offer visits as a reward for loyalty or exceptional work. Planners foresee hordes of tourists driving to the resort after arriving by plane at a converted military airbase in the nearest city, Wonsan. The resort also has its own heliport.</p><p></p><p>\"All of Wonsan will be turned into a tourist area,\" Ri Ki Song, an economist for the Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in a recent interview in Pyongyang. \"It will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy. It will also be a place for our own people to use.\"</p><p></p><p>Many  economists outside the country argue that if it is serious about improving its economy, North Korea should implement market reforms, build its energy and agricultural sectors and improve international relations by focusing less on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p><p></p><p>\"Certainly, the calculus is different in North Korea than in most places – they've demonstrated pretty consistently that economic efficiency is not the priority,\" said Andray Abrahamian, the executive director of Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit organisation that aims to build North Korean business savvy and economic growth. But Abrahamian said Masik is not merely a gilded albatross.</p><p></p><p>\"These kinds of projects are no more a boondoggle than say, hosting the Olympics or the World Cup,\" he said. \"The financial costs are very high, but the broader social gains – which don't show up on a balance sheet – are deemed to be higher. Nationalism, civic pride, health, urban regeneration, tourism dollars, construction projects for cronies – all these things come into consideration.\"</p><p></p><p>Though the ski season begins in December, officials plan to open the resort on 10 October on the 68th anniversary of the Korean Workers party. Kim Jong-un has visited the site twice, most recently last month. \"Masik Pass Speed\" has joined the long list of North Korean propaganda accolades for those who selflessly carry out the orders of their rulers.</p><p></p><p>With the clock ticking, the pace is frenetic. North Korean media recently claimed workers are \"carrying out their daily quotas at more than 200%.\" As recently as last week, worker brigades were scrambling to finish not only the two main hotels – a 250-room, eight-story building for foreigners and a 150-room hotel for Koreans – but also an underground parking lot, employee housing and access bridges and a pumping station.</p><p></p><p>The resort won't be finished by Thursday; Kim Tae Yong, the ski association chief, said much of it will be built in phase two. His only concern is the ski lifts.</p><p>Last month, the Swiss government blocked plans for a company to sell North Korea $7.7 million-worth (£4.8m) of lifts and cable car equipment because of new sanctions barring the sale of luxury goods to the North. Austrian and French ski-lift manufacturers also have reportedly said no.</p><p></p><p>North Korea's state-run media has called the Swiss decision a \"serious human rights abuse that politicises sports and discriminates against the Koreans\". Kim called it \"a pity\". but said Masik Pass will have three functioning lifts this year.</p><p>\"We can make nuclear weapons and rockets,\" he said. \"We can build a ski lift.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419238545|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|ff1381ab943140df5bce224ca5c6613ef059a3da -->",

        "body":"<p>An out-of-control monster truck shot into a crowd of spectators at a Mexican air show on Saturday killing at least eight people and hurting 80 others, dozens seriously.</p><p>Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, said the driver appeared to have lost control of the truck after leaping over a pile of cars it was crushing during a demonstration at the Extreme Aeroshow. Some witnesses said the driver appeared to have hit his head on the interior of the truck as he drove over the old cars, with at least two reporting seeing his helmet come off before the massive vehicle drove into the crowd of terrified spectators, who tried to flee.</p><p>\"I fell over, and when I turned around I saw the tire very close. It hit me and threw me to the other side,\" Jesus Manuel Ibarra, 41, said as he was treated for injuries to his arm and hip.</p><p>Gonzalez said the accident killed at least one child and hurt 80 people, 46 of whom remained hospitalised early on Sunday. He said the number of dead and injured could rise as officials received updated information Sunday morning. The local health system listed the names of 67 injured people on its Facebook page, calling urgently for blood donations and help from local doctors and nurses.</p><p>Gonzalez said prosecutors were looking into the possibility of a mechanical failure that left the driver unable to release the gas pedal. Several witnesses said, however, that the driver appeared to have become incapacitated when he struck his head during the show, in which the truck drives at high speed over smaller cars, leaping into the air as it crushes their roofs.</p><p>Spectator Daniel Dominguez, 18, said he was happily watching the show with a group of relatives when the truck came down hard in the middle of the cars.</p><p>\"The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off,\" Dominguez said. \"The truck came directly at where we were.\" His 11-year-old sister was in surgery for injuries to her legs, and his mother was treated for minor contusions.</p><p>The air show was canceled after the accident, which happened on the second day of three in a park on the outskirts of Chihuahua, the capital of Chihuahua state.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419181559|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|ce0d790b56c6dfdb086c06b4b4d08481d9cbe29b -->",

With love and understanding, the church reaches out to all God's children, including our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters,\" the <a href=\"http://www.lds.org/topics/same-gender-attraction?lang=eng\">church website</a> states.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419208122|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|8eede6d0c021abad9417b85d111e3ff6486a22ee -->",

        "body":"<p>The remnants of tropical storm Karen, which had already been downgraded to a depression, have dissipated over the Gulf of Mexico, the National Weather Service said on Sunday. </p><p>Although some flooding was possible along the northern Gulf coast, the service said at 11am ET it would issue no more public advisories on Karen. </p><p>\"Karen is no longer a tropical cyclone,\" the National Hurricane Center said in a statement, which was titled \"Remnants of Karen\".<br /> <br />The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Alabama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/05/tropical-storm-karen-gulf-coast-shutdown\">had earlier declared states of emergency to speed storm preparations</a>, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency recalled some workers who were furloughed in the federal government shutdown to assist. </p><p>However, the storm's top winds had dropped to 30mph by Sunday morning, down from 50mph on Friday. Karen's remnants were expected to drop 1-3in of rain over portions of the central US Gulf coast and south-eastern US through Monday evening, the center said. </p><p>Nearly two-thirds of oil output in the US Gulf of Mexico was halted as Karen neared the Louisiana coast earlier this week, prompting oil and gas companies to shut platforms and evacuate workers in preparation for the storm. The Gulf accounts for about 19% of US oil production and 6% of natural gas output.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419188543|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|82deba8c29ff857559faba607f7f9878a66a990a -->",

The president suffered trauma to the brain in August, her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, said. He did not elaborate.</p> <p>Vice-president Amado Boudou cut short a journey to France to return to Argentina and take over the president's duties.</p> <p>Fernandez is in an electoral campaign for elections at the end of October that will determine control of Congress.</p> <p>A subdural haematoma is an accumulation of blood under a membrane that covers the brain and usually occurs after a blow to the head.</p> <p>The decision to discharge the president when the damage occurred suggests the haematoma is too small to be drained via surgery, said a doctor not involved in the treatment.</p> <p>Fernandez, who has been president since 2007, had her thyroid glands removed last year after she was diagnosed with cancer, although later tests indicated no cancer was present.</p> <p>Her husband, former president Nestor Kirchner, died after a heart attack in 2010. The next presidential election is due in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419165828|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|76cf976f9757683112961b738aac7a0ed58b0ae9 -->",

The girl was in the car but was uninjured when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-capitol-lockdown-reports-gunshots?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">police and secret service agents fired at least 17 shots at the 34-year-old mother during a chase on Capitol Hill</a>.</p><p>Ms Carey-Jones denied <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57606111/miriam-carey-identified-capitol-hill-car-chase-driver-was-taken-for-mental-health-evaluation/\">reports that her sister had been treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder</a>, but did say her condition had led to episodes of paranoia.</p><p>\"There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly,\" Amy Carey-Jones said <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2013/10/04/ac-intv-sisters-of-miriam-carey-driver-shot-near-capitol-hill.cnn.html\">in an interview on Friday night with CNN</a>. \"She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress. There was not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on. They tapered her off the medications and she said she felt fine.\"</p><p>Another sister, Valarie Carey, a former New York police officer, said the family did not accept that the law enforcement officials' use of deadly force had been the only way to end the encounter.</p><p>The chase ended near the Capitol Building, after Ms Carey drove her black Nissan Infiniti car into security bollards close to the White House and then took off at speed as armed officers surrounded the vehicle. A uniformed secret service agent was struck and injured as she raced away.</p><p>\"Deadly physical force was not the ultimate recourse, nor did it have to be,\" said Valarie Carey. \"I'm more than certain there was no need for a gun to be used when there was no gunfire coming from the vehicle. My sister just totally didn't deserve this. There are going to be a lot of different stories being told by people that claim they may know her. They don't. She was a law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda.\"</p><p>Eric Sanders, a lawyer hired by the Carey family, said that the circumstances of Thursday's fatal encounter raised numerous questions.</p><p>\"We want to know if protocols were followed,\" he said in the CNN interview. \"We are interested in finding out what happened. We are going to conduct our investigation, and we are not going to go with just what the government said.\"</p><p>Lieutenant Kimberley Schneider of Washington's Capitol Police department did not respond to an inquiry from the Guardian on Saturday, but told reporters at an earlier press conference that a full internal inquiry was under way. It will focus, among other things, on whether officers followed correct procedure in opening fire on a moving vehicle. Schneider would not confirm if department personnel were permitted to do so, but many big-city police departments across the US have banned the practice because of the risk of harm to innocent bystanders.</p><p>\"It's inherently dangerous and usually ineffective,\" John Miller, a former FBI spokesman, told CBS. \"But this is an issue of context. When you're guarding the Capitol or the White House and someone tries to deliberately ram the barricades, and they seem to be trying to get close to the building, this is not your normal traffic chase, traffic violation, stolen car. In context, those officers usually factor in, is this a car bomb, is this a terrorist attack, is there a button under the dashboard, is there a weapon?\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the District of Columbia child and family services department said that Ms Carey's one-year-old daughter was in good health and had been placed with a foster family while her future was determined.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419150578|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|7612ca213554e6afbd535f524227e3f7efa5e237 -->",

        "headline":"US anti-drug plane tracking smuggling vessel at time of crash in Colombia",
        "body":"<p>A twin-engine turboprop plane that crashed in northern Colombia while on a US counter-drug mission, killing three American contractors and a Panamanian aboard, had been tracking a suspected smuggling vessel over the western Caribbean when it lost radio contact, the US military has said. Two other Americans aboard the Dash 8 were seriously injured in the crash, which happened before dawn on Saturday.</p><p>Under contract with the US air force, the plane was a \"prospector\" aircraft, equipped with surveillance equipment and employed to track speedboats and other vessels that smuggle cocaine north from Colombia, said Jody Draves, spokeswoman for the US-sponsored multinational task force in Key West, Florida, known as JIATF-South, that runs interdiction in region. Draves said the plane was operating in co-ordination with a Colombian surface vessel and had flown out of Panama. It was near that country's border that it crashed, near the city of Capurgana.</p><p>The two injured Americans were rescued by Colombian soldiers and taken to a hospital in the capital, Bogota, Southcom said in a statement. The names of the Americans were withheld, pending notification of next-of-kin. Panama's national air service identified the deceased Panamanian guardsman as Lieutenant Lloyd Nunez. Host-country nation service personnel routinely accompany US military contractors on such missions.</p><p>\"We express our sympathies to the families of the deceased, and are particularly saddened by the loss of a Panamanian air national guardsman,\" said General John Kelly, commander of US southern command. \"We also want to thank the Colombians for their outstanding rescue and recovery efforts.\"</p><p>General Nicasio de Jesus Martinez, commander of the Colombian army's fourth brigade, whose troops traveled to the accident scene, ruled out the possibility that the plane was shot down by rebels active in Colombia.</p><p>\"There was no aggression, no impact,\" said Martinez, adding that it was too soon to know if the crash was caused by mechanical failure, human error or the weather. Southcom also said there was no indication the plane was shot down.</p><p>The region where it crashed is mountainous jungle and rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, operate there along with drug traffickers. Local farmers reported that the plane went down at about 1am in a rural part of the municipality of Acandi, said mayor Gabriel Jose Olivares. Capurgana is in the municipality of Acandi.</p><p>Carlos Ivan Marquez, chief of Colombia's national office for disaster response, said the surviving Americans had injuries including multiple bone fractures and burns over at least 40% of their bodies.</p><p>Santiago Castro, director of Colombia's civil aviation agency, said the plane was not civilian so he could not provide details about its route, origin or destination. The plane was contracted to provide detection and monitoring of drug trafficking routes in the coastal region of Central America as part of Operation Martillo, Southcom said.</p><p>Operation Martillo (Hammer) is part of the $165m, US-led regional security initiative that focuses on the seas off Central America, key shipping routes for 90% of the cocaine headed to the US. Fourteen countries participate: Belize, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, the United Kingdom and the US. Chile has also contributed to the operation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419180477|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|5fe90dd023de051f57a5b1784fe8ca930aab99d3 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Silent and humble manual tasks\" are not something to which Silvio Berlusconi has ever felt naturally drawn. Before big business and politics he sold vacuum cleaners and sang on cruise ships.</p><p>Now, however, thanks to the Italian legal system, a very different kind of activity awaits him. His lawyer has said he intends to ask to serve his sentence for tax fraud in a community service placement.</p><p>Franco Coppi said that barring any last-minute changes, the former prime minister's legal team would submit the request to the Milan courts by the end of this week. It would be then up to the judges to decide how to proceed.</p><p>The embattled 77-year-old billionaire has until the middle of the month to decide how to spend his commuted one-year sentence, which his lawyers reportedly hope will be further whittled down to nine months for good behaviour.</p><p>Berlusconi could yet opt for house arrest, but for a man who continues to nurse great political ambitions despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/silvio-berlusconi-senate-italy\" title=\"\">recent setbacks</a>, the logistical restrictions would perhaps prove unacceptable.</p><p>Last week he was forced to perform a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/silvio-berlusconi-humiliating-climbdown-italian-parliament\" title=\"\">humiliating U-turn</a> in parliament following an unprecedented party rebellion, only for a committee then to recommend he be expelled from the senate due to the tax fraud conviction.</p><p>Community service, however arguably undignified, would allow Berlusconi to remain in the public eye in some capacity. It would also be unlikely to begin before the spring, buying him yet more time with which to try to rebuild a political power base that has never looked so shaky.</p><p>It remains unclear quite what publicly useful activity he would be assigned, but there is no shortage of charities and organisations keen to offer him a place.</p><p>\"I would like very much to have him among my guys - not as an act of mischief but to work for his redemption,\" Antonio Mazzi, a Catholic priest from Exodus, a rehabilitative foundation, told La Repubblica. \"I would like to be the one who gets him out of bed in the morning and tells him to make his bed. I would like him to do silent and humble manual tasks, starting with cleaning the bathroom.\"</p><p>Mazzi added: \"At the moment he feels like the idol of the masses, but I think that inside he has something saveable. But he will have to sink his hands into the earth, plant his tomatoes in silence.\"</p><p>This is perhaps not the likeliest of scenarios. Some of those close to Berlusconi object to the community service option because it usually implies a desire for rehabilitation and admission of guilt, neither of which the centre-right leader – who has always insisted on his innocence – appears close to expressing.</p><p>Writing in La Stampa, the commentator Jacopo Iacobini suggested a more likely possibility: that Berlusconi would regard community service as a chance for rehabilitation of not his soul but his political brand.</p><p>He could be seen spending time \"among poor children, troubled adolescents, 20-somethings with drug problems, young people with disabilities, abandoned elderly people\". It could yet prove, remarked Iacobini, \"a glorious propaganda opportunity\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419186496|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|5b4fde7273a4f04cd55d5b3b17ce878e038e6781 -->",

        "headline":"Iceland rises from the ashes of banking collapse",
        "body":"<p>A new mood of proud nationalism is emerging in economically resurgent Iceland after an out-of-control banking system sank the country into financial meltdown exactly five years ago. Riding this wave of confidence is 38-year-old prime minister, Sigmundur Davíd Gunnlaugsson, elected in April on populist promises of mortgage relief for every homeowner.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson earned his spurs in years of outspoken campaigning against the foreign creditors who still haunt Iceland, particularly the British and the Dutch governments, which intervened after the collapse of Landsbanki – the bank behind Icesave – on 7 October 2008.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary British and Dutch savers had previously switched their savings into online Icesave accounts, attracted by market-beating interest rates and promises that: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\"</p><p>When the crash came, however, Iceland's deposit guarantee proved worthless, forcing the UK and the Netherlands to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers and sparking a poisonous diplomatic row.</p><p>It was a spat that, against the odds, Iceland won. While many other politicians in Iceland had urged a policy of appeasing the enraged British and Dutch governments, Gunnlaugsson had insisted they should go hang. \"Icelanders, as descendants of the Vikings, are highly individualistic and have difficulty putting up with authorities, let alone oppression,\" he said in one of his first speeches as prime minister on Iceland's Independence Day in June this year.</p><p>\"This was clearly demonstrated in the Icesave dispute, in which the people rejected an agreement they considered unfair. This was later upheld by an international court, which showed that the people's sense of justice was a reliable indicator to follow.\"Having helped win the famous Icesave victory from outside government, Gunnlaugsson has promised to carry that uncompromising approach with him as prime minister, hinting at a new wave of attacks on the interests of foreign creditors to Iceland's three failed banks: Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki. Between them, these institutions had assets more than nine times the size of Iceland's economic output when they failed in 2008.</p><p>From the wreckage, only three modest domestic banks emerged, allowing Iceland to keep functioning. The country was also able to let its overheated currency devalue, and impose capital controls to bring some stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, international bondholders and depositors were left out in the cold, waiting to recover what scraps they could from the banks' administration processes. Five years on and they are still waiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gunnlaugsson's main pre-election pledges were to squeeze these foreign creditors – characterised as \"hedge funds\" or \"vulture funds\" – in order to bankroll a mortgage relief programme for all homeowners and a string of pro-business tax cuts.</p><p>Political opponents savaged the pledge. \"It was like promising to bring back [the boom of] 2007,\" reflects the Left-Green former finance minister Steingrímur Sigfússon. But the Icelandic electorate loved it.</p><p>And with creditors' interests still locked in slow administration processes, and behind tight capital control walls, Gunnlaugsson believes he has a strong hand to play.</p><p>During the election campaign this year, he said: \"This does not revolve around the confiscation of assets. The loss has already been incurred. It was mostly borne by foreign creditors who have recognised the loss and got out. In their place came hedge funds that have profited enormously — on paper — from the collection now of much that was considered lost and written off …</p><p>\"It cannot be accepted that Icelanders should slave away to increase such collections and regain that which had already been lost without getting any share in it.\"</p><p>Creditor groups remain circumspect, keen to get into private discussions with the new administration as quickly as possible. Behind the scenes, however, they are examining their legal options carefully should Gunnlaugsson's aggression go too far. Their goal is to strike a deal that will allow foreign creditors to access more than £9bn of foreign currency assets tied up with the three banks' administrators and barred from exiting Iceland. \"We have been attempting to engage for some time and fail to understand the lack of progress from the authorities,\" said one source close to the creditors.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson's rise to power shocked some observers outside Iceland, who thought the electorate might give their backing to the Left-Green-led coalition that had taken power iafter the banking crash and steered the country through the strictures of an International Monetary Fund programme, and back to growth.</p><p>Instead, the Left-Greens suffered the heaviest defeat in Icelandic history after an election campaign dominated not by economic achievements but by the fallout from the Icesave saga.</p><p>Bouncing back into office came a coalition of the two rightwing parties – the Independence Party and Gunnlaugsson's Progressive party – that had been in charge for much of Iceland's discredited boom years between 2003 and 2008. \"The old rascals are back,\" laughs Geir Haarde, former Independence Party leader and prime minister at the time of the crash.</p><p>The previous government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland would repay the UK and the Netherlands, with interest, for the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. It was made plain to ministers at the time that continued IMF support depended on such a deal.</p><p>But both proposals, despite being passed by the Icelandic parliament, were overwhelmingly defeated in public referenda thanks in part Gunnlaugsson. Popular opinion in Iceland had railed against what Gunnlaugsson grass roots campaign group InDefence portrayed as bullying forces from overseas, set on extracting reparations from Reykjavik akin to those sought from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.</p><p>InDefence attacked Britain in particular, accusing Gordon Brown's government of deliberately damaging Iceland's standing in international markets in 2008 by using anti-terrorism laws to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki. The bank, together with Iceland's finance ministry, was even place on a UK list of financially sanctioned regimes alongside North Korea and al-Qaida.</p><p>As time went on, however, eminent economists began to reassess Iceland's reputation as a pariah state, contrasting it favourably with, among others, Ireland, which had been similarly laid low by an outsized banking sector and forced to seek emergency help from the IMF.</p><p>\"Where everyone else bailed out the bankers and made the public pay the price, Iceland let the banks go bust and actually expanded its social safety net,\" noted Paul Krugman, admiringly. Iceland, he found, had demonstrated the \"case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses\".</p><p>Nobel prize winner Joeseph Stilitz agreed. \"What Iceland did was right. It would have been wrong to burden future generations with the mistakes of the financial system.\" For Financial Times economist Martin Wolf too, it was a triumph. \"Iceland let the creditors of its banks hang. Ireland did not. Good for Iceland!\" Less good, of course, for the foreign creditors. And Not all of the foreign creditors are the vulture funds Gunnlaugsson talks of. British and Dutch taxpayers still have significant exposure to the Landsbanki administration. As priority creditors they have had almost 55% of their claims repaid, though the remainder will take a good deal longer to be paid out. There are UK local authorities and charities, too, which entrusted more than £1bn with failed Icelandic banks and are still waiting to get much of their money back. Meanwhile, taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland had been one of the largest investors in Icelandic bank bonds, a position that has left it a non-priority claimant, expecting only minimal returns in its claims.</p><p>Until recently RBS had remained on the banks' creditor lists but sold its positions to distressed debt specialists earlier this year — at a heavy loss — as the outlook for creditors began to look more uncertain in the face of Gunnlaugsson's rising fortunes.</p><p>The Icelandic prime minister has promised to give further details of his populist programme for tax cuts and home loan debt relief next month, and will be under pressure to show how he expects to fund such moves. It remains to be seen if he gains more from squeezing foreign creditors trapped within Iceland's capital controls than he loses in terms of the damage to Iceland's reputation among international investors.</p><p>Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\"</p><p>The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder.</p><h2>Return to riches</h2><p>Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history.</p><p>\"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added:  \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\"</p><p>Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme.</p><p>\"We raised almost every tax there was – and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels.</p><p>By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries.</p><p>Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\"</p><p>Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy – having shrunk more than 10% in two years – bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year.</p><p>Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people – one-tenth of the population – have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed.</p><p>But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\"</p><p>Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population.</p><p>Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\"</p><p>• This article was amended </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192881|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|bcddb08466134c9ed61d0ec1cc5cd5dc863b73c2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nasa is facing an extraordinary backlash from US researchers after it emerged that the space agency has banned Chinese scientists, including those working at US institutions, from a conference on grounds of national security.</p><p>Nasa officials rejected applications from Chinese nationals who hoped to attend the meeting at the agency's Ames research centre in California next month citing a law, passed in March, which prohibits anyone from China setting foot in a Nasa building.</p><p>The law is part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by congressman Frank Wolf, chair of the House appropriations committee, which has jurisdiction over Nasa. It aims to restrict the foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, ostensibly to counter espionage.</p><p>But the ban has angered many US scientists who say Chinese students and researchers in their labs are being discriminated against. A growing number of US scientists have now decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior academics withdrawing individually, or pulling out their entire research groups.</p><p>The conference is being held for US and international teams who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme, which has been searching the cosmos for signs of planets beyond our solar system. The meeting is the most important event in the academic calendar for scientists who specialise in the field.</p><p>Alan Boss, co-organiser of the Kepler conference, refused to discuss the issue, but said: \"This is not science, it's politics unfortunately.\"</p><p>Geoff Marcy, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been tipped to win a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on exoplanets, or planets outside the solar system, called the ban \"completely shameful and unethical\".</p><p>In an email sent to the conference organisers, Marcy said: \"In good conscience, I cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away, with no national security implications,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"It is completely unethical for the United States of America to exclude certain countries from pure science research,\" Marcy told the Guardian. \"It's an ethical breach that is unacceptable. You have to draw the line.\"</p><p>Debra Fischer, professor of astronomy at Yale University, said she became aware of the ban only when a Chinese post-doctoral student in her lab, Ji Wang, was rejected from the conference. When Nasa confirmed that Ji was banned because of his nationality, Fischer decided to pull out of the meeting. She told her students: \"I cannot say don't go, but I'm boycotting the meeting.\" Her team followed suit and has withdrawn from the meeting.</p><p>The law allows Nasa to apply for a waiver against the ban in special circumstances, but any appeal would have been rejected under a moratorium that has been introduced by the agency's administrator, Charles Bolden.</p><p>Chinese applicants were told they could not attend the conference in an email sent by Mark Messersmith, a Kepler project specialist at Nasa Ames. \"Unfortunately  … federal legislation passed last March forbids us from hosting any citizens of the People's Republic of China at a conference held at facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Regarding those who are already working at other institutions in the US, due to security issues resulting from recent Congressional actions, they are under the same constraints,\" according to the email, seen by the Guardian.</p><p>The recent Congressional action refers to a broader law passed in July which prohibits Nasa funds from being used to participate or collaborate with China in any way. The law has raised fears among some Nasa-funded scientists that they will have to sever ties with their Chinese collaborators, and no longer take on Chinese students.</p><p>Marcy said the law would damage relationships built up between US and Chinese researchers that could be valuable lines of communication if conflicts arose between the two nations in the future.</p><p>Sir Martin Rees, Britain's astronomer royal, said he \"fully supported\" Marcy's position and called the ban \"a deplorable 'own goal' by the US\".</p><p>Chris Lintott, an astronomer at Oxford University, called for a total boycott of the conference until the situation had been resolved. \"I'm shocked and upset by the way this policy has been applied. Science is supposed to be open to all and restricting those who can attend by nationality goes against years of practice, going right back to cold war conferences of Russian and western physicists,\" he said.  \"The Kepler team should move their conference somewhere else – and I hope everyone boycotts until they do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419121755|2013-10-07T11:13:04Z|b9356ec117c769103837d56847bdc6aa2fee6672 -->",

The cell, with its different compartments called organelles, faces a similar problem: cells produce molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines and enzymes that have to be delivered to other places inside the cell, or exported out of the cell, at exactly the right moment. Timing and location are everything. Miniature bubble-like vesicles, surrounded by membranes, shuttle the cargo between organelles or fuse with the outer membrane of the cell and release their cargo to the outside. This is of major importance, as it triggers nerve activation in the case of transmitter substances, or controls metabolism in the case of hormones. How do these vesicles know where and when to deliver their cargo?</p> <p>Traffic congestion reveals genetic controllers</p> <p>Randy Schekman was fascinated by how the cell organizes its transport system and in the 1970s decided to study its genetic basis by using yeast as a model system. In a genetic screen, he identified yeast cells with defective transport machinery, giving rise to a situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system. Vesicles piled up in certain parts of the cell<em>.</em> He found that the cause of this congestion was genetic and went on to identify the mutated genes. Schekman identified three classes of genes that control different facets of the cell&acute;s transport system, thereby providing new insights into the tightly regulated machinery that mediates vesicle transport in the cell.</p> <p>Docking with precision</p> <p>James Rothman was also intrigued by the nature of the cell&acute;s transport system. When studying vesicle transport in mammalian cells in the 1980s and 1990s, Rothman discovered that a protein complex enables vesicles to dock and fuse with their target membranes. In the fusion process, proteins on the vesicles and target membranes bind to each other like the two sides of a zipper. The fact that there are many such proteins and that they bind only in specific combinations ensures that cargo is delivered to a precise location. The same principle operates inside the cell and when a vesicle binds to the cell&acute;s outer membrane to release its contents.</p> <p>It turned out that some of the genes Schekman had discovered in yeast coded for proteins corresponding to those Rothman identified in mammals, revealing an ancient evolutionary origin of the transport system. Collectively, they mapped critical components of the cell&acute;s transport machinery.</p> <p>Timing is everything</p> <p>Thomas S&uuml;dhof was interested in how nerve cells communicate with one another in the brain. The signalling molecules, neurotransmitters, are released from vesicles that fuse with the outer membrane of nerve cells by using the machinery discovered by Rothman and Schekman. But these vesicles are only allowed to release their contents when the nerve cell signals to its neighbours. How is this release controlled in such a precise manner? Calcium ions were known to be involved in this process and in the 1990s, S&uuml;dhof searched for calcium sensitive proteins in nerve cells. He identified molecular machinery that responds to an influx of calcium ions and directs neighbour proteins rapidly to bind vesicles to the outer membrane of the nerve cell. The zipper opens up and signal substances are released. S&uuml;dhof&acute;s discovery explained how temporal precision is achieved and how vesicles&acute; contents can be released on command.</p> <p>Vesicle transport gives insight into disease processes</p> <p>The three Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental process in cell physiology. These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell. Vesicle transport and fusion operate, with the same general principles, in organisms as different as yeast and man. The system is critical for a variety of physiological processes in which vesicle fusion must be controlled, ranging from signalling in the brain to release of hormones and immune cytokines. Defective vesicle transport occurs in a variety of diseases including a number of neurological and immunological disorders, as well as in diabetes. Without this wonderfully precise organization, the cell would lapse into chaos.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T11:15:44.586+01:00\">at 11.15am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52528238e4b041f09f138ad9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:44:34.170+01:00\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">James Rothman explains his work</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's Prof Rothman speaking in December last year.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjurQ5i4PI\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMjurQ5i4PI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=170\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:57:34.270+01:00\">at 10.57am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525280c4e4b04e5d3aefa98d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:37:52.714+01:00\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is a summary from the Nobel Foundation of the scientists' discoveries that led to the prize:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 2013 Nobel Prize honours three scientists who have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system. Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and chemical signals called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three Nobel Laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time in the cell.</p> <p>Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. James Rothman unravelled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. Thomas S&uuml;dhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision.</p> <p>Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and S&uuml;dhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:38:57.532+01:00\">at 10.38am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52528041e4b04e5d3aefa98c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:35:52.202+01:00\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">More on the winners</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The affiliations of the winners - a full house for the US.</p> <p>James E Rothman, Yale University</p> <p>Randy W Schekman, Berkeley</p> <p>Thomas C S&uuml;dhof, Stanford University</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:39:34.014+01:00\">at 10.39am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52527dabe4b01e4020f8d93c\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:33:44.575+01:00\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">And the winners are...</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The winners of the 2013 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine are:</p> <p>James E Rothman</p> <p>Randy W Schekman</p> <p>Thomas C S&uuml;dhof</p> <p>For elucidating the machinery that regulates vesicle transport through the cell.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:37:10.263+01:00\">at 10.37am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52527e02e4b01e4020f8d93d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:31:13.929+01:00\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The committee is filtering into the room and taking their seats.
