We will cover the interviews and reactions in a new live blog we're launching momentarily.</p> <p><strong>• The Syria debate underwent a sudden shift today, from the question of US strikes to potential new diplomatic headway in the form of Assad cutting some kind of deal that could diminish his chemical weapons arsenal. </strong></p> <p><strong>• Russia called on Syria to turn control of its chemical weapons arsenal over to international authorities as prelude to the arsenal's destruction. The Syrian foreign minister immediately &quot;welcomed&quot; the demand.</strong> The swerve in Russian rhetoric was variously depicted as a &quot;stalling tactic&quot; to put off US military strikes and as a sign of potential new diplomatic progress.</p> <p><strong>• The sudden shift in the Syria debate originated with apparently offhand remarks by US secretary of state John Kerry Monday morning.</strong> In a London news conference, Kerry said Assad could avoid strikes by surrendering control of &quot;every single bit&quot; of his arsenal to the international community by the end of the week. Soon afterward the state department walked back the statement, said Kerry was making a &quot;hypothetical&quot; &quot;rhetorical argument.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• And yet top US officials, including deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken, state department spokeswoman Marie Harf and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton appeared to take the proposal seriously.</strong> The White House said it would take a &quot;hard look&quot; at the proposal. All of the above stipulated that they did not expect much and that the push toward US strikes continues apace.</p> <p><strong>• At least 49 people have died from violence in Syria on Monday, including 25 in Damascus and environs,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=734641856562953&amp;l=ef4e5ac1f1\">according to</a> the Local Coordination Committees activist group.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T22:50:31.956+01:00\">at 10.50pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-522e3a57e4b0b4804819a481\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T22:15:03.554+01:00\">10.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov his comments about Syria averting a U.S. military strike by turning over its chemical weapons within a week were rhetorical and <strong>not meant to be a proposal</strong>, a senior U.S. Official said on Monday, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kerry also voiced &quot;serious skepticism&quot; when Lavrov offered to explore the idea, saying that the United States would take a look at any serious proposal, but this could not be a reason to slow the White House's efforts to secure congressional authorization to use force against Syria, the official told reporters traveling back from London with Kerry.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-522e32d0e4b0716040115e8d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T21:42:57.029+01:00\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>This blog has featured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">firsthand</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">interviews</a> with opposition fighters who are not happy about the idea of US strikes inside Syria because the <strong>fighters assume the real targets are them, not Assad</strong>.

Renewed diplomacy could make it more difficult for the US to launch any strikes. Any real or perceived movement by Assad on chemical weapons could compound the difficulty.

They cause vast destruction, wrecking the lives of civilians and increasing their dependency on their oppressors. Missile attacks are mere displays of power, usually as a spectacular alternative to a ground assault. Their military ineffectiveness makes them susceptible to mission creep.</p> <p>Already Obama has shifted from threatening a &quot;surgical punitive strike&quot; to a massively destructive one, intended to aid the insurgency and thus assist in regime change. This happens to be against international law. More to the point, such missile attacks did not &quot;work&quot; in Serbia, Iraq or Afghanistan.

Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US secretary of state has said that President Bashar al-Assad has one week to hand over his entire stock of chemical weapons to avoid a military attack, but said he had no expectation that the Syrian leader would comply.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry\">John Kerry</a> also said he had no doubt that Assad was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in east Damascus on 21 August, saying that only three people are responsible for the chemical weapons inside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> – Assad himself, one of his brothers and a senior general. He said the entire US intelligence commnity was united in believing Assad was responsible.</p> <p>Kerry was speaking alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\">William Hague</a>, who was forced to deny that he had been pushed to the sidelines by the House of Commons decision 10 days ago to reject the use of UK force in Syria.</p> <p>The US Senate is due to vote this week on whether to approve an attack and Kerry was ambivalent over whether Barack Obama would use his powers to ignore the Senate, if it were to reject an attack.</p> <p>Kerry said the US had tracked the Syrian chemical weapons stock for many years, adding that it &quot;was controlled in a very tight manner by the Assad regime … Bashar al-Assad and his brother Maher al-Assad, and a general are the three people that have the control over the movement and use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>&quot;But under any circumstances, the Assad regime is the Assad regime, and the regime issues orders, and we have regime members giving these instructions and engaging in these preparations with results going directly to President Assad.</p> <p>&quot;We are aware of that so we have no issue here about responsibility. They have a very threatening level of stocks remaining.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-522da110e4b03cba712fa112\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T11:21:04.603+01:00\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In Geneva, the UN's high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has been saying there seems little doubt chemical weapons were used in Syria, while not speculating on who might have used them.

        "body":"<p>On my wall is the Daily Express front page of September 5 1945 and the words: \"I write this as a warning to the world.\" So began <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/163115/66-years-ago-wilfred-burchett-arrives-hiroshima%E2%80%94-new-era-nuclear-censorship-begins#\" title=\"\">Wilfred Burchett's report from Hiroshima</a>. It was the scoop of the century. For his lone, perilous journey that defied the US occupation authorities, Burchett was pilloried, not least by his embedded colleagues. He warned that an act of premeditated mass murder on an epic scale had launched a new era of terror.</p><p>Almost every day now, he is vindicated. The intrinsic criminality of the atomic bombing is borne out in the US National Archives and by the subsequent decades of militarism camouflaged as democracy. The Syria psychodrama exemplifies this. Yet again we are held hostage by the prospect of a terrorism whose nature and history even the most liberal critics still deny. The great unmentionable is that humanity's most dangerous enemy resides across the Atlantic.</p><p>John Kerry's farce and Barack Obama's pirouettes are temporary. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/us-russian-proposal-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">Russia's peace deal over chemical weapons</a> will, in time, be treated with the contempt that all militarists reserve for diplomacy. With al-Qaida now among its allies, and US-armed coupmasters secure in Cairo, the US intends to crush the last independent states in the Middle East: Syria first, then Iran. \"This operation [in Syria],\" said the former French foreign minister Roland Dumas in June, \"goes way back. <a href=\"http://explosivereports.com/2013/07/07/former-french-foreign-minister-anglo-french-operations-against-assad-prepared-preconceived-and-planned/\" title=\"\">It was prepared, pre-conceived and planned</a>.\"</p><p>When the public is \"psychologically scarred\", as the Channel 4 reporter Jonathan Rugman described the British people's overwhelming hostility to an attack on Syria, suppressing the truth is made urgent. Whether or not Bashar al-Assad or the \"rebels\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\" title=\"\">used gas in the suburbs of Damascus</a>, it is the US, not Syria, that is the world's most prolific user of these terrible weapons.</p><p>In 1970 the Senate reported: \"The US has dumped on Vietnam a quantity of toxic chemical (dioxin) amounting to six pounds per head of population.\" This was <a href=\"http://starabcd.blogspot.co.uk/2007/07/operation-hades-later-known-as.html\" title=\"\">Operation Hades, later renamed the friendlier Operation Ranch Hand</a> – the source of what Vietnamese doctors call a \"cycle of foetal catastrophe\". I have seen generations of children with their familiar, monstrous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3798581.stm\" title=\"\">deformities</a>. John Kerry, with his own blood-soaked <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_career_of_John_Kerry\" title=\"\">war record</a>, will remember them. I have seen them in Iraq too, where the US used depleted uranium and white phosphorus, as did the Israelis in Gaza. No Obama \"red line\" for them. No showdown psychodrama for them.</p><p>The sterile repetitive debate about whether \"we\" should \"take action\" against selected dictators (ie cheer on the US and its acolytes in yet another aerial killing spree) is part of our brainwashing. Richard Falk, professor emeritus of international law and UN special rapporteur on Palestine, describes it as \"a self-righteous, one-way, legal/moral screen [with] positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened, validating a campaign of unrestricted political violence\". This \"is so widely accepted as to be virtually unchallengeable\".</p><p>It is the biggest lie: the product of \"liberal realists\" in Anglo-American politics, scholarship and media who ordain themselves as the world's crisis managers, rather than the cause of a crisis. Stripping humanity from the study of nations and congealing it with jargon that serves western power designs, they mark \"failed\", \"rogue\" or \"evil\" states for \"humanitarian intervention\".</p><p>An attack on Syria or Iran or any other US \"demon\" would draw on a fashionable variant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/04/un-syria-duty-to-intervene\" title=\"\">\"Responsibility to Protect\", or R2P</a> – whose lectern-trotting zealot is the former Australian foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.gevans.org/biography.html\" title=\"\">Gareth Evans</a>, co-chair of a \"<a href=\"http://www.globalr2p.org/\" title=\"\">global centre</a>\" based in New York. Evans and his generously funded lobbyists play a vital propaganda role in urging the \"international community\" to attack countries where \"the security council rejects a proposal or fails to deal with it in a reasonable time\".</p><p>Evans has form. He appeared in my 1994 film <a href=\"http://johnpilger.com/videos/death-of-a-nation-the-timor-conspiracy\" title=\"\">Death of a Nation</a>, which revealed the scale of genocide in East Timor. Canberra's smiling man is raising his champagne glass in a toast to his Indonesian equivalent as they fly over East Timor in an Australian aircraft, having signed a treaty to pirate the oil and gas of the stricken country where the tyrant Suharto killed or starved a third of the population.</p><p>Under the \"weak\" Obama, militarism has risen perhaps as never before. With not a single tank on the White House lawn, a military coup has taken place in Washington. In 2008, while his liberal devotees dried their eyes, Obama accepted the entire Pentagon of his predecessor, George Bush: its wars and war crimes. As the constitution is replaced by an emerging police state, those who destroyed Iraq with shock and awe, piled up the rubble in Afghanistan and reduced Libya to a Hobbesian nightmare, are ascendant across the US administration. Behind their beribboned facade, more former US soldiers are killing themselves than are dying on battlefields. Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/01/us-military-suicide-epidemic-veteran\" title=\"\">6,500 veterans took their own lives</a>. Put out more flags.</p><p>The historian Norman Pollack calls this \"liberal fascism\": \"For goose-steppers substitute the seemingly more innocuous militarisation of the total culture. And for the bombastic leader, we have the reformer manqué, blithely at work, planning and executing assassination, smiling all the while.\" Every Tuesday the \"humanitarian\" Obama personally oversees a worldwide terror network of drones that \"bugsplat\" people, their rescuers and mourners. In the west's comfort zones, the first black leader of the land of slavery still feels good, as if his very existence represents a social advance, regardless of his trail of blood. This obeisance to a symbol has all but destroyed the US anti-war movement – Obama's singular achievement.</p><p>In Britain, the distractions of the fakery of image and identity politics have not quite succeeded. A stirring has begun, though people of conscience should hurry. The judges at Nuremberg were succinct: \"Individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity.\" The ordinary people of Syria, and countless others, and our own self-respect, deserve nothing less now.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416964499|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|cb0f1efe92912f440fd6510e214881ba97d3a2b9 -->",

        "headline":"Syria: a path worth exploring",
        "body":"<p>However the plan emerged – whether it was the US secretary of state John Kerry going off-piste at a press conference, whether it had been floated at the G20 summit last week, or whether it had been worked over <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3863062.ece\" title=\"\">in back-channel discussions </a>for some time – it soon acquired momentum. Within 24 hours, China and Iran had backed the emerging Russia-US idea for Syria to surrender its chemical arsenal – although Iran added that this should include the chemical weapons it alleged were in rebel hands. Barack Obama, increasingly uncertain of winning congressional backing for a strike over Syria's alleged chemical weapons use, put that idea on hold and said the plan for Syria to sign the chemical weapons convention (CWC) could be a significant breakthrough. For the first time in two and a half years, everyone in the Syrian crisis – except the rebels – appears to be on the same page.</p><p>This is welcome, although that momentum was already slowing over the insistence by the US, UK and France to make a UN resolution enforceable with military action. Vladimir Putin said that a draft resolution could only work if the use of force was off the table. As the CWC process contains its own timetable and enforcement procedures, there must still be room for compromise although the meeting at the UN was postponed. The international securing of Syria's chemical weapons should be explored, however, not least because it may simultaneously stop a military strike and chart a way back to the negotiating table at Geneva. If successful, Syria's putative agreement to admit inspectors to verify and seal its chemical weapons stockpile could be accompanied by a wider ceasefire negotiated in Geneva. One agreement could lead to another.</p><p>This is emphatically not the case with a military strike. The closer Mr Obama comes to pulling the trigger, the more difficulty his advisers and spokesmen have in defining the mission. Is it an \"unbelievably small, limited kind of effort\" (Mr Kerry) or does \"The US … not do pinpricks\" (Mr Obama)? Are the strikes intended to tip the balance of power or just as a shot across the bows? The original project of arming the rebels, proposed by Hillary Clinton and David Petraeus, then secretary of state and head of the CIA, had one purpose in mind – regime change. The military option morphed, in British and French hands, into a plan to force Bashar al-Assad to the negotiating table by securing rebel gains on the ground.</p><p>Yet, as the war drags on, an Assad defeat looksincreasingly unlikely. His forces are cohesive and their lines of supply from Russia and Iran not in doubt. The rebels' forces are anything but unified. They have been Balkanised along ethnic, religious and local lines, and follow competing military strategies. Some jihadi groups are now using Syria as a base to attack Iraq.</p><p>We could swiftly reach the point, if we have not got there already, where it is not in international interests for any side to win.</p><p>If the twists and turns of the Lebanese civil war become a template for the Syrian one, peace would be a long way down the line. And if and when it came, it might not deliver a country liberated from a single dictator. Rather, it might produce a landscape dominated by lots of them, each in control of his own patch. The sooner the fighting stops, the greater the chances of stopping such Balkanisation.The diplomatic option has real advantages. The first steps are clear – Mr Assad's signature on an agreement to join the CWC – and could even be achieved almost as quickly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24038120\" title=\"\">as Mr Kerry is urging</a>. The next steps are more difficult, but they are automatic and intrusive. Thirty days after signing, any use or stockpiling of chemical agents would be illegal and make Syria liable to emergency inspections. The practical problems of delivering this, in the midst of a civil war, should not be underestimated.</p><p>But for now, the problem and doubts over enforcement should not be allowed to obscure the ultimate goal – that if Syria signs the CWC, and it said  it would, a procedure will be put in place that is more thorough and more targeted at Syria's chemical weapons stock than any military action, barring full  scale invasion, could achieve.</p><p>If the CWC route takes time, so be it. Renouncing the use of force – that Mr Obama's administration is deeply divided about  and struggling to define –may be the price that has to be paid.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416993921|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|6277147dff322b4755b4e63580eb1777bb3efe2d -->",

With the solemn grandeur appropriate to a declaration of war, president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/obama-diplomatic-path-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">Barack Obama informed the American people</a> on Tuesday night that a congressional vote on military action had been postponed because Russia was now brokering a diplomatic initiative that might, or might not, put Syria's chemical weapons under international control. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address\" title=\"\">Gettysburg address</a> this wasn't.</p><p>There will be many more turns on the road to Damascus, but the politics of these weeks since the criminal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">use of&nbsp;chemical weapons in Syria on 21&nbsp;August</a> already tell us a lot about the US. First and foremost, they tell us what&nbsp;Obama himself acknowledged in his televised address, quoting the words&nbsp;of a letter sent him by a veteran: \"This nation is sick and tired of war.\"</p><p>Yes, the shadow of being misled by Colin Powell (of all people) about the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-schwarz/colin-powell-wmd-iraq-war_b_2624620.html\" title=\"\">intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction</a> hangs over this debate, as over European debates. But that's not the main point for most Americans. According to a New York Times-CBS poll this week, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/world/middleeast/poll-majority-of-americans-oppose-military-strike.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">75% of Americans think the Syrian government \"probably did\" use chemical weapons</a> against Syrian civilians – and still they're overwhelmingly against the US military response that Obama advocated.</p><p>Every one of the countless members of Congress I've seen interviewed on cable television news has acknowledged this, be they Republican or Democrat, for or against striking Syria. Only \"three or four\" of at least a thousand constituents he's talked to favour military action, reports Congressman Elijah Cummings, a Democrat and Obama supporter. Senator Rand (son of&nbsp;Ron) Paul, a rising star of the Republican&nbsp;party, says his phone calls are \"100 to 1\" against war.</p><p>The American people are \"sick and tired\" of it. They don't think it's done any good in the Middle East. It's cost trillions of dollars, while they've been losing their jobs and homes, struggling to get by, seeing their own roads, hospitals and schools decay. Now here's the great irony: this is Obama's own theme tune. He's the president who came into office to end \"a decade of war\" (a trademark phrase he used again in this speech) and concentrate on \"nation-building at home\". So the popular sentiment is one he both&nbsp;reflected and reinforced.</p><p>And – irony upon irony – if Obama's own best enemy, Russian president Vladimir Putin, had not self-interestedly ridden to the rescue at the eleventh hour, that very sentiment would probably have delivered a shattering blow to the American presidency. For&nbsp;when we woke up on Monday morning, it looked as if he faced defeat in a vote in&nbsp;the House of Representatives, if not in the Senate.</p><p>\"Isolationism\" is the lazy term often applied to the attitude now found among Democrats and Republicans alike. It is true that the US has a history of periodically withdrawing into its own vast continental indifference, as it did after the first world war. But this time feels different. While the current withdrawalism undoubtedly drinks from some of those traditional wells, it flows through a country not brashly rising on the world stage but fearfully conscious of relative decline. Back in the 1920s, Americans were not worried&nbsp;about a rising China eating their&nbsp;lunch – and then buying the hamburger stall. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/05/usa-china-smithfield-idUSL4N0H10G720130905\" title=\"\">They are now</a>.</p><p>A few more specific ingredients of this American pie also deserve mention. One is Israel. It is hard to overstate the impact of concerns about Israel on American foreign policy in general, and its Middle East policy in particular.</p><p>Some of the most chilling analysis I have read over these weeks identifies an Israeli realpolitik which concludes that the least worst outcome for Israel is that two sets of its arch-enemies – the Iran and Hezbollah-backed Assad regime and the increasingly Sunni Islamist extremist and partly al-Qaida oriented rebels – should go on beating the living daylights out of each other.</p><p>\"Our 'best case scenario' is that they continue to busy themselves fighting each other and don't turn their attention to us,\" <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/the-horrifying-secret-of-syria-policy\" title=\"\">an unnamed Israeli intelligence officer tells a writer on buzzfeed.com</a>. \"Let them both bleed, haemorrhage to death: that's the strategic thinking here,\" says Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. This makes Machiavelli look like Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>Then there are the interventionist hawks, such as John McCain and Paul Wolfowitz, who believe the US should act more decisively so as to enable more moderate rebels to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. They'll be very unhappy with a fix that may only contain the chemical weapons, and that only by making a Russian-brokered deal with Assad. Beside them are Republican politicos so incurably partisan that doing down Obama takes precedence over stopping Assad. And there are the seasoned strategic types – quite a lot of them, actually, not least in or connected to the American military – who carefully think through all the implications for&nbsp;the US and the region. Overwhelmingly, their message is caution.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least, there are still a few liberal, humanitarian interventionists, of the old 1990s genre, shaped by the experiences of Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo. Obama has appointed as his ambassador to the UN an almost totemic representative of that persuasion, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Power\" title=\"\">Samantha Power</a>, the author of a 2002 book called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Problem_from_Hell\" title=\"\">A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide</a>. Well, Syria is a problem from hell, all right. These liberal humanitarian interventionists are not the predominant voice in an administration characterised by cautious, security-first pragmatism, but they're still there.</p><p>I am writing this column on the 12th anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attacks which launched the US into that decade of war – justifiably, in the immediate response to al-Qaida in Afghanistan, unjustifiably and disastrously in Iraq. This is a very different America now.</p><p>Maybe after some years spent putting its own house in order it will come back as the – for all its many faults and hypocrisies – indispensable anchor of some kind of liberal international order. Yet given not just its structural domestic problems but above all the changing global power constellation around it, I doubt it. To the many critics and downright enemies of the US in Europe and across the globe, I say only this: if you didn't like that old world in which the US regularly intervened, just see how you like the new one in which it does not.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417069941|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|bf9615dfa969b3670bb7e2048d918d606f16a867 -->",

        "body":"<p>Vladimir Putin's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">highly unusual and razor-edged comment piece</a> setting out his views on the Syria crisis, addressed directly to the American people and published by the New York Times, is a mixture of closely argued policy points and breathtaking political effrontery.</p><p>Even as he appears to offer the hand of friendship and co-operation to Barack Obama, the Russian leader repeatedly plunges the knife into the president's wounds, not just on Syria but on a range of other sore points, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, the UN and terrorism.</p><p>In bearding the US president on his home ground, Putin – who encourages an off-duty image of himself as a bare-chested, fearless tough-guy hunter and outdoorsman – seems to be trying to add Obama to his trophy bag, while simultaneously presenting himself as an altruistic global statesman.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>No one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the League of Nations, which collapsed because it lacked real leverage. This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without security council authorisation.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> we are not going to stand back and let Syria become another Iraq (when US-led military action was taken without UN authority). Putin implies that by its principled stance, Russia has become the chief defender of the UN system and international law. This is an extraordinary piece of hypocrisy, given that Russia has blocked effective UN action on Syria for two years and is bound, for example, like the US, to uphold the international chemical weapons convention.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> Putin raises the spectre of a wider Middle East conflagration without acknowledging that, if it happened, Russia's policy so far will have made this outcome more likely, and that Moscow would be deeply involved in any conflict through proxy forces and arms sales. This is real Orwellian double-speak.</p><p>But he delivers a powerful poke in the eye for Obama when he suggests US action in Syria could torpedo the Israel-Palestine peace process, which the US is trying to revive, and make it harder to resolve the impasse over Iran's nuclear programme.</p><p>That the man responsible for appalling past violence in Chechnya should summon the pope as an ally is extraordinary. And the idea that he really cares about \"innocent victims\" in Syria is sickening.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> on the day after the 9/11 anniversary, Putin suggests he knows better than Obama, the man who has effectively crushed the leadership of al-Qaida and killed Osama bin Laden, about the perils posed by jihadism. But he speaks for many in the west when he argues that mercenaries fighting in Syria, and armed by US allies, could one day move their operations to other countries, as happened in Libya-Mali, and most famously in Afghanistan-Pakistan. Reminding Obama how the US helped create the Taliban is a low blow.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack – this time against Israel – cannot be ignored.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> the claim that the rebels, not the government, have used chemical weapons to trick the US into intervening is not new, but by recycling it, Putin further muddies the waters. The reference to a possible CW attack on Israel is a masterstroke, given the sensitivity of the Democratic administration and its backers to all matters affecting the Jewish state.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you're either with us or against us'.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> another canny blow delivered to the American solar plexus. Putin is echoing many people in the US who oppose their country's activities as self-appointed global policeman and believe its values have been severely compromised in the post-9/11 years. By offering a resumed diplomatic dialogue as the way out of the Syrian morass, Putin is attempting to seize and hold the moral high ground and assert Russian leadership amid the evident confusion in Washington. If his initiative ultimately prevents US action, he expects to be seen as a hero in many parts of the world.</p><p>• Putin says:</p><p><blockquote>It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.</blockquote></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong> this passage takes the biscuit for sheer chutzpah. Referring directly to Obama's depiction this week of America as an exceptional nation called to do great things in the world, Putin invokes God Almighty, democracy, and the American constitution in one breath to suggest Obama is a menace to global society. You can almost hear the cynical laughter in the Kremlin. It is hard to remember that Putin is the man, more than any other, who has made a mockery of democracy in Russia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417112337|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|2a63b05bc8e8b1ee312325e04cb9e19e4ede577e -->",

        "headline":"A plea for caution from Russia",
        "body":"<p>Recent events surrounding Syria have prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders. It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies.</p><p>Relations between us have passed through different stages. We stood against each other during the cold war. But we were also allies once, and defeated the Nazis together. The universal international organization – the United Nations – was then established to prevent such devastation from ever happening again.</p><p></p><p>The United Nations' founders understood that decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus, and with America's consent the veto by security council permanent members was enshrined in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml\" title=\"\">United Nations charter</a>. The profound wisdom of this has underpinned the stability of international relations for decades.</p><p></p><p>No one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations\" title=\"\">League of Nations</a>, which collapsed because it lacked real leverage. This is possible if influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without security council authorisation.</p><p></p><p>The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders. A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism. It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilise the Middle East and North Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.</p><p></p><p>Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multireligious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough al-Qaida fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government. The United States State Department has designated al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, fighting with the opposition, as terrorist organisations. This internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition, is one of the bloodiest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Mercenaries from Arab countries fighting there, and hundreds of militants from western countries and even Russia, are an issue of our deep concern. Might they not return to our countries with experience acquired in Syria? After all, after fighting in Libya, extremists moved on to Mali. This threatens us all.</p><p></p><p>From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations security council and believe that preserving law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not. Under current international law, force is permitted only in self-defense or by the decision of the security council. Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations charter and would constitute an act of aggression.</p><p></p><p>No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack – this time <a href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/09/09/322987/syria-militants-ready-to-attack-israel/\" title=\"\">against Israel</a> – cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan \"you're either with us or against us\".</p><p></p><p>But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.</p><p></p><p>No matter how targeted the strikes or how sophisticated the weapons, civilian casualties are inevitable, including the elderly and children, whom the strikes are meant to protect.</p><p></p><p>The world reacts by asking: if you cannot count on international law, then you must find other ways to ensure your security. Thus a growing number of countries seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction. This is logical: if you have the bomb, no one will touch you. We are left with talk of the need to strengthen nonproliferation, when in reality this is being eroded.</p><p></p><p>We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.</p><p></p><p>A new opportunity to avoid military action has emerged in the past few days. The United States, Russia and all members of the international community must take advantage of the Syrian government's willingness to place its chemical arsenal under international control for subsequent destruction. Judging by the statements of President Obama, the United States sees this as an alternative to military action.</p><p></p><p>I welcome the president's interest in continuing the dialogue with Russia on Syria. We must work together to keep this hope alive, as we agreed to at the Group of 8 meeting in Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in June, and steer the discussion back toward negotiations.</p><p></p><p>If we can avoid force against Syria, this will improve the atmosphere in international affairs and strengthen mutual trust. It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues.</p><p></p><p>My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this. I carefully studied his <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-obama-syria-20130911,0,3505376.story\" title=\"\">address to the nation</a> on Tuesday. And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is \"what makes America different. It's what makes us exceptional\". It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417112521|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|7f06ecea83853f0d109e72222c67bf3734160edb -->",

        "headline":"International order: drifting without an anchor",
        "body":"<p>There were many ironies to the lecture that Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html\" title=\"\">gave New York Times readers</a> on the need to uphold international law. Here was an assiduous supplier of Bashar al-Assad's war machine – just as effective a feeder of the collective furnace as Iran, Hezbollah, Libyan middle men, Saudi Arabia and Qatar – posing as peacebroker. But here too was the man who, only two weeks ago, was deemed so peripheral to US foreign policy goals that Barack Obama cancelled plans to hold a bilateral with him at St Petersburg. Russia's temporary emergence as the knight in shining armour holds one unsavoury truth to those in the White House, Downing Street and the Elysée who still believe in business as usual on the world stage: the failure of western diplomacy has handed the initiative to Russia. This is because, for such a long time, the aim of British, French and US foreign policy was not to seek a diplomatic solution to Syria, but to support the rebels in securing a military one.</p><p>It is difficult to resist the notion, however, that something more fundamental is taking place: that Syria, after the failures of interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, may not be <em>sui generis</em>. The twists and turns of policy raging in Mr Obama's own mind about a strike on Syria are the latest example of what the <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)</a> has dubbed the year of living tactically. The IISS defines the problem as more than a failure of leadership or will. It is the absence of strategy that worries it most. Crisis management has replaced the pursuit of grand designs. It puts much of the blame on Washington itself, which it says acts not just out of war-weariness, but from a judgment that most foreign-policy problems fall into the \"too hard\" category. Why stop there?</p><p>An example of British hubris was on display at an arms fair in Docklands this week when the first sea lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, claimed that two large new aircraft carriers being built for the navy would put Britain back on the world stage. The carriers would be nothing less than a symbol of national authority, he claimed. Putting to one side the difficulty he will have in finding planes to put on them, the words themselves hark back to a sepia-tinted vision of British naval power. They are perilously at odds with a world where the utility of force is not obvious. Does Britain conceive its role to be that of an international firefighter? In which case, it has engaged in interventions that have spread fires more than they have extinguished them. Is Britain an essential member of future military coalitions?</p><p>The two closest coalitions are in need of some repair in the dry dock. Nato's past purpose was clear, but its future one, after Afghanistan, is anything but. And the EU did not act in Mali – France did. Germany ducked Libya and resisted a strong statement at the G20 on Syria. François Hollande is drawing the wrong conclusions if he thinks Mali will form a reliable template for Syria. An alliance forged by a common will? It can work in specific areas, such as the anti-piracy campaign off the coast of Somalia. But where it matters most, on its doorstep in the Mediterranean, and in the Middle East, EU foreign policy is held together with duct tape.</p><p>What grand design should international policymakers be pursuing? Democracy promotion and state-building are debased currencies, after the experience of Afghanistan and Iraq. Responsibility to protect is following a similar trajectory in Syria. But the first-order question still remains unanswered. If indeed we are bidding farewell to a world where the only global policeman is no longer up to walking the beat, to whom does the task now fall? International law and order, and interventions, derive first and foremost from establishing their legitimacy and from answering the question: whose law and whose order? To do that we need a UN security council that represents the nations that do the bulk of international peacekeeping. We are entering an era where the big global players of the 20th century no longer have that power on their own.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417166468|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|81707c50edcd2f60a96ad3e0847603b3c2d9e90d -->",

        "body":"<p>Syria said on Tuesday night it would sign an international chemical weapons treaty and admit the scale of its chemical weapons stockpile for the first time.</p><p>The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said his country would halt production of chemical arms, disclose the location of its existing arsenal and allow access to UN inspectors in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p><p>Joining the convention implied a commitment to destroy the poison gases and nerve agents thought to be in Syria's possession, but a battle was looming at the UN over whether the timetable for Syrian disarmament should be enforced by the threat of military action.</p><p>The US, Britain and France are preparing a hard-edged security council resolution backed by the possible use of force. Russia is proposing a much milder non-binding council declaration. As both sides manoeuvred for tactical advantage, Russia first summoned an emergency council meeting for 4pm on Tuesday then abruptly cancelled it.</p><p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, insisted the disarmament process would work \"only if the US and those who support it on this issue pledge to renounce the use of force, because it is difficult to make any country – Syria or any other country in the world – unilaterally disarm if there is military action against it under consideration\".</p><p>Russia proposes to work with the Assad regime and the UN secretariat to lay out a \"workable, precise and concrete\" disarmament plan with a timetable but no enforcement mechanism.</p><p>After a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, admitted: \"As I understood, the Russians at this stage were not necessarily enthusiastic – and I'm using a euphemism – to put all that into the framework of a UN binding resolution.\"</p><p>The US, UK and France all stressed that they would not allow Russia or Damascus to play for time. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, told a hearing of the House of Representatives armed services committee that the US was waiting for details of the Russian proposal, \"but we're not waiting for long\".</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-416981794\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria/130910KerrySyria.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/9/10/130910KerrySyria_vpx.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>He said: \"President Obama will take a hard look at it. But it has to be swift, it has to be real, it has to be verifiable. We have to show Syria, Russia and the world we are not going to fall for stalling tactics.\"</p><p>US officials later said that Kerry would meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday for further talks. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Lavrov and Kerry spoke by telephone and the two \"agreed to continue contacts, including the possibility of holding a personal meeting in the coming days.\"</p><p>David Cameron delivered the same message in Westminster, saying the UK did not want the Russian disarmament proposal to be \"some delaying tactic, some ruse to buy time for a regime that must act on chemical weapons\".</p><p>Referring to the planned UN resolution, the prime minister said \"there would have to be consequences\" if it wasn't done.</p><p>However, the western powers' tough rhetoric is weakened by the lack of enthusiasm at home for military action. Parliament has ruled out British involvement in punitive strikes, and Barack Obama faces stiff resistance in Congress.</p><p>\"I think there is a high risk of another car crash at the security council,\" said Richard Gowan of the centre for international co-operation at New York University. \"It will be very, very difficult for Obama to accept a resolution that doesn't involve a threat to Assad. Putin is daring him to walk away from the UN and go back to Washington, knowing he can't count on support there. The Russians hope that when he's faced with that trap he will climb down.\"</p><p>The White House abandoned its earlier plan to seek open-ended authorisation for punitive air strikes in response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons in a civilian massacre in eastern Damascus on 21 August. Instead, the Obama administration was working with a bipartisan group of eight senators to craft a new resolution that would set a deadline for Syrian co-operation with the UN on disarmament, and authorise the use of force if that deadline was broken.</p><p>The Senate suspended plans to vote on military authorisation after meeting with Obama to discuss the proposed Russian deal. The majority leader, Harry Reid, said \"it's important we do this well, not quickly\" but called on Syria to show that its offer to hand over chemical weapons to international observers was \"not a ploy\".</p><p>A fellow Democrat, Joe Manchin, who has opposed military action, said he was heartened by the meeting and said he would pursue a separate resolution giving the Syrians time to comply.</p><p>On Tuesday Human Rights Watch said evidence from the massacre of civilians in eastern Damascus last month strongly suggested the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attacks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/118725/\" title=\"\">The report</a> based its conclusions on testimony from witnesses and medical staff as well analysis of the armaments used, which HRW said were of a type used only by the Syrian military. The effect on the victims pointed to a nerve agent, \"most likely sarin\".</p><p>It said it was impossible so far to give an exact death toll, but noted that the estimate in just one district was over 700 and that Médecins Sans Frontières had reported that at least 3,600 people were treated for symptoms consistent with exposure to neurotoxins.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416982163|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|e3336e5b19aec8e821bb282a8af684c92ceaff7c -->",

        "headline":"Aleppo rebels angry as diplomacy seems to let Assad off the hook",
        "body":"<p>In the basement of a bombed-out police station, a group of Syrian rebels were sheltering from a fighter jet roaring through the twilight sky. But no one was watching the jet. Instead the men were transfixed by a television that blared news of the latest wrangling over whether a US attack would be launched against Bashar al-Assad. Even the sound of the aircraft's firing cannon was dismissed with a mocking cheer.</p><p>\"Wait till there's a real air force up there,\" said a young defector who had fought with the rebels of northern Syria for the past year. \"The regime will be far more scared of the Americans than we are of them.\"</p><p>That was late last week. By early  Wednesday, however, the rebels' mood had changed radically. \"We should have known better than to believe them,\" the group's commander told the Guardian despondently.</p><p>News that a mooted attack on the Assad regime had been put on hold and replaced with a diplomatic push has been met with despair and, in some cases, anger in and around Aleppo, where a grinding, gruelling war of attrition has become a way of life.</p><p>Battered by bombs, Scud missiles and the tank shells that thump randomly into buildings most days, Aleppo's stone heart has steadily crumbled. So too have the concrete suburbs of the east, which giant missiles have emptied of people. Newly arrived jihadists have added to the misery, splintering a cause that locals believe is theirs alone to fight and trying to turn the Syrian civil war into an arena for the settling of ancient scores.</p><p>Throughout it all, though, the rebels of the north held out hope that real help would arrive some time. \"We were depending on this,\" said Sheikh Omar Otthman, a leader of the Liwa al-Tawheed brigade, the main opposition militia in Aleppo, of the now uncertain international intervention. \"The suffering of the people of Ghouta could have created an opportunity for all our suffering to be lifted.\"</p><p>Every twist in the fast-shifting international response to the chemical attack in eastern Damascus three weeks ago has been eagerly digested in opposition communities here. But the latest has convinced many that, despite the fuss, no one had been serious about helping them.</p><p>\"They've spent the past two weeks saying Bashar is a liar and must be punished and that he needs to know that he can't get away with what he does,\" said Abu Hamza, a former colonel in the Syrian military who became a central figure in the war for the north soon after it began.</p><p>\"And then they give him a chance to do more of what he has always done, get away with murder. He will stall them, trick them and wear them down. And they will send the ships home. And we'll be left alone.\"</p><p>In the town of al-Bab, a hub of the opposition to the north-east of Aleppo, phones have not worked for almost a year and electricity can be off for days. The town's unswept streets, which are now home to a growing number of black-robed extremists, echo to the sound of generators and clapped-out motorbikes.</p><p>\"We want to chase them out, but we need the Americans to help us,\" said Tawfik Merza of the aloof strangers among them. \"They are not from us, and they're not for us.\"</p><p>The standoff with the extremists is an unwanted distraction in al-Bab, which continues to be hit with the full range of the Syrian military's arsenal – except for chemicals.</p><p>In the early hours of Sunday, a large ballistic missile struck farmland north-east of Aleppo, the first for several months and a pointed reminder that a powerful enemy was still out there. The impact was soon followed by the roar of a fighter jet above the blacked-out town. The next day, Liwa al-Tawheed leaders and cadres stood among fig trees not far from where the missile landed, excitedly plucking fruit, their rifles resting against tree trunks. One fighter offered up a peeled fig. \"They're the best fruit you can eat,\" he said. \"Delicious, and healthy. Even in war there is still good.\"</p><p>Another fighter, Abu Hamza, said the missile showed Bashar was still in control. \"It shows he is still making decisions. There are three pillars of the Syrian military that we knew to be their strategic assets. The first was the use of the air force, the second was the ballistic missiles, and the third was the chemical weapons. To use any of those things, the permission must come from the commander-in-chief.\"</p><p>Few military commanders or civic leaders here doubt that the Syrian president still has control over his military chiefs. To those running the war here, he also holds sway over a reluctant US and Europe that is proving itself pliable in the hands of Syria's allies.</p><p>\"Don't they know that to negotiate after threatening force is to show that you are weak?\" said Abu Tayeb, a member of the governing council of one of the area's main militias.</p><p>To some, however – those who hang on to hope that the Russian-backed proposal to force Syria to give up its stockpile is a ploy to build further consensus to attack – the recent developments do not let the regime off the hook.</p><p>\"He has surrendered before a shot has been fired,\" said one senior supporter of the Syrian opposition. \"If he carries through with this promise to give up his weapons, he is handing over the most important strategic deterrent that he has. He has always been able to keep the Israelis at bay with the threat of these things. And if he tries to delay, or play games, he will get hit.</p><p>\"It will be easier for Europe to fall in behind Obama if they can see that he is not acting in good faith, which he won't be.\"</p><p>In al-Bab, the tension has at times been unbearable for locals who had early on coveted help from powerful backers, then given up on intervention, only to see it re-emerge as what seemed to be a real option.</p><p>\"I'll need to see a doctor after all of this,\" said Abdullah Namoud, a local from the town. \"It is worse than a Turkish TV drama, all these twists and changes.\"</p><p>The militias of the north had been preparing for a military operation to coincide with the mooted US attack, which they saw as the first chance they had to advance under air cover.</p><p>There had even been a sense among leaders of the northern militias, those that fall under the auspices of the Military Council, which funnels weapons into Syria, that they were expected to seize the moment, if and when the US rockets fell.</p><p>Now, with the US effectively having stood down, the palpable hope has been replaced by a sense of confusion.</p><p>\"I've said from the beginning that this was about the Americans saving their reputation, not about helping us,\" said a member of the governing council. \"That's politics, we know that. But our reality is that nothing will change for us. They're helping themselves, not us.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417068849|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|31d03ed029f4a9444b558fccf2835f32f207f7b8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Russia has dispatched a \"carrier killer\" missile cruiser and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean in its largest naval deployment since Soviet times.</p><p>The move comes as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, examine Moscow's plan to place Syrian chemical weapons under international control. Both Russia and the US have been beefing up their naval presence in the Med over the past several weeks.</p><p>The destroyer Smetlivy left a naval base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on Tuesday on a mission to the Syrian coast, a military source told the state news agency Interfax on Thursday.</p><p>The source said the Smetlivy would travel to the Mediterranean with the amphibious assault ship Nikolai Filchenkov, which left Novorossiysk on Monday carrying unidentified supplies for the Damascus government.</p><p>The missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, is also on its way to the Syrian coast to lead the Russian force there. The ship is reportedly known as a \"carrier-killer\" because it is outfitted with Vulkan missiles, that are designed to destroy large ships.</p><p>Observers have speculated that the buildup is in preparation for an evacuation of Russian citizens in Syria or even to repel a possible US attack against the Assad regime. According to a scientist working on military research, who asked not to be named, the deployment will put Russia in a position to evacuate its citizens currently in Syria and serve as a deterrent against military actions by Turkey and other players in the region.</p><p>\"The demonstration of strength, the demonstration of the flag, is an additional argument for Russia to be seen as important player,\" they said. However, the Russian fleet will not be able to stop an American missile or aircraft strike against Syria, they added</p><p>Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said that the Mediterranean force is part the biggest deployment of Russian ships worldwide in the post-Soviet era. However, Pukhov denied that the concentration of ships in the eastern Mediterranean was a direct reaction to the growing tensions over the Syrian conflict.</p><p>\"The rest of the Russian navy is now exercising all over the globe, including a visit to Australia, and all of these were planned months before and are not a reaction to events in Syria … in the past two months,\" Pukhov said.</p><p>In recent months, Russian ships have also conducted training exercises in the Barents Sea and in the Pacific Ocean near Kamchatka. At the end of August, it was reported that the missile cruiser Varyag and two other ships were preparing to set out for the south Pacific to make the Russian navy's first-ever visit to Sydney and to conduct joint exercises with the Australian navy.</p><p>Moscow dispatched ships to the Med starting in late August, but officials have maintained that the deployments are routine and not part of a naval buildup. The size of the fleet there has nonetheless increased: Russian forces in the Med will grow to 11 ships by mid September, the newspaper RBC Daily reported.</p><p>The US navy deployed an additional destroyer – its fifth – to the eastern Mediterranean at the end of August. The force could launch Tomahawk missiles at targets in Syria if Barack Obama orders an attack.</p><p>Retired admiral Vladimir Komoyedov, chairman of the defence committee of the state Duma and the former commander of the Black Sea fleet, told RBC Daily that the increased Russian presence is a demonstration of force that will nonetheless not be able to match US strength in the eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>\"The fact that we're building up our forces on the Syrian coast is the normal reaction of a government whose interests there are being interfered with,\" Komoyedov said. \"But unfortunately, the force we've assembled there is made up of pretty aged ships built 30 years ago. To compete with the United States, we need a fresh horse.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417125635|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|21c9081a765f5c1610c5e2cb810463c7aa3a0ff4 -->",

        "trailText":"Russian president appeals to Americans in New York Times article claiming intervention would unleash more terror",
        "headline":"Vladimir Putin warns US not to launch attack in Syria",
        "body":"<p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has warned against US military intervention in Syria, writing in what he called a direct address \"to the American people and their political leaders\" that it could \"increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism\".</p><p>Syria was not witnessing a battle for democracy but \"an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country\", Putin said, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html\" title=\"\">in a New York Times comment piece</a> repeating assertions that rebels rather than the government might have used chemical weapons, \"to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons\", and may be planning further attacks, even against Israel.</p><p>\"[An American attack] could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilise the Middle East and north Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.\"</p><p>Putin's article was published after the US welcomed what the Obama administration called \"very specific\" Russian proposals to secure the handover of Syria's chemical weapons before key talks in Geneva. The Russian president said recent events had \"prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders\".</p><p>In meetings planned for later on Thursday and again on Friday with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will ask Moscow to put forward a credible and verifiable plan to list, quarantine and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stocks.</p><p>Kerry is accompanied by US chemical weapons experts to look at and possibly expand on Russian ideas for the complex task of dealing safely with the vast stockpiles in the midst of the brutal and unpredictable Syrian conflict. Russian technical experts will join Lavrov in the meetings.</p><p>\"Our goal here is to test the seriousness of this proposal, to talk about the specifics of how this would get done, what are the mechanics of identifying, verifying, securing and ultimately destroying the chemical weapons,\" the state department said shortly before Kerry left Washington.</p><p>In his article, Putin welcomed Obama's consideration of the Russian-backed plan for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons and said his relationship with the US president was marked by \"growing trust\". But he warned: \"It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it.</p><p>\"Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan: 'You're either with us or against us.'\" Putin said Russia was not aiming to protect the Syrian government but international law.</p><p>The White House said on Wednesday it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by \"putting their prestige on the line\".</p><p>\"We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,\" said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p><p>\"The proposal they have put forward is very specific and the Syrian reaction is a total about-face. This is significant.\"</p><p>But the sudden thaw in White House attitudes towards Russia has met with scepticism in Washington, where many see it as an excuse for Barack Obama to avoid defeat in Congress over military action against Syria. A speech by Obama to the American people on Wednesday night was criticised by hawkish Republicans after it called for a suspension of Senate attempts to pass a resolution authorising US strikes.</p><p>The White House insisted that the Russian offer was genuine and a direct result of the pressure it had put on Syria. \"There is no question that the credible threat of US force helped bring us to this point,\" Carney said. \"By making this proposal Russia has, to its credit, put its prestige on the line when it comes to a close ally.\"</p><p>The US wants an agreement with Russia to be bolstered by a UN resolution to hold Syria accountable for using chemical weapons. The talks in Geneva between Kerry and Lavrov will not cover the wording of any resolution, but the US tried to play down a potential rift over whether it should contain the threat of military action if Syria fails to comply.</p><p>The talks will need to resolve differences between western powers and Russia over whether the disarmament process should be backed by a threat of force if the Syrian government reneges on the timetable.</p><p>Diplomats also said it was unlikely a UN security council vote would take place before the publication of a report by UN weapons inspectors on the suspected chemical weapons attack in rebel-held eastern Damascus on 21 August. That report is expected some time next week.</p><p>US, British and French diplomats continued to meet at the UN headquarters on Wednesday to discuss a French draft resolution that would give Bashar al-Assad's regime 15 days to produce an \"exhaustive, complete and definitive declaration of the locations, amount and types of all items related to its chemical warfare programme\".</p><p>The draft, according to a copy obtained by Reuters, would then order \"immediate on-site inspections of Syria's chemical, biological and related vehicles\". The full security council was due to meet later on Wednesday.</p><p>The Syrian government has acknowledged it agreed with Russia that it would sign the 1993 chemical weapons convention, deliver a full declaration of its arsenal and its locations, and provide access to UN, Russian and other inspectors.</p><p>Kerry said the US was still pushing for a UN resolution to bolster the plan which would punish Syria if it delayed or broke off the disarmament process. But he indicated he was prepared to listen to the Russian point of view.</p><p>\"We need a full resolution from the security council in order to have confidence that this has the force that it ought to have. That's our belief, and obviously the Russians are at a slightly different place. We'll have to see where we get to. I'm not going to negotiate this out in public,\" Kerry said.</p><p>The French president, François Hollande, also signalled flexibility on the wording of a resolution. A statement, released after a meeting of Hollande's defence council, said: \"The president emphasised France's determination to explore all avenues at the UN security council, in order to enable actual and verifiable control of the chemical weapons present in Syria as soon as possible.\"</p><p>France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is due in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the issue with Lavrov and may visit Beijing on Monday for talks with the Chinese government, which has been noncommittal on France's draft resolution.</p><p>• <em>Additional reporting by Paul Lewis in Washington</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417092965|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|4a5f68938e81ebb08a6b5c39bdcc0c4e43f31241 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sitting on thin mattresses laid out on a concrete floor, three men from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/syria-gas-attack-blood-tests\" title=\"\">the Ghouta</a>, the eastern district of Damascus that was attacked with chemical weapons, argued over their country's fate. Along with 22 other members of their families, they fled their homes a year ago and now share three rooms in a windowless, half-completed block of flats in a poor but safer part of Syria's capital. The district houses hundreds of displaced people.</p><p>\"You don't know what benefits you had until you lose them,\" said Abu Humeid. \"Education for your kids, peace, healthcare, security.\" Abu Humeid supported the uprising against President Assad's government when it started. Now, he said \"most Syrians want a political solution to be found, because a war is easy to start but hard to end. We've had two and a half years of fighting and we've made no progress\".</p><p>Saeed, his brother-in-law, poured tea on to a thick layer of sugar in small glasses that were passed round the room. He had been doubtful about the uprising from the beginning, he said. In spite of this fundamental disagreement, they were both relieved that President Obama has suspended his plan to launch missiles against Syria. \"About half of our neighbours think the same. A similar number are still worried that he might attack later. No attack will bring any good. A few people want Obama to do it, but it's a sign of how frustrated and desperate they are with the lack of jobs and the misery of the way we have to live now. They just want to have everything finished off, even if they end up being killed themselves,\" said Saeed.</p><p>An older relative, who also initially supported the uprising, made the point starkly: \"Negotiations are useless. I hope Obama strikes us all, us and the government, then we'll all be dead.\"</p><p>In the better-off districts of central Damascus, relief clearly outweighs such grim despair. Two weeks ago, when a US attack seemed imminent, people rushed to the shops to stock up on essentials. They stayed at home in the evenings. But now the cafes are full again and mothers push babies in buggies in the cool after dusk along tree-lined streets. Young people window-gaze in a pedestrian area full of fashion boutiques near the parliament building.</p><p>Even as the poorer districts fill up with escapees from the bombing of Ghouta and other outlying areas to the south and west, the city centre is emptier than it was in February. The wealthy have gone to Beirut or the Gulf.</p><p>The government has lifted travel bans on a number of people who supported the peaceful protests and demonstrations of 2011 in an apparent bid to get the politically active to leave. \"I was taken in for interrogation by a security force general last month,\" said one female activist. \"He was very polite, and at the end told me I had permission to go abroad. You don't need to return, he added.\"</p><p>Disappointed that Obama has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/obama-diplomatic-path-syria-chemical-weapons\" title=\"\">postponed the air strikes</a>, which she felt should have been launched as part of a no-fly zone long before the chemical weapons furore, she was astonished that Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, had agreed to abandon the country's chemical arsenal. \"In one move, Assad has thrown away years of effort in building [the chemical weapons] up, as well as his claim to be part of the resistance to Israel. They always said they needed them because Israel has nuclear weapons. Now he's giving them up to save his skin. It shows his cynicism.\"</p><p>In the Christian part of the walled Old City, Mirna Medaa, a hotel receptionist, was unhappy that Syria had abandoned its chemical weapons. \"We don't believe our president or the Syrian army used them, but it's not good to give them up. Israel has the biggest arsenal of chemical weapons in the world, as well as nuclear ones. The US has their defences. Why should we give ours up? I hope we have peace. If there is a peace agreement, then we won't need to use them.\"</p><p>Syria's pro-government media do not disguise their satisfaction that the US attacks have been put on hold. But they mainly avoid gloating or describing it as victory. Nasser Mundher, a columnist in al Thawra, the official Ba'ath party paper, wrote yesterday: \"The people who wanted to destroy Syria and were applauding the plan to attack are shocked now. They're holding their breath and hope it will still happen, but Russia's plan has stopped the attacks and given Obama a safe let-out from the problem he created for himself by drawing red lines and making threats.\"</p><p>Some Damascenes say they never thought Obama was serious about attacking Syria. Louai Hussein, who heads Building the Syrian State, a civil society group that campaigns for democratic reforms and has long criticised the way the opposition took up arms, believes the US is manoeuvring before the long-delayed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/friends-syria-talks-geneva-peace-conference\" title=\"\">Geneva II conference </a>on Syria. Hussein is convinced John Kerry's suggestion at a press conference in London that Syria could avoid the air strikes if it gave up chemical weapons was choreographed by President Putin with Mr Obama at the G20 summit.</p><p>\"In May the US began to feel the Syrian conflict was getting out of control and this was not in Israel's interest,\" Hussein said. \"Kerry is trying to collect more cards before Geneva. That's why he used the chemical weapons issue to produce a new card in the threat of air strikes.\"</p><p>Hussein hoped this week's talks between the Russian and US ministers will not only produce agreement on chemical weapons but moves to accelerate the convening of Geneva II – something that could end the entire war, not just the use of chemical weapons.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417150477|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|91d0a53fa2e27914b2ca16bcde6104b52b12c5e1 -->",

The US threats did not influence the decision,\" Interfax said, quoting the state-run Rossiya-24 channel's yet-to-be-aired interview.</p><p>Assad also told Rossiya-24 that Syria would submit documents to the United Nations for an agreement governing the handover of its chemical arsenal.</p><p>The reports came hours before the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and US secretary of state, John Kerry, were due to meet in Geneva to discuss the proposal, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/us-syria-russian-chemical-weapons-handover\" title=\"\">Lavrov announced on Monday along with Moscow's plan for implementing it</a>.</p><p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the initiative will not succeed unless Washington abandons plans for potential air strikes to punish Assad for a poison gas attack on 21 August that the US president, Barack Obama, blames on Syrian government forces.</p><p>Syria, which denies it was behind that attack, has agreed to Moscow's proposal that it give up its chemical weapons stocks – apparently averting what would have been the first direct western intervention in a war that has killed more than 100,000 people.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-crisis-russia-us-talks-live\" title=\"\">meetings planned for later on Thursday and again on Friday with Lavrov</a>, Kerry is expected to ask Moscow to put forward a credible and verifiable plan to list, quarantine and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stocks.</p><p>Kerry is accompanied by US chemical weapons experts to look at and possibly expand on Russian ideas for the complex task of dealing safely with the vast stockpiles in the midst of the brutal and unpredictable Syrian conflict. Russian technical experts will join Lavrov in the meetings.</p><p>\"Our goal here is to test the seriousness of this proposal, to talk about the specifics of how this would get done, what are the mechanics of identifying, verifying, securing and ultimately destroying the chemical weapons,\" the state department said shortly before Kerry left Washington.</p><p>In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/russia-putin-syria\" title=\"\">comment article for the New York Times</a> published on Wednesday, Putin welcomed Obama's consideration of the Russian-backed plan for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons and said his relationship with the US president was marked by \"growing trust\".</p><p>But he warned: \"It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it.</p><p>\"Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan: 'You're either with us or against us.'\" Putin said Russia was not aiming to protect the Syrian government but international law.</p><p>The White House said on Wednesday it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by \"putting their prestige on the line\".</p><p>\"We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,\" said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p><p>\"The proposal they have put forward is very specific and the Syrian reaction is a total about-face. This is significant.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417136010|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|b581d83a748e86422e232a1cfc997b75993aef02 -->",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>• <strong>Syrian UN envoy Ibrahim Jaafari claimed the country had attained &quot;full membership&quot; in the global convention banning chemical weapons.</strong> The UN had announced earlier this afternoon that it had received Syria's application.</p> <p>•<strong> US secretary of state John Kerry rejected president Bashar Assad's claim that Syria would take a &quot;standard&quot; month to declare its chemical assets after signing the convention. </strong>&quot;We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,&quot; Kerry said.</p> <p><strong>• Kerry said a UN resolution authorizing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal&nbsp;&quot;ought to&quot; include &quot;consequences if it doesn't take place.&quot;</strong></p> <p><strong>• American and Russian delegations began two days of meetings in Geneva to try to set a timeline and guidelines for taking Syrian's chemical assets.</strong> &quot;The technical challenges of trying to do this in the context of the civil war are obviously immense,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;We do believe there is a way to get this done.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• The Local Coordination Committees activist group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=736257656401373&amp;l=1d34b47cb4\">counted</a> 72 deaths on the opposition side from violence – an uptick from recent weeks – including 24 reported in Aleppo and 18 in Damascus and environs.</strong></p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The White House deflected questions about FSA Gen.

Here's an excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The international consensus that the regime was responsible [for the chemical attack] is growing. During the G20 eleven nations including the UK signed a statement condemning the regime’s use of chemical weapons and supporting efforts by the US and other countries to reinforce the prohibition against chemical weapons use. A week later that statement has now been signed by 25 countries.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Saturday I attended the EU Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Vilnius, which unanimously agreed that there was strong evidence of regime culpability, and that ‘in the face of this cynical use of chemical weapons, the international community cannot remain idle.’<br />&nbsp;<br />This growing international pressure, including the threat of military action by the US, has had an impact.<br />&nbsp;<br />On Monday I hosted Secretary Kerry for detailed discussions on the way forward. On the same day the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov announced that Russia would urge the Syrian regime to sign up to a proposal which would place their chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction. In response, the regime announced that it supported the initiative and was ready to cooperate; and that it intended to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, open up its sites and give up its chemical weapons.<br />&nbsp;<br />Given their track record, any commitment made by the Syrian regime must be treated with great caution. This is a regime that has lied for years about possessing chemical weapons, that still denies it has used them, and that refused for four months to allow UN inspectors into Syria.<br />&nbsp;<br />Nevertheless, as the Prime Minister has said, we have to take this proposal seriously and test its sincerity. If the Syrian regime verifiably gave up its chemical weapons stockpiles this would obviously be a major step forward. We agree with President Obama that this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.</p> <p>Intensive discussions are now taking place about how to achieve this, and Secretary Kerry is meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss the proposal.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft Security Council resolution, and the five permanent members of the Security Council met for consultations last night. A resolution must establish a binding commitment for the Syrian regime to give up its chemical weapons within a specific timeframe. We will hold further discussions in the Security Council once the UN inspectors have reported.<br />&nbsp;<br />The United Kingdom will make every effort to negotiate an enforceable agreement that credibly, reliably, and promptly places the regime’s chemical weapons stocks under international control for destruction.<br />&nbsp;<br />The House should be in no doubt of the scale of the challenge and the immense practical difficulties that would need to be overcome.<br />&nbsp;<br />It would require the genuine cooperation of a regime that denied until recently that it possessed these weapons and has used them ruthlessly against its own people on at least 14 occasions, killing many hundreds of people including women and children. The regime has a large number of sites – possibly the largest stock of chemical weapons possessed by any nation in the world – in numerous different locations in a country that is a contested battlefield. We would need to have confidence that all chemical weapons had been identified and secured and that they could not fall into the wrong hands.<br />&nbsp;<br />These issues can all be overcome with sufficient international unity and goodwill, and provided there is a complete change of approach by the Assad regime to all of its past practices and deceptions.<br />&nbsp;<br />So we will approach these negotiations with determination and resolve, knowing that if successful it would be an important breakthrough, but that overcoming all these issues will not be easy and that in the meantime thousands of Syrians are dying every month from conventional weapons in this worsening conflict.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is abundantly clear that this diplomatic opening would not have come about had the international community shown complacency or disregard for the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and that pressure on the regime must be maintained.<br />&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52319602e4b0a811a627c8eb\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:44:23.470+01:00\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hague calls for binding UN resolution</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for a tough UN resolution to hold Syria to its commitment to hand over its chemical weapons.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons, Hague said he was wary of Syria's promises and that dealing with the Assad's regime's chemical stockpiles posed &quot;immense practical difficulties&quot;. He said: &quot;We will need to have confidence that all chemical weapons have been identified and secured and that they would not fall into the wrong hands.&quot;</p> <p>But the foreign secretary said the initiative presented a &quot;diplomatic opening&quot; that would not have come about without international pressure to hold the Syrian government to account for last month's chemical weapons attack.</p> <p>Hague said: &quot;Our diplomats in New York are in close discussion about a draft security council resolution ...

US Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for talks in Geneva on a plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control.</p> <p>Here's a round up of the latest developments:</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/us-syria-russian-chemical-weapons-handover\"><strong>The US has welcomed what it called &quot;very specific&quot; Russian proposals to secure the handover of Syria's chemical weapons before key talks in Geneva on Thursday.</strong></a> The White House urged patience and said it was increasingly confident that its Kremlin partners were acting in good faith by &quot;putting their prestige on the line&quot;. &quot;We have seen more co-operation from Russia in the last two days than we have heard in the last two years,&quot; said White House spokesman Jay Carney.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/russia-offers-four-step-plan-for-syria-arms-handover-report.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=54312&amp;NewsCatID=359\"><strong>Russia has proposed a four-stage plan for Syria to hand over its weapons, according to AFP citing the Russian daily Kommersant. </strong></a>Under the plan Syria would:</p> <ol> <li>Join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] the body that upholds the international ban</li> <li>Disclose the location of chemical stockpiles</li> <li>Allow OPCW inspectors access to the sites</li> <li>Destroy the stockpile of weapons</li> </ol> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24058006\">The five permanent UN security council members have met in New York to discuss the Russian plan, the BBC reports.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US, UK and French diplomats held separate talks before the meeting of the so-called P5 envoys. The meeting lasted less than an hour and envoys declined to comment as they left.</p> <p>The French have already been working on a draft resolution that would be enforced by Chapter VII of the UN charter, which would in effect sanction the use of force if Syria failed in its obligations.</p> <p>However, Russia has already indicated that this would be unacceptable, as would any resolution blaming the Syrian government for chemical attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has drawn a contrast between what he portrayed as Russia's diplomatic approach to Syria and the Obama administration's talk of military intervention.</a>&nbsp;</strong>He also claimed Barack Obama's talk of US exceptionalism was &quot;dangerous&quot;.&nbsp;Writing in the New York Times he warned:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America's long-term interest? I doubt it ...</p> <p>From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law. We need to use the United Nations Security Council and believe that preserving law and order in today’s complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos.</p> <p>We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/11/un_report_will_finger_assad_for_massive_chemical_attack\"><strong>UN inspectors investigating last month's chemical attack east of Damascus have compiled enough circumstantial evidence to suggest the Assad regime was responsible, diplomats have told Foreign Policy's The Cable blog.</strong></a> &quot;You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author,&quot; one said.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/aleppo-rebels-angry-diplomacy-assad\"><strong>The US shift from planning an attack on the Assad regime to diplomacy has prompted despair and anger among rebels in Aleppo, Martin Chulov reports from the city.&nbsp;</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebels of the north held out hope that real help would arrive some time. &quot;We were depending on this,&quot; said Sheikh Omar Otthman, a leader of the Liwa al-Tawheed brigade, the main opposition militia in Aleppo, of the now uncertain international intervention. &quot;The suffering of the people of Ghouta could have created an opportunity for all our suffering to be lifted&quot; ...</p> <p>&quot;They've spent the past two weeks saying Bashar is a liar and must be punished and that he needs to know that he can't get away with what he does,&quot; said Abu Hamza, a former colonel in the Syrian military who became a central figure in the war for the north soon after it began.</p> <p>&quot;And then they give him a chance to do more of what he has always done, get away with murder. He will stall them, trick them and wear them down. And they will send the ships home. And we'll be left alone.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T11:25:06.332+01:00\">at 11.25am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417092960|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|75aaf935e2de56d91c0859d1bf1c913ee3beaddc -->",

        "headline":"Syria crisis: Kerry cautiously optimistic over chemical weapons surrender",
        "body":"<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Thursday expressed cautious optimism that a deal could be reached to guarantee the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, as he began talks on the issue in Geneva with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-chemical-weapons-un-us-russia\">Appearing alongside Lavrov, shortly after the beginning of two days of negotiations</a>, Kerry acknowledged that expectations were high but said: \"We do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>As the talks got under way in Geneva, the United Nations announced that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had signed a legislative decree making his country party to the chemical weapons convention.</p><p>\"In their letter, the Syrian authorities have expressed their commitment to observe the obligations entailed by the convention even before its entry into force for Syria,\" a UN spokesperson said. \"Given recent events, he hopes that the current talks in Geneva will lead to speedy agreement on a way forward which will be endorsed and assisted by the international community.\"</p><p>Kerry insisted that the threat of military action against Syria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\">over a chemical weapons attack in the country on 21 August</a>, remained an option. He also rejected Assad's suggestion that he would have 30 days, under the standard terms of the chemical weapons treaty, to declare his stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said. \"And the words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\"</p><p>The joint press conference between Kerry and Lavrov marked the start of an uncomfortable alliance between the US and Russia, after the two countries unexpectedly converged around a proposal to disarm Syria of its chemical stockpiles. Delegations of Russian and American technical experts are in the Swiss capital to discuss the mechanics of the disarmament plan, which would involve Syria identifying the locations of its stockpiles and handing over control to the international community. </p><p>Washington is seeking to shift responsibility for the success of any weapons destruction programme to Moscow. US officials argue that the plans for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons were put forward by Russia, and says its \"prestige\" is now at stake. \"This is not a game. It has to be real,\" Kerry said in Geneva.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/sep/12/assad-ready-handover-syria-chemical-weapons-video\">Assad told Russian television</a> Syria would submit documents to the UN for an agreement governing the handover of its chemical arsenal. \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The US threats did not influence the decision,\" Interfax said, quoting the state-run Rossiya-24 channel's yet-to-be-aired interview.</p><p>The White House and State Department both indicated on Thursday that the US was treating Assad's promise with scepticism. In Geneva, Kerry said: \"It is too early to tell whether these efforts will succeed, but the technical challenges of trying to do this in the context of the civil war are obviously immense. But despite how difficult this is, with the collaboration of our experts, and only with the compliance of the Assad regime, we do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>A senior state department official accompanying the Kerry delegation said the US and Russia both had technical expertise in chemical weapons destruction because of the two-decade process – which is still ongoing – to destroy cold war-era stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We also have experience in doing destruction of chemical weapons in the face of a resistant environment,\" the official said. \"That is Iraq in the 1990s. And we have recent and ongoing experience, successful experience, in the case of a cooperative government. That is Libya, which we expect within the next few months will complete the destruction of its stockpiles left over from the previous regime.\"<br /> <br />The senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity, as occurs routinely in US administration briefings. </p><p>Kerry said Syrian weapons destruction would need to be credible, comprehensive, verifiable and implemented quickly, and added that there would need to be \"consequences\" for Assad if he did not comply with his obligations. He did not specify whether such consequences would involve the use of force against Syria. </p><p>However, he also said that the credible threat of military action had forced Syria into conceding that it possessed chemical weapons and agreeing to their destruction, and maintained that the threat of strikes remained. Lavrov said that the securing of Syria's chemical weapons \"will make unnecessary any strike against the Syrian Arab Republic\".</p><p>After Kerry spoke, Lavrorv appeared to admonish him for making political comments. \"Diplomacy likes silence,\" Lavrov said. Kerry did not hear the translation and asked for it to be repeated. Lavrov said in English: \"It's okay, John.\" Kerry laughed and replied: \"You want me to take your word for it. It's a little early for that.\"</p><p>Aside from the jokes, Kerry adopted softer language than has recently been used by the Obama administration, saying only that \"force might be necessary\" to deter Assad from using his weapons if the diplomatic route failed.</p><p>The question over whether force could be authorised, in the event that Syria did not comply with chemical weapons actions, is at the centre of negotiations at the UN in New York, where a possible resolution is being drafted. </p><p>Lavrov added that Russia's position on Syria had been laid out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-op-ed-author-ketchum-nyt\"> president Vladimir Putin's op-ed article in the New York Times</a>. \"I am convinced that all of you have read this article,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>In the article, Putin welcomed the new diplomatic initiative over Syria but condemned a US tendency toward unilateral \"brute force\" and sharply criticised America's belief in its own \"exceptionalism\". The article caused consternation in Washington.</p><p>The Republican senator John McCain said the article was \"an insult to the intelligence of every American\", while the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, said of reading the piece: \"I almost wanted to vomit.\"</p><p>The US administration chose more diplomatic language. A State Department deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the time had come for Putin to \"put forward actions now, not just words\".</p><p>The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"The important thing is that both in his op-ed and in his statements and actions, president Putin has invested his credibility in the transfer of Assad's chemical weapons.\"</p><p>He added: \"[Nevertheless] there's a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition in this country of freedom of expression – something on the decrease in the last dozen or so years in Russia.\"</p><p>Carney said the White House would not tolerate any delay by the Syrian government and would continue to provide military assistance to rebel groups throughout the process.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417166585|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|3a43cf818b20ccd10a7eb8c0e33c8916996e28ad -->",

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said at a news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that both sides were serious about the negotiations despite some differences over the plan. But he warned: \"This is not a game. It has to be real.\"</p><p>With its letter to the UN, Syria was poised to become the the 190th member of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), leaving a small group of nations outside the treaty: Israel, Burma, Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan. Syrian membership will take effect 30 days after the delivery of the letter. After that Syria would be legally committed to ridding itself of its chemical arsenal.</p><p>However, in a Russian television interview, Assad also appeared to put conditions on Syria's chemical disarmament, saying the US would have to reciprocate by ceasing military threats against his government and the arming of \"terrorists\".</p><p>Assad's comments emphasised the significant diplomatic obstacles facing US and Russian diplomats and chemical weapons experts as they began meetings in Geneva to discuss Moscow's plan to disarm the Syrian government. According to the Russian Kommersant newspaper, the plan would involve four stages: Syria would sign the CWC, then declare its stockpile and production facilities, invite weapons inspectors in, and cooperate with them in drawing up a plan to destroy the stockpile.</p><p>That arsenal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-french-intelligence-assad\">according to a French intelligence estimate this month</a>, amounts to more than 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents and precursors, including mustard gas as well as sarin and VX nerve agents.</p><p>Speaking in Geneva, Kerry acknowledged that there would be \"immense technical challenges\" in implementing the plan. But he told Lavrov: \"We are serious, as you are, about engaging in substantive, meaningful negotiations.\" He repeated Washington's position that there had to be \"consequences\" if Syria failed to follow through on its commitments and said that US military assets would remain in place.</p><p>In an op-ed published in the New York Times on Wednesday night, Russian president Vladimir Putin restated Moscow's claim that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\">the chemical attacks in Damascus on 21 August which triggered the current global crisis</a> were the work of rebel forces, but he did not cite evidence.</p><p>A UN investigation into the attack is expected to produce a report early next week. <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/09/11/un_report_will_finger_assad_for_massive_chemical_attack\">The Foreign Policy online magazine quoted a senior western official</a> as saying the report, by Swedish scientist Åke Sellström, would include a \"wealth\" of evidence pointing at the culpability of the Assad regime. American officials said that they would insist on a brisk timetable to ensure the plan did not become a time-buying ploy.</p><p>While the diplomats talked in Geneva, the US and Russia continued to build up their naval forces in the Mediterranean. Russia has dispatched a \"carrier killer\" missile cruiser and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean, in its largest naval deployment since Soviet times.</p><p>The destroyer Smetlivy left a naval base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on Tuesday, on a mission to the Syrian coast, a military source told the state news agency Interfax on Thursday. The source said the Smetlivy would travel to the Mediterranean with the amphibious assault ship Nikolai Filchenkov, which left Novorossiysk on Monday carrying unidentified supplies for the Damascus government. The missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, is also on its way to the Syrian coast to lead the Russian force there. The ship is reportedly known as a \"carrier-killer\" because it is outfitted with Vulkan missiles, which are designed to destroy large ships.</p><p>The former Democratic US senator Sam Nunn, who is one of the world's leading arms-control campaigners, said the disarmament process would have a chance of succeeding only if the Syrian army is in charge of the arsenal.</p><p>\"We hope that the Syrian army is in control. The US government believes it is. The Russians disagree. If the Russians are right and some of the rebels have control, the nightmare's just started,\" said Nunn, speaking to The Guardian in Brussels.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417158925|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|3ef03e99dbcb519853c76d86fb7804df913d8c72 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Thursday expressed cautious optimism that a deal could be reached to guarantee the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, as he began talks on the issue in Geneva with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/syria-chemical-weapons-un-us-russia\">Appearing alongside Lavrov, shortly after the beginning of two days of negotiations</a>, Kerry acknowledged that expectations were high but said: \"We do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>As the talks got under way in Geneva, the United Nations announced that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had signed a legislative decree making his country party to the chemical weapons convention.</p><p>\"In their letter, the Syrian authorities have expressed their commitment to observe the obligations entailed by the convention even before its entry into force for Syria,\" a UN spokesperson said. \"Given recent events, he hopes that the current talks in Geneva will lead to speedy agreement on a way forward which will be endorsed and assisted by the international community.\"</p><p>Kerry insisted that the threat of military action against Syria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/syria-chemical-weapons-eyewitness\">over a chemical weapons attack in the country on 21 August</a>, remained an option. He also rejected Assad's suggestion that he would have 30 days, under the standard terms of the chemical weapons treaty, to declare his stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said. \"And the words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough.\"</p><p>The joint press conference between Kerry and Lavrov marked the start of an uncomfortable alliance between the US and Russia, after the two countries unexpectedly converged around a proposal to disarm Syria of its chemical stockpiles. Delegations of Russian and American technical experts are in the Swiss capital to discuss the mechanics of the disarmament plan, which would involve Syria identifying the locations of its stockpiles and handing over control to the international community. </p><p>Washington is seeking to shift responsibility for the success of any weapons destruction programme to Moscow. US officials argue that the plans for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons were put forward by Russia, and says its \"prestige\" is now at stake. \"This is not a game. It has to be real,\" Kerry said in Geneva.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/sep/12/assad-ready-handover-syria-chemical-weapons-video\">Assad told Russian television</a> Syria would submit documents to the UN for an agreement governing the handover of its chemical arsenal. \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The US threats did not influence the decision,\" Interfax said, quoting the state-run Rossiya-24 channel's yet-to-be-aired interview.</p><p>The White House and State Department both indicated on Thursday that the US was treating Assad's promise with scepticism. In Geneva, Kerry said: \"It is too early to tell whether these efforts will succeed, but the technical challenges of trying to do this in the context of the civil war are obviously immense. But despite how difficult this is, with the collaboration of our experts, and only with the compliance of the Assad regime, we do believe there is a way to get this done.\"</p><p>A senior state department official accompanying the Kerry delegation said the US and Russia both had technical expertise in chemical weapons destruction because of the two-decade process – which is still ongoing – to destroy cold war-era stockpiles.  </p><p>\"We also have experience in doing destruction of chemical weapons in the face of a resistant environment,\" the official said. \"That is Iraq in the 1990s. And we have recent and ongoing experience, successful experience, in the case of a cooperative government. That is Libya, which we expect within the next few months will complete the destruction of its stockpiles left over from the previous regime.\"<br /> <br />The senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity, as occurs routinely in US administration briefings. </p><p>Kerry said Syrian weapons destruction would need to be credible, comprehensive, verifiable and implemented quickly, and added that there would need to be \"consequences\" for Assad if he did not comply with his obligations. He did not specify whether such consequences would involve the use of force against Syria. </p><p>However, he also said that the credible threat of military action had forced Syria into conceding that it possessed chemical weapons and agreeing to their destruction, and maintained that the threat of strikes remained. Lavrov said that the securing of Syria's chemical weapons \"will make unnecessary any strike against the Syrian Arab Republic\".</p><p>After Kerry spoke, Lavrorv appeared to admonish him for making political comments. \"Diplomacy likes silence,\" Lavrov said. Kerry did not hear the translation and asked for it to be repeated. Lavrov said in English: \"It's okay, John.\" Kerry laughed and replied: \"You want me to take your word for it. It's a little early for that.\"</p><p>Aside from the jokes, Kerry adopted softer language than has recently been used by the Obama administration, saying only that \"force might be necessary\" to deter Assad from using his weapons if the diplomatic route failed.</p><p>The question over whether force could be authorised, in the event that Syria did not comply with chemical weapons actions, is at the centre of negotiations at the UN in New York, where a possible resolution is being drafted. </p><p>Lavrov added that Russia's position on Syria had been laid out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/putin-op-ed-author-ketchum-nyt\"> president Vladimir Putin's op-ed article in the New York Times</a>. \"I am convinced that all of you have read this article,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>In the article, Putin welcomed the new diplomatic initiative over Syria but condemned a US tendency toward unilateral \"brute force\" and sharply criticised America's belief in its own \"exceptionalism\". The article caused consternation in Washington.</p><p>The Republican senator John McCain said the article was \"an insult to the intelligence of every American\", while the Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, said of reading the piece: \"I almost wanted to vomit.\"</p><p>The US administration chose more diplomatic language. A State Department deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the time had come for Putin to \"put forward actions now, not just words\".</p><p>The White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \"The important thing is that both in his op-ed and in his statements and actions, president Putin has invested his credibility in the transfer of Assad's chemical weapons.\"</p><p>He added: \"[Nevertheless] there's a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition in this country of freedom of expression – something on the decrease in the last dozen or so years in Russia.\"</p><p>Carney said the White House would not tolerate any delay by the Syrian government and would continue to provide military assistance to rebel groups throughout the process.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417166585|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|3a43cf818b20ccd10a7eb8c0e33c8916996e28ad -->",

We are working hard to find the common ground to be able to make that happen. We discussed some of the homework that we both need to do,\" Kerry said.</p><p>Kerry said they agreed to meet around 28 September on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly high-level meetings in New York. But, he said, the future of peace negotiations depends on the outcome of the weapons talks.</p><p>\"And we are committed to try to work together, beginning with this initiative on the chemical weapons, in hopes that those efforts could pay off and bring peace and stability to a war-torn part of the world,\" he added.</p><p>Brahimi also met privately with Kerry at a Geneva hotel on Thursday to explore ways to resume international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012 aimed at ending the Syrian civil war.</p><p>Lavrov said Russia has supported the peace process from the start of the Syrian conflict but that \"it is very unfortunate that for a long period the Geneva communique was basically abandoned.\"</p><p>Lavrov said he, Kerry and Brahimi discussed ways of preparing for a second conference along with the document, which \"means that the Syrian parties must reach mutual consent on the transitional governing organ, which would come with full executive authority. And the communique also says that all groups of Syrian society must be represented.\"</p><p>When the talks began Thursday, Kerry bluntly rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a \"standard process\" by turning over information rather than weapons — and nothing immediately. The American diplomat said that was not acceptable.</p><p>\"The words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough,\" Kerry declared as he stood beside Lavrov. \"This is not a game.\"</p><p>Salem al-Meslet, a senior member of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, said he was disappointed in the outcome of the Kerry and Lavrov meeting.</p><p>\"They are leaving the murderer and concentrating on the weapons he was using,\" he said of Assad. \"It is like stabbing somebody with a knife then they take the knife away and he is free.\"</p><p>He spoke on the sidelines of a two-day opposition conference in Istanbul.</p><p>The talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the 21 August gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The US blames Syrian president Bashar Assad for the use of chemical weapons, although Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to rebels engaged in a two-year-old civil war against his government.</p><p>President Barack Obama began building a case for support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Assad's forces, then changed course and asked Congress to give him explicit authority for a limited strike. With the campaign for lawmakers' building to a vote – one that he might well lose – Obama said Tuesday he would consider a Russian proposal calling for international control of Assad's chemical weapons and their eventual destruction.</p><p>Obama dispatched Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of US military action.</p><p>\"We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" Kerry said on the opening day of talks. The turnover of weapons must be complete, verifiable and timely, he said, \"and, finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place.\"</p><p>Lavrov seemed to contradict Kerry's negative view of Assad's offer to provide details on his country's chemical arsenal beginning 30 days after it signs an international convention banning such weapons. Syria's ambassador to the United Nations said that as of Thursday his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons.</p><p>The Russian said the initiative must proceed \"in strict compliance with the rules that are established by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\" That suggests Russia does not agree with the US that this is an exceptional case and that Syria should face tougher standards than other countries.</p><p>\"We proceed from the fact that the solution to this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the Syrian Arab Republic, and I am convinced that our American colleagues, as President Obama stated, are firmly convinced that we should follow a peaceful way of resolution to the conflict in Syria,\" Lavrov said.</p><p>The distrust in US-Russia relations was on display even in an offhand parting exchange at the news conference. Just before it ended, Kerry asked the Russian translator to repeat part of Lavrov's concluding remarks.</p><p>When it was clear that Kerry wasn't going to get an immediate retranslation, Lavrov apparently tried to assure him that he hadn't said anything controversial . \"It was OK, John, don't worry,\" he said.</p><p>\"You want me to take your word for it?\" Kerry asked Lavrov. \"It's a little early for that.\"</p><p>They were smiling at that point. Shortly after making their opening statements, the two went into a private dinner.</p><p>Assad, in an interview with Russia's Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the US halted threats of military action.</p><p>At a meeting in Kyrgyzstan of an international security grouping dominated by Russia and China, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Syria's efforts have demonstrated its good faith.</p><p>\"I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,\" Putin said.</p><p>Even as diplomacy took center stage, word surfaced that the CIA has been delivering light machine guns and other small arms to Syrian rebels for several weeks, following Obama's statement in June that he would provide lethal aid to the rebels.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the administration could not \"detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery, but it's important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.\"</p><p>Current and former US intelligence officials said the CIA has arranged for the Syrian opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry such as rocket-propelled grenades through a third party, presumably one of the Gulf countries that have been arming the rebels. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the classified program publicly.</p><p>Loay al-Mikdad, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, told the Associated Press that his group expected to receive weapons in the near future.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417203893|2013-10-17T10:29:17Z|a350e0967d6f08353f359cb9746a3e4e536c080d -->",
