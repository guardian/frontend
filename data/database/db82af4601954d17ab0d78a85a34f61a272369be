A senior Fed official said today that the bank wants to make sure the improvement in the US jobs market is not just temporary before scaling back the bond buying. In <a href=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/newsroom/displayNews.cfm?article=1973&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SM&amp;utm_campaign=Twitter\">a speech at a financial forum&nbsp;</a> St Louis Fed president James Bullard said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To the extent that key labour market indicators continue to show cumulative improvement the likelihoodof tapering asset purchases will continue to rise. The committee also wants reassurance that nay progress made in labour markets will stick.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those comments suggested to some that Bullard was becoming less dovish. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Bullard’s views are highly relevant as he has been a bellwether for investors: at the beginning of this year, he was one of the first Fed officials to discuss the need to taper. Since the summer, however, he became much more dovish, highlighting concerns about the too low inflation rate. Today’s remarks suggest that Mr Bullard has again abandoned his dovish bias and is – under certain conditions – willing to support the tapering.</p> <p>In short, his speech and the presented slides indicate that to him average monthly payroll gains of about 180,000 would represent a substantial improvement in the labor market, the necessary condition for the Fed to wind-down its asset purchase program.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T16:34:44.267Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5273bd15e4b0ad7c52b60506\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T14:51:23.990Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54f4114c-24a0-4fae-80d6-6e17e4da06cf\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/8/22/1377166412900/Shopper-pushes-a-trolley--010.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is 412th on the Forbes list of billionaires.

And however much people care about inequality, almost every place on Earth would like to be the kind of place where successful new firms are born and raised.</p> <p>The good news about Sweden is that it’s exactly that kind of place. High taxes go to finance cheap health care and education, an excellent system of public transportation, and relatively generous subsidies to low-income households that keep the poverty rate and inequality low. But they haven’t stopped Swedish entrepreneurs from building giant firms like H&amp;M, Ikea, and&nbsp;Tetra Pak.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read his full piece <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/billion_to_one/2013/10/sweden_s_billionaires_they_have_more_per_capita_than_the_united_states.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><em>I am passing onto Nick Fletcher now.

to plug a fiscal gap that it says can been easily fixed by better control of social security contributions.</p> <p>Earlier this week tensions were raised a notch further when the country’s normally mild-mannered president <strong>Carolos Papoulias</strong> used an annual commemoration of the country’s stand against fascism to insist that “<a href=\"http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/10/28/greece-says-cant-take-any-more-austerity-will-not-be-blackmailed/\">Greek people cannot give anymore</a>”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Athens’ outright rejection of new belt-tightening measures has outraged creditors who in private insist that fresh cuts are the only way forward.&nbsp;</p> <p>Indicative of the mood in a country where disposal incomes have been slashed by up to 50%, the government has been forced to backtrack on a new bill outlining property taxes with the finance minister, <strong>Yannis Stornaras</strong>, promising to amend the legislation in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5273a02be4b01fc33230d44e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T12:41:17.604Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sterling extends its losses</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar to $1.5958</strong>, as investors shrug off Friday's economic good news. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/chinas-manufacturing-at-18-month-high-live#block-527375b9e4b01fc33230d43b\">Manufacturing data showed the fastest growth in export orders for two years</a>, but many traders are not convinced the pick-up in the UK economy will be sustained.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527398cee4b0020e1b71993d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T12:29:27.120Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Belfast relieved over RBS plan</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6b944428-975d-40db-88ce-297dbf2a291a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383309142056/91cc8fb2-3dd1-44cf-9d8b-17f63f464610-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ulster Bank HQ in Belfast.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Paul Faith/PA</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The RBS bad bank is also an important move for Ulster Bank, the largest bank in Northern Ireland. </strong>Around &pound;9bn of Ulster Bank's bad loans will find a home in the RBS internal bad bank.</p> <p><strong>The Guardian's </strong>Ireland correspondent<strong> Henry McDonald</strong>&nbsp;writes that Ulster Bank is critical for both states on the island.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Northern Ireland secretary <strong>Theresa Villiers</strong> has welcomed RBS' decision to continue operating as the Ulster Bank on both sides of the Irish border.&nbsp;The secretary of state said today she had been working closely with colleagues in the Treasury &quot;to ensure the importance of this decision to Northern Ireland was clearly understood and properly considered.&quot;&nbsp;She said the restructuring of RBS overall would &quot;give Ulster Bank a greater ability to lend, providing extra help to Northern Ireland business and the economy.&quot;</p> <p>The Northern Irealnd Finance Minister Simon Hamilton said the news that RBS was not being split up was &quot;far better than many people feared&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;We do have the opportunity as a result of the review that will take place to shape Ulster Bank into the bank that we need it to be,&quot; he added.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SimonHamilton/statuses/396207416649719808\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Decision to keep Ulster Bank as a core part of RBS business is a positive result for Northern Ireland.

We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

About £9bn of those toxic assets are from Ulster Bank.</p><p>Ulster Bank will also face a further review aimed at finding a viable and sustainable business model.</p><p>The Ulster Bank also revealed it lost a further £132m in the third quarter of this year as it continues to suffer from the impacts of the property crash, particularly in the Irish Republic.</p><p>The bank's importance to the economies of both states on the island of Ireland is critical to the banking sector. Ulster Bank is the largest bank in Northern Ireland and the third largest in the Republic. Most of its debts on the island were generated when it lent billions in commercial property loans during the Celtic Tiger years before the crash.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421452363|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4891b26c485a85992a9f9cb32b5ea5de68e19cdd -->",

        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland's new capital resolution division (RCR) will contain £38bn of the bailed-out bank's most troublesome loans.</p><p>The bank already had a \"non-core\" division, which Stephen Hester created on joining RBS five years ago when the bank was on the brink of collapse. At that time it had £258bn of unwanted businesses and assets, which had shrunk to £35bn by the time Hester left in September. These businesses included substantial operations such as its commodity trading business, plane leasing and pub chains.</p><p>Some £14.8bn of those remaining non-core assets will go into the RCR together with another £23.5bn of loans that look as if they will not be repaid.</p><p>That £23.5bn is largely made up of commercial property loans - some 47% of the total - split between four of the bank's divisions. UK corporate, which lends to big business, will put £5.5bn of loans in, while Ulster bank will put in £4.1bn. The investment banking arm has £2.6bn of troubled positions that will go into the RCR, while £2.6bn will come from international markets.</p><p>The addition of the new legacy positions mean that £9bn loans from Ulster Bank are now included in the division. While half of the RCR will be comprised of commercial property, a quarter is corporate lending with the other quarter made up of shipping loans (8%) and trading positions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421448040|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|612f20176b4c8920190fdc749429c68478262568 -->",

        "body":"<p>With Royal Bank of Scotland under pressure, the <strong>Direct Line</strong> insurance business it spun off last year is heading in the other direction.</p><p>Shares in Britain's largest motor insurer have climbed 3.1p to 228.1p after it reported a 6% rise in third quarter operating profits and said restructuring costs for the next two years would be 12% lower than expected. Direct Line, where RBS still owns 28%, said it was too early to assess the cost of the recent St Jude's Day storm but it should fall within its expectation of around £25m from major weather events. Analysts were divided on the business. Canaccord Genuity's Ben Cohen said:</p><p><blockquote>Nine month on-going operating profit was £418m versus £419m consensus, while the net income was a clear beat at £243m versus £209m estimated, driven by higher run-off profits and lower restructuring charges. The underwriting result of £122m versus £136m included £9m loss on German hail in July, which we do not believe was in forecasts. Light underwriting was made up by better investment income, helped by realised gains.<br /><br />We continue to see Direct Line as well placed to produce attractive returns to shareholders, even in competitive end-markets, helped by cost-cutting and strong starting reserving. We would not expect consensus forecasts to move materially, absent the benefit from lower restructuring charges, but expect the mix of profit contribution near-term to continue to shift from motor to other lines.<br /><br />With Direct Line expected to pay a special dividend of 4p per share after the sale of its life division, we see the 7.3% dividend yield as attractive, and well-supported by an underlying payout ratio below 60%. RBS's residual stake remains an overhang. <br /></blockquote></p><p>But Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas was more negative;</p><p><blockquote>Headline operating profits were better than expected for the third quarter but only due to greater investment gains. Lower restructuring costs also flattered the pre-tax profits. Excluding these one-offs, underlying results were below expectations.<br /><br />Our concern regarding the sustainability of earnings remains due to: 1) the high prior year profits and motor reforms; and 2) rapidly falling new business prices will slowly impact the business.</blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421447200|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|5952cd9d7fbe761a2e22f87547e8584705d28490 -->",

        "headline":"RBS places troublesome assets worth £38bn in internal 'bad bank'",
        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Friday that it would make a substantial loss this year after its new chief executive, Ross McEwan, announced £38bn of troublesome assets would be ringfenced inside the bailed out bank.</p><p>In a move that was seen as an attempt to restore the often strained relationships with the government and regulators, McEwan also made clear he wanted to draw a line under lingering concerns about the bank's capital position. On a number of occasions he talked about \"resetting\" relationships with the Treasury and the Bank of England.</p><p>Chancellor George Osborne was in the main London office of RBS as the figures were released and conceded that any sell-off of the shares was unlikely before the election. McEwan said he wanted to move away from the \"weariness\" and \"defensiveness\" that had crept into RBS.</p><p>McEwan acknowledged the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/rbs-business-lending-attacked\" title=\"\">stinging criticism contained in a report into the bank's lending practices</a>, which found it was turning away three out of every four applications for business loans from small and medium-sized businesses and was too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty. McEwan said that while the report made uncomfortable reading, the bank had to confront the problem.</p><p>The review into creating a bad bank – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/osborne-lloyds-rbs-sell-off\" title=\"\">commissioned by Osborne after his Mansion House speech in June</a> – had concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". Investment bank Rothschild, which conducted the review recommended by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said it would \"do more harm than good\".</p><p>Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sat on the commission, tweeted: \"So RBS will have an internal bad bank, as it has had for five years.\"</p><p>RBS shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.5% at 355p – well below the 500p average price the taxpayer paid for them – after the bank reported a third-quarter loss of more than £600m.</p><p>Osborne, who through UK Financial Investments owns 81% of RBS, said the bailed-out bank was on a \"new direction\". A Treasury report showed RBS would become more UK-focused with an even smaller investment bank – which employed 25,000 staff before the bailout but now employs 10,900. Osborne said the bank should not be involved in \"speculating and punting on the markets\".</p><p>Instead of the bad bank, which the taxpayer would have had to fund, about £38bn of troublesome loans – including £9bn from Ulster Bank – will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which will aims to be wound down in two years. Some £11bn of capital should be released as a result.</p><p>McEwan – who said he wanted to \"reset the key relationships\" with government and regulators – will accelerate the spin-off of RBS's US arm, Citizens, to next year rather than 2015 and signalled a review of a large number of businesses, the outcome of which will be announced in February. Ulster Bank is likely to remain part of RBS Group.</p><p>The New Zealander, who has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/rbs-ross-mcewan-stephen-hester\" title=\"\">chief executive since 1 October</a>, would not comment on the potential impact on jobs as he discussed the need to cut costs.</p><p>Creating the new non-core division would mean the bank has to write off up to £4.5bn of problem loans in the next year – driving the bank to a \"substantial loss\" for the full year.</p><p>Despite the warning of losses, Osborne said: \"Today RBS sets out a new direction – a new direction that will lead it to being a boost to the British economy instead of a burden. This is part of our economic plan for sustaining the economic recovery and creating a banking system that works for Britain.\" He conceded though that a sale of the government's stake was unlikely to happen before the next election.</p><p>The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of £250m – taking its total bill so far to £2.65bn and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. McEwan would not comment on reports two traders had been suspended.</p><p>McEwan said the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority was preparing to ask banks to hold more capital and so RBS was acting in a \"pro-active manner\". The Bank of England had found RBS would have had a £13.5bn capital shortfall at the end of December 2013, which is why it taking steps to bolster its financial strength.</p><p>The review into a possible bad bank had been conducted with the regulator. \"The good bank/bad bank review has from the start been carried out in conjunction with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). This has allowed us to address our shared objective of identifying ways in which to strengthen the capital position of the bank, speed up the recovery in our core UK businesses and accelerate the path to privatisation,\" McEwan said.</p><p>RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends – when it could afford them – to the government before its other shareholders.</p><p>McEwan's own review into the business will be unveiled in February and will cover customer-facing businesses, IT and operations and decision-making structures.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421434497|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda1cbca0e5a987b9b9f9dee60ca911fc46d0d0b -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\" title=\"\">services sector appears to be booming</a>. Growth in services activity and employment rose at the fastest rate in more than 16 years in October.</p><p></p><p>The Markit/CIPS PMI for September jumped to 62.5 from 60.3 – well ahead of City expectations. It signalled further improvement for a sector which accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Nida Ali, economic adviser to the</strong> <strong>Ernst &amp; Young Item Club</strong>,<strong> </strong>says the data suggest the fourth quarter got off to a positive start, with unemployment likely to fall below 7% ahead of the Bank of England's current expectations.</p><p></p><p>\"The services sector has started the fourth quarter with a bang. These figures beat even the most optimistic expectations, as most commentators, after strong out-turns in the past couple of months, were expecting the pace of services growth to slow in October.</p><p></p><p>\"The all-sector PMI, which covers service, manufacturing and construction, rose 1.3 points in October to be 61.5, hitting its highest ever level, suggesting that growth is set to accelerate further in Q4. But there appears to be some divergence in the survey results and actual data. For instance, the PMI results in Q3 had suggested output growth of more than 1.5%, but official data was only half of that. So we would be wary of drawing any firm conclusions about Q4 growth just yet.</p><p></p><p>\"The strong increase in employment supports our view that the unemployment rate is on track to drop below the 7% forward guidance threshold well ahead of schedule. We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Blerina Uruçi, a Barclays economist</strong>, said it was a positive sign for the months ahead.</p><p></p><p>\"Strength in the services survey was spread across the board. The new business index rose by 2.8 points to 63.4, reaching the highest since the survey began in 1997. This rise in the pace of growth of new business bodes well for overall activity in the coming months and makes today's outturn appear more grounded.</p><p></p><p>\"The firms surveyed attributed this increase in new business mainly to an improvement in market sentiment and again noted the housing market as a driver of new orders growth.</p><p></p><p>\"The employment index was also strong, rising to 56.2, its highest in over 16 years. The services PMI survey has reported rising payroll numbers for 10 consecutive months and the latest reading is consistent with employment rising significantly faster than would be consistent with its long-term average (51.1).\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy at Scotiabank,</strong> says official data for the services sector is unlikely to be as strong as the PMI.</p><p></p><p>\"The UK services sector CIPS survey is flying! Nonetheless, it is worth keeping the reading in context. Why do we care about the PMI? Because it tells us where GDP is likely to go.</p><p></p><p>\"What does the relationship look like now? It suggests that business services output should be surging by around 3% quarter on quarter (q/q) compared to the near-1% q/q we saw during Q3. If we get that sort of growth in services output (and I'm not saying we will - it looks like an overshoot to me) then other things equal q/q GDP would be close to 1.5% q/q – almost double Q3's decent pace.</p><p></p><p>\"The survey feels a bit frothy. No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight</strong>, said it was a \"mightily impressive\" set of figures.</p><p></p><p>\"Particularly given the dominant role of the services sector in the economy (it accounts for 77.8% of total output, the survey suggests that there is a very real possibility that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could rival the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter growth rate achieved in the third quarter.</p><p></p><p>\"At this stage though, we expect GDP growth to ease back to a still very decent 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, partly due to some moderation in consumer spending. Lacklustre October retail surveys from the BRC and the CBI reinforce our view that consumers may be taking a breather at least until Christmas.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>James Knightley, ING economist</strong>, said the services PMI would likely provide a boost to the pound.</p><p></p><p>\"The UK service sector PMI has surprised yet again in October with the headline number up at 62.5, well ahead of the 60.0 consensus and up from the 60.3 reading last month. The new business component is at its highest level since the series began in 1996 and taking all of the PMIs together the composite reading is suggesting that 4Q GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% – equivalent to around 6% annualised growth.</p><p></p><p>\"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics</strong>, said the services PMI had implications for the Bank of England.</p><p></p><p>\"The CIPS business surveys suggest that the UK economy got off to a very strong start in Q4. An improvement on Q3's 0.8% expansion would seem eminently possible.</p><p></p><p>\"Evidence of robust jobs growth strengthens the likelihood that next week's Bank of England Inflation Report will see the MPC bring forward the date at which it expects the unemployment rate to fall to the 7% threshold.</p><p></p><p>\"The strong survey data is also likely to support a rise in the MPC's forecast for GDP growth in 2013. Indeed, a weighted average of all three surveys points to quarterly GDP growth in Q4 perhaps exceeding 1.5%.</p><p></p><p>\"Admittedly, the surveys have recently presented a more upbeat picture of the economy than the official GDP estimates. But, with activity in the economy accelerating and the recovery remaining broad-based, an improvement on Q3's 0.8% quarterly expansion would seem to be on the cards.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421711293|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|593c1b1ce22d72fb0ec7ddc1528a35d1846f74c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's manufacturers enjoyed rising export demand and hired new workers in October, according to a survey.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report suggested export orders grew at their fastest pace in more than two years, although overall activity rose at a slightly softer pace.</p><p>Although manufacturing output remains well below the level enjoyed before the recession, it notched up its seventh straight month of improvement with a reading of 56.0. That was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and down slightly from 56.3 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.1 in a Reuters poll.</p><p>The survey follows the latest official data showing the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter. With households under pressure from stagnant wages and rising bills and prices, there have been questions over whether that pace of growth can be maintained in the consumer-dependent UK economy. But economists said manufacturing could help drive overall growth.</p><p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October, boding well for the strong pace of economic growth we saw in the second and third quarter being sustained into the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%.\"</p><p>But he also highlighted the challenges facing the government as it vows to shift economic dependence towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>\"Maintaining this solid expansion will be important if we are to see any real signs of the economy rebalancing, as manufacturing remains 9% smaller than its pre-crisis peak, while services have already closed the gap,\" added Dobson.</p><p>The survey suggested manufacturing employment rose for the sixth consecutive month as total new orders for the sector continued to rise. Within that, export orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2011 as companies reported growing demand from Asia, the US, mainland Europe, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.</p><p>EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, welcomed the export growth.</p><p>\"Manufacturers' focus on developing new products and services to support their expansion into new export markets is making a strong contribution to this trend,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley.</p><p>\"Buoyant output across all sectors and an upbeat view of demand at home and in overseas markets bodes well for a sustained recovery in the fourth quarter and into 2014. While we expect to see a mild contraction in output overall for 2013, we are forecasting growth to bounce back to over 2% next year.\"</p><p>Economists said the latest show of continued growth in the sector would probably boost market speculation that the Bank of England will have to raise borrowing costs from their current record low of 0.5% sooner than suggested.</p><p>\"With orders and production indices remaining firm, the PMI is consistent with an acceleration in GDP growth in the fourth quarter from the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate recorded in the third quarter, which should keep early rate hike expectations and sterling supported, particularly against the euro,\" said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421444015|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4f25d47c2dbaa1e867e9b3467ca5e0eae251ef8c -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life? report </a>on wellbeing from the OECD thinktank attempts to count the human cost of the global financial crisis. The wide-ranging report ranks countries on a range of criteria from housing and health to crime and social engagement.</p><p><strong>Income inequality</strong> was highest in Chile, Mexico and the Russian Federation – and lowest in Eastern European and Nordic countries. The UK's income inequality was above the OECD average and has risen over the last 15 years.</p><p></p><p><strong>Life satisfaction</strong> is highest in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. People in Hungary, Portugal and Greece report the lowest levels of life satisfaction. In the UK satisfaction rates are higher than before the crisis, with 64% British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives.</p><p></p><p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is highest in Switzerland followed by Italy, Japan and Spain.</p><p></p><p><strong>Work-life balance</strong> is deemed worst in Turkey, by far and away the country with the highest proportion of employees working very long hours. Mexico and Israel are next and the UK is also ahead of the OECD average. In the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare.</p><p></p><p><strong>Leisure time</strong> is highest in Norway and Denmark and lowest in France and Japan.</p><p></p><p><strong>Education</strong> is the UK's weakest area when compared with other OECD countries. The UK is only just above average for educational attainment and behind 19 other countries. It is below average for educational expectancy – the average duration of education a five-year-old can expect to get by the age of 39. Teenage students' average score in reading, mathematics and science in the UK is above average but behind 14 other countries, with Finland and Korea top. Numeracy and literacy levels among adults in the UK are below the OECD averages but ahead of those in the US.</p><p></p><p><strong>Health</strong> was again a stand-out area for Switzerland. In 2011, the percentage of adults reporting good or very good health was 85% or more in Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but only half as high in Korea and Portugal. Japan ranked last with only one in three respondents reporting being in \"good\" or \"very good\" health.</p><p></p><p><strong>Employment rates</strong> increase with education but some countries do better than others on offering equal job chances. Since 2000 the employment gap between people with tertiary education and people with below upper secondary education has remained stable on average in the OECD area. But it has increased substantially in Slovenia, the UK, Sweden, Iceland and Korea.</p><p></p><p><strong>Homicide rates</strong> are low in most countries and the OECD average is 2.23 homicides per 100,000 people. They are, however, more than twice as high in the United States and even higher in Mexico, Brazil and in the Russian Federation. Iceland, Japan and Norway are the least likely places to get murdered. Over the last 10 years Mexico's homicide rate has almost doubled.</p><p></p><p><strong>Housing conditions</strong> vary greatly between countries. In Canada, Belgium, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, households report on average two or more rooms per person. In Turkey, Hungary and Poland, however, people live in smaller houses with one room per person or less. The UK is above average on this.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social support networks</strong> appear to be weakest in Turkey, Mexico, Korea and Greece, and strongest in Iceland, Ireland, the UK and Switzerland.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707629|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|de5127a173c218724d0448fe14439abed2dec3cd -->",

Meggitt said it expected revenues to grow in the low single digits this year, down from its prediction in August of mid-single digit gains.</p><p>The company, which makes avionics and wheels for the likes of Airbus and Boeing, said trading in the four months to the middle of October had fallen slightly below expectations. It said:</p><p><blockquote>[This was] principally due to short term production difficulties at Meggitt Sensing Systems and the timing of contract wins and project milestones in one of our energy businesses.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>It said military revenues remained flat despite the US budget issues, but the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the second half also had an effect. But it identified a raw material supply issue dating back to 2012, involving replacing various parts over the next few years at a cost of £20m. Analyst Chris Dyett at Investec said:</p><p><blockquote>Meggitt's third quarter management statement is a disappointment, leading us to make pretax profit downgrades of around 7% for this year and next. Underlying trading is largely as expected, but a number of newly identified issues have impacted the second half and also 2014. In addition, a foreign exchange headwind has compounded the issues. Our new price target is 515p and we move to hold, expecting the stock to unwind part of the recent re-rating as well as reflecting the downgrade.<br /><br /></blockquote></p><p>RBS meanwhile is indeed down after its figures, the second biggest faller after Meggitt with a 12.9p or 3.5% decline to 354.7p. Barclays is also lower, down 7.75p at 255.85p. Both banks are among those being sued by US group Fannie Mae over the libor scandal.</p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 11.36 points at 6720.07 as investors continue to be concerned about the US Federal Reserve easing its bond buying programme after some recent upbeat data, albeit the central bank made no changes at its meeting earlier this week.</p><p>Better than expected Chinese PMI figures failed to lift the mining sector, with <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> down 4.5p at 3153.5p. Fears of Fed tapering outweighed the positive signs from China.</p><p>But <strong>Vodafone</strong> jumped 4.65p to 229.15p on renewed talk of possible bid interest from US group AT&amp;T, in the wake of the UK mobile group's sale of its stake in its American wireless joint venture to partner Verizon.</p><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares have recovered 12.5p to £20.89 in the wake of Thursday's disappointing figures, while <strong>BG</strong> has added 8p to 1281.5p.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421441247|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|fc5ab4232609fe27cc4f820816b817cee18dd782 -->",

It added that there were encouraging signs that the recovery would continue but said the legacy of Europe's debt crisis would continue to act as a brake on growth.</p><p>Only in 2015, when growth is expected to increase to 1.7%, does the commission see a dent being made in the jobless total, with unemployment predicted to drop to 11.8%.</p><p>Olli Rehn, the commission's vice-president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said: \"There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point. The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery.</p><p>\"But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy, for sustainable growth and job creation.\"</p><p>The commission, publishing forecasts three times a year for the eurozone and the EU, stresses that the return to solid growth in the countries that belong to the monetary union is set to be gradual, with big differences in economic performance across member states. Financial markets believe the combination of sluggish growth, high unemployment and the threat of deflation will prompt the European Central Bank into fresh efforts to boost activity.</p><p>Of the bigger euro area countries, only Germany is forecast to grow by more than 1% in 2014. Spain is expected to expand by 0.5%, Italy by 0.7% and France by 0.9%.</p><p>By contrast, the commission said the outlook for the UK – which has exceeded expectations in 2013 – was \"quite bright\". Growth of 2.2% is pencilled in for 2014, rising to 2.4% in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702308|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|038742110316dd01cfe3ddd01a01807e70f6ade0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Three times more young women are employed in low-paid, low-skilled jobs than 20 years ago, according to a new study.</p><p>The TUC said the proportion of 16 to 24-year-old women in jobs such as office and hotel cleaning has increased from 7% to 21%, while the figure for young men has increased from 14% to 25%.</p><p>The research also showed that gender plays a huge part in career choice, with only 1% of women working in skilled trades compared with a fifth of young men.</p><p>Four times as many young women worked in occupations such as hairdressing, leisure and travel, said the report.</p><p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"The youth labour market has become a much harsher place for young people over the past 20 years, especially for young women.</p><p>\"While there has been a welcome rise in the number of females gaining qualifications, many still find themselves trapped in low-skill, low-wage jobs.</p><p>\"This is because there are fewer good jobs out there and because young women are still being channelled down 'traditional' routes.</p><p>\"Unless we create better training and employment opportunities for young people, as well as challenging gender roles from the outset, the situation will not improve. We need to invest in new industries to create decent jobs and provide better early years careers support.\"</p><p>Katy Jones from the Work Foundation, which conducted the study, said: \"The gender gap starts early in working lives and is particularly striking in the lower half of the labour market. Young women tend to start work and remain in sectors with lower pay and fewer prospects.</p><p>\"Unemployment for both young men and women remains at crisis levels. While it is higher for young men, young women are more likely to quit an active job search and move into inactivity from unemployment.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421438332|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|d20b90e405fd4cd9b84234761f5f5504fd193fee -->",

        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland received stinging criticism on Friday for turning away too many small business customers as a result of overly strict lending criteria and a complex management structure.</p><p>The 81% taxpayer-owned bank failed to meet its own goals for lending to small businesses – regarded as a potential engine of growth for the economy – and has been too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty, according to the report by Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England.</p><p>Outlining nine recommendations, Large suggests the bank conduct a forensic inquiry into the way it has treated customers in distress. He also says it should  create more coherent and realistic targets for lending to the small and medium-size enterprise (SME) sector.</p><p>Ross McEwan, presenting his first set of results since being promoted to chief executive, said: \"The picture Sir Andrew Large paints is not an entirely comfortable one, but it's one we have to confront. A successful, vibrant and well-regarded SME bank is central to the overall value and reputation of this company.\"</p><p>McEwan said he was conducting a review of the bank and would report back in February. In the meantime the bank is to write to customers and speed up the time it takes to grant loans after Large said the bank should give staff more confidence to lend.</p><p>Large said one person should be put in charge of the SME business, which is currently split across the business bank, the non-core division, the 315 branches that must be sold off to meet EU rules and a division  which looks after financially stretched customers.</p><p>The bank has faced repeated criticism over its lending to SMEs. The report said RBS had been losing market share – from 42% of net lending in the months before its 2008 bailout to 27% five years later – after reducing the period of time over which it was prepared to lend. It added that \"risk aversion\" among its bankers meant credit-worthy customers were turned away.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the bank following repeated criticism from politicians and small businesses bosses, said RBS's stock of lending has continued to fall this year, by £1.8bn in the first half, when rivals were expanding their SME lending.</p><p>\"RBS should look afresh at the manner in which it delivers lending to SMEs and make sure that the various components of its offering to customers are aligned,\" said Large.</p><p>RBS's lending before the 2008 crash was unsustainable when it reached £55bn but it then fell too quickly to £38bn. The bank had been trying to reduce its exposure to commercial property lending but as a result had turned away creditworthy customers.</p><p>\"The bank failed to meet its own SME lending targets, partly because they were unrealistic and also because of weakness in its lending operations,\" Large said.</p><p>Until 2012, the RBS small business bankers had been focused on gathering deposits and worrying about risk rather than issuing new loans. The processes inside the bank meant that credit controllers were turning away applications too quickly.</p><p>The report said RBS had been more active than its rivals in renegotiating loans after the crisis. \"RBS has also changed the way it manages its relationship with customers that it believes have shown signs of financial deterioration or distress. A small minority of customers who have experienced this have made serious allegations about the actions that RBS has taken,\" the report said.</p><p>The inquiry needed to substantiate or refute these allegations, the report said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421424810|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|5f018c5765a0d76f9b564ef1bd96476cbcfb1601 -->",

        "body":"<p>It conjures up those blissful, carefree days when Things Could Only Get Better, and the name Lehman Brothers meant nothing to anyone in Britain outside a tiny cadre of City workers: according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\" title=\"\">the latest survey of the services sector</a>, its companies are now more optimistic than at any time since 1997.</p><p>If this latest survey is to be believed, the services sector – long the engine of our out-of-kilter economy – is booming. Whether it has been the Funding for Lending scheme prising open the banks' purse strings; the housing recovery helping to tempt shoppers back into the spending habit; or the halt to doom-laden headlines about the imminent collapse of the eurozone, confidence appears to have flooded back.</p><p>Some of this new euphoria must be froth: there's a bad-tempered argument raging between City economists about how much the latest run of Panglossian survey results can be believed.</p><p>But something has clearly happened to unleash the \"animal spirits\" that can power economic growth, by prompting firms to ramp up production, invest in new equipment and - hopefully - hire new staff.</p><p>GDP may not be expanding at the boomy 1.3%-per-quarter rate that would be suggested by a direct read-across from the PMIs; but it does seem to be accelerating.</p><p>There is a clear risk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">highlighted once again by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday</a>, that this is the \"wrong sort of growth\": too dependent on consumers running down their savings – and indeed, as the Bank of England has suggested, starting to borrow again against the rising value of their homes.</p><p>Much will turn on firms' behaviour: no one quite knows how much they could crank up output using their existing workforce, without resorting to bringing in new workers or bidding up wages.</p><p>The shortfall in business investment, and the relentless squeeze on wages, which in turn deadens consumer demand, have been key factors in holding back the recovery since 2009.</p><p>NIESR believes it will be 2019 before real wages return to their pre-recession levels. That could mean that sluggish wage growth and a stagnating jobs market eventually call a halt to both the housing upturn and the closely related consumer recovery.</p><p>However, it is likely to be many months before we know whether this period of running on air is giving the economy a leg-up towards more solid, sustainable growth, or laying the foundations for a future crisis. Meanwhile, there will be plenty more sunny-sounding surveys to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699953|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|c567ec9aee2ee31d8e0e5d483bcfdbc144d3c21b -->",

        "headline":"RBS places troublesome assets worth £38bn in internal 'bad bank'",
        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Friday that it would make a substantial loss this year after its new chief executive, Ross McEwan, announced £38bn of troublesome assets would be ringfenced inside the bailed out bank.</p><p>In a move that was seen as an attempt to restore the often strained relationships with the government and regulators, McEwan also made clear he wanted to draw a line under lingering concerns about the bank's capital position. On a number of occasions he talked about \"resetting\" relationships with the Treasury and the Bank of England.</p><p>Chancellor George Osborne was in the main London office of RBS as the figures were released and conceded that any sell-off of the shares was unlikely before the election. McEwan said he wanted to move away from the \"weariness\" and \"defensiveness\" that had crept into RBS.</p><p>McEwan acknowledged the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/rbs-business-lending-attacked\" title=\"\">stinging criticism contained in a report into the bank's lending practices</a>, which found it was turning away three out of every four applications for business loans from small and medium-sized businesses and was too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty. McEwan said that while the report made uncomfortable reading, the bank had to confront the problem.</p><p>The review into creating a bad bank – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/osborne-lloyds-rbs-sell-off\" title=\"\">commissioned by Osborne after his Mansion House speech in June</a> – had concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". Investment bank Rothschild, which conducted the review recommended by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said it would \"do more harm than good\".</p><p>Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sat on the commission, tweeted: \"So RBS will have an internal bad bank, as it has had for five years.\"</p><p>RBS shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.5% at 355p – well below the 500p average price the taxpayer paid for them – after the bank reported a third-quarter loss of more than £600m.</p><p>Osborne, who through UK Financial Investments owns 81% of RBS, said the bailed-out bank was on a \"new direction\". A Treasury report showed RBS would become more UK-focused with an even smaller investment bank – which employed 25,000 staff before the bailout but now employs 10,900. Osborne said the bank should not be involved in \"speculating and punting on the markets\".</p><p>Instead of the bad bank, which the taxpayer would have had to fund, about £38bn of troublesome loans – including £9bn from Ulster Bank – will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which will aims to be wound down in two years. Some £11bn of capital should be released as a result.</p><p>McEwan – who said he wanted to \"reset the key relationships\" with government and regulators – will accelerate the spin-off of RBS's US arm, Citizens, to next year rather than 2015 and signalled a review of a large number of businesses, the outcome of which will be announced in February. Ulster Bank is likely to remain part of RBS Group.</p><p>The New Zealander, who has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/rbs-ross-mcewan-stephen-hester\" title=\"\">chief executive since 1 October</a>, would not comment on the potential impact on jobs as he discussed the need to cut costs.</p><p>Creating the new non-core division would mean the bank has to write off up to £4.5bn of problem loans in the next year – driving the bank to a \"substantial loss\" for the full year.</p><p>Despite the warning of losses, Osborne said: \"Today RBS sets out a new direction – a new direction that will lead it to being a boost to the British economy instead of a burden. This is part of our economic plan for sustaining the economic recovery and creating a banking system that works for Britain.\" He conceded though that a sale of the government's stake was unlikely to happen before the next election.</p><p>The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of £250m – taking its total bill so far to £2.65bn and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. McEwan would not comment on reports two traders had been suspended.</p><p>McEwan said the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority was preparing to ask banks to hold more capital and so RBS was acting in a \"pro-active manner\". The Bank of England had found RBS would have had a £13.5bn capital shortfall at the end of December 2013, which is why it taking steps to bolster its financial strength.</p><p>The review into a possible bad bank had been conducted with the regulator. \"The good bank/bad bank review has from the start been carried out in conjunction with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). This has allowed us to address our shared objective of identifying ways in which to strengthen the capital position of the bank, speed up the recovery in our core UK businesses and accelerate the path to privatisation,\" McEwan said.</p><p>RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends – when it could afford them – to the government before its other shareholders.</p><p>McEwan's own review into the business will be unveiled in February and will cover customer-facing businesses, IT and operations and decision-making structures.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421434497|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda1cbca0e5a987b9b9f9dee60ca911fc46d0d0b -->",

        "body":"<p>UK authorities have acted to give more power to minority investors in listed companies dominated by a controlling shareholder.</p><p>There have been concerns about the likes of ENRC and Bumi, controlled by various tycoons and subsequently caught up in rows about corporate governance.</p><p>Now the Financial Conduct Authority has announced <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/cp13-15-enhancing-the-effectiveness-of-the-listing-regime\" title=\"\">it is strengthening the listing rules for top companies</a> to give minority shareholders additional voting rights and greater influence over key decisions. David Lawton, the FCA's director of markets, said:</p><p><blockquote>Active engagement by all shareholders is essential to make markets work well. By safeguarding minority interests from abuse by controlling shareholders, these changes will promote market integrity and empower minority shareholders to hold the companies they invest in to account.<br /></blockquote></p><p>After months of consultations, the FCA believes it has addressed concerns about controlling shareholders without turning minority protection into minority control. The proposals include:</p><p><em>• Ensuring listed companies are run independently of their controlling shareholders, including measures that give independent shareholders a veto over transactions between listed companies and a controlling shareholder when this independence is threatened.</em></p><p><em>• Requiring separate approval of independent directors by independent shareholders, in addition to gaining approval from shareholders as a whole.</em></p><p></p><p><em>• Enhanced voting power for minority shareholders where a company with a controlling shareholder seeks to cancel its listing or remove minority shareholders' rights. </em></p><p></p><p><em>• Requiring greater transparency for listed companies to ensure shareholders have the information they need to exercise their voting rights. </em></p><p></p><p>The City is expected to be relieved at the FCA decision following the consulation, said Richard Weaver at PWC. He said:</p><p><blockquote>The City will largely breathe a sigh of relief that the FCA has resisted calls to significantly increase the current free float requirement of 25% of shares to be held in public hands, allaying concerns that such an increase could seriously threaten the attractiveness of UK capital markets.<br /><br />Some of the proposed rules, such as the requirement for a formal agreement with the controlling shareholder, may be little more than the codification of existing practice in many cases and hence may not  be especially onerous.<br /><br />The consequences of other rule changes such as the appointment of independent directors involving a separate vote by minority shareholders are more difficult to anticipate and we will need to see how they operate in practice.</blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699386|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|d3820c2d0965402313d1945a89019dac4b24d641 -->",

        "headline":"UK a great place to live and work, says OECD",
        "body":"<p>The UK is one of best places to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007.</p><p>The Paris-based thinktank has been seeking to measure wellbeing for the 34 nations of the OECD, based on aspects of life such as incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills.</p><p>That puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the latest work for the OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Better Life Index</a>.</p><p>The thinktank's &quot;traffic light&quot; system for how countries perform on various elements ranks the US, Ireland, Germany and France as average. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance.</p><p>Overall, the latest part of the OECD's attempt to find new ways to measure wellbeing beyond simple GDP numbers, paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis.</p><p>&quot;This report is a wake-up call to us all,&quot; said the OECD secretary-general, Angel Gurr&iacute;a.</p><p>&quot;It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making.&quot;</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life 2013</a> report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severely hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><p>Its analysis of the crisis suggested new forms of solidarity and engagement emerged in the countries that were hardest hit. This trend was less clear cut in the UK, however. The percentage of people reporting having helped someone decreased by 3 percentage points while the share of people reporting having volunteered their time increased by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>When it comes to education and job prospects the UK lags behind. On average the employment gap between those people in OECD countries with tertiary education and those with below upper secondary education had remained stable since 2000. But in the UK the gap had widened &quot;substantially&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bbf4bad794c314e2698636d8c99a30321583d36 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's manufacturers enjoyed rising export demand and hired new workers in October, according to a survey.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report suggested export orders grew at their fastest pace in more than two years, although overall activity rose at a slightly softer pace.</p><p>Although manufacturing output remains well below the level enjoyed before the recession, it notched up its seventh straight month of improvement with a reading of 56.0. That was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and down slightly from 56.3 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.1 in a Reuters poll.</p><p>The survey follows the latest official data showing the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter. With households under pressure from stagnant wages and rising bills and prices, there have been questions over whether that pace of growth can be maintained in the consumer-dependent UK economy. But economists said manufacturing could help drive overall growth.</p><p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October, boding well for the strong pace of economic growth we saw in the second and third quarter being sustained into the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%.\"</p><p>But he also highlighted the challenges facing the government as it vows to shift economic dependence towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>\"Maintaining this solid expansion will be important if we are to see any real signs of the economy rebalancing, as manufacturing remains 9% smaller than its pre-crisis peak, while services have already closed the gap,\" added Dobson.</p><p>The survey suggested manufacturing employment rose for the sixth consecutive month as total new orders for the sector continued to rise. Within that, export orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2011 as companies reported growing demand from Asia, the US, mainland Europe, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.</p><p>EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, welcomed the export growth.</p><p>\"Manufacturers' focus on developing new products and services to support their expansion into new export markets is making a strong contribution to this trend,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley.</p><p>\"Buoyant output across all sectors and an upbeat view of demand at home and in overseas markets bodes well for a sustained recovery in the fourth quarter and into 2014. While we expect to see a mild contraction in output overall for 2013, we are forecasting growth to bounce back to over 2% next year.\"</p><p>Economists said the latest show of continued growth in the sector would probably boost market speculation that the Bank of England will have to raise borrowing costs from their current record low of 0.5% sooner than suggested.</p><p>\"With orders and production indices remaining firm, the PMI is consistent with an acceleration in GDP growth in the fourth quarter from the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate recorded in the third quarter, which should keep early rate hike expectations and sterling supported, particularly against the euro,\" said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421444015|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4f25d47c2dbaa1e867e9b3467ca5e0eae251ef8c -->",

        "body":"<p>Shares in pharmaceuticals group <strong>Shire</strong> have hit an all time high after news one of its drugs was successful in treating binge eating.</p><p>The company said Vyvanse, used in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had proved superior to a placebo in reducing binge eating in two late stage trials. It now plans to submit an application to US regulator the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug by the third quarter of next year. Chief executive Flemming Omskov said:</p><p><blockquote><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Binge-eating/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">Binge eating disorder</a> is a condition for which there is no currently approved pharmacologic treatment and yet there is a significant unmet patient need, as was demonstrated with the faster than expected enrolment of participants in our clinical trial programme.<br /><br />Our development of Vyvanse for [the disorder] also aligns well with Shire's growth strategy of developing innovative treatments to address significant unmet patient needs.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The disorder was officially recognised as a psychiatric disorder in the US in May, affecting 2.8% of adults in their lifetime. Shire added:</p><p><blockquote>[It] is characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating, feeling out of control while binging, and feeling guilt and shame afterward.<br /></blockquote></p><p>With positive updates on other treatments in its pipeline, Shire's shares climbed to a record £28.92 before slipping back to £28.71, still 51p higher on the day so far. Brian White at Shore Capital issued a buy note, saying:</p><p><blockquote>Reassuringly the safety for Vyvanse in these two studies appears to be generally consistent with the known profile established in studies in adults with ADHD.<br /><br />Our Shire model includes risk adjusted forecasts for Vyvanse in binge eating disorder with the first revenues ($50m) expected for 2015, in line with current filing timelines. Although with positive phase 3 data we can foresee the potential for off label prescribing of Vyvanse by physicians in the disorder to begin ahead of regulatory approval.<br /></blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421690640|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|5f164903b52800d47a92fe56539c694dee3241df -->",

We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making.&quot;</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life 2013</a> report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severely hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><p>Its analysis of the crisis suggested new forms of solidarity and engagement emerged in the countries that were hardest hit. This trend was less clear cut in the UK, however. The percentage of people reporting having helped someone decreased by 3 percentage points while the share of people reporting having volunteered their time increased by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>When it comes to education and job prospects the UK lags behind. On average the employment gap between those people in OECD countries with tertiary education and those with below upper secondary education had remained stable since 2000. But in the UK the gap had widened &quot;substantially&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bbf4bad794c314e2698636d8c99a30321583d36 -->",

Basic rate taxpayers pay 18% of the profits, while higher rate payers hand over 28%.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Treasury or HM Revenue &amp; Customs would comment on the reported change, which Sky suggested would be introduced in December's autumn statement.</p><p></p><p>Recent months have seen a boom in the London property market, with prices rising by about 10% year-on-year and reports of bidding wars for homes in some of the most sought-after neighbourhoods.</p><p></p><p>An influx of overseas investors seeking a safe haven for their money has been blamed for helping to push prices out of the reach of \"normal\" Londoners, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/20/london-new-york-times-foreign-rich-property\" title=\"Future of London: the New York Times on the foreign rich buying up property\">a writer from the New York Times recently describing the capital's property as \"a global reserve currency for the super elite\"</a>.</p><p></p><p>The UK's property taxation system has been cited as a reason for its appeal, and there have been calls for the government to apply more taxes to the country's richest homebuyers.</p><p></p><p>In 2012's budget, the chancellor introduced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-stamp-duty-raised\" title=\"Budget 2012: stamp duty on 2m homes raised to 7%\">7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m</a> and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</p><p></p><p>The Liberal Democrats have repeatedly called for a mansion tax on homes costing more than £2m, but critics suggest this may have more of an impact on domestic homeowners who have owned properties for many years than on overseas buyers.</p><p></p><p>Yolanda Barnes, director of residential research at upmarket estate agency Savills, said bringing CGT rules in line for overseas buyers was \"a sensible move\" and unlikely to deter overseas money from coming to London.</p><p></p><p>\"I don't think it will put many people off at all. It is a relatively modest tax paid only on gains – and if it erodes the case for a mansion tax it could boost the market,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>Barnes said Savills' research suggested that investors from outside the UK were buying properties to let and holding them for the long term.</p><p></p><p>\"People aren't speculating here; they're not flipping properties – foreigners are holding homes for longer than UK sellers,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>Ed Mead of estate agency Douglas &amp; Gordon said the policy would be \"difficult to police\" as the government could struggle to ascertain whether overseas buyers were investors or residing full time in the property.</p><p></p><p>He agreed that it was unlikely to put many people off: \"It's not a draconion move – London will still be a much more attractive and easier place to buy property than many other cities around the world.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421362915|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|3aa9675775623743abb5d73638fd746a0d8c51c9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's services sector enjoyed its strongest growth since 1997 as new business flowed in at a record pace last month, according to the latest survey to suggest the recovery is strengthening.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK services PMI beat City forecasts to jump to a headline activity reading of 62.5 in October, from 60.6 in September. The forecast was for a slight slowdown to 59.8.</p><p>The index for new work was the highest since records began in 1996 and companies took on new staff at the fastest pace since 1997, according to the survey of a range of businesses in Britain's dominant service sector such as transport, IT and restaurants.</p><p>The report follows upbeat news in recent days on the smaller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/uk-construction-output-property-market\" title=\"\">construction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/uk-manufacturing-demand-exports-employment-pmi\" title=\"\">manufacturing</a> sectors in sister PMI surveys and is likely to raise expectations that the UK economy can keep up its recent pace of growth.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, said the reports suggested growth would accelerate further in the final quarter of this year.</p><p>\"The UK economic recovery moved up a gear again in October, with the PMIs indicating record growth of output and employment,\" he said.</p><p>\"Historical comparisons of the PMI against gross domestic product suggest the latest survey data are consistent with a 1.3% quarterly rate of GDP growth, up sharply from previous quarters.\"</p><p>The latest official data put GDP growth at 0.8% in the third quarter. Some economists have questioned whether that can be matched in the final months of the year, especially given the pressures on consumers from soaring bills and slow pay growth.</p><p>But Markit suggested that pressures on consumers from the tough labour market were easing with the surveys signalling the private sector is creating more than 100,000 jobs per quarter.</p><p>Economists said the recent run of mostly upbeat indicators would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise its outlook for growth when it publishes its latest forecasts next week.</p><p>James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said the survey cast doubt over the Bank's outlook for unemployment. Policymakers have said that they will not raise interest rates from their record low at least until the jobless rate falls to 7%, barring various knock-out clauses being triggered.</p><p>\"Taking all of the PMIs together, the composite reading is suggesting that fourth quarter GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% - equivalent to around 6% annualised growth,\" said Knightley.</p><p>\"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\"</p><p>But Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, questioned how much markets and policymakers should read into Tuesday's report.</p><p>\"The survey feels a bit frothy,\" he said.</p><p>\"No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\"</p><p>Experts have also questioned the sustainability of the UK's recovery, arguing the government's much espoused rebalancing towards manufacturing and exports is a long way off.</p><p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said on Tuesday that while it expects growth to pick up from 1.4% this year to 2% in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421689020|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|9568e276b62d8d0b709553995aab54be4da0ee57 -->",

        "headline":"British energy suppliers' explanations for price hikes just don't add up",
        "body":"<p>Compare and contrast. In the euro area, falling energy prices are cited as one of the reasons why the annual inflation rate has dropped to a four-year low of 0.7%. Energy bills in the 17-nation single currency zone were 1.7% lower in September than they were a year earlier, continuing a downward trend in recent months.</p><p>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics says that the average consumer could expect to pay 8% more for both gas and electricity in September than a year earlier. Fuel makes up only 5% of the average family's weekly spending (rather more for those on lower incomes) but as the ONS pointed out earlier this week, rising gas and electricity bills are having a dampening impact on the economy because households have less left over at the end of the month for discretionary spending.</p><p>So what's going on? When pressed to explain why they are raising domestic energy tariffs by 10%, the Big Six energy companies tend to say either that they are being forced to pass on green levies to their customers, that they are being forced to pay more for fuel on the world's wholesale energy markets or that above-inflation increases are needed for investment in new capacity.</p><p>Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Ovo energy, blew the gaff on the \"it's all down to global forces\" explanation when giving evidence to a parliamentary committee this week, noting that wholesale prices have been going down not up. This is now underlined by the data from Eurostat, which shows that across the Channel these lower wholesale prices are being reflected in lower bills to consumers and falling inflation.</p><p>Green levies, which make up just 9% of the average energy bill, could not possibly explain such a disparity. Nor could movements in the pound, since sterling has moved slightly higher on the foreign exchanges this year. All of which means that the energy companies had better get started on building all the new power plants they have been promising.

        "body":"<p>It conjures up those blissful, carefree days when Things Could Only Get Better, and the name Lehman Brothers meant nothing to anyone in Britain outside a tiny cadre of City workers: according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\" title=\"\">the latest survey of the services sector</a>, its companies are now more optimistic than at any time since 1997.</p><p>If this latest survey is to be believed, the services sector – long the engine of our out-of-kilter economy – is booming. Whether it has been the Funding for Lending scheme prising open the banks' purse strings; the housing recovery helping to tempt shoppers back into the spending habit; or the halt to doom-laden headlines about the imminent collapse of the eurozone, confidence appears to have flooded back.</p><p>Some of this new euphoria must be froth: there's a bad-tempered argument raging between City economists about how much the latest run of Panglossian survey results can be believed.</p><p>But something has clearly happened to unleash the \"animal spirits\" that can power economic growth, by prompting firms to ramp up production, invest in new equipment and - hopefully - hire new staff.</p><p>GDP may not be expanding at the boomy 1.3%-per-quarter rate that would be suggested by a direct read-across from the PMIs; but it does seem to be accelerating.</p><p>There is a clear risk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">highlighted once again by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday</a>, that this is the \"wrong sort of growth\": too dependent on consumers running down their savings – and indeed, as the Bank of England has suggested, starting to borrow again against the rising value of their homes.</p><p>Much will turn on firms' behaviour: no one quite knows how much they could crank up output using their existing workforce, without resorting to bringing in new workers or bidding up wages.</p><p>The shortfall in business investment, and the relentless squeeze on wages, which in turn deadens consumer demand, have been key factors in holding back the recovery since 2009.</p><p>NIESR believes it will be 2019 before real wages return to their pre-recession levels. That could mean that sluggish wage growth and a stagnating jobs market eventually call a halt to both the housing upturn and the closely related consumer recovery.</p><p>However, it is likely to be many months before we know whether this period of running on air is giving the economy a leg-up towards more solid, sustainable growth, or laying the foundations for a future crisis. Meanwhile, there will be plenty more sunny-sounding surveys to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699953|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|c567ec9aee2ee31d8e0e5d483bcfdbc144d3c21b -->",

        "body":"<p>The European commission is warning that it is too early to claim victory in the euro area's fight against recession after its latest forecasts showed it would be 2015 before weak growth generated a fall in the jobless total.</p><p>Although the 17-nation single currency zone started to expand in the summer after a six-quarter double-dip recession, Brussels said there will be a lag before the pickup in activity leads to a fall in unemployment.</p><p>The commission trimmed its growth forecast for the euro area in 2014 from 1.2% to 1.1% and said unemployment will remain stuck at a record 12.2% next year. It added that there were encouraging signs that the recovery would continue but said the legacy of Europe's debt crisis would continue to act as a brake on growth.</p><p>Only in 2015, when growth is expected to increase to 1.7%, does the commission see a dent being made in the jobless total, with unemployment predicted to drop to 11.8%.</p><p>Olli Rehn, the commission's vice-president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said: \"There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point. The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery.</p><p>\"But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy, for sustainable growth and job creation.\"</p><p>The commission, publishing forecasts three times a year for the eurozone and the EU, stresses that the return to solid growth in the countries that belong to the monetary union is set to be gradual, with big differences in economic performance across member states. Financial markets believe the combination of sluggish growth, high unemployment and the threat of deflation will prompt the European Central Bank into fresh efforts to boost activity.</p><p>Of the bigger euro area countries, only Germany is forecast to grow by more than 1% in 2014. Spain is expected to expand by 0.5%, Italy by 0.7% and France by 0.9%.</p><p>By contrast, the commission said the outlook for the UK – which has exceeded expectations in 2013 – was \"quite bright\". Growth of 2.2% is pencilled in for 2014, rising to 2.4% in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702308|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|1f8bfac2f53964f75062a196aa4023e4ab1c7ab4 -->",

        "body":"<p>BT's multimillion-pound venture into sports broadcasting has rekindled its consumer business, with 2 million viewers now signed up to the BT Sport channels.</p><p>Revenues from consumer sales are up 4% in the September quarter, the best performance for 10 years, and BT's television service has added 70,000 subscribers, more than in any quarter since 2008. A further 156,000 customers signed for broadband, meaning BT grabbed the lion's share of new internet subscribers in the quarter.</p><p>BT is spending an estimated £1.5bn over three years on premier league football rights, big name presenters Jake Humphries and Clare Balding and lavish television studios in the former Olympic park, in an effort to stop the leakage of customers to rivals Sky and TalkTalk.</p><p>The loss of customers with a BT telephone line – a key measure of defections from the company – fell to 65,000 for the quarter, the best performance in five years. The telecoms firm beat City forecasts to report revenues flat at £4,491m, comfortably outstripping the consensus forecast of £4,440m, while profit before tax was also ahead at £499m.</p><p>\"BT Sport has made a confident start and is already delivering for viewers,\" said chief executive Gavin Patterson, presenting his first financial results since taking over from Ian Livingston. \"More than 2 million of our customers are signed up to it and our wholesale contract with Virgin Media means it is available to around four million homes in total.\"</p><p>BT now has 900,000 television customers – still some way behind Virgin's 3.8m and Sky's 10.5m. But its broadband and TV signings were ahead of Sky for September – the satellite broadcaster added 111,000 broadband customers and 37,000 to its television service.</p><p>Jerry Dellis, an analyst at Jefferies bank, said fears Sky had successfully countered the impact of BT Sport by giving away broadband free to TV subscribers had been overblown. \"Robust broadband net adds from BSkyB … had raised some concern that BT's heavy investment in TV might be having rather limited initial impact at stemming the loss of retail lines within the BT base. In fact BT Retail KPIs are quite encouraging.\"</p><p>BT increased its interim dividend by 13% to 3.4 pence per share, and investors bumped the stock up 6.5p to 376p in early trading before the shares fell back to 372p.</p><p>Days after its August launch, BT Sport reached  1 million direct subscribers. That number has now doubled to 2 million. More than half are Sky subscribers watching via satellite, while others are viewing the programmes online or via the BT Sport app.</p><p>Following a deal signed a £75m a year deal with Virgin Media, which is offering the channels free to the 2 million customers who are already signed up to its most expensive TV package, the BT channels now have a potential audience of 4 million.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421350551|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|8cee54e751b6562882d33539d9f631108be814ae -->",

The second quarter decline was 1.3%, only a slight slowdown on the first quarter fall of 1.6%, despite the much-vaunted new clothing range.</p><p>This was in the stores for three weeks of the first half and Bolland said it had been well received by customers.

        "headline":"Bill Adderley unmasked as Marks &amp; Spencer's biggest private shareholder",
        "body":"<p>Bill Adderley, the billionaire founder of the homeware chain Dunelm, has secretly built a near £250m stake in Marks &amp; Spencer, it has emerged.</p><p>The entrepreneur acquired the shares during the past 18 months, a period in which the M&amp;S share price has risen by almost 40%.</p><p>The disclosure, triggered by stock market rules that unmask shareholders who own more than 3% of a company, revealed Adderley as M&amp;S's largest private shareholder. He will receive dividends on his stake of more than £8m a year.</p><p>An M&amp;S insider said: \"We do know him and have met him, being as he has been our largest private shareholder for some time. It was a small purchase [that took Adderley over the 3% disclosure threshold] so this has not come out of the blue.\"</p><p>Adderley founded Dunelm on a Leicester market stall with his wife Jean in 1979 after leaving his job as manager of Woolworths in the city, eventually floating the business on the stock exchange.</p><p>The business is now worth about £1.8bn and boasts more than 100 stores making sales of £677m and profits of £108m. It is still majority owned by the Adderley family, who live near Uppingham, Rutland, and are collectively worth £1.1bn, according to the 2013 Sunday Times Rich List. Shares in Dunelm have more than doubled since the financial crisis and risen by about 30% during 2013.</p><p>Adderley, who has avoided the public spotlight, was not available to comment but sources close to the family suggested he had merely spotted an investment opportunity and taken it. When asked if he was planning to lead a consortium to bid for control of M&amp;S, the source said: \"This would be an extraordinarily clumsy way of going about it.\"</p><p>The news that M&amp;S has attracted such a large private shareholder comes at a propitious time for the retailer, which has struggled to impress the City under the leadership of chief executive Marc Bolland.</p><p>The Dutchman is in the final year of a three-year, £2.3bn plan designed to address decades of under-investment. His efforts were insufficient to prevent clothing sales falling for eight straight quarters, although this week it emerged that M&amp;S has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/marks-and-spencer-clothing-sales\" title=\"\">stemmed the erosion of its share of the clothing market</a> – albeit while suffering continued declines in its share of the women's clothing market. It is due to report its half-year figures next week.</p><p>Efforts to repair flagging clothing sales and pull in younger shoppers have also been knocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/20/marks-and-spencer-womenswear-executive-clothing-sales\" title=\"\">imminent departure of Gillian Ridley Whittle</a>, development and buying director for womenswear, which was announced last week.</p><p>Next week M&amp;S is expected to report a 1.5% fall in underlying sales of general merchandise – a category mainly made up of clothing – for the six months to the end of September. That would be on a par with the 1.6% slide reported in the three months to the end of June. Some analysts have downgraded their sales expectations amid unseasonably warm autumn weather.</p><p>The retailer is also launching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/30/marks-and-spencer-christmas-advert-launch\" title=\"\">its Alice in Wonderland-inspired Christmas adverts</a>, featuring actor Helena Bonham Carter and models David Gandy and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.</p><p>M&amp;S shares added 2.09% yesterday to close at 503.5p. Adderley's 48.5m shares are therefore worth £244m.</p><p>City analysts have a mixed view on the shares. Of the 23 following the company, 11 rate the shares as a buy, seven as a sell, while five are neutral, according to the financial website Digital Look.</p><p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst in London, told Bloomberg: \"He's brave to take such a big punt on an M&amp;S recovery.\"</p><p>Recent M&amp;S successes have included its food business - Bolland's area of expertise, having joined from the grocer Morrisons - that has enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters of underlying sales growth and contributes 54% of group sales. Meanwhile, online sales growth is running ahead of the market and solid progress has been made overseas.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421399765|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda0e0b4a0530a9892cbcdcd292b9caf021aa0a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Bank of England has admitted to an error in its data and said consumer borrowing has been growing at its fastest rate since before the financial crisis five years ago.</p><p>The Bank said on Thursday that net unsecured lending to consumers – overdrafts, personal loans and credit cards – rose by £864m last month, the biggest increase since December and more than double the £411m figure it first reported.</p><p>The jump meant unsecured lending in the three months to September increased by 5.8% on an annual basis, the strongest growth since April 2008.</p><p>The surge in borrowing will raise concerns that Britain is relying on a debt-fuelled recovery at a time when policymakers have repeatedly stressed the need to rebalance the UK economy away from spending and towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"There is an amber warning light here – not an immediate risk but a medium-term financial stability concern. The notion that we have gone through a full deleveraging cycle is abject nonsense.\"</p><p>On Thursday, new data showed UK consumer confidence has risen to its highest level for six years despite the ongoing squeeze on disposable incomes. While levels of confidence lag those reported in Germany, Australia and the US, and a degree of pessimism remains, confidence has grown at a faster rate in the UK than in most European countries, according to figures from the market research firm Nielsen.</p><p>Its survey of more than 30,000 online consumers in 60 countries found those in the UK rated their confidence at 87 in the three months to the end of September, with levels above 100 indicating optimism and below pessimism. German confidence stands at 92 and the US at 98, France stands at 61 and Portugal and Spain at 55 and 56 respectively.</p><p>Chris Morley, managing director of Nielsen in the UK and Ireland, said British consumers had coped with rising household costs and falling real-term wages by shopping carefully and hunting bargains.</p><p>He added: \"Throughout this period, British consumer confidence remained stubbornly weak, but in recent months it has finally taken an upward turn as the green shoots of economic recovery start to show.\"</p><p>Positive news on the UK housing market has boosted sentiment. But Nielsen also revealed a growing perception that the economic downturn in Britain is over.</p><p>With a move towards optimism, the proportion saying they were willing to spend crept up five percentage points to 39%.</p><p>Utility bills are now by far the biggest concern for people living in the UK. Energy and water bills were highlighted as a top concern by 31% of those questioned, compared with 27% a year ago as several of the major gas and electricity providers have raised prices in recent weeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421397912|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|aaea5cc73d55a69a852ba8a20866757a4a5f67cb -->",

        "body":"<p>Nearly a decade after the closure of its last US factory, Apple is to create 2,000 manufacturing, engineering and construction jobs at a new plant in Arizona.</p><p>The California technology titan is beginning to shift production back to its home market, with the creation of its second US plant in under a year. It is understood the renewable energy powered facility in Mesa, Arizona, will produce laboratory grown sapphire crystals of the kind used in the iPhone 5S fingerprint scanner.</p><p>The initiative is a joint venture with crystal growth equipment specialist GT Advanced Technologies, which said Monday it had signed a multi-year agreement with Apple to provide furnaces to make sapphire. The material, which has been used in watch faces, is more scratch-resistant than glass and may eventually be used to make Apple's screens.</p><p>\"Apple will have an incredibly positive economic impact for Arizona,\" said governor Janice Brewer. \"Their investment in renewable energy will also be greening our power grid, and creating significant new solar and geothermal power sources for the state.\"</p><p>Run with solar and geothermal energy, which uses heat from deep underground, the plant has been designed in collaboration with local utility Salt River Project.</p><p>The building will be owned by Apple, while the furnaces will be supplied by GT Advanced, with a $578 down payment from Apple which will be reimbursed over five years starting in 2015 and is understood to come with certain exclusivity rights.</p><p>Demand for industrially produced sapphire has rocketed since Apple began using the material to protect camera lenses in 2012, according to research firm IHS Suppli. The deal will help Apple secure control over a scarce resource.</p><p>Next month, the first Macintosh computer made in America since 2004 will go on sale. The Mac Pro, whose internal parts are contained in an unusual cylindrical shell, has been produced from a purpose-built plant in Austin, Texas, in a joint venture with contract manufacturer Flextronics which has created 1,700 jobs.</p><p>Apple closed its last American computer assembly plant in Elk Grove, California, in June 2004, having by then shifted much of its production to contract manufacturers in Asia. By then, the company had given up making its own products and outsourced the work to sub-contractors such as Foxconn.</p><p>But bad publicity surrounding the treatment of workers at the plants owned by Foxconn and other companies operating in China have led Apple to take more control over production.</p><p>Other companies have followed suit. Google, which now owns the Motorola smartphone group, has opened a site in Texas, where its latest smartphones are being assembled. Caterpillar, the construction and mining equipment maker, and General Electric, have been opening factories at home in recent years. Samsung has also opened a semi-conductor fabrication plant in Texas, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/16/apple-a5-chip-made-by-samsung\" title=\"\">it makes chips for Apple</a>.</p><p>\"We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction,\" Apple said in a statement. \"This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100% renewable energy from day one.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707511|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|3a43a884b31b5db0ba573cce3ba86af05a72793e -->",

        "body":"<p>AstraZeneca is being investigated by US authorities over a clinical trial that was used to win marketing approval for its heart drug <a href=\"http://www.brilinta.com/\" title=\"\">Brilinta</a>, casting fresh doubts over the medicine.</p><p>Brilinta sales have been a disappointment since its launch two years ago, although AstraZeneca has recently stepped up marketing efforts and hopes that further clinical tests will underscore its value in preventing heart attacks.</p><p>The British drugmaker said on Thursday it received a civil investigative demand from the US department of justice, seeking documents and information regarding the Plato (platelet inhibition and patient outcomes) study.</p><p>AstraZeneca plans to co-operate with the DOJ and its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said he was \"very confident\" in the findings of the trial. \"It was guided by a strong academic group who oversaw the trial and its conduct,\" he told reporters  after announcing third-quarter results.</p><p>AstraZeneca did not disclose the exact nature of the investigation and DOJ spokesman Peter Carr in Washington said he had no immediate comment on the case.</p><p>The results of the 18,000-patient trial were first reported in 2009 and went on to form the basis of successful new drug applications in the US, Europe and other markets. Brilinta was launched in 2011.</p><p>Aspects of the study, which relied heavily on patients recruited in eastern Europe, have been criticised by medical experts. Poland and Hungary together accounted for 21% of the subjects studied – more than double the US and Canada combined.</p><p>James DiNicolantonio of Ithaca New York and Ales Tomek of Charles University in Prague raised several questions about the conduct of the study in a recent paper in the <a href=\"http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/inpress\" title=\"\">International Journal of Cardiology</a>.</p><p>In particular, their analysis found that patients in the Plato trial who were monitored by AstraZeneca were reported as having more beneficial effects from taking Brilinta than those monitored by an independent clinical research organisation.</p><p>Those conclusions, however, have been strongly disputed by Lars Wallentin of Uppsala clinical research center in Sweden, the principal investigator on Plato.Brilinta is a key product for AstraZeneca but its progress to date has been slow, with sales in the third quarter edging up to just $75m (£47m) from $65m in the three months to end-June – a long way from the multibillion-dollar sales potential that analysts once predicted.</p><p>Among the challenges it faces is the fact that US doctors tend to use high-dose aspirin for cardiovascular patients, and clinical trials suggest AstraZeneca's new drug does not work as well in this setting.</p><p>AstraZeneca hopes that a new clinical study called Pegasus will put to rest any uncertainties about the effectiveness of Brilinta and also increase uptake of the medicine. Results are expected in 2014.</p><p>In addition to the DOJ inquiry into Brilinta, AstraZeneca also disclosed it had received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Office in Boston, seeking documents and information related to the safety of its antipsychotic drug <a href=\"http://www.seroquelxr.com/\" title=\"\">Seroquel</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The news came as AstraZeneca promoted Marc Dunoyer to chief financial officer, plugging a gap in the management team as it grapples with falling sales and profits.</p><p>Dunoyer, 61, who joined from rival GlaxoSmithKline in June, will replace well-respected finance chief Simon Lowth, whose departure to join BG Group had been announced.</p><p>Hit by generic competition to key drugs, sales and profits at AstraZeneca continued to slide in the third quarter, underscoring the challenge facing Soriot, who has been in the job for just over a year. Lowth has been viewed as a steady hand on AstraZeneca's finances, and the appointment of Dunoyer, who lacks recent direct CFO responsibility, may concern some investors. Soriot and Dunoyer have their work cut out to turn around AstraZeneca after years of failure to come up with new drugs to replace those reaching the end of their patent life.</p><p>Improving AstraZeneca's record in drug research is Soriot's top priority, but he told Reuters in June that turning around the company would take three to four years.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It will also require investment in the science behind new medicines and AstraZeneca said it expected to spend more, with 2013 spending increasing at the upper end of its prior guidance range of a low-to-mid single-digit percentage rise on 2012.</p><p>Mark Clark of Deutsche Bank said higher operating costs suggested there would be \"minor\" downgrades in earnings forecasts.</p><p>Sales in the quarter slid by 6% to $6.25bn, weighed down by the loss of patent protection on several drugs – including, in some markets, its top-selling cholesterol fighter Crestor.</p><p>\"Core\" operating profit was $2.03bn.</p><p>Growth in drug sales in China, where destocking and an anti-corruption drive disrupted business, slowed to 13% from 21% in the second quarter. But AstraZeneca fared a lot better than GlaxoSmithKline, the company at the centre of the scandal, whose China sales crashed 61% percent in the third quarter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421412204|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|31d8142be869159339de633f287c5653d11c110b -->",

        "body":"<p>The Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd should have raised serious concerns about the methodology in a report claiming the high-speed rail project would bring £15bn in additional benefits to the UK, one of HS2's former advisers has told MPs.</p><p></p><p>A panel of academic experts told the Treasury select committee that a KMPG report into HS2's regional economic impacts published in September overstated the benefits by six to eight times.</p><p></p><p>The findings, widely cited by the government – including in the new strategic case for HS2 published last week – used a procedure that was \"essentially made up\", said Henry Overman, professor of economic geography at the LSE.</p><p></p><p>Overman, who was an adviser to HS2 Ltd until 2012, said: \"At some point HS2, DfT and the peer review should have pointed out that parts of the report were problematic&nbsp;… I don't understand why the £15bn figure was allowed to go out.\"</p><p></p><p>He said that even the reduced figure should not be presented as additional to the benefit cost ratio with wider economic benefits published by the DfT, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/hs2-economic-case-downgraded-benefits\" title=\"\">which was revised downward to 2.3:1 last week</a>.</p><p></p><p>Dan Graham, professor of statistical modelling at Imperial College, told the committee he shared that view. He said of the KPMG work: \"I don't think the statistical work is reliable.\"</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the KMPG partners who produced the report defended their work as robust as MPs queried the scale and viability of the report, which was produced over four months for a total fee of £242,000.</p><p></p><p>Committee chair Andrew Tyrie asked: \"You don't normally do work of this scale for a couple of hundred thousand do you?\"</p><p></p><p>KPMG's Richard Threlfall replied: \"We didn't quite anticipate the degree of debate the report would create.\"</p><p></p><p>Tyrie asked KPMG to explain a line in the report admitting: \"We recognise that this approach does not have a firm statistical foundation.\"</p><p></p><p>The consultants said they had been transparent about their workings. KPMG's Lewis Atter said he believed the work was a \"reasonable, probably conservative approach\". He said: \"There is no perfect way of answering the exam question we are posed.\"</p><p></p><p>He said that they stood by the £15bn figure as a forecast, despite a disclaimer that the findings should be regarded only as an estimate. Atter said it was a standard disclaimer.</p><p></p><p>The KPMG pair denied cherrypicking figures, after a Newsnight freedom of information request showed that cities and towns which would lose out economically from the creation of the HS2 network were omitted from a table in the report which showed only potential gains.</p><p></p><p>Threlfall pointed to a map included in the report marking with red dots places that would be negatively affected in 2037. He said he thought that a map was more illustrative than a table.</p><p></p><p>Asked their opinion of the HS2 project, Threlfall said: \"Based on the work we've done HS2 is a good thing and we should get on with it.\"</p><p></p><p>Atter, who said he started in the sceptical camp, said he now believed HS2 should be built, especially in the context of the wider transport and infrastructure spending ahead.</p><p>He said: \"The question is not is it the very best thing to do, but would you find space for it in your £1.2tn [spending] over 20 years.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, was speaking at a supply chain conference in Birmingham attended by over 800 companies looking to win contracts totalling more than £10bn.</p><p></p><p>McLoughlin said businesses from across the UK could be part of building HS2, saying the project would bring jobs and growth to communities across the country for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>The HS2 network linking London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds is scheduled for full completion in 2033 at a cost of £42.6bn, including £14bn in contingencies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702356|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bcca15648003bd240f22fb0ef1616e86e7e98cc -->",

        "headline":"Co-op Bank scrambles to convince customers its ethical stance will survive",
        "body":"<p>The Co-operative Group was scrambling late on Monday to convince the 4.6 million customers of its banking arm that its ethical stance could survive aggressive US hedge funds taking a stake in the troubled bank.</p><p>As details of a £1.5bn rescue package were announced, the group disclosed the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, was asking questions about information it provided about its financial strength in its 2012 annual report. The bank had concluded it did not need to reissue the accounts.</p><p>About 50 of the 324 Co-op bank branches are to close and a significant number of jobs from the 10,000-strong workforce are under threat as the new management team attempts to reverse steep losses. It could take five years to make the bank profitable again after losses caused by bad lending and the merger with the Britannia building society in 2009.</p><p>The troubles at the bank are forcing the wider Co-operative Group, which owns supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, to pump £462m into the bank – equivalent to around £60 for each of the group's 7.9 million owner-members.</p><p>While this is less than the £1bn the group originally expected to stump up, it means the UK's largest mutual will own just 30% of the bank; the rest will be owned by its bondholders. Those include a group of hedge funds, led by the US-based Silver Point and Aurelius, that has forced the rewriting of a radical proposal first outlined in June, when the £1.5bn shortfall was identified.</p><p>Despite concerns that the millions of pounds being used to prop up the bank would starve the Co-op of cash to invest in its other businesses, the finance director, Richard Pennycook – part of a new management team installed in the last six months – said the alternative would have been worse.</p><p>\"We are all extremely sorry about what has happened,\" said Pennycook. \"But there is a difference between today and June. In June, if we hadn't taken this action the bank was going to go bust … the impact on the wider group would have been disastrous.\"</p><p>Bondholders including 30,000 retail investors, largely pensioners, still need to back the deal, without which the bank fears it would fall under control of the Bank of England, or could be nationalised.</p><p>In an attempt to demonstrate commitment to the ethical stance the bank has been known for since 1992, the new bank will poll its customers in the spring about the businesses it should turn away on ethical grounds. Since 1992 it has turned away £1.2bn of business, including backing for arms shipments, coalmining and cleaning products tested on animals.</p><p>But Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, warned: \"With hedge funds at the wheel, the bank will become more ruthlessly commercial. Cutting 1,000 jobs at the same time as you launch an ethics policy is quite a contradiction.\"</p><p>The bank will be able to use the Co-operative name only if it keeps an ethical stance that will be overseen by an independent director who will chair an ethics and values committee. The bank said \"customer power\" would keep it ethical.</p><p>The Co-operative Group on Monday warned its brand could be  damaged by the bank continuing to use the Co-op name. The City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and the business secretary, Vince Cable, can force the bank to change its name if the description is misleading.</p><p>The bank's constitution will be written from 15 November to force it to take account of the \"highest standards of ethical principles\" and being a \"good corporate citizen … contributing to building a stronger and sustainable society\".</p><p>It will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders unless it also considers its commitment to society and the environment. The group of hedge funds, advised by Caroline Silver of the Wall Street investment bank Moelis, and known as LT2, stressed that it was determined to maintain the ethical stance, which Silver described as a \"unique mission\".</p><p>The hedge funds will put in an extra £125m of capital in addition to their bonds. The secretive group admitted only  on Monday that it included Aurelius  – known for a long-running battle to force Argentina to pay out £800m – and Silver Point, linked to troubled financial firms such as Lehman Brothers. Others, including Beach Point Capital Management, Caspian Capital, Canyon Capital Advisors and Monarch Alternative Capital, then stepped forward.</p><p>Euan Sutherland, who arrived from B&amp;Q to run the Co-op in May, refused to criticise the hedge funds, describing them as \"very economically rational people\" who were investing in the bank because they believed it could become profitable again. He said the bank had lost its way over the previous five years, during which it had expanded rapidly, merging with the Britannia and then attempting the audacious but ill-fated takeover of more than 600 so-called Verde branches <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/coop-pulls-out-talks-buy-lloyds-bank-branches\" title=\"\">from Lloyds Banking Group, in a move that would have given the Co-op a 1,000-strong network</a>.</p><p>Under Niall Booker, who also joined in May, the bank's high-street presence will shrink. At least 15% of the 324 branches are to be shut, and £500m ploughed into investing in IT systems that previous management neglected.</p><p></p><p>Sutherland said it was his idea for Co-op Group would use £130m of the £462m it is pumping into the bank to issue new bonds to some 30,000 private investors who would otherwise have been wiped out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421599156|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|d9f39eef28410054a94922c3e59fdcd17c1df79e -->",

        "body":"<p>The flop of the film White House Down has added to earnings woes at Sony in the latest quarter, dragging the entertainment and electronics giant to a 19.3bn yen (£122m) loss.</p><p>The action movie's lacklustre box office performance, especially compared with last year's releases of 21 Jump Street and The Amazing Spider Man, contributed to a 17.8bn yen operating loss for Sony's pictures division, according to figures released on Thursday.</p><p>The company slashed its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending in March to 30bn yen from 50bn yen, reflecting deep-seated problems in its electronics business – televisions in particular – and the disappointing performance at Sony Pictures.</p><p>White House Down starred Jamie Foxx as president of the United States and Channing Tatum as a police officer who becomes the president's impromptu bodyguard while touring the executive residence with his daughter just as a band of rogue former soldiers and government employees attack. The film appeared to suffer by comparisons with Olympus Has Fallen, a slightly earlier release with a similar plot, featuring a former North Korean terrorist who takes the president hostage.</p><p>Sony's sales for the July to September quarter rose 10.6% from a year earlier to 1.78tn yen, thanks mainly to the favourable impact of the yen's decline against the US dollar. Adjusted for the 20% drop in the value of the yen, revenue fell 9%.</p><p>The company's sales of digital cameras and video cameras fell while its television, music and smartphone businesses improved. Sales of its Xperia Z smartphone helped and are expected to remain strong, a spokesman for the company said.</p><p>But although sales of televisions and personal computers improved slightly from earlier in the year, they were lower than the same quarter of 2012.</p><p>\"The electronics business is declining beyond expectations\" due to shrinking sales of televisions and other audio-visual equipment, along with slowing growth in major emerging markets such as China, the spokesman said.</p><p>\"Sony expects its business environment to continue to be severe in the second half of the fiscal year,\" he added.</p><p>Sony said it is striving to improve profitability at its troubled television division by focusing on sales of higher cost products, including its LCD (liquid crystal display) TVs.</p><p>The company, which has suffered declining fortunes for several years, is also gearing up for the introduction of its PlayStation 4 game machine.</p><p>But it faces fierce competition from Apple's iPad and iPhone as well as from its powerful South Korean rival Samsung.</p><p>Sony made record losses for the fiscal year ending March 2012, reporting the worst result in the company's six-decade history.</p><p>Still, its loss for April to September narrowed to 15.8bn yen from 40bn yen in the first half of the previous fiscal year.</p><p>Its rival Panasonic, meanwhile, said its quarterly profit improved to 63.3bn yen from a 698.6bn yen loss the year before.</p><p>Panasonic, like Sony, has benefited from weaker yen. While its domestic sales fell 4%, sales overseas climbed 11%. Total revenue of 1.88tn yen was up 3% from a year earlier after taking a hit from the sale of Sanyo businesses carried out in the current fiscal year.</p><p>Panasonic raised its sales forecast to 7.4tn yen and doubled its profit forecast for the fiscal year to 100bn yen.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421377025|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|a7aedb8e2a1aadf764194ef1c8c08100dc58b033 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal criminal investigation into two of the government's biggest suppliers, G4S and Serco, following claims by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, of tens of millions of pounds of overcharging on electronic tagging contracts for offenders.</p><p>Grayling asked the SFO to look into the billing allegations in July when he told MPs that an external audit had revealed that the overcharging included billing for tracking the movements of criminals who had moved abroad, who were back in prison, who had had their tags removed and even, in a few cases, those who had died.</p><p>The justice secretary said that in some cases the bills had continued to be presented years after active monitoring had stopped.</p><p>Whitehall sources have confirmed that the central allegation in the case revolves around charges for 3,000 phantom offenders. The justice ministry was being billed by the two companies for the tagging of 18,000 offenders a day under the &pound;700m contract when only 15,000 were actually being monitored.</p><p>G4S said it would co-operate with the investigation and had been notified by the SFO director, David Green, that it would cover &quot;the contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services which commenced in 2005 as amended and extended until the present day&quot;.</p><p>In July Grayling asked the SFO to look into the situation after G4S refused to co-operate with a justice ministry internal forensic audit to establish whether any dishonesty had taken place. The decision to refer Serco, which did co-operate with the MoJ audit, to the SFO was taken in September.</p><p>In July Serco said senior management had not been aware of the discrepancies but they did not believe anything dishonest had taken place. The company agreed with the MoJ that if the forensic audit showed dishonesty had taken place they would jointly call in the SFO.</p><p>The pattern of overcharging was revealed by a PricewaterhouseCoopers external audit commissioned by Grayling in May after billing discrepancies were discovered during the re-tendering process.</p><p>Under the contracts, more than 20,000 offenders are monitored on electronic tags at any one time. They are a key element in the criminal justice system's menu of community punishments as they are used to enforce curfews for prisoners on early release as well as some court orders.</p><p>In a small number of cases they have been used to track the movements of terror suspects and paedophiles. Last week prosecutions were halted against three terror suspects accused of tampering with their G4S-supplied GPS tags amid claims of faults with the tags and their straps.</p><p>The two companies are among the government's biggest suppliers. Both have already agreed to withdraw from bidding for the &pound;3bn next-generation tagging contract.</p><p>The Cabinet Office has also been reviewing the 28 contracts that the two companies currently hold with the government worth a total of &pound;9bn, including the management of the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston. Grayling has said that both companies can bid for contracts to run 70% of the probation service but will not be awarded them unless the SFO give them a clean bill of health.</p><p>Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said the SFO decision was a major development. &quot;In July I wrote to the SFO calling on them to investigate claims against G4S and to act swiftly to secure any possible evidence that might be needed. I hope that the time taken to launch this investigation hasn't resulted in the loss of important evidence,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;With future Ministry of Justice contracts up for grabs, including more than &pound;600m of probation contracts, the government must act swiftly and bar G4S from bidding for any more until the SFO has concluded its investigation. By failing to do so, David Cameron risks undermining public confidence in our justice system.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618253|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|91b053b26838896921efd78405999bf9d79adb4c -->",

        "body":"<p>Six of the world's leading central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, say they will provide each other with ready supplies of their currencies on a standing basis, extending arrangements set up to steady the global financial system during post-2007 turbulence.</p><p>The decision, announced on Thursday, extends currency swap arrangements that until now had been considered temporary measures.</p><p>The central banks are: the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank.</p><p>The so-called swap lines enable those central banks to make sure banks in their home countries can always borrow ready cash from them in any of the currencies involved, should they need it.</p><p>The ECB said the arrangements \"have helped to ease strains in financial markets\" and \"will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop\".</p><p>The Fed and the ECB started their first dollar-euro swap arrangement in December 2007 as the losses on mortgage-backed bonds began to shake the banking system. Subsequent bilateral deals between the different banks were added during the financial turbulence that followed, which included the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, sudden extreme falls on stock markets, the subsequent recession and Europe's crisis over too much government debt in several countries.</p><p>Central banks serve as custodians of their countries' currencies and play an important role in supporting the stability of banks so companies can do business and the economy can function properly.</p><p>They typically provide liquidity – ready cash to meet the demands of everyday business – to their banks, even when banks may be having trouble borrowing elsewhere due to market trouble. With the new currency arrangements, they can do this in currencies other than their own.</p><p>For example, the European Central Bank holds credit offerings in US dollars for periods of seven days and three months, offering as much in dollars as European banks may want in return for collateral such as bonds or other securities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421361156|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|6d090c719e098d354347639d2eaa089ab99f5975 -->",

        "body":"<p>The boss of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has waived his bonus this year after admitting that the energy industry urgently needs to rebuild trust with consumers.</p><p>Sam Laidlaw, who was paid a total of nearly £5m last year including almost £1.5m in cash bonuses, said he understood the anger and frustration felt by many after bills rocketed by more than three times the rate of inflation in 2013.</p><p>Speaking at the CBI's annual conference in London, he said trust in the energy sector is at an \"all-time low\" and acknowledged an urgent need to rebuild it.</p><p>He said the reputation of the company and the industry had been damaged by the furore over rising bills and industry leaders needed to tackle the issue head on. But Centrica, which has almost 9 million UK customers of its British Gas subsidiary, was innocent of profiteering, he said, and was unable to subside retail prices from profits in other parts of the business.</p><p>He said Centrica's gas exploration business, which has been mentioned as a possible cash cow for the retail arm, lost £130m last year. Other parts of the organisation were also less profitable than critics imagined, while profit margins on worldwide sales were a modest 5.9%, he said. Laidlaw pledged to cut bills if the chancellor goes ahead in his autumn statement with plans to absorb the green levy into general taxation. He said British gas would cut bills by the amount of the levy if the rumoured change goes ahead.</p><p>Currently the green levy, which is used to subsidise the extra costs of generating electricity from renewable sources, is imposed on the larger energy providers, which pass on the bill to customers.</p><p>The commitment appeared to give a boost to proposals circulating inside the Treasury for an immediate cut in household bills by transferring the green levy to the government budget. Officials had feared that energy companies would absorb the cut and boost profits rather than pass on the benefit to customers.</p><p>Laidlaw said there was a need for leadership in the current environment, though a decision to deny bonuses needed to be balanced with being able to attract employees.</p><p>\"Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it.\"</p><p>Laidlaw said the energy industry was \"in the eye of the storm\", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers.</p><p>Laidlaw said he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of £60, on top of a £135 warm home discount, he said.</p><p>Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by £300m over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills. \"We are listening – we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421630833|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|76192004ff2c765cec9e497ebb223e2ea0f92144 -->",

Routes in and out of London saw the biggest increase in numbers, particularly to and from airports.</p><p>Coach revenue had already grown 9% during the third quarter of 2013, the transport group announced, bolstered by the best August bank holiday figures on record.</p><p>National Express has also seen improved coach revenue in Morocco and its US school bus operations.</p><p>The group is also pursuing multiple rail franchises in Germany, where it has been shortlisted for the Berlin Ringbahn contract.</p><p>News that coach links from London to the airports are booming may further aggrieve rival Arriva, which is suing Luton airport for putting the coach service it previously ran out to tender this year. The franchise was won by National Express.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421370263|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|483e577db044ec08edd21842c594a96bc4169104 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|5da1f27d91cd822a13b88488594c4ae355341a47 -->",

It took Facebook close to a year to surpass the $38 price its shares initially sold for. Facebook's shares soared close to 10% to $53.88 in after-hours trading as investors digested the mobile figures.</p><p>Facebook is expected to account for a 15.8% share of worldwide mobile ad spending in 2013, up from a 5.35% share last year, according to analyst eMarketer. Google is expected to grab 53.17% of the worldwide mobile ad market this year, up slightly over a 52.36% share in 2012.</p><p>Mobile advertising is the fastest growing advertising category. The overall mobile ad market worldwide is expected to grow 89% to $16.65bn in 2013, eMarketer estimates, up from just $8.8bn in 2012.</p><p>Overall, Facebook's revenues were over $2bn for the quarter, up from $1.26bn for the same period last year. Net income was $425m, compared to a loss of $59m last year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, said: \"The strong results we achieved this quarter show that we're prepared for the next phase of our company, as we work to bring the next five billion people online and into the knowledge economy.\"</p><p>The company said there was an average of 728m daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook in September 2013, an increase of 25% year-over-year. The number of monthly active users was 1.19bn as of September 30, 2013, an increase of 18% year-over-year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421325385|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|08c97e2906a336eb54edf3fe004656497a4a2522 -->",

        "headline":"SAC Capital agrees to plead guilty to insider trading charges",
        "body":"<p>SAC Capital has become the first hedge fund to plead guilty to insider trading after an extensive six-year dragnet by government regulators, who issued a warning to future \"Gordon Gekkos\" and imposed fines that totalled $1.8bn.</p> <p>\"No institution should rest in the belief that is too big to jail,\" said Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. \"That is a moral hazard.\"</p> <p>April Brooks, who heads the New York field office of the FBI, said the proposed settlement should act as a warning to \"those who venerate Gordon Gekko\", referring to the Machiavellian capitalist in the 1987 movie Wall Street who popularized the phrase \"greed is good\".&nbsp;</p> <p>SAC has agreed to a passel of penalties, which follow a July indictment by Bharara's office. It must pay a&nbsp;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&nbsp;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period &ndash; in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission &ndash; and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&nbsp;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds&rdquo;.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649512|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|76f462cdfb6ce7731fbc76a449c1216094efb09c -->",
