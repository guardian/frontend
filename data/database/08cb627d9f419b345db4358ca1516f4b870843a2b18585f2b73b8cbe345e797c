There are no such exceptional circumstances here.\"</p><p>The court would have to find the CIA implicitly guilty of a war crime before it could consider whether GCHQ had been involved, the court said.</p><p>Lawyers for the UK government had argued that the case should not proceed as \"a finding by our court that the notional UK operator of a drone bomb which caused a death was guilty of murder would inevitably be understood … by the US as a condemnation of the US.\"</p><p>Responding to the ruling, Kat Craig, legal director of the human rights charity Reprieve, which is supporting Khan, said: \"It is shameful that the risk of embarrassing the US has trumped British justice in this case.</p><p>\"It now appears that the UK government can get away with murder, provided it is committed alongside an ally who may be sensitive to public criticism. It is a sad day when the rights of civilian victims of drone strikes take second place to the PR concerns of the US government.\"</p><p>Khan said: \"I used to think that Britain stood for justice, but now it seems as though the government has put itself above the law.</p><p>\"However, I am still determined to get answers from the UK government about the part they have played in the death of my father. The CIA's drone programme has not only killed hundreds of civilians, but is turning people in Pakistan against the US and its allies.</p><p>\"This is why I was so upset to hear that Britain is helping the CIA to carry out these killings, and even more upset when the government refused to respond to my questions.\"</p><p>Rosa Curling from Leigh Day, which is representing Khan, said: \"The court's decision not to determine the lawfulness of our government's involvement in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, deadly strikes which have killed many civilians over recent years including my client's father, simply to spare the US government embarrassment is not only disappointing but also deeply worrying.</p><p>\"The courts must have jurisdiction over the legality of our government's action irrespective of whether they act alongside a foreign state or not.\"</p>","headline":"Pakistan drone strike relative loses GCHQ court case","trailText":"Judges say case would involve 'sitting in judgment' on US and block move by Noor Khan, whose father died in a 2011 attack","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/20/1390219422353/Drones-003.jpg","wordcount":"468","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"427533283","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"8577105","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent","internalPageCode":"2029264","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T12:09:09Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jan/20/pakistan-drone-strike-relative-loses-gchq-court-case","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/2014/jan/20/pakistan-drone-strike-relative-loses-gchq-court-case","tags":[{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"uk/gchq","webTitle":"GCHQ","description":"The latest news and comment on the Government Communications Headquarters","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/gchq","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"world/drones","webTitle":"Drones","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/drones","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/pakistan","webTitle":"Pakistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pakistan","references":[]},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/human-rights","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owenbowcott","webTitle":"Owen Bowcott","rcsId":"GNL004729","r2ContributorId":"16213","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/owen_bowcott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Bowcott is legal affairs correspondent.

Hundreds of innocent civilians are thought to have been killed as a result of drone attacks.</p><p>Questions are also mounting over the role of British officials in assisting the CIA's targeting of alleged militants in Pakistan.

If they're not supplying information as part of the CIA's illegal drone war, why not tell us?

strike victim's son to appeal against court's refusal to bar British officials from sharing targeting intelligence with US","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T12:40:55Z","body":"<p>A Pakistani man whose father was killed in a US drone strike has failed to persuade the UK courts that British officials should be prevented from sharing targeting intelligence with the CIA.</p><p>Noor Khan said he would appeal against the high court's refusal to issue a declaration that support for US drone operations over Pakistan may involve acts of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/23/uk-support-us-drones-pakistan-war-crime\" title=\"\">assisting murder or even war crimes</a>.</p><p>His landmark challenge, backed by the human rights organisation <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Reprieve</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.leighday.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">solicitors Leigh Day</a>, was based on reports that the government's signal intelligence centre, GCHQ, passes on information about the location of Taliban suspects to the CIA.</p><p>Khan's father, Malik Daud Khan, was killed on 17 March 2011, the court was told. He had been presiding over an outdoor meeting of local elders to settle a commercial dispute when a missile was fired from a drone. Altogether 49 people perished in the attack.</p><p>Martin Chamberlain, counsel for Khan, told the court that a newspaper article in 2010 reported that GCHQ was using telephone intercepts to provide the US authorities with locational intelligence on leading militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The report suggested that the Cheltenham-based agency was proud of this work, which was said to be \"in strict accordance with the law\".</p><p>In its judgment the high court noted: \"By assisting US agents to direct armed attacks in Pakistan, GCHQ employees are said to be at risk of committing offences under the criminal law of England and Wales, as secondary parties to murder. The claimant submits that there is no armed conflict in Pakistan, as it is recognised under international law, still less an international armed conflict, and thus GCHQ employees are not entitled to combatant immunity.</p><p>\"The response of the secretary of state has been to invoke the consistent and conventional policy of neither confirming nor denying the assertions; to do so would risk damaging the important public interest in preserving the confidentiality of national security and 'vital' relations with international partners.\"</p><p>The two judges, Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Simon, said the real purpose of the legal action was \"to persuade a court to do what it can to stop further strikes by drones operated by the United States. In this country, however, that presents the claimant with a formidable difficulty. His legal advisers acknowledge, as they have to acknowledge, that they cannot seek from this court a declaration that the United States' drone strikes are unlawful. They recognise that a domestic court would refuse to make such a declaration.</p><p>\"Since an employee [of GCHQ] is unlikely to be in a position to know whether or how intelligence is disseminated, no sensible guidance could possibly be given as to the circumstances when intelligence may lawfully be passed on and when it may not. Merely passing on intelligence could not amount to an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007 unless a particular state of mind could be proved against the provider [at that time]. So how is the declaration to be drafted to have any meaningful utility?\"</p><p>Leigh Day confirmed that Khan would appeal against the decision. He is also involved in a parallel case in Peshawar's high court asking the Pakistani government to disclose its involvement – if any – in the drone strikes.</p><p>Rosa Curling, of Leigh Day, who represents Khan, said: \"We are disappointed that the court has decided not to engage in this very important issue, leaving our client no option but to appeal the decision.</p><p>\"This claim raises very serious questions and issues about the UK's involvement in the CIA drone attacks in Pakistan. This case seeks to determine the legality of intelligence sharing in relation to GCHQ assistance in CIA drone strikes. Those providing such information could be commiting serious criminal offences, including conspiracy to murder.\"</p><p>Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, said: \"CIA drone attacks in Pakistan terrorise entire communities of innocent civilians in a country with which the UK is not at war. By avoiding judicial scrutiny over drone attacks, combined with its ongoing attempts to push through secret courts, this government is showing a disturbing desire to put itself above the law. We should not be involved in secret, dirty wars, where civilian casualties are ignored or hushed up. If the government is supporting the CIA's campaign of drone strikes which are illegal, the British public have the right to know.\"</p>","headline":"High court rejects challenge over UK link to drone strikes in Pakistan","trailText":"Drone strike victim's son to appeal against court's refusal to bar British officials from sharing targeting intelligence with US","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/21/1356095783208/US-Predator-drone-003.jpg","wordcount":"717","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"401454886","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"7055674","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent","internalPageCode":"1845855","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-24T13:29:43Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/21/high-court-drone-strikes-pakistan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/dec/21/high-court-drone-strikes-pakistan","tags":[{"id":"world/drones","webTitle":"Drones","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/drones","references":[]},{"id":"world/pakistan","webTitle":"Pakistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pakistan","references":[]},{"id":"world/cia","webTitle":"CIA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/cia","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/human-rights","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owenbowcott","webTitle":"Owen Bowcott","rcsId":"GNL004729","r2ContributorId":"16213","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/owen_bowcott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Bowcott is legal affairs correspondent.

Rather, Khan was seeking a declaration by the civil courts that such intelligence-sharing is unlawful.</p><p>Between June 2004 and September this year, according to <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/\" title=\"\">research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, drone strikes killed between 2,562 and 3,325 people in Pakistan, of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children.</p><p>With the number of drone strikes increasing sharply under the Obama administration, the London case is one of several being brought by legal activists around the world in an attempt to challenge their legality of the programme.</p><p>In Pakistan, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220828/US-drone-attacks-CIA-chiefs-face-arrest-horrific-evidence-bloody-video-game-sorties.html?ITO=1490\" title=\"\">lawyers and human rights activists are mounting two separate court claims</a>: one is intended to trigger a criminal investigation into the actions of two former CIA officials, while the second is seeking a declaration that the strikes amount to acts of war, in order to pressurise the Pakistani air force into shooting down drones operating in the country's airspace.</p><p>During the two-day hearing in London, lawyers for Khan are seeking permission for a full judicial review of the lawfulness of any British assistance for the US drone programme.</p><p>Lawyers for William Hague, the foreign secretary, say not only that they will neither confirm nor deny any intelligence-sharing activities in support of drone operations, but that it would be \"prejudicial to the national interest\" for them even to explain their understanding of the legal basis for any such activities.</p><p>For Khan and his lawyers to succeed, they say, the court would need to be satisfied that there is no international armed conflict in Pakistan, with the result that anyone involved in drone strikes was not immune from the criminal law, and that there had been no tacit approval for the strikes from the Pakistan government – another matter that the British government will neither confirm nor deny.</p><p>The court would also need to consider, and reject, the US government's own legal position: that drone strikes are acts of self-defence. It would also need to be satisfied that the handing over of intelligence amounted to participation in hostilities.</p><p>The government also says that Khan's claim would have a \"significant impact\" on the conduct of the UK's relations with both the US and Pakistan in an \"acutely controversial, sensitive and important\" area, and also impact on relations between the US and Pakistan.</p><p>The

This narrative is false,\" the report, entitled Living Under Drones, states.</p><p>The authors admit it is difficult to obtain accurate data on casualties \"because of US efforts to shield the drone programme from democratic accountability, compounded by obstacles to independent investigation of strikes in North Waziristan\".</p><p>The \"best available information\", they say, is that between 2,562 and 3,325 people have been killed in Pakistan between June 2004 and mid-September this year – of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children. The figures have been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/aug/02/us-drone-strikes-data\" title=\"\">assembled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, which estimated that a further 1,300 individuals were injured in drone strikes over that period.</p><p>The report was commissioned by and written with the help of <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/cases/2012_03_28_noor_khan/\" title=\"\">the London-based Reprieve organisation, which is supporting action in the British courts by Noor Khan</a>, a Pakistani whose father was killed by a US drone strike in March 2011. His legal challenge alleges the UK is complicit in US drone strikes because GCHQ, the eavesdropping agency, shares intelligence with the CIA on targets for drone strikes.</p><p>\"US drones hover 24 hours a day over communities in north-west Pakistan, striking homes, vehicles, and public spaces without warning,\" the American law schools report says.</p><p>\"Their presence terrorises men, women, and children, giving rise to anxiety and psychological trauma among civilian communities. Those living under drones have to face the constant worry that a deadly strike may be fired at any moment, and the knowledge that they are powerless to protect themselves.</p><p>\"These fears have affected behaviour. The US practice of striking one area multiple times, and evidence that it has killed rescuers, makes both community members and humanitarian workers afraid or unwilling to assist injured victims.\"</p><p>The study goes on to say: \"Publicly available evidence that the strikes have made the US safer overall is ambiguous at best … The number of 'high-level' militants killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low – estimated at just 2% [of deaths]. Evidence suggests that US strikes have facilitated recruitment to violent non-state armed groups, and motivated further violent attacks … One major study shows that 74% of Pakistanis now consider the US an enemy.\"</p><p>Coming from American lawyers rather than overseas human rights groups, the criticisms are likely to be more influential in US domestic debates over the legality of drone warfare.</p><p>\"US targeted killings and drone strike practices undermine respect for the rule of law and international legal protections and may set dangerous precedents,\" the report says, questioning whether Pakistan has given consent for the attacks.</p><p>\"The US government's failure to ensure basic transparency and accountability in its targeted killings policies, to provide details about its targeted killing programme, or adequately to set out the legal factors involved in decisions to strike hinders necessary democratic debate about a key aspect of US foreign and national security policy.</p><p>\"US practices may also facilitate recourse to lethal force around the globe by establishing dangerous precedents for other governments. As drone manufacturers and officials successfully reduce export control barriers, and as more countries develop lethal drone technologies, these risks increase.\"</p><p>The report supports <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\" title=\"\">the call by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN's special rapporteur on countering terrorism, for independent investigations </a>into deaths from drone strikes and demands the release of the US department of justice memorandums outlining the legal basis for US targeted killings in Pakistan.</p><p>The report highlights the switch from the former president George W Bush's practice of targeting high-profile al-Qaida personalities to the reliance, under Obama's administration, of analysing patterns of life on the ground to select targets.</p><p>\"According to US authorities, these strikes target 'groups of men who bear certain signatures, or defining characteristics associated with terrorist activity, but whose identities aren't known',\" the report says. \"Just what those 'defining characteristics' are has never been made public.\" People in North Waziristan are now afraid to attend funerals or other gatherings, it suggests.</p><p>Fears that US agents pay informers to attach electronic tags to the homes of suspected militants in Pakistan haunt the tribal districts, according to the study. \"[In] Waziristan … residents are gripped by rumours that paid CIA informants have been planting tiny silicon-chip homing devices that draw the drones.</p><p>\"Many of the Waziris interviewed spoke of a constant fear of being tagged with a chip by a neighbour or someone else who works for either Pakistan or the US, and of the fear of being falsely accused of spying by local Taliban.\"</p><p>Reprieve's director, Clive Stafford Smith, said: \"An entire region is being terrorised by the constant threat of death from the skies. Their way of life is collapsing: kids are too terrified to go to school, adults are afraid to attend weddings, funerals, business meetings, or anything that involves gathering in groups.</p><p>\"George Bush wanted to create a global 'war on terror' without borders, but it has taken Obama's drone war to achieve his dream.\"</p>","headline":"Drone attacks in Pakistan are counterproductive, says report","trailText":"<p>US academics' report says drones kill large numbers of civilians and increase recruitment by militant groups</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"19","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/24/1348500465361/Pakistani-anti-drone-prot-004.jpg","wordcount":"931","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"396608643","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6700345","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1805556","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-09-28T04:01:01Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/drone-attacks-pakistan-counterproductive-report","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/25/drone-attacks-pakistan-counterproductive-report","tags":[{"id":"world/drones","webTitle":"Drones","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/drones","references":[]},{"id":"world/pakistan","webTitle":"Pakistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pakistan","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/human-rights","references":[]},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/law/law","references":[]},{"id":"profile/owenbowcott","webTitle":"Owen Bowcott","rcsId":"GNL004729","r2ContributorId":"16213","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/owen_bowcott_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Owen Bowcott is legal affairs correspondent.

The case was brought by families of victims killed in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/17/pakistan-army-chief-drone-attack\" title=\"\">a US drone strike on 17 March 2011</a>. The strike – one of more than 300 Obama has launched at Pakistan – is infamous: more than 50 people were killed, including many community elders who had gathered to settle a local dispute over a chromite mine. For the locals it was the equivalent of a strike on the high court itself.</p><p>The chief justice's first finding is perhaps the most obvious: \"[Drone strikes] are absolutely illegal and a blatant violation of sovereignty of the state of Pakistan.\" The strikes are, he says, international war crimes, given that there is no state of war between the US and its nominal ally, Pakistan.</p><p>It does not matter whether General Pervez Musharraf gave the CIA a wink and a nod when he was the country's dictator. \"[T]here is nothing in writing to the effect,\" writes the chief justice. In any event, no government can legitimately authorise the murder of its own citizens – certainly not without a public announcement through the democratic process. Indeed, Musharraf is currently facing the music for a number of illegal acts he allegedly took while in office.</p><p>The American use of drones is, in the chief justice's legal opinion, wholly disproportionate under international law. He notes that 9/11 still provides the US administration's pretext for a \"global war on terror\", yet there has been \"not a single … terror incident … anywhere in the USA\" emanating from Pakistan in more than a decade since. How, then, can it be proportionate to kill more than 3,000 Pakistanis, including \"infant babies, pre-teen and teenage children, women and others\".</p><p>Rather than respond with force first and ask questions afterwards, the chief justice orders the Pakistan government to try to solve the dispute through the rule of law. The Pakistan government must make an immediate and genuine complaint to the UN. If the UN security council reaches the appropriate conclusion (which he feels legally it must, absent a US veto), or the general assembly adopts a resolution, and \"the US authorities do not comply … the government of Pakistan shall sever all ties with the USA and as a mark of protest shall deny all logistic and other facilities to the USA within Pakistan\".</p><p>Then he makes another self-evident pronouncement: the Pakistan military's first obligation must be to preserve the security of its own citizens. The \"security forces shall ensure that in future such drone strikes are not conducted and carried out within the sovereign territory of Pakistan\". Again, rather than shoot first, the government shall administer a \"proper warning\"; if this does not work, the Pakistan air force must immediately shoot down the drones. Even though I am American myself, I find it hard to argue with this unhappy suggestion: after all, if the Pakistanis were terrorising Texas with Predator drones, I would expect Barack Obama to send the US air force into immediate action.</p><p>Ultimately, the US must bear full responsibility for its actions. \"The government of Pakistan shall mak[e] a request to the UN secretary general to constitute an independent war crime tribunal, to direct the US authorities to immediately stop the drone strikes ... and to immediately arrange for the complete and full compensation for the victims' families.\"</p><p>This judicial decision is all about democracy and the rule of law. America has held itself out as a proponent of these ideals for more than 200 years. It is a shame that the CIA's supposedly secret drones campaign marks such a sharp departure from both, following on from earlier policy catastrophes such as Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib.</p><p>In contrast, Saturday's election marked the first time in its 66-year history that Pakistan has made the transition from one democratically elected government to another. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/12/pakistan-elects-nawaz-sharif-imran\" title=\"\">The apparent victor, Nawaz Sharif's PLM-N party</a>, has promised to stop US drone strikes in Pakistan. The court's decision will light a judicial fire under this vow.</p>","headline":"Will Pakistan finally stand up against illegal US drone attacks?","trailText":"<strong>Clive Stafford Smith</strong>: The Peshawar high court has delivered a damning verdict on the strikes.

US officials say the vast majority of those killed are \"militants\". Earlier this week 48 people were killed in two strikes on tribal regions of Pakistan. The American definition of \"militant\" has been disputed by relatives and campaigners.</p><p>The attempt to seek an international arrest warrant for Rizzo is being led by the British human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith of the campaign group Reprieve, and lawyers in Pakistan. The lawyers are also building cases against other individuals, including drone operators interviewed or photographed during organised press facilities.</p><p>A first information report, the first step in seeking a prosecution of Rizzo in Pakistan, will be formally lodged early next week at a police station in the capital, Islamabad, on behalf of relatives of two people killed in drone strikes in 2009. The report will also allege Rizzo should be charged with conspiracy to murder a large number of Pakistani citizens.</p><p>Now retired, Rizzo, 63, is being pursued after <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-killing-machine.html\" title=\"\">admitting in an interview with the magazine Newsweek</a> that since 2004 he had approved one drone attack order a month on targets in Pakistan, even though the US is not at war with the country.</p><p>Rizzo, who was by his own admission \"up to my eyeballs\" in approving CIA use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", said in the interview that the CIA operated \"a hit list\". He also asked: \"How many law professors have signed off on a death warrant?\"</p><p>Rizzo has also admitted being present while civilian operators conducted drone strikes from their terminals at the CIA headquarters in Virginia.</p><p>Although US government lawyers have tried to argue that drone strikes are conducted on a \"solid legal basis\", some believe the civilians who operate the drones could be classified as \"unlawful combatants\".</p><p>US drone strikes were first launched on Pakistan by George Bush and have been accelerated by Barack Obama.</p><p>Much of the intelligence for the attacks is supplied either by the Pakistani military or the ISI, the country's controversial intelligence agency.</p><p>Both have blocked journalists and human rights investigators from visiting the tribal areas targeted, preventing independent verification of the numbers killed and their status.</p><p>While Stafford Smith of Reprieve estimates around 2,500 civilian deaths, others say the number is closer to 1,000. US sources deny large numbers of civilian deaths and say only a few dozen \"non-combatants\" have been killed.</p><p>While killing civilians in military operations is not illegal under international law unless it is proved to be deliberate, disproportionate or reckless, Stafford Smith believes the nature of the US drone campaign puts it on a different legal footing.</p><p>\"The US has to follow the laws of war,\" he said. \"The issue here is that this is not a war. There is zero chance, given the current political situation in Pakistan, that we will not get a warrant for Rizzo. The question is what happens next. We can try for extradition and the US will refuse.</p><p>\"Interpol, I believe, will have to issue a warrant because there is no question that it is a legitimate complaint.\"</p><p>The warrant will be sought on the basis of two test cases. The first centres on an incident on 7 September 2009 when a drone strike hit a compound during Ramadan, brought by a man named Sadaullah who lost both his legs and three relatives in the attack.</p><p>The second complaint was brought by Kareem Khan over a strike on 31 December 2009 in the village of Machi Khel in North Waziristan which killed his son and brother.</p><p>Both men allege Rizzo was involved in authorising the attack. The CIA refused to comment on the allegations.</p><p>The pursuit of Rizzo will further damage US-Pakistani relations, which are already under severe strain following years of drone attacks and the killing of Osama bin Laden in May. Last week the US suspended $800m (£495m) in military aid to Pakistan.</p><p>The US launched its first drone strike against a target in Pakistan in 2004, the only one for that year.

Morally, such methods have also been widely condemned by the west as a hallmark of savagery. Yet, as was demonstrated yet again this weekend in Pakistan, this has become one of the favorite tactics of the very same US government.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.policeone.com/terrorism/articles/86852-FBI-Again-Warns-of-Secondary-Explosive-Devices-Cautions-Officers-To-Watch-Surroundings/\">2004 official alert</a> from the FBI warned that \"terrorists may use secondary explosive devices to kill and injure emergency personnel responding to an initial attack\"; the bulletin advised that such terror devices \"are generally detonated less than one hour after initial attack, targeting first responders as well as the general population\". Security experts have long noted that the evil of this tactic lies in its exploitation of the natural human tendency to go to the scene of an attack to provide aid to those who are injured, and is specifically potent for sowing terror by instilling in the population an expectation that attacks can, and likely will, occur again at any time and place:</p><blockquote><p>\"'The problem is that once the initial explosion goes off, many people will believe that's it, and will respond accordingly,' [the Heritage Foundation's Jack] Spencer said … The goal is to 'incite more terror. If there's an initial explosion and a second explosion, then we're thinking about a third explosion,' Spencer said.\"</p></blockquote><p>A <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a494447.pdf\">2007 report</a> from the US department of homeland security christened the term \"double tap\" to refer to what it said was \"a favorite tactic of Hamas: a device is set off, and when police and other first responders arrive, a second, larger device is set off to inflict more casualties and spread panic.\" Similarly, the US justice department has highlighted this tactic in its prosecutions of some of the nation's most notorious domestic terrorists. Eric Rudolph, convicted of bombing gay nightclubs and abortion clinics, <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2005-07-18/justice/rudolph.sentencing_1_eric-rudolph-emily-lyons-birmingham-bombing-and-three?_s=PM:LAW\">was said</a> to have \"targeted federal agents by placing second bombs nearby set to detonate after police arrived to investigate the first explosion\".</p><p>In 2010, when WikiLeaks published a video of the incident in which an Apache helicopter in Baghdad killed two Reuters journalists, what sparked the greatest outrage was not the initial attack, which the US army claimed was aimed at armed insurgents, but rather the follow-up attack on those who arrived at the scene to rescue the wounded. From<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\"> the Guardian's initial report</a> on the WikiLeaks video:</p><blockquote><p>\"A van draws up next to the wounded man and Iraqis climb out. They are unarmed and start to carry the victim to the vehicle in what would appear to be an attempt to get him to hospital. One of the helicopters opens fire with armour-piercing shells. 'Look at that. Right through the windshield,' says one of the crew. Another responds with a laugh.</p><p>\"Sitting behind the windscreen were two children who were wounded. </p><p>\"After ground forces arrive and the children are discovered, the American air crew blame the Iraqis. 'Well it's their fault for bringing kids in to a battle,' says one. 'That's right,' says another.</p><p>\"Initially the US military said that all the dead were insurgents.\"</p></blockquote><p>In the wake of that video's release, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/06/wikileaks-iraq-killing-vi_n_527383.html\">international condemnation</a> focused on the shooting of the rescuers who subsequently arrived at the scene of the initial attack. The New Yorker's Raffi Khatchadourian <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2010/04/the-wikileaks-video-and-the-rules-of-engagement.html\">explained</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"On several occasions, the Apache gunner appears to fire rounds into people after there is evidence that they have either died or are suffering from debilitating wounds. The rules of engagement and the law of armed combat do not permit combatants to shoot at people who are surrendering or who no longer pose a threat because of their injuries. What about the people in the van who had come to assist the struggling man on the ground? The Geneva conventions state that protections must be afforded to people who 'collect and care for the wounded, whether friend or foe.'\"</p></blockquote><p>He added that \"A 'positively identified' combatant who provides medical aid to someone amid fighting does not automatically lose his status as a combatant, and may still be legally killed,\" but – as is true for drone attacks – there is, manifestly, no way to know who is showing up at the scene of the initial attack, certainly not with \"positive identification\" (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/drones-yemen_b_1458668.html\">by official policy</a>, the US targets people in Pakistan and elsewhere for death even without knowing who they are). Even commentators <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/36106_Wikileaks_Video_Provokes_Debate_Over_War_Crimes\">who defended</a> the initial round of shooting by the Apache helicopter by claiming there was evidence that one of the targets was armed typically noted, \"the shooting of the rescuers, however, is highly disturbing.\"</p><p>But attacking rescuers (and arguably worse, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/07/unrestrained_savagery/\">bombing funerals of America's drone victims</a>) is now a tactic routinely used by the US in Pakistan. In February, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/\">documented</a> that \"the CIA's drone campaign in Pakistan has killed dozens of  civilians who had gone to help rescue victims or were attending funerals.\" Specifically: \"at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims.\" That initial TBIJ report detailed numerous civilians killed by such follow-up strikes on rescuers, and established precisely the terror effect which the US government has long warned are sown by such attacks:</p><blockquote><p>\"Yusufzai, who reported on the attack, says those killed in the follow-up strike 'were trying to pull out the bodies, to help clear the rubble, and take people to hospital.' The impact of drone attacks on rescuers has been to scare people off, he says: 'They've learnt that something will happen. No one wants to go close to these damaged building anymore.'\"</p></blockquote><p>Since that first bureau report, there have been<a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/06/04/cia-revives-attacks-on-rescuers-in-pakistan/\"> numerous other documented cases</a> of the use by the US of this tactic: \"On [4 June], US drones attacked rescuers in Waziristan in western Pakistan minutes after an initial strike, killing 16 people in total according to the BBC. On 28 May, drones were also reported to have returned to the attack in Khassokhel near Mir Ali.\" Moreover, \"between May 2009 and June 2011, at least 15 attacks on rescuers were reported by credible news media, including the New York Times, CNN, ABC News and Al Jazeera.\"</p><p>In June, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\">said</a> that if \"there have been secondary drone strikes on rescuers who are helping (the injured) after an initial drone attack, those further attacks are a war crime.\" There is no doubt that there have been.</p><p>(A different UN official, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Emmerson, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-should-hand-over-footage-of-drone-strikes-or-face-un-inquiry-8061504.html\">this weekend demanded</a> that the US \"must open itself to an independent investigation into its use of drone strikes or the United Nations will be forced to step in\", and warned that the demand \"will remain at the top of the UN political agenda until some consensus and transparency has been achieved\". For many American progressives, caring about what the UN thinks is so very 2003.)</p><p>The frequency with which the US uses this tactic is reflected by<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/tariq-khan-killed-cia-drone/story?id=15258659#.UDIo592PXdQ\"\"> this December 2011 report from ABC News</a> on the drone killing of 16-year-old Tariq Khan and his 12-year-old cousin Waheed, just days after the older boy <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2133282/The-boy-sitting-photos-protesting-deadly-US-drone-strikes--Three-days-later-killed--US-drone-says-Jemima-Khan.html\">attended a meeting</a> to protest US drones:</p><blockquote><p>\"Asked for documentation of Tariq and Waheed's deaths, Akbar did not provide pictures of the missile strike scene. Virtually none exist, since drones often target people who show up at the scene of an attack.\"</p></blockquote><p>Not only does that tactic intimidate rescuers from helping the wounded and removing the dead, but it also ensures that journalists will be unwilling to go to the scene of a drone attack out of fear of a follow-up attack.</p><p>This has now happened yet again this weekend in Pakistan, which witnessed what Reuters <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/us-drone-strikes-kill-pakistan\">calls</a> \"a flurry of drone attacks\" that \"pounded northern Pakistan over the weekend\", \"killing 13 people in three separate attacks\". The attacks \"came as Pakistanis celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid al-Fitr.\" At least <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/424117/us-drone-strike-kills-four-militants-in-pakistan-officials/\">one of these weekend strikes</a> was the type of \"double tap\" explosion aimed at rescuers which, the US government says, is the hallmark of Hamas:</p><blockquote><p>\"At least six militants were killed when US drones fired missiles twice on Sunday in North Waziristan Agency. </p><p>\"In the first strike, four missiles were fired on two vehicles in the Mana Gurbaz area of district Shawal in North Waziristan Agency, while two missiles were fired in the second strike at the same site where militants were removing the wreckage of their destroyed vehicles.\"</p></blockquote><p>An unnamed Pakistani official identically <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRSgGVNqSXm9i7ML3c7FDBM7djDw?docId=CNG.c1edd15a728475879a106e5c12399c08.c1\">told Agence France-Presse</a> that a second US drone \"fired two missiles at the site of this morning's attack, where militants were removing the wreckage of their two destroyed vehicles\". (Those killed by US drone attacks in Pakistan are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/02/deliberate_media_propaganda/\">more or less automatically deemed</a> \"militants\" by unnamed \"officials\", and then uncritically called such by most of the western press – a practice that inexcusably continues despite revelations that the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/singleton/\">has redefined</a> \"militants\" to mean \"all military-age males in a strike zone\".)</p><p>It is telling indeed that the Obama administration now routinely uses tactics in Pakistan long denounced as terrorism when used by others, and does so with so little controversy. Just in the past several months, attacks on funerals of victims have taken place <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/middleeast/yemen-suicide-attacks-toll-rises.html?_r=2\">in Yemen</a> (purportedly by al-Qaida) and <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/more-than-70-killed-by-car-bombing-at-funeral-in-syrian-town.html\">in Syria</a> (purportedly, though without evidence, by the Assad regime), and such attacks – understandably – sparked outrage. Yet, in the west, the silence about the Obama administration's attacks on funerals and rescuers is deafening.</p><p>But in the areas targeted by the US with these tactics, there is anything but silence.

Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, said: \"It is preposterous. The assertion that this programme is a secret is nothing short of absurd.</p><p>\"For more than two years, senior officials have been making claims about the programme both on the record and off. They've claimed that the programme is effective, lawful and closely supervised. If they can make these claims, there is no reason why they should not be required to respond to [FOIA] requests.\"</p><p>The so-called targeted killing programme has become one of the most controversial aspects of Obama's national security policy. It has been used in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia to strike at suspected terrorists and their supporters. Proponents of the programme say attacks can be highly accurate and come at little risk to American forces as there is no need for ground forces. Critics point out that there often civilian casualties and little is known about how targets are identified and targeted. </p><p>The London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism<a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/\"> tracks the strikes</a> and has calculated that there have been 344 CIA drone hits in Pakistan alone since 2002, killing up to 3,325 people, including 881 civilians. Another area of concern is the use of drones to kill American citizens, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/30/anwar-al-awlaki-dead\">radical American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki </a>and his 16-year-old Colorado-born son. Both died in drone strikes in Yemen and relatives have<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/world/middleeast/us-officials-sued-over-citizens-killed-in-yemen.html\"> sued top Pentagon and CIA officials</a> for damages.</p><p>The ACLU's demand for details of the programme – including documents related to its legal justification drawn up by the department of justice – is aimed at prompting a national debate on the scope of the drone programme and how it is used. Its legality is a particular issue. The memorandum justifying the legal basis for the targeted killing has now been requested by at least 10 members of Congress and three different lawsuits but it remains so secret that that acknowledging its existence is a classified matter. \"The public has a right to decide for itself whether or not the programme is lawful or moral,\" Jaffer said.</p><p>Some legal and security experts agree and believe that the current boom in drone warfare is only like to increase the demand for greater openness about how and why the weapons are used. Professor Amos Guiora, a national security and legal expert at the University of Utah, said: \"Given that the drones are the warfare of the future you need a public debate about what's being done in the public's name.\"</p>","headline":"ACLU takes CIA to court as agency denies existence of drone programme","trailText":"<p>Despite references by president and defence secretary, CIA has refused FOIA

He decided not to reward her because during the protracted sale she had \"moved to the Libyan camp\".</p><p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Peter Smith explained that the dispute turned on whose evidence he accepted. Both Sharab and Al-Waleed appeared in person but the judge said he had \"overwhelmingly concluded\" that he preferred Sharab's account.</p><p>The ruling is an embarrassment for the prince, who is a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. The prince has already attracted media attention by suing Forbes magazine in London over an article published alongside its coveted rich list, which he claims underestimated his fortune by $9.6bn (£6.1bn). He claims he is worth $30bn.</p><p>Through his Kingdom Holding Company, Al-Waleed owns significant stakes in Citigroup, News Corp and Apple, among other companies. As well as the Savoy in London, he is also the owner or part-owner of the Plaza hotel in New York and the George V hotel in Paris.</p><p>Sharab, 52, said after the ruling: \"Today's decision has reinforced my belief in the fairness and impartiality of the English courts. I feel a great sense of relief … and thank Mr Justice Peter Smith for drawing a line under what has been a stressful seven years of litigation.</p><p>\"However, it will be extremely disappointing if the prince fails to accept the decision of this court and yet again attempts to delay payment of the agreed fee of $10m.\"</p><p>She was represented by Clive Freedman QC and Richard Waller at TLT Solicitors.</p><p>Her daughter, Noor Allawy, said: \"I hold Saudi Arabian citizenship and I am proud to be Saudi Arabian. However, it has been very sorrowful to see a Saudi Arabian prince fighting with my mother for seven years and standing against her in court.\"</p><p>The customised Airbus A340 at the centre of the dispute was fitted with a double bed, silver leather sofas and a whirlpool bath. It became a symbol of the Libyan dictator's private opulence and was put on display by rebel fighters after they captured it at Tripoli airport in 2011.</p><p>The court was told that  Sharab was initially contacted by the prince from Cannes in August 2001. He informed her that he had two aircraft, an Airbus – built in 1996 and purchased from the Brunei government – and a Boeing 767, both of which he wanted to sell.</p><p>Later that month she met an accountant who was said to be his personal representative at Ayoush restaurant in Marylebone. Sharab said that the following year she was instructed by the prince to begin negotiations. She set about arranging an audience with Gaddafi, whom she had known since meeting him at a business conference in Tripoli in the late 1980s.</p><p>Sharab said that in April 2003 she flew to Libya and was present when Al-Waleed and Gaddafi met. Both planes had been delivered and Gaddafi chose the Airbus.</p><p>She testified: \"The prince told me that if I could sell the aircraft for between $100m and $110m, he would pay me the $2m commission (which had been agreed previously) but that if I was able to negotiate a sale at above $110m, I could keep anything above that $110m.\"</p><p>In the end Gaddafi agreed to pay $120m. The final payment did not reach the Saudi prince until 2006. Sharab, who lives for part of the year in the UK, said she had received $500,000 commission from Al-Waleed for a previous deal.</p><p>Gaddafi subsequently fitted out the aircraft in the colours of his Afriqiyah Airways, and it became known as Afriqiyah One. It had red and grey carpets and nightclub-style spotlights on the ceiling.</p><p>In 2009 the personalised jet was used to collect the convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was ill and had been released on compassionate grounds from prison in Scotland. It was also used by Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, on jaunts around the world.</p><p>Shortly before the case was originally due to be heard in 2010, Sharab visited Libya again.

Between the three countries, there were around 55 strikes this year, a substantial drop from the roughly 92 in 2012.&nbsp;In 2013 the strikes killed up to 271 people, down from an estimate of between 505 and 532 in 2012. Approximately one in every nine to 10 deaths is a civilian. The data comes from estimates compiled by the New America Foundation, the Long War Journal and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.</p> <p>Yet attempts to correlate the decline in strikes to a decline in specific threats are blocked by secrecy, diplomatic contingency and political convenience, Zenko said.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the drawdown of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Zenko said, &ldquo;there has never been more available, both dedicated US and leased, satellite bandwidth; never been more strike drones available; and there&rsquo;s more people who can watch full-motion video [for targeting]. There has never been more assets available to kill people and strikes are going down. There&rsquo;s been a policy decision, and I think they&rsquo;ve been correct to emphasize that.&rdquo;</p> <p>A number of counterterrorism scholars consider 2013 to have been a good year for terrorist groups that claim to be motivated by Islam. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/al-qaeda-2013-101477.html\">cited a &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; for al-Qaida</a> &ndash; although the regeneration Gartenstein-Ross cited occurred among &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; groups of varying connection to the organization that attacked the US on 9/11, and in places mostly outside the reach of drones, such as Mali, Libya, Syria and Iraq.&nbsp;</p> <p>The exception is Somalia, where al-Shabab, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/02/shebab-qaida/\">an Islamist militia that formally joined al-Qaida in 2012</a>, launched a handful of terrorist attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, and a dramatic, deadly assault on Kenya&rsquo;s Westgate mall in September that killed 70 people. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/us-drone-strike-somalia-al-shabaab-expert\">The US responded with what is believed to be the only missile strike of the year</a>, apparently launched from a drone in October and leaving two dead.&nbsp;</p> <h2>'They have not opened a new front'</h2> <p>But despite the strength of groups believed to be aligned with al-Qaida, observers are yet to see an affiliated rise in either the groups&rsquo; sophistication or ability and ambition to attack the US at home. US officials and sympathetic analysts in 2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/09/30/does-al-shabab-pose-a-threat-on-american-soil/a-threat-to-the-us-and-its-interests-in-east-africa\">talked more of threats to &ldquo;US interests&rdquo; than threats to the American people</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only domestic attack in 2013 that might be considered jihadism came at the Boston marathon in April, from two brothers with no known connection to any terrorist organization. The actual threat posed by jihadist terrorism in 2013 remains the subject of fierce and unresolved debate.&nbsp;</p> <p>In May, Obama signaled a discomfort with the rise in drone strikes that have become synonymous with his stewardship of counterterrorism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/obama-drones-guantanamo-speech-text\">during a speech at the National Defense University</a>. While Obama did not pledge to end the strikes &ndash; and indeed sharply defended them &ndash; he placed new emphasis on avoiding them.</p> <p>Zenko said the available data did not show &ldquo;big changes pre-speech or post-speech&rdquo;, but did indicate that the strikes had, at least temporarily, stopped proliferating.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;To their credit, they have not opened a new front in Syria, Iraq or North Africa,&rdquo; Zenko said.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the strikes did not end after the speech, there was an increase in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/us-raid-al-shabaab-somalia-navy-seals\">raids, from Libya to Somalia, conducted by elite troops and the CIA</a> and aiming to capture terrorist operatives rather than kill them. Administration officials have stopped short of declaring such raids a policy shift &ndash; either because no such shift occurred or because the veil of secrecy surrounding drone strikes prevents such a declaration.</p> <p>The data also points to other patterns that cut against the Obama administration&rsquo;s typical contention that the strikes kill senior terrorist leaders, the standard the president set in the president's May speech.&nbsp;In tribal Pakistan, the initial front of US drone strikes, there was a steep rise in strikes in 2010 and a continued high rate in 2011, followed by a decline in 2012 and a steeper decline in 2013. The pattern fits the rise and fall of the US troop surge in neighboring Afghanistan, suggesting that the strikes in Pakistan had more to do with protecting nearby US troops than killing al-Qaida&rsquo;s top operatives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zenko gave Obama &ldquo;a lot of credit&rdquo; for acknowledging the so-called &ldquo;force protection&rdquo; component of the Pakistan strikes in his May speech &ndash; a detail that got little media attention.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;No longer was there just the nonsense of a significant, imminent threat to the homeland,&rdquo; Zenko said.</p> <p>There is no comparable US troop presence in Yemen, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/yemen-drone-strikes-us-policy\">strikes in Yemen</a>, a relative rarity before the 2010 rise of al-Qaida&rsquo;s local affiliate, swelled to more than 40 in 2012, before dropping off this year to around 26. The drop occurred despite a highly-publicized threat warning in the summer, attributed to the group, that prompted the closure of regional US diplomatic facilities and a temporary rise in strikes on Yemen.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Zenko took a closer look at local announcements of Yemen strikes by the US-sponsored security departments, he said, he found them typically attributed to reports of threats to the Yemeni military or police; generic &ldquo;threat warnings&rdquo;; or to US diplomats. While government statements on counterterrorism provide no guarantee of truth, those in Yemen rarely had to do with attempts on the United States.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Counterterrorism run amok?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b14545ce-b776-47f1-b671-6d8a0a538d9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/31/1388519768431/42a8baee-e4ee-4dee-b70b-a53a2c2705a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protest against US drone attacks\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>People burn a mock US flag during a protest against US drone attacks in Pakistan. Photograph: STR/EPA</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with Guant&aacute;namo Bay and bulk surveillance by the National Security Agency, drone strikes have become an international symbol of US counterterrorism efforts run amok.&nbsp;</p> <p>The new government of Pakistan has made the strikes a point of diplomatic contention with Washington, although the country's security services have facilitated them in the past. In Yemen, where the government is more openly aligned with the US on counterterrorism, anger about and fear of drones have become a cultural phenomenon, as a local activist testified to the Senate in the spring, citing parents who used threats of the drones to discipline misbehaving children.&nbsp;</p> <p>In October, the United Nations special rapporteur investigating drone strikes, Ben Emmerson, cited 33 cases in which drone strikes, mostly by the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/18/drone-strikes-us-violate-law-un\">killed civilians and potentially violated international law</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Emmerson called on the US government to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding the strikes, which are conducted by the CIA and the military&rsquo;s Joint Special Operations Command, an elite force that has even fewer requirements to brief legislators than does the CIA. Obama&rsquo;s speech in May did not yield greater transparency on what the administration has called &ldquo;targeted killing&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p>That, Zenko said, obscured an analysis of the 2013 frequency of &ldquo;signature strikes&rdquo;, the most notorious of US counterterrorism efforts: operations that kill not specific, known terrorists but individuals, often &ldquo;military aged males&rdquo;, believed to fit a pattern of terrorist behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re stopping signature strikes,&rdquo; Zenko said, &ldquo;because it acknowledges they&rsquo;ve done them.&rdquo;</p>","headline":"Fewer deaths from drone strikes in 2013 after Obama policy change","trailText":"Strikes this year are estimated to have killed up to 271 people, down from 2012 figure of between 505 and 532","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/30/1388422720163/Drone-MQ-9-Reaper-003.jpg","wordcount":"1235","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"426031908","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"52c317cee4b053cde70cfbba","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Spencer Ackerman in Washington","internalPageCode":"2019841","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-03T15:00:52-05:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/31/deaths-drone-strikes-obama-policy-change","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/dec/31/deaths-drone-strikes-obama-policy-change","tags":[{"id":"world/drones","webTitle":"Drones","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/drones","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/usforeignpolicy","webTitle":"US foreign policy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usforeignpolicy","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-military","webTitle":"US military","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-military","references":[]},{"id":"world/cia","webTitle":"CIA","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/cia","references":[]},{"id":"world/al-qaida","webTitle":"Al-Qaida","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-qaida","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/al-qaida","references":[]},{"id":"world/pakistan","webTitle":"Pakistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/pakistan","references":[]},{"id":"world/yemen","webTitle":"Yemen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/yemen","references":[]},{"id":"world/somalia","webTitle":"Somalia","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/somalia","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/spencerackerman","webTitle":"Spencer Ackerman","r2ContributorId":"22229","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/7/1370612137660/SpencerAckerman.png","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Spencer Ackerman is national security editor for Guardian US.

I'd start with: \"How many women and children have you seen incinerated by a Hellfire missile?\" And: \"How many men have you seen crawl across a field, trying to make it to the nearest compound for help while bleeding out from severed legs?\" Or even more pointedly: \"How many soldiers have you seen die on the side of a road in Afghanistan because our ever-so-accurate UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were unable to detect an IED [improvised explosive device] that awaited their convoy?\" </p><p>Few of these politicians who so brazenly proclaim the benefits of drones have a real clue of what actually goes on. I, on the other hand, have seen these awful sights first hand. </p><p>I knew the names of some of the young soldiers I saw bleed to death on the side of a road. I watched dozens of military-aged males die in Afghanistan, in empty fields, along riversides, and some right outside the compound where their family was waiting for them to return home from the mosque. </p><p>The US and British militaries<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/in-defence-of-drones-keep-civilians-troops-safe\"> insist </a> that this is an expert program, but it's curious that they feel the need to deliver <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/resaercher-most-civilian-drone-deaths-from-faulty-information/1622442.html\">faulty information</a>, <a href=\"http://web.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute/counterterrorism/drone-strikes/counting-drone-strike-deaths\">few or no statistics about civilian deaths</a> and twisted technology reports on the capabilities of our UAVs. These specific incidents are not isolated, and the civilian casualty rate<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/31/civilian-drone-deaths-pakistan-report_n_4180293.html\"> has not changed</a>, despite what our defense representatives might like to tell us. </p><p>What the public needs to understand is that the video provided by a drone is not usually clear enough to detect someone carrying a weapon, even on a crystal-clear day with limited cloud and perfect light. This makes it incredibly difficult for the best analysts to identify if someone has weapons for sure. One example comes to mind: \"The feed is so pixelated, what if it's a shovel, and not a weapon?\" I felt this confusion constantly, as did my fellow UAV analysts. We always wonder if we killed the right people, if we endangered the wrong people, if we destroyed an innocent civilian's life all because of a bad image or angle. </p><p>It's also important for the public to grasp that there are human beings operating and analysing intelligence these UAVs. I know because I was one of them, and nothing can prepare you for an almost daily routine of flying combat aerial surveillance missions over a war zone. UAV proponents claim that troops who do this kind of work are not affected by observing this combat because they are never directly in danger physically.</p><p>But here's the thing: I may not have been on the ground in Afghanistan, but I watched parts of the conflict in great detail on a screen for days on end. I know the feeling you experience when you see someone die. Horrifying barely covers it. And when you are exposed to it over and over again it becomes like a small video, embedded in your head, forever on repeat, causing psychological pain and suffering that many people will hopefully never experience. UAV troops are victim to not only the haunting memories of this work that they carry with them, but also the guilt of always being a little unsure of how accurate their confirmations of weapons or identification of hostile individuals were. </p><p>Of course, we are trained to not experience these feelings, and we fight it, and become bitter. Some troops seek help in mental health clinics provided by the military, but we are limited on who we can talk to and where, because of the secrecy of our missions. I find it interesting that the suicide statistics in this career field aren't reported, nor are the data on how many troops working in UAV positions are heavily medicated for depression, sleep disorders and anxiety. </p><p>Recently, the Guardian ran a commentary by Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/in-defence-of-drones-keep-civilians-troops-safe\">secretary of state for defence, Philip Hammond</a>. I wish I could talk to him about the two friends and colleagues I lost, within a year of leaving the military, to suicide. I am sure he has not been notified of that little bit of the secret UAV program, or he would surely take a closer look at the full scope of the program before defending it again. </p><p>The UAVs in the Middle East are used as a weapon, not as protection, and as long as our public remains ignorant to this, this serious threat to the sanctity of human life – at home and abroad – will continue.</p><p><em>• Editor's note: Heather Linebaugh does not possess any classified material and has honored her non-disclosure agreement since the time of her discharge. </em></p>","headline":"I worked on the US drone program.

Many in&nbsp;Pakistan&nbsp;also consider it an affront to their sovereignty but the US has shown no indication it is willing to halt the program.</p> <p>Angered over the strikes, supporters from cricket star-turned politician Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party in the northwest have been protesting along a main road used to truck NATO troop supplies in and out of Afghanistan for the past month, forcing the US to stop shipments out of Afghanistan.</p> <p>Khan has urged the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to force the US to end drone attacks and block NATO supplies across the country.</p> <p>On Thursday, about 150 supporters from Khan's party on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Quetta briefly blocked trucks carrying supplies for NATO forces heading toward Afghanistan, said a senior police official Abdul Rauf.

But critics are not nearly as effective as the manufacturers themselves when it comes to making drones sound evil. General Atomics decided on the name Predator drone. And the Reaper surely attracts the image of the Grim Reaper, harvesting the souls of those damned with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/23/israel6\" title=\"\">Hellfire missiles</a>.</p><p>Hammond focuses almost solely on Afghanistan, where at least there has been a war for the past decade. He writes: \"This capability saves the lives of our personnel, our Afghan allies and Afghan civilians on a daily basis.\" Yet he completely ignores the most contentious use of Hellfire missiles, terrorising swaths of Pakistan and Yemen, where no war has even been declared. Indeed, Hammond's snapshot of what he calls the \"precision\" RPA is presented in the same week as the latest drone atrocity, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/air-strike-yemen-15-wedding-guest-killed-mistaken-al-qaida?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">at least 15 Yemeni people slaughtered in what turned out to be a convoy of wedding guests</a>, not al-Qaida terrorists.</p><p>Hammond says it's wrong to suggest that \"the government's use of unmanned and remotely piloted aircraft is shrouded in secrecy\". Yet his government (with several taxpayer-funded QCs) is fighting tooth and nail <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/uk_must_not_hide_drone_war_involvement/\" title=\"\">to keep secret Britain's policy for co-operating with illegal US drone attacks</a>. And neither the US nor the UK will say how many civilians they think they are killing, although we at Reprieve represent more than 150 civilian victims and families of those killed in drone strikes.</p><p>Hammond tells us that \"the most basic falsehood\" of all is the notion of automation. They are piloted, he says – albeit by a pilot drinking coffee thousands of miles from the target. Yet it is the ambition of the UK military – along with the Americans and everyone else – to develop genuinely autonomous drones.
