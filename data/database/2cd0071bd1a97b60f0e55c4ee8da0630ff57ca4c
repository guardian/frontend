        "body":"<p><strong>Last Friday, Tim Cook issued a sombre remembrance to Apple employees:</strong><br /><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Team-<br /></em><em>Tomorrow marks the second anniversary of Steve's death. I hope everyone will reflect on what he meant to all of us and to the world. Steve was an amazing human being and left the world a better place. I think of him often and find enormous strength in memories of his friendship, vision and leadership. He left behind a company that only he could have built and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. We will continue to honour his memory by dedicating ourselves to the work he loved so much. There is no higher tribute to his memory. I know that he would be proud of all of you.<br /></em><em>Best,<br /></em><em>Tim</em></p><p>I am one of the many who are in Steve's debt and I miss him greatly. I consider him the greatest creator and editor of products this industry has ever known, and am awed by how he managed the most successful transformation of a company – and of himself – we've ever seen. I watched his career from its very beginning, I was fortunate to have worked with him, and I thoroughly enjoyed agreeing and disagreeing with him.</p><p>I tried to convey this in an 9 October, 2011 Monday Note titled <a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/2011/10/09/too-soon/\">Too Soon</a>. I just reread it and hope you'll take the time to do the same. You'll read words of dissent by Richard Stallman and Hamilton Nolan, but you'll mostly find praise by Barack Obama, John Stewart, Nicholson Baker in the New Yorker, and this elegant image by Jonathan Mak:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/steve_silouhette.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5811\" alt=\"steve_silouhette\" src=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/steve_silouhette.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></a></p><p>Two years later, we can look at Apple under Tim Cook's leadership. These haven't been an easy 24 months: company shares have gone on a wild ride, execs have been shown the door, there was the Maps embarrassment and apology, and there has been a product drought for most of the last fiscal year (ending in September).</p><p>All of this has provided fodder for the Fox Newsstands of the Web, for netwalkers seeking pageviews. The main theme is simple and prurient, hence its power: Without Steve, Apple is on the decline. The variations range from the lack of innovation – where's the Apple TV?, the iWatch?, the next Big Thing? – to The Decline of the Brand, Android Is Winning, and Everything Will Be Commoditised.</p><p>Scan Philip Ellmer-DeWitt's <a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/category/apple-2-0/\">Apple 2.0</a> or John Gruber's <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net\">Daring Fireball</a> and treat yourself to intelligent repudiations of this incessant \"<a href=\"http://401stblow.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/claim-chowder/\">claim chowder</a>\", discredited pontifications.

His explanation draws from a substantial <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/and-then-steve-said-let-there-be-an-iphone.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">New York Times Magazine</a> article in which Fred Vogelstein describes the convergence of company-wide risk-taking and engineering feats that resulted in the iPhone:<br /><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>It's hard to overstate the gamble Jobs took when he decided to unveil the iPhone back in January 2007. Not only was he introducing a new kind of phone – something Apple had never made before – he was doing so with a prototype that barely worked. Even though the iPhone wouldn't go on sale for another six months, he wanted the world to want one right then. In truth, the list of things that still needed to be done was enormous. </em></p><p>It's a great read. But even Vogelstein can't resist the temptation of inserting a word of caution: \"<em>And yet Apple today is under siege …\" </em></p><p>This is something I heard 33 years ago when I signed up to start Apple France in 1980, and I've heard it constantly since then. I'll again quote Horace Dediu, who best summarises the concern:<br /><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\"[There's a] perception that Apple is not going to survive as a going concern. </em><strong><em>At this point of time, as at all other points of time in the past, no activity by Apple has been seen as sufficient for its survival</em></strong><em>. Apple has always been priced as a company that is in a perpetual state of free-fall. It's a consequence of being dependent on breakthrough products for its survival. No matter how many breakthroughs it makes, the assumption is (and has always been) that there will never be another. When Apple was the Apple II company, its end was imminent because the Apple II had an easily foreseen demise. </em><strong><em>When Apple was a Mac company its end was imminent because the Mac was predictably going to decline. Repeat for iPod, iPhone and iPad.</em></strong><em> It's a wonder that the company is worth anything at all.\"</em></p><p>I recently experienced a small epiphany: I think the never-ending worry about Apple's future is a good thing for the company. Look at what happened to those who were on top and became comfortable with their place under the sun: Palm, BlackBerry, Nokia …</p><p>In ancient Rome, victorious generals marched in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_triumph\">triumph</a> to the Capitol. Lest the occasion go to the army commander's head, a slave would march behind the victor, murmuring in his ear, <em>memento mori</em>, \"remember you're mortal\".</p><p>With that in mind, one can almost appreciate the doomsayers – well, some of them. They might very well save Apple from becoming inebriated with their prestige and, instead, force the company to remember, two years later and counting, how they won it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419238728|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1c1e57bcd485f7e4188f8b9b24ce9458fe31f3e2 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Quartz (</strong><a href=\"http://qz.com\"><strong>qz.com</strong></a><strong>) is the kind of media most business writers would love to be part of.</strong> It's smart, fun, witty, basic and sophisticated at the same time. Like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive\">Jony Ive</a> design at Apple, its apparent simplicity is the combined product of deep thought and of a series of bold moves by its owner, the Atlantic Media group, publisher of the eponymous monthly. From all standpoints, content, organisation or even business model, Quartz came up with innovations (see the Monday Note I wrote for <a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/2012/09/30/quartz-interesting-and-uncertain/\">the launch in September 2012</a>).</p><p>Ten days ago, my phone interview with editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney, started with a discussion of his newsroom of 25 writers and editors. On Tuesday September 24 at 9pm Paris Time, Quartz had this piece at the top of its infinite scroll:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Quartz-illustr.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-5809\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"Quartz illustr\" src=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Quartz-illustr.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"583\" /></a></p><p>Editorially, this epitomises (in a way) what Quartz is about: topics addressed through well-defined angles (in <a href=\"http://qz.com/127861/its-time-to-kill-the-idea-that-amazon-is-killing-independent-bookstores/\">this case</a>, the idea that if Amazon hit large book retailers hard, it didn't have much impact on small independent bookstores.) The story was short but right to the point – taking the opposite side of the now worn tale of Amazon devastating the book-selling landscape. To illustrate his piece, instead of using yet another photograph of Jeff Bezos haranguing a crowd, the <em>writer</em> picked this weird image of a girl showing off at a bookstore event.</p><p>Yes, at Quartz, journalists are the ones who get to select the pictures that go with their article. Most of the time, this yields better audience numbers.</p><p>Actually, explains Kevin Delaney, the staff are supposed to produce a complete package, ready to be processed by editors, with links, headline, photos (lifted from Reuters, Getty, AP or sometime the Creative Commons trove) properly cropped and adjusted. Everything is done within a Wordpress interface, chosen for its versatility, but also because most journalists already know to use it. As for headlines (the task usually handled by editors), the Quartz newsroom relies on team chats to quickly and collaboratively work on pieces.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kevin_delaney.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5810\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"kevin_delaney\" src=\"http://www.mondaynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kevin_delaney.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"178\" /><br /></a><em>Kevin Delaney (photo: Quartz)</em></p><p>The same goes for graphics like in <a href=\"http://qz.com/132310/the-definitive-chart-that-shows-why-twitter-is-not-facebook/\">this snapshot</a> of Tweeter's IPO prospectus, a part of the magazine's comprehensive coverage of the upcoming event. To further encourage the use of graphics and charts in stories, <a href=\"http://qz.com/author/davidyanofskyquartz/\">David Yanofsky</a>, one of Quartz journalist/coder/data hackers developed ChartBuilder an easy to use infographic tool. As an internet-native company, Quartz threw its software in the open-source world (see how it looks <a href=\"http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/\">in Github</a>) – an unthinkable move in the close-to-the-vest legacy media world …</p><p><strong>While listening to Delaney describing his organization,</strong> I couldn't help but mentally itemize what separates its super-agile setup from traditional media. A couple of months ago, I met the digital management of a major UK newspaper. There, execs kept whining about the slow pace evolution of the news staff and the struggle to get writers to add links and basic metadata (don't even think about pix or graphics) to their work product. By and large, most legacy media I know of, in France, UK and the United States, are years behind swift boats such as Quartz, Politico or the older but still sharp Slate.</p><p>I used to think the breadth and depth of older large newsrooms could guarantee their survival in a digital world plagued by mediocrity and loose ethics. But considering great pure players like Quartz – which is just the latest offspring of a larger league – I now come to think we are witnessing the emergence of a new breed of smaller, digital-only outlets that are closing the gap, quality-wise, with legacy media. In the context of an increasingly segmented and short-on-time readership, I can only wonder how long the legacy newsroom's strategic advantage of size and scope will last.</p><p><strong>Quartz editorial staff has nothing to do with the low-paid, poultry farm</strong> newsrooms of many digital outlets. Most of the 25 journalists and editors (out a staff of 50) were drawn from well established brands such as Bloomberg, the Economist, Reuters, New York Magazine or the Wall Street Journal (Kevin Delaney, 41, is himself a former WSJ.com managing editor). \"Our staff is slightly younger than the average newsroom, and it is steeped in the notion of entrepreneurial journalism\", says the Quartz editor-in-chief. \"With Quartz, we had many opportunity to rethink the assumptions of traditional media\".</p><p>The original idea was to devise how the Economist would look like if it had been born in 2012 rather than in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist\">1843</a>, explains Delaney. It would be digital native, mostly for mobile reading, and focus on contemporary economic engines such as digital, globalisation, e-commerce, the future of energy, debt, China, etc. Instead of abiding by the usual classification of business news that looks like a nomenclature from the bureau of labour statistics  (industry, services, markets, trade, etc.), Quartz opted for a sexier taxonomy; its coverage is based on an <a href=\"http://qz.com/about/our-current-obsessions-2/\">evolving list of \"Obsessions</a>\", a much more cognitive-friendly way to consider the news cycle than the usual \"beat\" (read <a href=\"http://newsthing.net/2012/09/16/quartz-obsessions-phenomenology-of-news/\">this</a> on the matter). As an avid magazine reader, Delaney said he derived the idea from publications like <a href=\"http://nymag.com/\">New York Magazine</a>.</p><p><strong>The challenge is connecting this categorisation to audience expectations …</strong> Hence the importance of the social reverberation of Quartz treatments. They translate into stunning numbers: according to Kevin Delaney, 85% to 90% of its traffic is \"earned\" and social referrals account for 50% of the site's traffic. In other words, the traffic coming from people typing <a href=\"http://qz.com\">http://qz.com</a> in their browser accounts for only 10-15% of the volume. To put things in perspective, on a legacy media site, social traffic weighs about 5% – in some rare cases 10% – and around 40% to 50% of the pages views are generated via the home page.</p><p>Since the site is nothing else but an infinite rolling page of stories, there is no classic jumping board home page. Another obsession of Quartz founders: \"We wanted to minimise friction and encourage readers to share our stories. We designed the site first for tablets, then for mobile and as a classic website, in that order,\" insists Kevin Delaney. No apps in sight, but a site built in HTML5 and responsive design that adjusts to screen size. At first, the no-app choice sounded weird for a media aimed at a mobile audience, but considering the rising costs and complexity of building, managing, and maintaining native apps on multiple platforms, a single HTML design was probably the best approach.</p><p>I'm not through talking about Quartz. Next week, we'll examine the venture's business aspects, its bold ways of dealing with advertising.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419234724|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|458a2bbd8343f85bafb228e7831900c242ac3404 -->",

An offline mode would have the additional benefit of providing room to the modding community to experiment without interfering or breaking the multiplayer experience.\"</p></blockquote><p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/state-of-simcity\">Patrick's blog post in full</a>.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-03-gaming-risks-a-repeat-of-1983-crash-report\">Gaming risks a repeat of 1983 crash - Report | GamesIndustry International</a></h2><p>In 1983, an over-abundance of competitive hardware and too many awful third-party software titles led to the great video game crash., when the industry really looked as though it call fall apart – at least in the States where they didn't have the wonder of the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro computers. Now one analyst thinks we're heading for another dip:</p><blockquote><p>The marketing push for next month's Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launches is beginning to ramp up, but not everyone is sold on the new consoles just yet. In a new report prepared by Superdata and released by Digital River, the research firm warned that the market for consoles is already crowded, with 79 percent of gamers already owning a console, and that group having an average of 2.6 consoles each. The report was based in part on a March survey of 1,105 respondents.</p><p>\"Industry veterans will remember the crash of 1983, when the games market was saturated with hardware devices,\" the report states. \"Today, the industry runs a similar risk, as [with] a higher-than-ever console installed base, consumers may be resistant to adding more hardware to their living rooms.\"</p></blockquote><p>Apparently, consumers will gravitate to multipurpose hardware, perhaps like Valve's Steam Machine. Although, of course, both Sony and Microsoft are keen to stress the multipurpose capabilities of their platforms. I don't think any of us have to panic just yet (will that be my Michael Fish moment?)</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/431236/features/50-insane-details-you-probably-missed-in-gta-v/\">50 insane details you probably missed in GTA V | CVG UK</a></h2><p>CVG has been digging around behind the Grand Theft Auto V sofa cushions to find little facts and sights you may not have noticed. Some of them are pretty sillY:</p><blockquote><p>If you attack Michael's house with an RPG, he'll text you and tell you to stop firing rockets at it.</p></blockquote><p>Some are nice little extra features:</p><blockquote><p>You can share music tracks you hear on the radio with friends on Rockstar Social Club.</p></blockquote><p>Definitely worth a flick through if you're stuck at work and can't play for a few hours...</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-04-state-of-decay-sells-one-million-copies\">State of Decay sells one million copies | Eurogamer.net</a></h2><p>Good news for indie developer Undead Labs; it's open world zombie adventure has sold one million copies:</p><blockquote><p>This is taking into account both XBLA sales as well as those who've purchased the incomplete Steam version on Early Access. By triple A accounts, one million may not sound like much, but for a smallish Seattle startup, that's a very healthy number.</p><p>The developer noted that its first DLC, Breakdown, will be available shortly, though no date was given. It then said it will give away five copies of it to random users who share a fond State of Decay related memory on the bottom of this blog post. The Breakdown add-on will contain a story-less Sandbox mode, new weapons, and new \"Hero\" NPCs that can carry items and do a better job of protecting players.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.edge-online.com/features/in-the-click-of-it-the-last-generation/\">In The Click Of It: the last generation | Features | Edge Online</a></h2><p>Veteran game designer Clint Hocking explains why he's not excited by the next-gen consoles – they're not sufficiently different from the old ones:</p><blockquote><p>Sure, I can have better graphics, but the graphics on current-generation consoles are amazing enough. Sure, I can potentially buy games more easily through more robust online stores, but I'm not really constrained by an inability to buy a game at a store, so what does an online store offer me? And while I am looking forward to crossplatform compatibility and being able to engage with certain games on the couch or on the bus, this is all possible on current-gen hardware. Why do I need a new console?</p><p>When I lie back and stare at the ceiling and try to imagine the experience that I think will typify the next generation of gaming, I see something completely different to what the next-generation consoles are offering.</p><p>I imagine that some time before the upcoming console generation ends, I will walk into my house and pick up a controller. The controller will detect that it has been moved and it will connect to my television and to the phone in my pocket. I will browse through the games that are on my phone (which is now my console) and I will select one and play it using my controller. Full HD and 7.1 audio will stream from my pocket to my television. And I won't be playing Angry Birds for the iPhone 3G either, I'll be playing GTAV.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting thoughts from the co-creator of ambitious titles like Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Far Cry 2.</p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:gdngames\">Press Start at Pinboard</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198875|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|70711e8c144836f1463a345f16725092bfb93663 -->",

        "body":"<p>Spotify celebrates its fifth birthday today, but the streaming music service probably shouldn't expect a present or card from Thom Yorke.</p><p>The Radiohead and Atoms for Peace musician has renewed his attack on Spotify in an <a href=\"http://www.sopitas.com/site/253083-entrevista-con-thom-yorke-de-atoms-for-peace/\">interview with Mexican website Sopitas</a>, describing the company as \"the last desperate fart of a dying corpse\", and attacking its relationship with major labels.</p><p>\"I feel like as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing. I feel that in some ways what's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen,\" Yorke told Sopitas.</p><p>\"But it's all about how we change the way we listen to music, it's all about what happens next in terms of technology, in terms of how people talk to each other about music, and a lot of it could be really fucking bad.\"</p><p>The interview follows Atoms for Peace's decision earlier this year to pull its albums from Spotify and other streaming services, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/thom-yorke-spotify-twitter\">Yorke and bandmate Nigel Godrich sparking a heated debate</a> with their tweeted views on Spotify being bad for emerging artists.</p><p>The new interview is Yorke's longest yet explaining his views, as he compares Spotify to what Radiohead did with their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/07/musicnews.music\">In Rainbows album in 2007</a>, self-releasing it online and allowing fans to set their own price for the download.</p><p>\"When we did the In Rainbows thing what was most exciting was the idea you could have a direct connection between you as a musician and your audience. You cut all of it out, it's just that and that. And then all these fuckers get in a way, like Spotify suddenly trying to become the gatekeepers to the whole process,\" said Yorke.</p><p>\"We don't need you to do it. No artists needs you to do it. We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off. But because they're using old music, because they're using the majors… the majors are all over it because they see a way of re-selling all their old stuff for free, make a fortune, and not die.\"</p><p>Spotify has become a lightning rod for criticism of streaming music by artists in recent months, partly because it's the biggest service of its kind, with more than 24m active users and 6m paying subscribers.</p><p>The company has defended itself by pointing to the money it has paid out to music rightsholders – $500m by the end of 2012, with another $500m expected this year. And while that doesn't answer Yorke's specific criticism about major labels, Spotify has been praised by companies in the independent music world too.</p><p>In January, Beggars Group chairman Martin Mills said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/04/record-labels-making-money-youtube\">22% of his label group's digital revenues had come from streaming</a> in 2012. Meanwhile, independent labels' trade body Merlin – which like the major labels has a stake in Spotify – said in May that <a href=\"http://www.merlinnetwork.org/membersurvey/\">a third of its members had seen streaming revenues more than double</a> in the last year.</p><p>Spotify has also been hailed as a key factor in the music industry's comeback in countries like <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/21/swedish-music-sales-up-12-in-first-half-of-2013/\">Sweden</a> and <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/11/streaming-still-storming-as-norwegian-music-sales-rise-17-year-on-year/\">Norway</a>, where recorded music revenues rose 12% and 17% respectively in the first half of 2013, following more growth in 2012 after a decade of declining music sales.</p><p>Thom Yorke remains unconvinced that streaming is the answer to artists' problems, though. \"To me this isn't the mainstream, this is is like the last fart, the last desperate fart of a dying corpse. What happens next is the important part,\" he told Sopitas, before suggesting that the music industry should rethink its backing for certain new business models.</p><p>\"It's like this mind trick going on, people are like 'with technology, it's all going to become one in the cloud and all creativity is going to become one thing and no one is going to get paid and it's this big super intelligent thing'. Bullshit,\" said Yorke.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419214746|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1d517394cebe1695069d9ffdc51babb62852fe32 -->",

Er, typing experience. And in adapting to the keys on the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard, I've noticed that my transition to the flat keyboard on my Samsung is easier than it was in the past, when I was coming off the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. They're just more similar. But the short throw on each is, I think, an advantage.</p></blockquote><p>\"Island\" keyboards are the ones where the keys are separately spaced - so each rises vertically out of the key area, rather than all touching at the base.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-next-google-glass-132951075.html\">Here's what's next for Google Glass &gt;&gt; Yahoo Finance</a></h2><p>Monty Munford: </p><blockquote><p> then there are the uber-mavens, the 8,000 special ones that Google personally invited to be a Glass Explorer.

Then, HTC's CEO Peter Chou came on stage and reminisced that his company has sold more than 40 million HTC Windows Mobile devices around the world. Chou: \"12 years ago when we started our company, we met with Microsoft early on. It was clear that we shared the same vision of smart connectivity. I'm an old veteran of Windows Mobile. We try really hard to make all the visions happen, and we have sold more than 40 million HTC Windows mobile phones around the world.\"</p><p>The next conclusion to make is that the other 49 OEM partners, including Palm, Motorola and Samsung, have sold 10 million phones all combined.</p></blockquote><p>The next year, HTC rode the Android wave and in 2011 had its biggest-ever revenues.

An extract: </p><blockquote><p>\"I understood how it could be done,\" [Tony] Fadell says. \"But it's one thing to think that, and another to take a room full of special, one-off gear and make a million phone-size versions of that in a cost-effective, reliable manner.\" The to-do list was exhausting just to think about. \"You had to go to LCD vendors who knew how to embed technology like this in glass; you had to find time on their line; and then you had to come up with compensation and calibrating algorithms to keep the pixel electronics from generating all kinds of noise in the touch-screen\" — which sat on top of the LCD. \"It was a whole project just to make the touch-screen device. We tried two or three ways of actually making the touch-screen until we could make one in enough volume that would work.\"</p><p>Shrinking OS X and building a multitouch screen, while innovative and difficult, were at least within the skills Apple had already mastered as a corporation. No one was better equipped to rethink OS X's design. Apple knew LCD manufacturers because it put an LCD in every laptop and iPod. Mobile-phone physics was an entirely new field, however, and it took those working on the iPhone into 2006 to realize how little they knew.</p></blockquote><p>Save some time and read it all.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://english.etnews.com/communication/2839280_1300.html\">Korean mobile phone market to post negative growth &gt;&gt; ET News</a></h2><blockquote><p>What is notable is that unlike the global trend, only Korea will suffer drastic decline in sales. Unlike Korea, not only leading economies such as the United States, Europe, and Japan but also emerging markets including China, India, Southeast Asian countries, and the like are expected to see mobile phone sales grow.</p><p>This year's mobile phone sales in Korea are expected to reach 27.3m units, 16.3% down from 32.6m of last year. The Korean mobile phone market has steadily grown since 2010. Prior to 2010, mobile phone sales continued to grow in overall, with a slight letup in some years. Therefore, the abrupt drop in mobile phone sales this year is deemed to be unprecedented.</p></blockquote><p>Reasons are reckoned to be widespread penetration of smartphones, and availability of LTE - but also to the reduction of subsidies.

The secretary of the German services union Verdi has told Der Spiegel magazine that Amazon \"shouldn't rely on being able to keep all their promises to customers before Christmas\" and that the union would call strikes when it would hurt the company most.</p><p>Germany has had strikes by Amazon employees this year over wages. In June and September several hundred workers at the US company's distribution centres in Leipzig, Saxony and Bad Hersfeld in the Hesse region  walked out. Verdi has around 2.2 million members and has said it wants to force Amazon to negotiate a collective wage agreement that complies with standards in the German retail sector. Amazon claims that the wages it pays are above average in the logistics industry. \"Job descriptions for staff are typical of the logistics industry such as the storage, packaging and dispatch of goods,\" a spokeswoman for Amazon Germany told Reuters. The spokeswoman added that the strikes in June and September had not affected customers.</p><p>There is so far no detail on whether the strikes are planned again for the centres in Leipzig or Bad Hersfeld, or any other of the eight distribution centres in Germany.Amazon employs more than 9,000 in Germany but is reportedly considering opening five new centres in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189783|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|eae0fce88d68a84ab70ba21c0b6e34ba1366c505 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>But Brian Robbins warns children's TV broadcasters that if they don't make more shows for mobile consumption 'you're going to see the audience keep eroding'. By <strong>Stuart Dredge</strong></p>",
        "headline":"AwesomenessTV boss talks YouTube networks for kids: 'I don't think we're replacing television'",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/awesomenesstv\">AwesomenessTV</a> launched in the summer of 2012 as a YouTube multi-channel network (MCN) aimed at tweens and teenagers. In May 2013, it was <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/dreamworks-animation-acquires-youtube-network-awesomenesstv/241206/\">acquired by DreamWorks Animation</a> for $33m plus up to $117m in bonuses for hitting future earnings targets.</p><p>Now in October 2013, its main channel has more than 900,000 subscribers on YouTube and 176m views, but its wider network has 25m subscribers, nearly 2bn views and 65m monthly visitors. A rapid rise, to say the least.</p><p>Founder and chief executive Brian Robbins says that AwesomenessTV is capitalising on changing media habits of its young audience. \"They don't watch television any more, at least the way we used to watch television,\" he said during a keynote speech <a href=\"http://blog.mipworld.com/2013/10/liveblog-keynote-%E2%80%94-brian-robbins-awesomenesstv/\">at the MIPCOM conference</a> in Cannes.</p><p>Robbins said that children are still sitting on their sofas watching videos, but the source is now YouTube and the devices are smartphones and tablets. \"It's not just my kids, or kids in the US. It's kids everywhere,\" said Robbins, adding that half his company's views come from outside the US, and that half its views and comments come from mobile devices.</p><p>\"For kids their devices provide a gateway to their friends, and a means to consume the content that they love,\" he said. \"If you want to reach and engage kids, you have to go where they go, and that's online.\"</p><p>Robbins also explained that AwesomenessTV launched with 20 shortform shows, despite lots of advice (\"even from YouTube\") to focus on three or four instead.</p><p>\"Us adults, we like to eat meals, but kids snack, and they snack a lot. Where I might have a few marquee shows on my radar, kids, because they are on their devices all day and night, have both the time and appetite to consume a lot of content, especially around the things they're passionate about,\" he said.</p><p>Robbins also said that the people watching AwesomenessTV are also \"curating and creating\" their own content on YouTube: which includes sharing their favourite shows with friends, but also filming their own responses.</p><p>\"We're in this new era of entertainment where the lines between consuming content and participating in it are blurry,\" he said, before pointing to the global nature of YouTube, with 40% of the 80,000 channels in AwesomenessTV's network produced outside the US.</p><p>\"Kids really don't care where the content is coming from, just as long as it speaks to them,\" said Robbins. \"The bottom line is that creating videos that are funny, shareable and culturally relevant is the best way to engage this audience.\"</p><h2>Shortform shows</h2><p>Robbins showed the trailer for a new show called Side Effects, which blends story and musical covers in Glee-esque style, with a central character who suffers from \"musical hallucinations\" due to the medication that she's taking.</p><p>The show will be delivered in 5-6 minute episodes, even though the production quality makes it look like a show that could easily live on broadcast TV as full-length episodes.</p><p>\"I think YouTube right now is a shortform experience: kids love it for that, and it's where their attention span is,\" said Robbins. \"I don't love it as a filmmaker to be perfectly honest with you, but I love feeding their passion for content.\"</p><p>AwesomenessTV has experimented with taking some of its content to TV, signing a deal with Nickelodeon to produce a half-hour comedy sketches show collecting some of its popular online skits. It premiered in July, and according to Robbins it doubled the ratings for its time-slot on that network.</p><p>\"We want to play in both worlds. I think there's a great opportunity to start stuff on YouTube, develop it, build an audience and then drive it elsewhere in other forms, like we did with Nickelodeon,\" he said.</p><p>However, Robbins spoke at length about the challenges facing TV networks like Nickelodeon, walking a line between pitching AwesomenessTV as a new production partner for those companies, and as a fearsome new competitor poised to disrupt their businesses.</p><p>\"What's happening online today is very similar to what happened in television 25 years ago,\" he said. \"Just as branded cable networks like ESPN, CNN and MTV and Nickelodeon transformed television, a new generation of online channels is going to do the same thing,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think we're replacing television. Let's be really clear: people are watching more TV than ever, but we're filling the periods of time that these kids have, because they have these devices… If my kids aren't entertained every second, they lose their minds! And we're here to fill that gap.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419176592'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381054934369/side-effects.jpg' alt='Side Effects' width='460' height='180' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A still from Side Effects</figcaption></figure><h2>Advertising growth</h2><p>What about the challenges facing this new generation of online video networks? Most make their money predominantly from ads on YouTube, with regular speculation this year that those revenues may not yet be enough to fund profitable businesses – at least not those investing heavily in original shows.</p><p>Robbins, whose career has included producing TV shows Smallville and One Tree Hill, admitted that it's still much more profitable to have a popular TV show than a popular YouTube show, but sees that changing.</p><p>\"The advertising model is catching up very slowly. Right now TV is getting this much money, and YouTube is getting this much,\" said Robbins, with gestures to indicate huge and tiny ad revenues respectively.</p><p>\"But we're starting to see a shift. For next year we see a big shift, and that shift will continue,\" he said. \"I also think we'll create properties online that will become very valuable franchised properties that will transfer across media.\"</p><p>That's one reason why DreamWorks bought AwesomenessTV so early in its growth. Robbins said the company plans to spend around $10m creating shows this year, from bigger projects like Side Effects to smaller videos designed for viral sharing.</p><p>\"There's a handful of companies in Los Angeles right now who I think are going to be the next generation of cable networks,\" said Robbins, although he said there is no plan for AwesomenessTV to expand into feature films under the wing of DreamWorks boss Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p><p>\"No, he wants me to stay in my lane and stay out of his business!\" joked Robbins, before outlining the likely form of collaboration with his new parent company. \"What we're doing is giving the studio another platform to develop content, reach an audience and ultimately help them market the movies.\"</p><p>Like other MCNs, AwesomenessTV is thinking hard about expansion, with plans for a bigger presence in countries like Brazil and the UK, where its videos already have big audiences. And like other MCNs, the company is also looking beyond YouTube.</p><p>\"We're going to live everywhere: YouTube is just the beginning. AwesomenessTV will have a mobile app, we'll be on Xbox and PlayStation and every other device you can think of that kids are using,\" he said.</p><h2>Networks future</h2><p>The key to this expansion – and a phrase that's over-used at TV industry conferences – is \"good content\", but Robbins added a twist to the familiar claim that quality is what will separate winners from losers in the entertainment world.</p><p>\"At the end of the day good content wins. What's different is with this audience, you have to constantly refresh that content,\" he said. \"They will not just watch repeats over and over again. Those days are over.\"</p><p>That led to more speculation about the future for the big, established television networks aiming for a similar audience of tweens and teens. What would Robbins be doing if he was in charge of Nickelodeon in 2013, for example, to respond to changing habits of their audience, and disruptive competition from the YouTube world?</p><p>\"The one thing that I would do: I don't think they make enough content. If you look at the primetime schedule on most of those networks, there are three to four original shows on, and it's not enough. It used to be enough when there were only two channels, but now with a mobile and a tablet, I have so many choices,\" said Robbins.</p><p>\"That's the big problem: the model is broken. Their shows are relatively expensive to make, so they can only afford to make a certain number of them. So they are sort of stuck, and until they figure out how to change that model, you're going to see the audience keep eroding.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419175192|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|4b4ab50af2c5d28f0bc379be673bb3dee11fdc40 -->",

        "headline":"Thom Yorke calls Spotify 'the last desperate fart of a dying corpse'",
        "body":"<p>Spotify celebrates its fifth birthday today, but the streaming music service probably shouldn't expect a present or card from Thom Yorke.</p><p>The Radiohead and Atoms for Peace musician has renewed his attack on Spotify in an <a href=\"http://www.sopitas.com/site/253083-entrevista-con-thom-yorke-de-atoms-for-peace/\">interview with Mexican website Sopitas</a>, describing the company as \"the last desperate fart of a dying corpse\", and attacking its relationship with major labels.</p><p>\"I feel like as musicians we need to fight the Spotify thing. I feel that in some ways what's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen,\" Yorke told Sopitas.</p><p>\"But it's all about how we change the way we listen to music, it's all about what happens next in terms of technology, in terms of how people talk to each other about music, and a lot of it could be really fucking bad.\"</p><p>The interview follows Atoms for Peace's decision earlier this year to pull its albums from Spotify and other streaming services, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/thom-yorke-spotify-twitter\">Yorke and bandmate Nigel Godrich sparking a heated debate</a> with their tweeted views on Spotify being bad for emerging artists.</p><p>The new interview is Yorke's longest yet explaining his views, as he compares Spotify to what Radiohead did with their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/07/musicnews.music\">In Rainbows album in 2007</a>, self-releasing it online and allowing fans to set their own price for the download.</p><p>\"When we did the In Rainbows thing what was most exciting was the idea you could have a direct connection between you as a musician and your audience. You cut all of it out, it's just that and that. And then all these fuckers get in a way, like Spotify suddenly trying to become the gatekeepers to the whole process,\" said Yorke.</p><p>\"We don't need you to do it. No artists needs you to do it. We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off. But because they're using old music, because they're using the majors… the majors are all over it because they see a way of re-selling all their old stuff for free, make a fortune, and not die.\"</p><p>Spotify has become a lightning rod for criticism of streaming music by artists in recent months, partly because it's the biggest service of its kind, with more than 24m active users and 6m paying subscribers.</p><p>The company has defended itself by pointing to the money it has paid out to music rightsholders – $500m by the end of 2012, with another $500m expected this year. And while that doesn't answer Yorke's specific criticism about major labels, Spotify has been praised by companies in the independent music world too.</p><p>In January, Beggars Group chairman Martin Mills said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/04/record-labels-making-money-youtube\">22% of his label group's digital revenues had come from streaming</a> in 2012. Meanwhile, independent labels' trade body Merlin – which like the major labels has a stake in Spotify – said in May that <a href=\"http://www.merlinnetwork.org/membersurvey/\">a third of its members had seen streaming revenues more than double</a> in the last year.</p><p>Spotify has also been hailed as a key factor in the music industry's comeback in countries like <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/21/swedish-music-sales-up-12-in-first-half-of-2013/\">Sweden</a> and <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/11/streaming-still-storming-as-norwegian-music-sales-rise-17-year-on-year/\">Norway</a>, where recorded music revenues rose 12% and 17% respectively in the first half of 2013, following more growth in 2012 after a decade of declining music sales.</p><p>Thom Yorke remains unconvinced that streaming is the answer to artists' problems, though. \"To me this isn't the mainstream, this is is like the last fart, the last desperate fart of a dying corpse. What happens next is the important part,\" he told Sopitas, before suggesting that the music industry should rethink its backing for certain new business models.</p><p>\"It's like this mind trick going on, people are like 'with technology, it's all going to become one in the cloud and all creativity is going to become one thing and no one is going to get paid and it's this big super intelligent thing'. Bullshit,\" said Yorke.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419214746|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1d517394cebe1695069d9ffdc51babb62852fe32 -->",

        "body":"<p>Online retailer Amazon may be facing strike action in Germany in the run-up to Christmas. The secretary of the German services union Verdi has told Der Spiegel magazine that Amazon \"shouldn't rely on being able to keep all their promises to customers before Christmas\" and that the union would call strikes when it would hurt the company most.</p><p>Germany has had strikes by Amazon employees this year over wages. In June and September several hundred workers at the US company's distribution centres in Leipzig, Saxony and Bad Hersfeld in the Hesse region  walked out. Verdi has around 2.2 million members and has said it wants to force Amazon to negotiate a collective wage agreement that complies with standards in the German retail sector. Amazon claims that the wages it pays are above average in the logistics industry. \"Job descriptions for staff are typical of the logistics industry such as the storage, packaging and dispatch of goods,\" a spokeswoman for Amazon Germany told Reuters. The spokeswoman added that the strikes in June and September had not affected customers.</p><p>There is so far no detail on whether the strikes are planned again for the centres in Leipzig or Bad Hersfeld, or any other of the eight distribution centres in Germany.Amazon employs more than 9,000 in Germany but is reportedly considering opening five new centres in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189783|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|eae0fce88d68a84ab70ba21c0b6e34ba1366c505 -->",

        "body":"<p>In the coming weeks, investors will be faced with an intriguing choice. Buy shares in the Royal Mail, one of the oldest long-distance communication enterprises in the world – or take a punt on Twitter, one of the newest.</p><p>The internet has created plenty of work for postmen delivering parcels despatched by online shops, but&nbsp;written messages more often travel in bits and bytes than envelopes these&nbsp;days.</p><p>The Royal Mail delivers to 29m addresses in the UK – and sends more mail on its way overseas. But Twitter claims 215 million active monthly users, and is growing fast, with its following up from 150 million a year ago.</p><p>Comparisons are less flattering when it comes to hard cash. Royal Mail Group has an annual turnover of £9bn, while Twitter tapped advertisers for a mere $316m (£197m) in 2012 and despite being seven years old has never turned a profit.</p><p>Which means that, while Royal Mail generates £310 in revenue per address, Twitter's active addresses produce just $1.47 of revenue each – around 92p per&nbsp;year.</p><p>The 500-year-old postal service will float at about £3.3bn – a shadow of the $12.8bn (£8bn) Twitter is likely to raise. But the Royal Mail is considered a sure bet. Analysts say its value could soon rise to as much as £4.5bn, thanks to changes in the law that will allow it to set higher delivery prices.</p><p>Twitter's digital precursors suggest room for growth is potentially stratospheric. Facebook made $5bn in revenues last year, Google $31bn.</p><p>But the Twitter feed does not lend itself as easily to advertising as a search engine. Unlike Facebook, it is not the internet version of a telephone&nbsp;directory. Twitter is a soapbox for those with something to say, and if its users do not like the way advertising is introduced, they will say something.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419128732|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1766e0dbefbdeeb06a2f69e5b977e1fa4bc08a0a -->",

        "body":"<p>Watching the legal system deal with the internet is like watching somebody trying to drive a car by looking only in the rear-view mirror. The results are amusing and predictable but not really interesting. On the other hand, watching the efforts of regulators – whether national ones such as Ofcom, or multinational, such as the European Commission – is more instructive.</p><p>At the moment, the commission is wrestling with the problem of how to protect the data of European citizens in a world dominated by Google, Facebook and co. The windscreen of the metaphorical car that the commission is trying to drive has been cracked so extensively that it's difficult to see anything clearly through it.</p><p>So in her desperation, the driver (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/viviane-reding\" title=\"\">Viviane Reding</a>, the commission's vice-president) oscillates between consulting the rear-view mirror and asking passers-by (who may or may not be impartial) for tips about what lies ahead. And just to make matters worse, she also has to deal with outbreaks of fighting between the other occupants of the car, who just happen to be sovereign states and are a quarrelsome bunch at the best of times.</p><p>The idea behind the proposed new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\" title=\"\">general data protection regulation</a> (GDPR) is to extend controls to foreign companies that process the personal data of EU citizens. The draft regulation proposes a strict compliance regime with fearsome penalties (up to 2% of worldwide turnover) for infringement. <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-46_en.htm?locale=en\" title=\"\">Personal data is defined</a>  as \"any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information or a computer's IP address.\"</p><p>Needless to say, the companies potentially affected by this regulation are mightily pissed off, for obvious reasons: Google's <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog/financials\" title=\"\">turnover last year </a>was $50bn, for example; so a 2% fine would be a billion dollars, a sum that would make even that company's bosses choke on their muesli. So we can expect the wrangling in Brussels to continue, with lots of pious declarations about the economic blessings that giant US internet corporations bestow on European citizens.</p><p>But while all this is going on, the ground is shifting beneath the disputants. They are arguing about organisations' responsibilities in holding and processing personal data, and about the rights of an individual (the \"data subject\") to know how their data is being used. But technology is already making some of these considerations moot. The advent of \"big data\" means that those who try to focus data–protection measures on individual records held by individual organisations may be whistling into the wind.</p><p>The reason is that routine big-data analytical techniques can now effectively manufacture personal data that is not protected by any of the measures we've used up to now. A well-known illustration of this is the way Target, an American retail chain, creatively collated scattered pieces of data about individuals' changes in shopping habits to predict the delivery date of pregnant shoppers – so that they could then be targeted with relevant advertisements.</p><p>It's called \"predictive analytics\" in the trade and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">a <em>New York Times</em> report</a> of the Target case explains how it's done. One of the company's data analysts noticed that some women customers were loading up on supplements such as calcium, magnesium and zinc. \"Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitisers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date.\"</p><p>As a very perceptive academic <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2325784\" title=\"\">study of predictive analytics</a> points out, there are some serious downsides to this application of big data techniques. One is the way they neatly circumvent current approaches to data protection. The individual components in the data jigsaw may all be satisfactorily protected under whatever regulatory regime is finally agreed in Brussels. But data analytics may nevertheless produce from them a piece of personal information that is intensely private – for example sexual orientation as inferred from <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073791\" title=\"\">clues in social networking posts</a>.</p><p>The second danger is that personal data inferred by analytics may be damaging to an individual. And damage may result whether the inference is correct or faulty: a correct inference that someone is concerned about a potential health issue might have an impact on their employment or health insurance prospects; while an incorrect inference (that a woman was pregnant, say) might lead to discrimination (not being granted a job interview).</p><p>The point is that in neither case would the individual know what was happening. And it's not clear that our current approaches to data-protection be much use either. We're back to horses and stable doors again.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983789|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|82396467fb2487b067dadcd1464450edfec8d2a8 -->",

In May 2013, it was <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/dreamworks-animation-acquires-youtube-network-awesomenesstv/241206/\">acquired by DreamWorks Animation</a> for $33m plus up to $117m in bonuses for hitting future earnings targets.</p><p>Now in October 2013, its main channel has more than 900,000 subscribers on YouTube and 176m views, but its wider network has 25m subscribers, nearly 2bn views and 65m monthly visitors. A rapid rise, to say the least.</p><p>Founder and chief executive Brian Robbins says that AwesomenessTV is capitalising on changing media habits of its young audience. \"They don't watch television any more, at least the way we used to watch television,\" he said during a keynote speech <a href=\"http://blog.mipworld.com/2013/10/liveblog-keynote-%E2%80%94-brian-robbins-awesomenesstv/\">at the MIPCOM conference</a> in Cannes.</p><p>Robbins said that children are still sitting on their sofas watching videos, but the source is now YouTube and the devices are smartphones and tablets. \"It's not just my kids, or kids in the US. It's kids everywhere,\" said Robbins, adding that half his company's views come from outside the US, and that half its views and comments come from mobile devices.</p><p>\"For kids their devices provide a gateway to their friends, and a means to consume the content that they love,\" he said. \"If you want to reach and engage kids, you have to go where they go, and that's online.\"</p><p>Robbins also explained that AwesomenessTV launched with 20 shortform shows, despite lots of advice (\"even from YouTube\") to focus on three or four instead.</p><p>\"Us adults, we like to eat meals, but kids snack, and they snack a lot. Where I might have a few marquee shows on my radar, kids, because they are on their devices all day and night, have both the time and appetite to consume a lot of content, especially around the things they're passionate about,\" he said.</p><p>Robbins also said that the people watching AwesomenessTV are also \"curating and creating\" their own content on YouTube: which includes sharing their favourite shows with friends, but also filming their own responses.</p><p>\"We're in this new era of entertainment where the lines between consuming content and participating in it are blurry,\" he said, before pointing to the global nature of YouTube, with 40% of the 80,000 channels in AwesomenessTV's network produced outside the US.</p><p>\"Kids really don't care where the content is coming from, just as long as it speaks to them,\" said Robbins. \"The bottom line is that creating videos that are funny, shareable and culturally relevant is the best way to engage this audience.\"</p><h2>Shortform shows</h2><p>Robbins showed the trailer for a new show called Side Effects, which blends story and musical covers in Glee-esque style, with a central character who suffers from \"musical hallucinations\" due to the medication that she's taking.</p><p>The show will be delivered in 5-6 minute episodes, even though the production quality makes it look like a show that could easily live on broadcast TV as full-length episodes.</p><p>\"I think YouTube right now is a shortform experience: kids love it for that, and it's where their attention span is,\" said Robbins. \"I don't love it as a filmmaker to be perfectly honest with you, but I love feeding their passion for content.\"</p><p>AwesomenessTV has experimented with taking some of its content to TV, signing a deal with Nickelodeon to produce a half-hour comedy sketches show collecting some of its popular online skits. It premiered in July, and according to Robbins it doubled the ratings for its time-slot on that network.</p><p>\"We want to play in both worlds. I think there's a great opportunity to start stuff on YouTube, develop it, build an audience and then drive it elsewhere in other forms, like we did with Nickelodeon,\" he said.</p><p>However, Robbins spoke at length about the challenges facing TV networks like Nickelodeon, walking a line between pitching AwesomenessTV as a new production partner for those companies, and as a fearsome new competitor poised to disrupt their businesses.</p><p>\"What's happening online today is very similar to what happened in television 25 years ago,\" he said. \"Just as branded cable networks like ESPN, CNN and MTV and Nickelodeon transformed television, a new generation of online channels is going to do the same thing,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think we're replacing television. Let's be really clear: people are watching more TV than ever, but we're filling the periods of time that these kids have, because they have these devices… If my kids aren't entertained every second, they lose their minds! And we're here to fill that gap.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419176592'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381054934369/side-effects.jpg' alt='Side Effects' width='460' height='180' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A still from Side Effects</figcaption></figure><h2>Advertising growth</h2><p>What about the challenges facing this new generation of online video networks? Most make their money predominantly from ads on YouTube, with regular speculation this year that those revenues may not yet be enough to fund profitable businesses – at least not those investing heavily in original shows.</p><p>Robbins, whose career has included producing TV shows Smallville and One Tree Hill, admitted that it's still much more profitable to have a popular TV show than a popular YouTube show, but sees that changing.</p><p>\"The advertising model is catching up very slowly. Right now TV is getting this much money, and YouTube is getting this much,\" said Robbins, with gestures to indicate huge and tiny ad revenues respectively.</p><p>\"But we're starting to see a shift. For next year we see a big shift, and that shift will continue,\" he said. \"I also think we'll create properties online that will become very valuable franchised properties that will transfer across media.\"</p><p>That's one reason why DreamWorks bought AwesomenessTV so early in its growth. Robbins said the company plans to spend around $10m creating shows this year, from bigger projects like Side Effects to smaller videos designed for viral sharing.</p><p>\"There's a handful of companies in Los Angeles right now who I think are going to be the next generation of cable networks,\" said Robbins, although he said there is no plan for AwesomenessTV to expand into feature films under the wing of DreamWorks boss Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p><p>\"No, he wants me to stay in my lane and stay out of his business!\" joked Robbins, before outlining the likely form of collaboration with his new parent company. \"What we're doing is giving the studio another platform to develop content, reach an audience and ultimately help them market the movies.\"</p><p>Like other MCNs, AwesomenessTV is thinking hard about expansion, with plans for a bigger presence in countries like Brazil and the UK, where its videos already have big audiences. And like other MCNs, the company is also looking beyond YouTube.</p><p>\"We're going to live everywhere: YouTube is just the beginning. AwesomenessTV will have a mobile app, we'll be on Xbox and PlayStation and every other device you can think of that kids are using,\" he said.</p><h2>Networks future</h2><p>The key to this expansion – and a phrase that's over-used at TV industry conferences – is \"good content\", but Robbins added a twist to the familiar claim that quality is what will separate winners from losers in the entertainment world.</p><p>\"At the end of the day good content wins. What's different is with this audience, you have to constantly refresh that content,\" he said. \"They will not just watch repeats over and over again. Those days are over.\"</p><p>That led to more speculation about the future for the big, established television networks aiming for a similar audience of tweens and teens. What would Robbins be doing if he was in charge of Nickelodeon in 2013, for example, to respond to changing habits of their audience, and disruptive competition from the YouTube world?</p><p>\"The one thing that I would do: I don't think they make enough content. If you look at the primetime schedule on most of those networks, there are three to four original shows on, and it's not enough. It used to be enough when there were only two channels, but now with a mobile and a tablet, I have so many choices,\" said Robbins.</p><p>\"That's the big problem: the model is broken. Their shows are relatively expensive to make, so they can only afford to make a certain number of them. So they are sort of stuck, and until they figure out how to change that model, you're going to see the audience keep eroding.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419175192|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|4b4ab50af2c5d28f0bc379be673bb3dee11fdc40 -->",

        "headline":"NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users",
        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency has made repeated attempts to develop attacks against people using Tor, a popular tool designed to protect online anonymity, despite the fact the software is primarily funded and promoted by the US government itself.</p><p>Top-secret NSA documents, disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, reveal that the agency's current successes against Tor rely on identifying users and then attacking vulnerable software on their computers. One technique developed by the agency targeted the Firefox web browser used with Tor, giving the agency full control over targets' computers, including access to files, all keystrokes and all online activity.</p><p>But the documents suggest that the fundamental security of the Tor service remains intact. One top-secret presentation, titled 'Tor Stinks', states: \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time.\" It continues: \"With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users,\" and says the agency has had \"no success de-anonymizing a user in response\" to a specific request.</p><p>Another top-secret presentation calls Tor \"the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity\".</p><p>Tor – which stands for The Onion Router – is an open-source public project that bounces its users' internet traffic through several other computers, which it calls \"relays\" or \"nodes\", to keep it anonymous and avoid online censorship tools.</p><p>It is relied upon by journalists, activists and campaigners in the US and Europe as well as in China, Iran and Syria, to maintain the privacy of their communications and avoid reprisals from government. To this end, it receives around 60% of its funding from the US government, primarily the State Department and the Department of Defense – which houses the NSA.</p><p>Despite Tor's importance to dissidents and human rights organizations, however, the NSA and its UK counterpart GCHQ have devoted considerable efforts to attacking the service, which law enforcement agencies say is also used by people engaged in terrorism, the trade of child abuse images, and online drug dealing.</p><p>Privacy and human rights groups have been concerned about the security of Tor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security\">following revelations in the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica</a> about widespread NSA efforts to undermine privacy and security software. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/09/shifting_shadow_stormbrew_flying_pig_new_snowden_documents_show_nsa_deemed.html\">A report by Brazilian newspaper Globo</a> also contained hints that the agencies had capabilities against the network.</p><p>While it seems that the NSA has not compromised the core security of the Tor software or network, the documents detail proof-of-concept attacks, including several relying on the large-scale online surveillance systems maintained by the NSA and GCHQ through internet cable taps.</p><p>One such technique is based on trying to spot patterns in the signals entering and leaving the Tor network, to try to de-anonymise its users. The effort was based on a long-discussed theoretical weakness of the network: that if one agency controlled a large number of the \"exits\" from the Tor network, they could identify a large amount of the traffic passing through it.</p><p>The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated in the documents would rely on the NSA's cable-tapping operation, and the agency secretly operating computers, or 'nodes', in the Tor system. However, one presentation stated that the success of this technique was \"negligible\" because the NSA has \"access to very few nodes\" and that it is \"difficult to combine meaningfully with passive Sigint\".</p><p>While the documents confirm the NSA does indeed operate and collect traffic from some nodes in the Tor network, they contain no detail as to how many, and there are no indications that the proposed de-anonymization technique was ever implemented.  </p><p>Other efforts mounted by the agencies include attempting to direct traffic toward NSA-operated servers, or attacking other software used by Tor users. One presentation, titled 'Tor: Overview of Existing Techniques', also refers to making efforts to \"shape\", or influence, the future development of Tor, in conjunction with GCHQ.</p><p>Another effort involves measuring the timings of messages going in and out of the network to try to identify users. A third attempts to degrade or disrupt the Tor service, forcing users to abandon the anonymity protection.</p><p>Such efforts to target or undermine Tor are likely to raise legal and policy concerns for the intelligence agencies.</p><p>Foremost among those concerns is whether the NSA has acted, deliberately or inadvertently, against internet users in the US when attacking Tor. One of the functions of the anonymity service is to hide the country of all of its users, meaning any attack could be hitting members of Tor's substantial US user base.</p><p>Several attacks result in implanting malicious code on the computer of Tor users who visit particular websites. The agencies say they are targeting terrorists or organized criminals visiting particular discussion boards, but these attacks could also hit journalists, researchers, or those who accidentally stumble upon a targeted site.</p><p>The efforts could also raise concerns in the State Department and other US government agencies that provide funding to increase Tor's security – as part of the Obama administration's internet freedom agenda to help citizens of repressive regimes – circumvent online restrictions.</p><p><a href=\"http://tech.state.gov/m/blogpost?id=6282015%3ABlogPost%3A40819\">Material published online</a> for a discussion event held by the State Department, for example, described the importance of tools such as Tor.</p><p>\"[T]he technologies of internet repression, monitoring and control continue to advance and spread as the tools that oppressive governments use to restrict internet access and to track citizen online activities grow more sophisticated. Sophisticated, secure, and scalable technologies are needed to continue to advance internet freedom.\"</p><p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors, a federal agency whose mission is to \"inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy\" through networks such as Voice of America, also supported Tor's development until October 2012 to ensure that people in countries such as Iran and China could access BBG content. Tor continues to receive federal funds through Radio Free Asia, which is funded by a federal grant from BBG.</p><p>The governments of both these countries have attempted to curtail Tor's use: China has tried on multiple occasions to block Tor entirely, while one of the motives behind Iranian efforts to create a \"national internet\" entirely under government control was to prevent circumvention of those controls.</p><p>The NSA's own documents acknowledge the service's wide use in countries where the internet is routinely surveilled or censored. One presentation notes that among uses of Tor for \"general privacy\" and \"non-attribution\", it can be used for \"circumvention of nation state internet policies\" – and is used by \"dissidents\" in \"Iran, China, etc\".</p><p>Yet GCHQ documents show a disparaging attitude towards Tor users. One presentation acknowledges Tor was \"created by the US government\" and is \"now maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)\", a US freedom of expression group. In reality, Tor is maintained by an independent foundation, though has in the past received funding from the EFF.</p><p>The presentation continues by noting that \"EFF will tell you there are many pseudo-legitimate uses for Tor\", but says \"we're interested as bad people use Tor\". Another presentation remarks: \"Very naughty people use Tor\".</p><p>The technique developed by the NSA to attack Tor users through vulnerable software on their computers has the codename EgotisticalGiraffe, the documents show. It involves exploiting the Tor browser bundle, a collection of programs, designed to make it easy for people to install and use the software. Among these is a version of the Firefox web browser.</p><p>The trick, detailed in a top-secret presentation titled 'Peeling back the layers of Tor with EgotisticalGiraffe', identified website visitors who were using the protective software and only executed its attack – which took advantage of vulnerabilities in an older version of Firefox – against those people. Under this approach, the NSA does not attack the Tor system directly. Rather, targets are identified as Tor users and then the NSA attacks their browsers.</p><p>According to the documents provided by Snowden, the particular vulnerabilities used in this type of attack were inadvertently fixed by Mozilla Corporation in Firefox 17, released in November 2012 – a fix the NSA had not circumvented by January 2013 when the documents were written.</p><p>The older exploits would, however, still be usable against many Tor users who had not kept their software up to date.</p><p>A similar but less complex exploit against the Tor network was <a href=\"http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/08/firefox-zero-day-used-to-reveal-identities-does-the-end-justify-the-means/\">revealed by security researchers in July this year</a>. Details of the exploit, including its purpose and which servers it passed on victims' details to, led to speculation it had been built by the FBI or another US agency.</p><p>At the time, the FBI refused to comment on whether it was behind the attack, but subsequently <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/\">admitted in a hearing in an Irish court</a> that it had operated the malware to target an alleged host of images of child abuse – though the attack did also hit numerous unconnected services on the Tor network.</p><p>Roger Dingledine, the president of the Tor project, said the NSA's efforts serve as a reminder that using Tor on its own is not sufficient to guarantee anonymity against intelligence agencies – but showed it was also a great aid in combating mass surveillance.</p><p>\"The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there's no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network,\" Dingledine said. \"Infecting the laptop, phone, or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard.</p><p>\"Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody's going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on.\"</p><p>But he added: \"Just using Tor isn't enough to keep you safe in all cases. Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.\"</p><p>The Guardian asked the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the US government, how it ensured that its attacks did not interfere with the secure browsing of law-abiding US users such as activists and journalists, and whether the agency was involved in the decision to fund Tor or efforts to \"shape\" its development. </p><p>The agency did not directly address those questions, instead providing a statement.</p><p>It read: \"In carrying out its signals intelligence mission, NSA collects only those communications that it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes, regardless of the technical means used by those targets or the means by which they may attempt to conceal their communications. NSA has unmatched technical capabilities to accomplish its lawful mission.<br /> <br />\"As such, it should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract targets' use of technologies to hide their communications. Throughout history, nations have used various methods to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others use technology to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 4 October after the Broadcasting Board of Governors pointed out that its support of Tor ended in October 2012.</p><p>• <em>Bruce Schneier is an unpaid member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's board of directors.

        "body":"<p>Rockstar has announced that an update file is now available for GTA Online, the troubled multiplayer extension to Grand Theft Auto V. Since the free download was released on Tuesday, thousands of gamers have found it almost impossible to access the new content, which allows players to meet up in an online version of Los Santos, where they can carry out out co-op missions, race cars or just chase each other through the streets with sub-machine guns.</p><p>The publisher has kept players up to date via its <a href=\"http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200426246-GTA-Online-Launch-Status-Latest-Updates-\">GTA Online Status page</a>, where an assortment of problems, from disappearing save files to game-crashing bugs and poor connection with the Social Club service, have been reported. As the instability continued, Rockstar made the decision to disable the microtransaction feature, which allows players to buy in-game currency with real cash. </p><p>Currently, the update, which downloads automatically when GTA V loads, is only available to PlayStation 3 owners, but an Xbox 360 version is expected later today. </p><p>Until then, players are being offered a range of possible fixes for the key issue - the inability to progress past the tutorial race at the beginning. From Rockstar's site:</p><blockquote><p>Some players have reported being able to get into the Tutorial race by re-downloading the Title Update, which can be deleted from Xbox Home or the PS3 XMB (Game Data Utility, NOT save data). Others reported having luck by selecting \"Swap Character\" from the Online tab within the pause menu, deleting the character that was unable to get into the tutorial, and then creating a new character. Going into GTAO in Solo mode may also help to allow completion of the tutorial.  Some who were experience this issue have been able to get in just by trying again later.</p></blockquote><p>We'll up date this story when the Xbox 360 version of the patch is available.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/21/grand-theft-auto-5-women-misogynistic-violent\">Helen Lewis: Yes, it's misogynistic and violent, but I still admire GTA</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/26/gta-v-micro-transactions-console\">GTA V and the future of micro-transactions</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\">GTA 5 review: a dazzling but monstrous parody of modern life</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419062589|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|fd1c15099ebe1ad70417d12d0f22574b613a37e8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tesco's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/23/tesco-launch-hudl-computer-tablet\">new 7in Android tablet</a>, called the Hudl, is family-focused, with kid-friendly features and a beginner's guide to Android built in.</p> <p>Offering a low-cost alternative to Google's &pound;199 Nexus 7 and Amazon's recently price-cut &pound;119 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/25/amazon-kindle-fire-hdx-mayday\">Kindle Fire HD</a>, Tesco is aiming the &pound;119 Hudl at people who wouldn't ordinarily think of buying a tablet computer.</p> <h2>Design: Soft-touch plastic that feels good in the hand</h2> <p>The Hudl is a colourful Android tablet encased in soft-touch plastic, which makes it easy to hold and feel good in the hand. It's also light enough, like most other 7in tablets, to wield with one hand.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-64739250-c8fc-464a-80c2-dbf3976e6ffe\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380818859260/6a071446-dc14-44bb-b1ae-5cfec9a74995-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco Hudl tablet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Tesco Hudl tablet has a soft-touch plastic back.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The front of the device is dominated by its 7in high-definition screen. It is both sharp and clear, making text from websites and ebooks easily legible, while TV and movies look good. The screen's viewing angles are also pretty good, which should make sharing videos and pictures with friends and family easy.</p> <p>The back of the device sports two fairly loud and clear stereo speakers that make for better video viewing.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong>&nbsp;7in HD LCD with 1,440 x 900 pixels</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;1.5GHz quad-core processor</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;1GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;16GB plus microSD slot supporting up to 32GB cards</li> <li><strong>Operating system:</strong>&nbsp;Android 4.2.2</li> <li><strong>Camera:</strong>&nbsp;3-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Wi-Fi (a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, micro HDMI</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;128.8 x 192.8 x 9.85mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;370g</li> </ul> <h2>Powerful enough for web browsing</h2> <p>Tesco has given the Hudl a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, which generally produces a lag-free experience within individual apps. However, with only 1GB of RAM, multi-tasking displays a noticeable burden on the Hudl, with slow transitions between apps and a touch of mildly frustrating lag in certain situations. The Hudl is certainly not the fastest or most powerful 7in tablet out there.</p> <p>For the most part, the processor copes well enough with the demands of web browsing, sending email and watching YouTube videos, but I found that video and audio could occasionally move out of sync while watching shows via the BBC iPlayer app.</p> <p>Tesco rates the Hudl's battery life at around nine hours, which proved to be roughly accurate in my testing. It charges quickly via the included mains charger, and lasted for around a day's worth of good general use, including watching videos, reading websites and sending and receiving around 25 emails.</p> <p>With light or occasional use, you'll have to charge the Hudl about once every two or three days, which is about on par with competing 7in tablets from other manufacturers.</p> <h2>Software: Perfectly usable standard Android</h2> <p>Unlike other 7in Android tablets such as Amazon's Kindle Fire family, Tesco decided to make only minor additions to the standard Google Android ‘Jelly Bean’ experience.</p> <p>That means users have full, unadulterated access to the Google Play Store, including its 850,000 or so apps, plus movies and music services.</p> <p>Tesco's only immediately visible addition is a small white T in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, which acts as a one-tap access button for Tesco's services. These include Tesco's online grocery shop, the Tesco Direct store, Tesco's F&amp;F clothing store, Tesco Clubcard, Mobile network and Tesco bank account access, as well as a store locator.</p> <p>Tesco has also given Hudl users direct access to its on-demand streaming entertainment services, including Blinkbox movies, music and books, and Tesco's Clubcard TV.</p> <p>Blinkbox movies works well, offering on-demand movies and TV shows on a pay-as-you-go basis, while Clubcard TV provides free access to a roster of family-aimed streaming TV shows.</p> <p>Blinkbox music offers free streaming music, while Blinkbox books, which wasn't available at the time of writing, promises to offer access to 600,000 books in the near future.</p> <p>For the family audience, Tesco has also added account control into the Android 4.2.2 operating system, allowing parents to set up restricted accounts for the kids that prevent access to certain content and applications, including YouTube.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-73e6a32d-737f-421b-946b-fd2be954a83d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380818908384/7802aa0b-38e2-47b5-8938-20b508256436-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco Hudl tablet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Tesco Hudl tablet has features such as account control that restrict children's access to age-restricted sites and services.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Tesco has also attempted to make Android more accessible to tablet novices with a simple walkthrough guide, instructing the user on setup and general use.</p> <h2>Camera: The results are poor</h2> <p>The camera on the back of the Hudl takes only passable still shots at 3-megapixels, and while it is also capable of capturing high-definition 720p video, the results are poor, full of judder and bordering on unwatchable – certainly in indoor lighting conditions.</p> <p>The front-facing camera is also anaemic, producing shots with washed-out colours, but does the job well enough for the highly compressed demands of video calling, which will be its primary use.</p> <h2>Price: As little as &pound;6o in Tesco Clubcard vouchers</h2> <p>Available in black, blue, purple and red, price is arguably the Hudl's greatest strength. It's available in-store for &pound;119, but can also be bought with just &pound;60 of Tesco Clubcard vouchers, which represents astounding value if you happen to be a Tesco shopper.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-249b5c96-0f40-49c1-b3e5-e059171be1c3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380818998444/360a7ef4-4c2a-4257-bce2-b1bf16268d06-460x325.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco Hudl tablet.\" width=\"460\" height=\"325\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Tesco Hudl tablet is available in four colours.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Verdict: A great value tablet</h2> <p>Overall the Tesco Hudl tablet is great value. It's not the best 7in tablet out there, but it holds it own very well compared to similarly priced competition.</p> <p>It feels good in the hand, has a crisp HD screen, and packs enough punch to handle web browsing, email and general tablet usage without much worry or frustration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/direct/hudl-7-16gb-wi-fi-android-tablet-black/629-5239.prd\">For &pound;119, </a>it's hard to beat the Hudl, and it would make an excellent first tablet for the kids or the grandparents.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Star rating: 4/5</strong></li> </ul><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991964|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|6a724b0dcd17a1848c82ed99e064aba16e8b1635 -->",

        "body":"<p>When the Silk Road, the internet's biggest marketplace for illegal drugs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">was taken down earlier this week</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value\">the price of Bitcoin plummeted</a>.</p> <p>The two were \"intrinsically linked\", according to&nbsp;Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, but with Silk Road gone, does Bitcoin have a future?</p> <h2><strong>What are Bitcoins? </strong></h2> <p>Bitcoins are an anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency.</p> <p>In contrast to older forms of electronic money, no company controls Bitcoin, nor ever could: all the rules about how it works are embedded into the very operation of trade, including the rate of inflation and how to verify transactions.</p> <h2><strong>How do I get them? </strong></h2> <p>For most users, the easiest way to get Bitcoins is to buy them. But due to strict anti-money laundering controls, even that is tricky.</p> <p>Most Bitcoin exchanges, such as <a href=\"https://mtgox.com/\">Mt Gox</a>, the best-known, require users to wire money from their banks to the exchange.</p> <p>A small group of hardcore users get extra Bitcoins through 'mining' for them: running computers which perform the calculations needed to make the currency work, in exchange for a share of the built-in inflation.</p> <h2>What do they look like?</h2> <p>Files of seemingly random data.</p> <p>Bitcoins have no physical existence, although some have devised ways to spend the digital currency <a href=\"http://blockchain.info/wallet/paper-tutorial\">by printing the necessary information on paper notes</a>. Instead, they are long lists of the digital signatures of previous owners. When a Bitcoin is spent, the old owner adds their digital signature to the end of the list, combined with the digital signature of the new owner.</p> <h2><strong>How do I spend them? </strong></h2> <p>With difficulty: few mainstream places accept Bitcoins, though the number is growing and now includes <a href=\"http://www.bitfash.com/\">fashion websites</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/23/britains-first-bitcoin-pub\">pubs</a>, and online dating service <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/04/17/okcupid-bitcoin/\">OKCupid</a>.</p> <p>If your tastes are on the geeky side, however, you might have more luck. You can buy web hosting, geeky t-shirts, and even membership of the Reddit social network with Bitcoin.</p> <h2><strong>Who's making money from Bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/meet-the-bitcoin-millionaires\">People who bought early and sold at the peak</a>. The currency has been through two boom-and-bust cycles, with the cost of one Bitcoin rising from $2 to $30 in 2011, and then from $13 to $266 earlier this year. But having a fortune in Bitcoin is a bit like having a fortune in gold: you have to sell your holdings to really make the most of it.</p> <h2><strong>Why would I want them?</strong></h2> <p>The big driver in Bitcoin&rsquo;s early growth was the online drug marketplace Silk Road, which took advantage of the currency&rsquo;s qualities to provide anonymity to patrons.</p> <p>While Silk Road no longer exists, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/silk-road-underground-market-closed-bitcoin\">a number of smaller outfits offer the same services</a>.</p> <p>But beyond access to illicit substances, for many fans Bitcoin use is a political statement: its existence proves that a currency with no centralised control is possible.</p> <h2><strong>How secure is Bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p>As secure as its user.</p> <p>Although there have been <a href=\"http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/05/13/bitcoin-blockchain-hard-fork-coming-may-15th-final-warning/\">some bugs</a> with the currency&rsquo;s programming, all of the reported thefts have come from the outside.</p> <p>If users don&rsquo;t keep their \"private key\", the password which lets them spend their Bitcoins, well hidden, <a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/first-major-bitcoin-theft/\">they can easily lose everything</a>.</p> <p>And, of course, anonymity cuts both ways: if you get tricked by a scammer into parting with your bitcoins, there&rsquo;s no higher authority to turn to.</p> <h2>Will it ever be a mainstream currency?</h2> <p>Economists and developers point to several flaws in the&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;of Bitcoin which render it unsuitable for widespread use. One problem is that the currency has deflation built in to its very core: only 21m bitcoins will ever be produced, and we're already halfway there. Most economists believe deflation is disastrous for an economy, but the Austrian school of economics, beloved by the libertarian creators of Bitcoin, disagrees.</p> <p>A more immediate problem is that it's not clear that the backbone of the currency can withstand the increased use that going mainstream would take. Transactions can already experience relatively lengthy delays in processing (taking minutes to clear), and that's just with Bitcoin remaining mostly popular amongst enthusiasts.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Was Silk Road's creator a genius who masterminded an online criminal underworld? Or did he actually do <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested\">five very stupid things to get himself arrested</a>?</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418997117|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ea48e57be532b39bd9e97530af940f5b56ac836c -->",

        "headline":"BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea episode one – preview",
        "body":"<p>(WARNING CONTAINS BIOSHOCK AND BIOSHOCK INFINITE SPOILERS)</p><p>I'm Sorry. Really, I'm very sorry about the above admission. I've been trying to come up with a way to talk about BioShock Infinite's story-based DLC without giving away significant plot points in it and Irrational's 2007 masterpiece. Lord alone knows that the less players know about the stories contained in the cities of Rapture and Colombia, the more they're likely to be blown away by their first encounters with them. But there simply is no way to discuss Burial at Sea without offering up some details about the sunken dystopia of Rapture and the twisted denizens that inhabit it.</p><p>Still, is this such a bad thing? Burial at Sea is the very definition of fan service.</p><p>Not only does it offer an intriguing glimpse into the barmy universe of BioShock Infinite, where neither the motives of the characters nor the very fabric of reality can be trusted, but it satiates a couple of desires many fans of the original BioShock have had since the credits rolled on that game back in 2007. (Oh, and if you're not a fan, and you've yet to play either of the aforementioned games, I strongly urge to you stop reading now.)</p><p>You see, not only does Burial at Sea mark Irrational's return to the sunken city of Rapture – the beautiful and horrific metropolis they created for BioShock – but it returns players to a time before the city's fall. Ever wanted to see what Rapture looked like in all of its grandeur before the civil war laid it to waste? Now's your chance …</p><p>Much like in BioShock Infinite, Burial at Sea begins with the player walking the streets of an otherworldly city, only in this case, the floating platforms of Columbia have been swapped out for the glorious art-deco pomp of Rapture's submerged corridors and pavilions.</p><p>As the player guides Booker through his paces, they'll see familiar sights such as the Nano-Tubes, Big Daddies patching up parts of the city on the ocean floor and even an outlet of Rapture Records where they can listen to a rendition of Le Mer by Django Rheinhart.</p><p>As delightful as it is to return to Rapture, Irrational's creative director, Ken Levine says it's there as the best backdrop for his new story – and is less about providing a kind of 'greatest hits' experience for players.</p><p>\"I had another story I wanted to tell about these people – Booker and Elizabeth – in particular,\" he says. \"But I'd be kidding if I said there wasn't some desire I had to go and play back in Rapture.\"</p><p>\"But the last thing I wanted to do was the whole 'midichlorian' thing and explain parts of the world to people that they didn't need or want explained. [Burial at Sea] is not about going back and explaining what happened back in Rapture. Rapture is a backdrop for this story.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419069498'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380879391212/Bio-Liz-008.jpg' alt='Bio Liz' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Living for the city<br /></h2><p>Running on the Infinite engine, it looks utterly sumptuous; dark hard-wood panelling and gold plating contrasts beautifully against blood-red carpets and green banners proclaiming the strengths of Objectivism. Rapture's civilians chatter excitedly in the streets and the hubbub mingled with 1920s music makes the environment feel alive as a city.</p><p>\"If you go back and look at Rapture in the original game,\" says Levine, \"you'll find that your memory is kind of looking back through rose-tinted glasses. \"</p><p>\"The kinds of places we can build now – especially the fact that we can now have a population – we saw that as a huge opportunity [to revisit Rapture] to just see what life in it was like.\"</p><p>On the surface, Rapture looks like Andrew Ryan's dream working the way it was meant to, but if players prick up their ears, they can hear the first signs of dissent.</p><p>In BioShock's timeline, Burial at Sea takes place after the failure of Frank Fontaine's first rebellion. Ryan Industries is in the process of taking command of Fontaine's assets and Fontaine's small army of violent Splicers has been banished to an underwater prison in the dilapidated Fontaine Department Store building. Levine says the madness in Burial at Sea needed to be partitioned in this way for the sake of moving things on.</p><p>\"That was a tricky problem to begin with,\" he says. \"Once we knew we were doing Rapture before the fall, just picking up a gun and running around shooting people wasn't going to work.\"</p><p>\"We wanted the game divided into the exploration of the city and into a traditional BioShock experience,\" he says. \"We knew we had the central story of Fontaine's clash with Ryan, but we didn't know exactly what he did with Fontaine's gang.\"</p><p>\"You ever seen Escape From New York? It's basically Escape From New York!\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419069499'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380879429115/Bio-Liz-Hall-008.jpg' alt='Bio Liz Hall' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Setting the scene<br /></h2><p>The DLC begins with an opening that would be right at home in a pulp dime-store novel. Private investigator, Booker DeWitt, is approached in his office by a mysterious woman named Elizabeth. He lights her cigarette with a snap of his fingers (using a flame Plasmid) and listens as she asks him to help her find a missing girl named Sally. Elizabeth comes on like a classic femme fatale; she seems to know more about Booker and Sally than she lets on and shadows play over her eyes. Booker takes the case and heads towards the den of one of Rapture's figures who has been known to partake in the odd bout of human trafficking – an artist with a couple of screws loose named Sander Cohen.</p><p>Seeing the worlds of BioShock and BioShock Infinite thrown into the mix together raises up its own set of questions. Is Infinite now part of the Rapture lore? Is Burial At Sea showing us one of the myriad parallel universes hinted at in Infinite? Levine is adamant that the strands tie together.</p><p>\"It's Rapture prime,\" he says. \"It's Elizabeth prime.\"</p><p>\"There's a difference between BioShock and Infinite in that the focus was more on the characters in Infinite and their moral progression. The Elizabeth you see here is not the one that was dancing on the beach in Infinite – even though there are echoes of that scene here – she's more opaque.\"</p><p>\"She is a product of the affects of people's ideas being put into reality. She didn't ask for any of it and all of it was put upon her. She's the embodiment of extremism.\"</p><p>Levine's sentiments hit home as I played through Burial at Sea. Elizabeth functioned the way she did in Infinite as a mechanic – she still opens tears and she still scrounges for resources – but the wide eyed, optimistic youth of Colombia has been replaced by a character who is altogether more cynical, darker and quicker to judge Booker. To be honest, she seems right at home in Rapture …</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419041753|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ae1d64281a574dfe0d9341de5423d27b12c680cf -->",

        "body":"<p><em>I'll be travelling to parts of Morocco and I need to find a reliable way for my relatives at home to let me know daily that they are OK. They are elderly, rather deaf, and not good on the phone, but they can manage email and Facebook. There appear to be programs that enable you to send emails as SMS messages from a PC to a mobile phone, which might be a solution, but I'm not sure which are safe and reliable. My mobile phone is fairly basic and on a pay-as-you-go service with T-Mobile.</em></p><p><strong>Carol</strong></p><p></p><p>If your relatives can handle email, then the simplest idea is for them to use emails to send SMS messages to your phone. Many mobile networks and independent companies offer email-to-SMS gateways that do this, though the commercial ones charge for sending bulk texts. Usually, you send the email to the international mobile phone number followed by the supplier's email address. In other words, the address will be something like 447712345678@emailsmsgateway.co.uk, where you replace the opening 0 with the UK country code, 44.</p><p>T-Mobile used to offer this as a free service via @t-mobile.uk.net and perhaps it still does. (I believe both Vodafone and O2 have dropped similar services.) You can test it by sending yourself an SMS.</p><p>Wikipedia has a big <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways\">table of SMS gateways</a>, which you can sort by region to get all the UK services together. However, all the ones I looked at were commercial services aimed at volume users.</p><p>PC users generally use websites to send the odd free SMS text message. There are quite a lot of these, and I don't know which is best. I tried half a dozen, and the two websites that delivered quickly were <a href=\"http://www.e-freesms.com/sms.php\">e-freesms</a> and, about 10 minutes later, <a href=\"http://www.smsfrog.com/sms-uk/\">SMS Frog</a>. The other four SMS messages failed to arrive within 12 hours, so again, you need to test whichever service you choose.</p><p>Both e-freesms and SMS Frog require you to fill in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA\">CAPTCHA</a> (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), which means typing some letters into a box. Here, SMS Frog is much the easier of the two. (SMS Frog also says: \"Messages can be sent to United Kingdom mobile numbers exclusively\", but I assume this means UK mobile numbers even if the phone is abroad.)</p><p>You have to be a bit careful because some sites are \"free to send\" but not necessarily \"free to receive\". With \"reverse charge services\", the recipient gets a free SMS alert, but they have to pay perhaps £1 to £3 to pick it up. (For example, by sending GET to a chargeable number.) However, US-based readers can use <a href=\"http://www.aim.com/\">AIM</a>, or AOL Instant Messenger, which supports sending SMS messages to US mobile numbers free of charge.</p><p>One of my Twitter followers, Paul Fald, recently asked a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bridge_53/status/375246738807738368\">similar question</a>: \"Can anyone recommend a reliable and possibly FREE online SMS messaging site – sending to all UK mobiles?\" Stuart Mitchell, a telecom professional made some suggestions, but he warned: \"please don't go free … you won't get QoS [quality of service] that way and have many headaches.\"</p><p>In the end, Paul decided to use <a href=\"http://www.vyke.com/\">http://www.vyke.com/</a> at 3 1/2p per text with a £5 minimum purchase. You have to register to use the service, but as he pointed out, it's cheaper than using Skype at 5.9p per message, where \"You must purchase Skype Credit or a Premium Account.\"</p><p>You also mention that your elderly relatives use Facebook, so it would be a good idea for them to send you Facebook messages as a back-up. With Facebook notifications, you can get these messages sent to your email address, so you can check them when you have access to a PC, if not on your mobile phone.</p><p>Finally, if your relatives have their own mobile phone or tablet, they may be able to send you SMS messages directly, or use one of the many \"free SMS\" apps. I appreciate that it can be very hard for some people to use a mobile phone's small onscreen keyboard, but perhaps that problem could be solved by using a large external Bluetooth keyboard like the Anker <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker®-Bluetooth-Wireless-Keyboard-Android/dp/B0096M8VR2/\">(£17.99 from Amazon,co.uk</a>). According to the blurb, this works with the Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, Android 3.0 and above, and Windows Mobile 5.0 and above.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419052653'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380875268243/SMS-Frog-008.jpg' alt='SMS Frog' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Which tablet for displaying photos and videos?</h2><p><em>I'm a new videographer/photographer, and I was looking into getting a tablet to display my work? Which one would you consider for videos and photos?</em></p><p><strong>dutchofspadez</strong></p><p>I answered a similar question in February: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/feb/14/computing-apple\">What's the best tablet for a photographer with a DSLR?</a></p><p>If money is not a problem, and if you also want to run programs such as Adobe Lightroom and video editors such as Sony Vegas Pro 12, then I'd go for the second-generation <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/pre-order\">Microsoft Surface Pro 2</a>, which is on pre-order. However, this would be overkill just for displaying your work. For that, I'd look at the new <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/7/\">Google Nexus 7</a> Android tablets, which has a high-resolution 7in 1920 x 1200-pixel screen (323 pixels per inch) at a low price (£199).</p><p>If a 7in screen is too small, you could move up to a 32GB <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/10/\">Google Nexus 10</a>, which has a 10in 2560 x 1600-pixel (300ppi) screen for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Google-Nexus-10-BLACK/dp/B00AXDU5XG/\">£349</a>. This compares with £479 for a 32GB Apple iPad with a 9.7in 2048 x 1536-pixel (264ppi) Retina display.</p><p>However, don't rule out the iPad or Windows tablets like the forthcoming 8in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/02/dell-venue-pro-8-and-pro-11-hands-on/\">Dell Venue 8 Pro and 11 Pro</a>. The most important thing is to choose a tablet that supports the file formats you are creating, especially if you are using a RAW format for photos. Yes, you can use a PC to convert files to a suitable tablet format, but you don't want to spend more time converting videos than watching them.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419052654'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380875103317/Surface-Pro-2-008.jpg' alt='Surface Pro 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The Microsoft Surface Pro 2</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419036109|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|3f04a5e1277a21b6149f6fcdcd98d4b0b35bdd58 -->",

        "body":"<p>A German security company says spoofing the iPhone 5S's fingerprint reader can be used to beat the phone's \"remote wipe\" facility to carry out identity theft.</p><p><a href=\"https://srlabs.de/spoofing-fingerprints/\">SRL demonstrates the hack on its website</a>. It relies on the phone's owner using a number of defaults in the setup of the phone. It does not work against iPhones without a fingerprint reader.</p><p>The identity theft relies on the user enabling Touch ID on the iPhone 5S, having the \"Control Center\" facility available in the lockscreen so that the Airplane mode can be enabled rapidly, and not having two-factor authentication turned on for email accounts, especially their Apple iCloud account which is required to set up the device. Touch ID is an optional setting, but the others are default settings for the device.</p><p>SRL points out that Airplane mode can be enabled on a stolen phone from the lockscreen, which turns off wireless connectivity and so defeats the remote wipe facility.</p><p>It then shows that a photo taken with an older iPhone 4S of the phone owner's fingerprint can be good enough to create a \"fake finger\" on a laminated sheet, which is then lightly stuck to a real finger. That method was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/apple-iphone-fingerprint-scanner-hacked\">demonstrated by the Chaos Computer Club</a> soon after the iPhone 5S's release.</p><p>Having created a spoof fingerprint to unlock the device - which must be done within three attempts or a passcode request is triggered, which is not available through a stolen phone - SRL points out that the attacker can see the owner's email address in the settings, and so can use an Apple website to request a password reset. That will be sent to the phone - and by rapidly turning off the Airplane mode to collect the email and then grabbing the password reset, and taking over the account. They could then put the phone back in Airplane mode.</p><p>Without two-factor authentication - which is an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/21/apple-icloud-protection-hackers-authentication\">optional safeguard for iCloud</a>, Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts - there would be no way for the phone's owner to prevent the account takeover. Two-factor authentication provides a method to revoke permissions for various devices and accounts. It is presently available for iCloud accounts in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>The Control Center facility can also be removed from the lock screen in the Settings. </p><p>SRL said that the hack proved that \"using fingerprints as credentials for local user authentication has two shortcomings when compared to passwords - limited revocation\" (because fingerprints cannot be changed) and \"credential spread\" (because we leave copies of our fingerprints anywhere we touch).</p><p>They suggest that fingerprint readers still need to improve further. \"Fingerprint spoof prevention would better be based on intrinsic errors in the spoof-creation process or on fingerprint features not present in latent prints (and become much harder to steal). Examples of such spoof-detection features are air bubbles contained in the glue often used for spoofs and minute details that are visible through a fingerprint sensor but not in a latent print,\" the researchers write. It suggests that a simple comparison of such air bubbles - which show up in their sensor data as white bubbles, which aren't found with real fingerprints - would \"challenge hackers to improve their spoofing techniques\".</p><p>Apple had no comment on the research.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419029304|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|f697495329f011ad0d719e289a8f5e18d51b685f -->",

        "headline":"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review - is it a tablet, or a phone?",
        "body":"<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the third iteration of Samsung's popular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/phablets\">phablet</a> series that has just become even bigger.</p> <p>With its large 5.7in screen and S Pen stylus, the Note 3 is unashamedly a phablet that will stretch prospective buyers hands and pockets, but provide fast and fluid experience while its at it.</p> <h2>Design: You'll need at least two hands</h2> <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is anything but small. A phablet through and through, it has a very large footprint compared to most other smartphones with screens between 4.7 and 5in, and while it's thin at just 8.9mm thick, it certainly feels big in your hand.</p> <p>The sheer size of the device basically makes one-handed operation impossible. Samsung's given the Note 3 an entire settings menu dedicated to trying to make it easier to use one-handed, but even with my adult male-sized hands it's a struggle to reach even half of the screen without dropping the device.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ad1b7e2b-55bd-4e86-91ce-e1fa3858c05d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380790962451/3a4cfe03-5fbc-409d-88a4-7d17f4f426a0-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a 5.7in phablet.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Samsung has used its characteristically plastic phone construction for the Note 3, matching the design ethos displayed by the rest of the Samsung Galaxy Android phone line, including its current flagship phone, the Galaxy S4.</p> <p>However, instead of a glossy plastic back, Samsung has given the Note 3 a fake leather back reminiscent of a cheap &quot;pleather&quot; sofa.</p> <p>I wouldn't call that an upgrade. Combined with chromed and ridged plastic edges, it makes the Note 3 feel anything but premium.</p> <p>Despite the cheap feel, the Note 3 is solidly built and displays little to no give, flex or creak in the body when twisted, while being lightweight.</p> <p>The front of the device is dominated by an excellent, bright and colourful large 5.7in screen. With a full HD 1920x1080 resolution the display is pin sharp making text on websites and ebooks easily legible, images crisp and detailed, while making watching videos a joy.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>5.7in full HD Super AMOLED</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;2.3 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800</li> <li><strong>RAM:&nbsp;</strong>3GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;32/64GB plus microSD slot supporting up to 64GB cards</li> <li><strong>Operating&nbsp;system&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Android 4.3 with Samsung TouchWiz</li> <li><strong>Camera:&nbsp;</strong>13-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE, Wi-Fi (n/ac), NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 with BLE, IR and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;168g</li> </ul> <h2>Powerful - and excellent for gaming</h2> <p>Samsung has given the Note 3 a top of the line processor in the form of a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800, and it really shows. The phablet absolutely flies along, with near-instant app loading and no perceptible lag anywhere within the operating system (more on that later).</p> <p>Even the most graphically intensive games run as smooth as butter, making the Note 3 excellent for gaming, while 3GB of RAM mean it should be up to any sort of multi-tasking you're likely to throw at it.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c32d4163-df9d-4043-9baa-f3dd5905882b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791055950/8567b134-a393-49cf-8ce6-91cc893b1a3e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is both powerful and lag-free.</figcaption> </figure> <p>To keep you fully stocked with apps, games and movies, the Note 3 sports ample storage with either 32GB or 64GB built-in, depending on model, of which the operating system takes up 5.64GB of space. A microSD card slot also stands ready to add up to another 64GB, should you need more.</p> <p>The Note 3 comes with USB 3.0 support, which makes transferring movies and music to the device much faster than most other smartphones that are saddled with the slower USB 2.0 standard.</p> <p>Charging the Note 3 is also fast via the included USB 3.0 cable, which from the mains charger adds about 1% of battery life per minute up until around 90% of capacity. It's 3,200mAh battery then gives it a very decent battery life of just about two days of real world use.</p> <p>That generally means you might have to top up the battery a little towards the end of the second day, but it should easily manage to last a day's mixed use even for the most demanding of users.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Software: TouchWiz is cluttered and confusing</h2> <p>The Galaxy Note 3 runs Android 4.3 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot; and has unfettered access to all the Google apps and services that are available through the Google Play Store, including Gmail, Chrome and Google Now.</p> <p>However, like most manufacturers, Samsung chooses to customise the Android experience on its devices. Samsung's modifications are known as TouchWiz, and include things like a custom keyboard, modified settings menus, and a custom home screen.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46c6698e-d466-4e07-a875-a4666fbf54ab\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791130851/d3524d8d-d355-4c0b-aba7-b0223573b437-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 runs Samsung's customised version of Android 4.3 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot;.</figcaption> </figure> <p>TouchWiz is a bit like Marmite - you will either love it or hate it. Personally, I loathe it, and find it cluttered and overly complicated. For instance, the settings menus are confusingly laid out at best, and the keyboard's strange, inefficient key spacing makes hitting the right touchscreen keys harder than it needs to be.</p> <p>Within the TouchWiz experience lays a whole host of gimmicky features that are of little practical use, including 'Air gesture' that allows you to wave your hand over the device to turn pages, but only in specific apps, and 'Smart screen', which uses the phablet's front-facing camera to watch for your gaze and pause video among other things when you look away.</p> <p>Generally they are confusing at best to use, and put additional drain on your device's battery at worst. Your mileage might vary, but I found myself turning them off within a frustrating first day of trying to use them.</p> <h2>Stylus: Completely ignore it</h2> <p>Samsung's 'S Pen' stylus also has a high potential for being relegated to just a gimmick. For the most part, there's little you can do with the stylus that you can't with a finger, which is often quicker and more convenient.</p> <p>The Note 3's 'Air command' function brings up a circular quick action menu that allows you to annotate a screenshot, but also provides access to 'Pen Window'.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-257c9640-19fb-49b3-ad19-e216dde94cd0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791254318/f1469cfd-fd9d-41c3-8c02-1b478f63107c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes equipped with Samsung's new and improved S Pen stylus.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Pen Window allows you to perform multi-window multi-tasking, by drawing out a window of your desired size with the stylus that you can fill with a select few apps that include Google Hangouts, a browser and a calculator - something that sounds potentially useful, but ends up being laborious to use and slower than just switching between dedicated full-screen apps.</p> <p>Some of the drawing and annotation functions within Samsung's apps such as S Note, SketchBook and Scrapbook could be useful for someone who can draw well, but they're lost on me.</p> <p>On the whole, the stylus doesn't detract from the Note 3's experience, as it slots neatly into the back, but it can often be completely ignored unless you're trying to actually sketch something on-screen.</p> <h2>Camera: Great for stills, but ultra HD is a gimmick</h2> <p>The Note 3 packs the same camera as the Samsung Galaxy S4, which at 13-megapixels produces clean, colourful and sharp images in decent lighting.</p> <p>In poor lighting, the camera can struggle to focus properly, however, it compares well to most other smartphone cameras and will capture pictures of a similar quality to most dedicated compact cameras.</p> <p>Samsung's camera software is easy and straightforward to use. It also manages to incorporate useful functions like an 'Eraser Mode', which is capable of removing unwanted objects like passers-by from your photos, and 'Drama Shot', which captures a series of shots and then stitches them together to make one over-laid action shot of a bike leaping off a ramp, or a football's flight through the air.</p> <p>Along with 13-megapixel stills, the Note 3's camera is capable of capturing video at up to 4K ultra high-definition, which at 3840x2160 has four times the number of pixels as full high definition.</p> <p>Since the Note 3's screen is only full HD, and 4K TVs are few and far between at the moment, capturing video in 4K UHD is a gimmick and will fill up the Note 3's storage very quickly with its large file sizes.</p> <p>The Note 3 will, of course, capture decent lower resolution video, including smooth normal full HD, and will even provide slow motion video at up to 120 frames per second if required.</p> <h2>Price: More expensive than iPhone 5S</h2> <p>Available in black, pink or white, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a large, flagship phone and therefore commands a premium price. Bought outright, the Note 3 costs &pound;650, which makes it one of the most expensive smartphones available at &pound;100 more expensive than an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/iphone-5s-review-apple\">iPhone 5s</a>&nbsp;and around &pound;230 more than a 5in Samsung Galaxy S4.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-32f69b25-f798-4b83-a593-1734d3fa8a11\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380791368210/a1085af8-2d7d-4485-9192-80d4772497ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 review.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes in three colours: black, white and pink.</figcaption> </figure> <p>However, bought with a mobile phone contract in the UK, the Note 3 is available for free on contracts starting at around &pound;42 a month for 24 months.</p> <h2>Verdict: a great phablet but too big for most</h2> <p><strong>If you're after a phablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the best one available right now. </strong></p> <p>It's a snappy, lag-free experience, with great battery life and fast charging, but it's just not big enough to be a proper 7in tablet replacement.</p> <p>It's also likely be too big for most users looking for a smartphone, who will struggle to fit it in their pockets and will find it near-on impossible to use one-handed. Samsung's TouchWiz customisations to Android are often gimmicky and confusing, but they can be turned off to save frustration and battery life.</p> <p>The S Pen is responsive and easy to use, but actually using a stylus on a phone feels clumsy and fiddly, meaning it can safely be ignored in favour of a finger unless you're actually trying to sketch something on-screen.</p> <p>Overall, Samsung hopes to continue dominating the phablet category and maintain its 50% market share of a device type that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/02/phablets-asia-pacific-tablets-laptops-growth\">equals tablets and laptops combined</a>&nbsp;in sales in Asia-Pacific. The Note 3 is an improvement on the previous Galaxy Note 2 in every way, and is therefore probably the device to do that.</p> <ul> <li>Star rating: 3</li> </ul><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418877623|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|6fed4e799b7b798e3433aece1458be9c12f7a20f -->",

        "body":"<p>Algorithms, simple functions that hover between mathematical problems and computer programs, are everywhere.</p> <p>Whether dealing with lost packets when using Wi-Fi, or getting your credit-card details securely to an online store, most consumer technology couldn't work without some ingenious solutions to common problems.</p> <p>And when&nbsp;Google decides to change its search algorithm -&nbsp;as it did with Hummingbird last week, it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/02/google-algorithm-bad-retailers-downgrade\">can make or break whole companies</a>.</p> <p>Here are just five which you couldn't live without.</p> <h2>Pagerank – how Google calculates search results</h2> <p>The broad strokes of how Google's&nbsp;search algorithm works have been public for over fifteen years, though the&nbsp;exact way it organises search results remains the company's most closely guarded secret.</p> <p>PageRank is the system at the heart of it all, and the key invention behind Google's rapid dominance of internet search. Ten years ago, when competitors relied on human-maintained indexes of webpages, it allowed the company to assess the value of websites automatically - a massive advantage as the web grew exponentially.</p> <p>The algorithm works by looking at every link to and from every page on the internet. A link to a page is, in effect, a vote for that page's validity, because it means that someone thought that whatever was on that page was worth sharing. So the more inbound links a page has, the higher its PageRank is.</p> <p>But then it adds a second measure: links from pages which have a high PageRank themselves confer a higher PageRank. So being linked to by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu\">Stanford</a>, the Google creators' alma mater, is significantly more valuable than being linked to by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stanfords.co.uk/\">Stanford's</a>, the map shop.</p> <p>On top of PageRank are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/feb/25/1\">myriad tweaks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/12/google-searchengines\">adjustments</a>&nbsp;to improve the results further. Some of those, such as the decision to punish 'link farms', vast networks of sites which link to each other in an effort to boost their PageRank , are directly connected to the core algorithm.</p> <p>Others, like the company's attempts to leverage what it knows about users based on their previous searches to deliver&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;results, were bolted on later.</p> <p>But as the demands we make of search have got ever more intensive, the company has been forced to adapt. The most recent update to the algorithm, Hummingbird is &quot;a new engine built on both existing and new parts&quot;, according to&nbsp;Danny Sullivan of the search blog&nbsp;<a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816\">Search Engine Land</a>.</p> <p>Hummingbird was built to deal with the fact that increasing familiarity with search, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/20/voice-recognition-apple-siri\">the rise of voice control</a>, mean that we now ask Google actual questions, rather than just typing in relevant words.</p> <p>In the future, new problems will require further tweaks, but the position of PageRank at the heart of it all seems secure.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ea606749-1e63-4052-a97f-df427784719c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380706393541/9392550515_f02c893417_o-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Two Enigma machines at the London Science Museum.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Two Enigma machines at the London Science Museum. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/zongo/9392550515/\">Photograph: DAVID HOLT/flickr</a></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Public key cryptography - keeping credit card data secure</h2> <p>Public key cryptography is the name for a broad collection of algorithms which lie at the heart of nearly every form of security online. Using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/05/how-internet-encryption-works\">what is perhaps best described as 'magic maths</a>', public key cryptography lets people encode data with a key which cannot then decode it.</p> <p>If Alice has a piece of information which she needs to get to Bob without anyone else seeing it – maybe a credit card number which she's using to buy a computer with, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/18/tech-companies-appeal-barack-obama-surveillance\">evidence of state wrongdoing which she's leaking to a national newspaper</a>&nbsp;– she has to encrypt it.</p> <p>Way back in history, the only way to do this would be to use a shared secret: a cipher which both Alice and Bob know, but no-one else does. That's how encryption all the way up to the second world war worked.</p> <p>But the obvious problem is that Alice and Bob can't use open channels to agree on their cipher. That's fine if they can meet in person to swap codes, but less effective if Alice is a consumer and Bob a multinational corporation.</p> <p>Public key cryptography means that Bob can tell the world his public key, and let them know that anything encoded with that will be readable by him and only him. Alice sees the public key, locks up her credit card data using it, and then sends that packet on the way.</p> <p>Only Bob, using a second, private, key can decrypt the data and read the number.</p> <p>Unfortunately, doing all of this every time is pretty hard on a computer's processor, so another step, where both Alice and Bob use their keys together to generate a shared secret, is frequently added in most practical uses of public key encryption. That shared secret can then be used in old-fashioned symmetrical ciphers. But it all comes back to the public and private keys.</p> <h2>Correcting errors</h2> <p>CDs are&nbsp;temperamental&nbsp;beasts. When they were introduced, they were hailed as being a resilient replacement for vinyl and cassettes, but as anyone who has tried to play a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2008/aug/07/dirtydiscscleaningcdsandd\">carelessly preserved</a>&nbsp;album found in their car's glovebox can attest to, that's only half true.</p> <p>Still, it could a lot worse. When you're storing data using microscopic pits on a sheet of metal covered with a thin layer of plastic, it's quite a feat to read every single pit correctly, a feat only compounded by later generations of optical media, which shrink the pits still further.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-60109f45-1f86-4c7d-aa78-f074b0415d30\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/13/1379096381218/The-new-police-unit-will--010.jpg\" alt=\"Playback. Photograph: Stockdisc/Getty Images\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Playback. Photograph: Stockdisc/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Error correction lies at the heart of that reliability, thanks to the use of a cunning algorithm which lets CDs be readable even with quite a lot of damage to the data stored on them.</p> <p>In hugely simplified form, imagine the data on a CD as a grid of 1s and 0s. Like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>101</p> <p>010</p> <p>000</p> </blockquote> <p>If there's an error reading the CD, one of those 0s may turn into a 1. Without error correction, there's no way to tell if that's happened, and no way to fix it.</p> <p>The simplest way to correct errors is to add another load of data. Each row and column is counted up, and if there's an even number of 1s, another 1 is added on the end. If there isn't, a 0 is added instead:</p> <blockquote> <p>101<strong>1</strong></p> <p>010<strong>0</strong></p> <p>000<strong>1</strong></p> <p><strong>000</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Now, if one of the 0s is misread, the player can check with the error correction codes, and tell that there's been a mistake – and even, assuming there's not too much damage, what the real value should be.</p> <p>Suppose the bottom right 0 is read as a 1: by reading the error correction code for that row, the player can tell that there's one too many 1s. It can then cross-check with the error correction codes for each column, and spot that there are also too many 1s in one column as well.</p> <p>Now the player knows where the error is, and can carry on with those sweet tunes.</p> <p>Error correction isn't just used by disc drives, though. Nearly every electronic device which gets data from one place to another will have some error correction on it, from WiFi to DSL. Even ISBN numbers on the back of books have error correction: the final digit serves the role.</p> <h2>Protecting passwords</h2> <p>Sometimes, it's really important to check that the file you have been given is exactly the one you expected. Maybe you are worried it's been tampered with, or just want to check that a large download finished without corruption. One way to do that is to look at its hash.</p> <p>There isn't really one algorithm which can be used to make 'hashes' of data: any process which can take information and spit out something which&nbsp;fulfils&nbsp;a few criteria will do.</p> <p>A good cryptographic hash function will give the same output every time it's given the same input; the hash will change if the message changes; it would be nearly impossible to work backwards from the hash to the message; and it would be nearly impossible for two messages to have the same hashes.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c8d3116c-d4e1-4191-ad8a-571e0b1582dc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380706589998/71ff1f30-564a-4297-b962-49acb079e1aa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Logging in.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Logging in. Photograph: Jan Miks/Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <p>But there's a much more important use for hashing data than just checking files: password protection.</p> <p>As is painfully obvious these days,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/12/yahoo-voice-hack-attack-passwords-stolen\">not many organisations can guarantee they won't lose your data</a>. That's&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;problematic if it's your password they've lost, because — well,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2010/sep/30/password-management-internet\">you don't have a different password for every service, do you</a>?</p> <p>These days, companies shouldn't be keeping passwords in plaintext at all. Instead, when a user types in their password for the first time, the site should hash the password, and only keep that.</p> <p>Every time they come back to log in, it can take another hash, and compare it to the one on file. If they match, the password's correct. But now, if the site's hacked, the only thing which gets lost is a table full of hashes which can't be reverse engineered into passwords, so everyone is happy.</p> <p>(Technically, site owners should be salting their hashes - an oh-so-cute term which means adding a little bit of extra data into the password hash to prevent it being&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/nov/23/forgottenyourpasswordgoogle\">reverse engineered</a>.)</p> <h2>Perlin noise: generating landscapes in games</h2> <p>Games are just big bags of algorithms. There's art, music, writing, direction, design and playtesting too, but a lot of algorithms.</p> <p>Take procedurally generated terrain, the&nbsp;favoured&nbsp;way of filling in the vast expanses of games like Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress. It's not enough just to generate random noise, and apply it to a landscape, because if you do, you end up with something which is&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;random: all noise, no pattern. Instead, you want terrain which demonstrates the same fractal nature as the real world, with mountains, hills, boulders and pebbles all having effects on different scales.</p> <p>That's what Perlin noise can do. It's a simple enough algorithm:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm\">generate some random noise at a load of different frequencies, smooth it out, and then add them together</a>. But when you do, you go from this:</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f29154f5-240f-4f78-bcd5-06408262136f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380644045258/85e62fe7-eee0-4158-92c3-cb267508eb29-bestSizeAvailable.gif\" alt=\"Random noise\" width=\"240\" height=\"144\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Random noise.

The obvious way to do it is easy enough: consider every possible route, then take the shortest one from A to B. But that's so computationally intensive that it's unusable in most situations.</p> <p>Instead algorithms like the A* search can be used.</p> <p>How it works is tricky to explain (essentially, it finds a path by always taking the step where the number of steps already taken plus the number of steps in a straight line to the destination is lowest), but it is <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Astar_progress_animation.gif\">entrancing in action</a>.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/16/networker-algorithms-john-naughton\">In August 2011, a rogue algorithm lost its owners $440m on the stock market before it was eventually shut down</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418657774|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|08a94818dd3d5f4f4cf22c8a74b248ea5d220826 -->",

        "headline":"Should gamers be accountable for in-game war crimes?",
        "body":"<p>Don't shoot the civilians. This is something military games have been telling us for many years. I remember my first go on Taito's explosive arcade title Operation Wolf – it was the late-80s and this frenzied blast-'em-up, with its jungle environment and hostage rescue missions, was clearly gunning for a generation of Rambo II fanatics. It even let you control the action with an Uzi-style sub-machine gun bolted to the cabinet. But what it wouldn't let you do was kill passing civilians: collateral damage of this sort took a big chunk off your health bar. </p><p>Of course, this was really more about mechanics than ethics: players were being tested on their reactions and visual awareness, and failure meant a reduction in game time rather than a few moments' reflection on innocent victims. These days, if you accidentally (or otherwise) shoot a civilian or comrade in a military shooter, you'll probably get a 'mission failed' message and a one-way trip back to the last checkpoint. What you won't get is a military tribunal and a dishonorable discharge. </p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24318061\">a BBC news report</a> earlier this week, however, Francois Senechaud from the International Committee of the Red Cross told a reporter that, due to the increasing verisimilitude between first-person shooters and real-life combat, games should start to abide by the international laws of armed conflict. &quot;Video games that represent contemporary battlefields are very close to reality,&quot; he said. &quot;It's difficult to make out the difference between real footage and the footage you get from video games.&quot;</p><p>What the Red Cross wants to see then is the player being penalised for carrying out such actions as willfully killing civilians or torturing enemy combatants, both of which are punishable under international law. <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/film/2013/09-28-ihl-video-games.htm\">A Q&amp;A document posted on the organisation's website</a> explains:</p><blockquote><p>The ICRC is suggesting that as in real life, these games should include virtual consequences for people's actions and decisions. Gamers should be rewarded for respecting the law of armed conflict and there should be virtual penalties for serious violations of the law of armed conflict, in other words war crimes. </p></blockquote><p>And importantly it adds:</p><blockquote><p>Our intention is not to spoil player's enjoyment by for example, interrupting the game with pop-up messages listing legal provisions or lecturing gamers on the law of armed conflict. We would like to see the law of armed conflict integrated into the games so that players have a realistic experience and deal first-hand with the dilemmas facing real combatants on real battlefields. </p></blockquote><p>The ICRC says it is now working directly with the developers of modern military simulations and the BBC report contains an interview with Marek Spanel of Bohemia Interactive, creator of the Arma series, who claims the studio's games will now be implementing the suggestions.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001569\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380798855863/Arma-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Arma 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Arma 2: The Red Cross believes that as video games become ever more realistic, they should also adhere to international rules of warfare.</figcaption></figure><h2>Feasibility studied</h2><p>The question is, how feasible are the ICRC's aims and will players really take on board the lessons about humanitarian law? It is difficult to imagine a Call of Duty or Battlefield title in which shooting a civilian leads to a mission where the player is detained in a military prison for several months before being tried and sentenced. But then if the consequences of illegal operations are subsumed into the gameplay mechanics – i.e. shoot civilian, fail mission – the player will usually read these instances in ludic terms. Within the action, civilians are are not people who deserve humane treatment, they're walking fail states to be avoided in the pursuit of success. </p><p>We do often see the consequences of player actions being threaded into gameplay, but this tends to be in the adventure genre. Titles like Fable, Heavy Rain, Walking Dead and Dishonored all provide different paths for a player depending on their moral decisions during play – and because the action is combined with a confirming narrative element, the meaning and weight of transgression can come through. The idea of an action adventure that put the player into a series of defining humanitarian situations allowing the story to spin-off in the player's moral direction is interesting – but it's hugely unlikely in the action cinema world of the modern shooter.</p><p>Furthermore, the ICRC statement makes clear that it is not interested in other genres – it is concentrating on combat games that depict and concentrate on contemporary battlefields. So how can players be made accountable for their actions beyond simple gameplay devices? How do you move beyond the simple message, &quot;Mission failed, you have broken international law and will spend the next ten years in prison. Re-start mission?&quot; </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001567\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793379957/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfa-008.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: shootouts often occur in areas where civilians are in the line of fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>Moral dilemmas</h2><p>There have been two stand-out examples. In Modern Warfare 2's notorious No Russian mission a US soldier is embedded with a Russian terrorist organisation and must take part in a mass killing at an airport. Success means blending in with the terror squad, and it's up to the player to decide whether that extends as far as shooting civilians. The sequence was brave, but also clumsily handled, exploitative and incongruous; however, it did place the player in a position where many felt they genuinely had to weigh up their moral proclivities with the demands of the gameplay mission.</p><p>Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development's criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals. In a scene reminiscent of the Black Hawk Down incident, they must decide whether to shoot their way out or face death. Although actually, it's more interesting than that, because the first shot fired sends the group fleeing – something the player won't know until they commit to pulling the trigger. And vitally, those who point their gun in the air before firing get the same dispersal effect without casualties. In the heat of the game, facing a furious mob, many players will take the lethal option – but they sure as hell think about it. It is these sorts of split-second decisions that really suggest something about the complexities of combat.</p><p>But then, of course, these examples offer more than a mere punishment mechanic – which is what the ICRC seems to be asking for. If all transgressions automatically lead to failure, it's a zero-sum game that invites only functional thinking. Players need to be able to live with the consequences of actions in more subtle ways. In both Heavy Rain and Walking Dead, players face lethal moral decisions that don't end the game, or even have ludic consequences for the player, but yet play on the mind and colour the experience. The game may be over but the choices remain – and by ending chapter of Waking Dead with a guide to the actions of other players, developer Telltale Games cleverly addresses and confronts the process.</p><p>Often the most affecting moments are those hidden in momentary or supplementary features. The ability to name characters in titles like Cannon Fodder and XCOM, for example, provided a heightened level of emotional attachment for many players. The way we learn little snippets about the lives of the characters passing through our border gates in Papers, Please. The way that mobile phone hacking lets us see into the personal problems of potential targets in Watch Dogs. In games, moral depth is much more about humanisation than it is about punishment. The latter is too intricately tied in with atavistic gameplay systems for us to extrapolate anything deeper than game over.</p><p>We are, though, surely heading into an era where gamers will have to take greater responsibility for their actions – if only because the visual fidelity will be there to splatter our violent failings across the screen in HD detail. In Operation Wolf, accidentally machine gunning a glitching sprite that vaguely resembled a non-military human could be easily divorced from the reality of armed conflict. In Battlefield 5 or Call of Duty 27, it may not be so simple to dismiss the sight of a photo-realistic person lying in the dust, eyes rolling back, limbs spasming. </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001568\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793814696/Battlefield-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Battlefield 4 – the siege of Shanghai level</figcaption></figure><p>I don't even think that's what the ICRC wants – it doesn't want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate. It wants developers to say, in this mission you must fly an armed drone over a school where terrorists are known to be hiding, and you must decide whether to open fire. And it wants players to understand the consequences of such an action, not just in terms of the score or progress, but in terms of the real world of warfare – the one that all military games reflect and fetishise.<br />.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418869488|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|7c253b562d7834958df7ce410c4f48abe5494609 -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Keith Stuart:</strong> The hugely successful author, who died on Tuesday, is being remembered for his blockbusting military novels, but one key element of his career is being overlooked: video games</p>",
        "headline":"Tom Clancy – a video game maker too",
        "body":"<p>Tom Clancy, the author of blockbusting military thrillers who died on Tuesday aged 66, was kind of a big deal in video games. You wouldn't have discovered that from the Today programme's lengthy report this morning, or from most of the obituaries in Wednesday's newspapers. Naturally, as the writer of 28 blockbusting novels, the earliest of which were famously endorsed by Ronald Reagen, it is his literary output that most are recalling today. </p><p>But while his books sold somewhere in the region of either 50m or 100m copies (depending on your source), the games that bore his name passed the lower figure five years ago. To many 20- and 30-somethings, Clancy will be best known, not for gung-ho CIA thrill-fests like Patriot Games or Clear and Present Danger, but for Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell, shooters that licensed his name and also bought his tales of righteous super spies and despicable terror chiefs to interactive life.</p><p>There have been Tom Clancy branded games for 25 years. At first they were loosely affiliated submarine simulations, with early home computer titles based on the Hunt for the Red October and Red Storm Rising. But then in 1996 Clancy co-founded the development studio Red Storm with the intention of better exploring his established and future novels in the gaming realm. In this era, his input was more than simply licensing his credentials. <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3422/postmortem_redstorms_rainbow_six.php\">According to designer Brian Upton</a>, he took part in the original brainstorming session's for the developer's first title, Rainbow Six, as well as providing the designers with valuable military contacts, accrued through his year's of scrupulous research. As the game development progressed, he wrote the accompanying novel beside it. </p><p>Alongside the Illusion Softworks title Hidden &amp; Dangerous, Rainbow Six effectively invented the tactical shooter genre – a more tense and authentic combat experience than the standard war blaster. Players had to command a small squad of counter-terrorist operatives, setting waypoints for their AI troopers and carefully planning attacks rather than barging in, sub-machine guns blasting. It was a huge success and would be followed by several sequels as well as an additional squad-based series, Ghost Recon, this time transferring the tense, strategy action into large battlefields with a more epic feel. It was the Ghost Recon titles, specifically the Advanced Warfare sub-series that popularised intelligent co-operative military action on the home consoles.</p><p>I have never been tempted to pick up a Clancy novel, but I have played pretty much all the games with his name attached. Ubisoft was, I think, his perfect video game partner, able to extract the compelling elements of his novels – the technology, the military detail, the rollicking stories of espionage and intrigue – while reining in some of the patriotic excess. These games were rarely straightforward escapist action yarns, they brought grit and tactical depth, and they did so by utilising Clancy's idea of a world overrun by warring techno factions. Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six are not footnotes on an impressive career, they are highlights.</p><p>In 2002, Ubisoft published Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, a stealth shooter featuring Sam Fisher, effectively Jack Ryan's more muscular younger brother. Clancy has little to do with the development beyond acting as an adviser, though, according to creative director Gregoire Gobbi, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2542487.stm\">speaking to the BBC in 2002</a>, the action was set squarely in Clancy's universe of high-tech weaponry and subterfuge. The author also lay down a series of strict rules for the team, including the assertion that civilians should never be killed – indeed the Splinter Cell series has always added a moral element to the slick action.</p><p>More recently, in the self-reflexive manner common to global entertainment franchises, we've seen the branding go full circle. There is now a range of novels based on the Splinter Cell and Endwar video games series – though none of them were written by Clancy himself. After signing a lucrative deal with Ubisoft in 2008 to license his name, his input seems to have been minimal. But the Clancy brand will remain – as will its promise, of high-tech warfare and compelling tactical action. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418953174|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|9bc3bd9b34ec47f7dd17c87406669da7108eb2da -->",

        "headline":"Moshi Monsters revenues grew in 2012 but Mind Candy sees 'untapped' mobile potential",
        "body":"<p>Children's virtual world Moshi Monsters signed up 15m new users in 2012, but its parent company <a href=\"http://mindcandy.com/\">Mind Candy</a>'s growth was fuelled more by sales of licensed products than subscriptions.</p><p>The London-based firm's turnover grew 62% from £28.9m in 2011 to £46.9m in 2012, while its net profit rose from £7.4m to £8.1m in the same period, according to its annual report filed with Companies House.</p><p>Moshi Monsters ended 2012 with 70m registered users compared to 55m at the end of 2011, with subscriptions and membership cards revenues rising 28.6% to £19.8m in 2012. However, sales of licensed products doubled to £19.3m for the year, accounting for 41% of Mind Candy's overall turnover.</p><p>The obvious comparison is to Rovio, the Finnish company behind Angry Birds. Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/apr/03/angry-birds-rovio-financials-2012\">Rovio made much more money in 2012</a> – around £129m – its proportion of licensing income was similar at 45%. Mind Candy made an additional £7.7m in 2012 from its products division.</p><p>The company claims that Moshi Monsters is the top licensed property in the UK, and cites the success of its self-published Nintendo DS games Moshling Zoo and Moshlings Theme Park in particular.</p><p>Its Moshi Magazine is currently the top-selling children's monthly magazine in the UK, and 28th in ABC's overall rankings. Meanwhile, the Moshi Monsters Music Rox album was released in March 2012 and had sold more than 100,000 copies by November, earning a gold certification from the BPI.</p><p>Mind Candy stresses in its financial report that it continues to carefully manage its licensing business, warning of \"a risk of over exposure of the brand\" while flagging a policy of not over-commercialising Moshi Monsters.</p><p>\"We have been careful with the licensed partners we have chosen and execute a strategy of limiting how many products we have in the market at any one time, for example we aim to only release two Nintendo DS games per year,\" explains the report.</p><p>Mind Candy also provides an update on its expansion plans in the filing, outlining plans to develop new IP \"to build out a successful portfolio of brands\", while noting \"significant growth potential\" for Moshi Monsters in non-English speaking territories.</p><p>The UK's share of Mind Candy's revenues actually edged upwards last year, from 65.2% in 2011 to 66.2% in 2012. The US was its second biggest market in 2012 with 16.8% of revenues, followed by Australia (9.8%). Back in 2010, the UK accounted for just over 46% of Mind Candy's turnover, although its greater share now is a mark of the company's success with licensing in its home country.</p><p>The key area for growth – and possibly the biggest threat to Moshi Monsters as things currently stand – is smartphones and tablets. The company has released a handful of apps, but admits in the report that there are \"untapped revenue and growth opportunities across different platforms not yet exploited for example on smartphones and tablets\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418935070'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/21/1337590841603/moshi-monsters-moshlings.jpg' alt='Moshi Monsters Moshlings app' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Moshi Monsters has spawned a handful of spin-off apps already, like this Moshlings app for iOS</figcaption></figure><p>In July 2012, Mind Candy's chief executive Michael Acton Smith announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/05/moshi-monsters-ipad-app\">a full iPad app for Moshi Monsters would be launching \"in the next few months\"</a>, telling the Children's Media Conference that \"we really firmly believe at Mind Candy that the tablet device is going to be the dominant form of entertainment for kids over the next few years\".</p><p>At that time, Mind Candy already had an in-house mobile team, as well as having struck <a href=\"http://mindcandy.com/2012/05/gree-and-mind-candy-partner-to-bring-moshi-monsters-to-mobile/\">a deal with Japanese social mobile games company GREE</a> for the latter to launch two mobile games later in 2012. Those games never appeared, although an early version of one seen by The Guardian was a FarmVille-style town-building game that looked likely to use in-app purchases.</p><p>In the light of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/26/oft-kids-apps-games-report\">recent Office of Fair Trading report into children's apps</a>, it's possible to see why Mind Candy may have retreated from the idea, or at least adopted a more cautious approach on mobile.</p><p>The full iPad app has also yet to launch, with the likely reason the use of the Flash technology on the Moshi Monsters website. As other children's brands like CBeebies have discovered, re-engineering Flash web games to work well on smartphones and tablets is a challenging task.</p><p>\"Building on work started in 2012 the company is developing new smartphone and tablet titles due to be released in 2013 and 2013 as part of its diversification strategy in order to appeal to a larger demographic,\" explains Mind Candy's 2012 financial report.</p><p>The company's previous annual reports reveal that its meteoric growth in 2010 and 2011 slowed down in 2012. The company's number of registered users grew 190% year-on-year to 32m in 2010, then 72% to 55m in 2011, and now 27% to 70m in 2012 – these are all total registered users, rather than active user figures. Mind Candy's turnover growth was 294% in 2010, 282% in 2011 and then 62% in 2012.</p><p>Making a success of mobile is thus a necessity for Moshi Monsters and similar brands, with more children using tablets in particular. Earlier this week, research firm eMarketer claimed that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/tablet-uk-usage-emarketer-stats\">20m Brits using tablets this year</a>, just under 1.8m will be children aged under 12.</p><p>Ofcom's Communications Market Report 2013, meanwhile, noted that <a href=\"http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2013/08/01/the-reinvention-of-the-1950s-living-room-2/\">24% of British households own at least one tablet</a>, with 91% of tablet-owning parents saying that their children either use it, or have one of their own.</p><p>The main competition for Moshi Monsters used to be other web-based virtual worlds like Disney's Club Penguin. In 2013, it's increasingly brands emerging from the apps world like Angry Birds and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/14/apps-smartphones\">Talking Friends</a>, which have notched up more than 1.7bn and 1bn downloads respectively while expanding into online video and licensed products.</p><p>These brands are based on characters and individual apps, rather than a Moshi-style virtual world. But it's a matter of time before someone disrupts Mind Candy with a direct competitor on mobile devices, so the company's task is to take on that disruptive role itself.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418932698|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|34f52297dfd0e651679bdeff013b14b75f476dc6 -->",

        "body":"<p>One of the UK's most congested highways, connecting the busy container port at Felixstowe to Birmingham, is to become Britain's first internet-connected road in a pilot project that could pave the way for everything from tolls to self-driving cars.</p><p>A network of sensors will be placed along a 50-mile stretch of the A14 in a collaboration between BT, the Department for Transport and the Cambridge start-up Neul, creating a smart road which can monitor traffic by sending signals to and from mobile phones in moving vehicles.</p><p>The technology, which sends signals over the white spaces between television channels instead of mobile phone networks, could even pave the way for government systems to automatically control car speeds.</p><p>The telecoms watchdog Ofcom, which on Wednesday approved the project as part of its new <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/spectrum-management-strategy/\" title=\"\">blueprint</a> for how Britain will use spectrum, is already forecasting what high technology traffic systems will look like.</p><p>\"Sensors in cars and on the roads monitor the build-up of congestions and wirelessly send this information to a central traffic control system, which automatically imposes variable speed limits that smooth the flow of traffic,\" Ofcom said. \"This system could also communicate directly with cars, directing them along diverted routes to avoid the congestion and even managing their speed.\"</p><p>Onboard computers could essentially override the driver, imposing maximum speeds on the vehicle by controlling the brakes and the engine. While the concept may sound futuristic, Google is already developing a computer-driven car, which uses cameras, radar, and range finders to detect obstacles and other vehicles. The Google smart car has been extensively tested on public highways and smart roads lined with sensors.</p><p>The A14 project will not involve smart cars, but is a first step in building the infrastructure such vehicles will need. It could also lay the ground for charging motorists to use busy roads.</p><p>The Highways Agency is proposing a £1.5bn improvement to the A14 which would be paid for by a <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Hauliers-launch-campaign-against-A14-toll-20130918163552.htm#ixzz2gZll8yHT\" title=\"\">toll</a>, with lorries paying up to £3 to use the improved route. The BT's sensor project could help design the toll and the road improvements. The project will initially gather information on car drivers before moving on to collect information on heavy goods vehicles. The information will be sent back to a database to which the Department for Transport will have access.</p><p>\"Understanding traffic patterns, in different weather conditions at different times of day, will allow changes to traffic regulation,\" said Stan Boland, chief executive of Neul. \"In the future it might provide data that could be used for road pricing, vehicle tracking, and breakdown.\"</p><p>Within one or two years, Boland believes the UK will have national, regional and city-wide networks of sensors, connected to simple tracking devices monitoring everything from whether council bins need emptying and which parking spaces are free to the location of missing pets.</p><p>While traffic data is already gathered by companies such as the satnav maker TomTom, using mobile phone networks, the A14 project offers a low-cost alternative. Instead of relying on mobile masts, which costs tens of thousands to install, Neul will use small base stations that cost a few pounds and can be fixed to street lamps or, in the case of the A14, the outside of nearby BT exchanges.</p><p>The project is one of a series approved by Ofcom to explore white space, which is currently used by cameras and microphones for films, theatres and live events but in many areas lies empty. In Glasgow, where consumer take-up of broadband is among the lowest in the country, Microsoft will be using the spectrum to install free wifi in the city centre. Working with the University of Strathclyde, the software group will install sensors around the city to measure pollution and humidity.</p><p>White space is also useful for getting broadband signals into rural areas, because it travels longer distances and through obstacles such as leaves and trees. On the Isle of Wight, an Ofcom-approved trial will get remote homes online.</p><p>Google is also taking part as one of a number of companies developing intelligent databases that could eventually allow smartphones and tablets to use white space to connect to the internet instead as an alternative to mobile signals.</p><p>The databases will tell devices which bands are empty in their local area, and at what power level the signal can safely operate without interfering with nearby users. Demand for data over wireless devices is forecast to be 80 times higher than it is today by 2030, and Ofcom is bent on increasing the amount of spectrum available to connect machines ranging from computers to parking meter sensors to the internet.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418888444|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|3b164729f77f17b95a077cc53290da3480a6efd2 -->",

        "headline":"Lavabit founder raises $20,000 to fund court battle",
        "body":"<p>Ladar Levison, the founder of secure email service Lavabit, <a href=\"https://rally.org/lavabit\">has raised more than $20,000</a> to pay the legal fees incurred by a court battle to prevent government interference in his service.</p> <p>The money already raised is half of the $40,000 target set by Levison, who says that \"defending the constitution is expensive\". Prominent donors so far include Apple blogger John Gruber, writer Merlin Mann, and <a href=\"http://www.pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Maciej Ceglowski.</p> <p>Edward Snowden, whose disclosures about NSA activities revealed extensive US electronic surveillance capability worldwide, was using a Lavabit email address when he announced a press conference at Moscow's airport. R<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/lavabit-snowden-pen-register/\">ecently uncovered documents</a>&nbsp;also reveal that the site attracted the attention of the US Justice department just one day after Snowden revealed himself as the source of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/nsa-files-edward-snowden-gchq-whistleblower\">the Guardian's stories</a>.</p> <p>As a secure email service, Lavabit encrypted users' messages. The site acted as a trusted third party, with Levison enabling encryption services but not storing the private keys himself. For the government to eavesdrop on Lavabit's customers, it would have to force Levison either to store their private keys, or share the SSL certificate the site uses to keep communication between itself and users private.</p> <p>However Levison <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/08/lavabit-email-shut-down-edward-snowden\">abruptly closed Lavabit in August</a>, writing in explanation to his customers that he refused \"to be complicit in&hellip; crimes against the American people and the US Constitution,\" about which he was not permitted to speak further. At the time, he was not even&nbsp;able to confirm that there was a court case against him.&nbsp;</p> <p>More details of that case, which will be heard in Virginia's&nbsp;4th Circuit Court of Appeals, have become available &ndash; though \"the entire record in the district court, including all applications, subpoenas, motions, warrants, and orders, remains under seal,\" the prosecutors say&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/799986-lavabit-15.html#document/p1\">in a public filing</a>.</p> <p>That document shows the chronology of the government's dealings with Lavabit. Two specific orders stand out: a \"pen register order\", on 28&nbsp;June, and an \"order to show cause\" on 9 July.</p> <p>The former is an order to record data prospectively, storing requested details (for example, the metadata of emails) as they come in. The latter is typically used by the government to ask a court to enforce a demand which hasn't been complied with.</p> <p>The judge whose orders Levison is challenging is&nbsp;Claude M. Hilton, the&nbsp;Senior US District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. Hilton served on the secret&nbsp;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for seven years, until 2007.</p> <p>Levison's opening brief in the appeal is due 3 October.</p> <p><em>&bull; This article was amended on 4 October 2013. The original gave the surname of the Lavabit founder as Levinson.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418833426|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|0fd148d891f007449bc891ea19de88edb7bb9ddd -->",

        "body":"<p>Apple says it is working on a fix after some users discovered that its iMessage service is not working after they upgraded to its new iOS 7 software for iPhones and iPads.</p> <p>Since the software was released on 18 September a number of people have complained that messages they send over the service are never delivered. Apple says that it is \"aware of an issue that affects a fraction of a percent of our iMessage users, and we will have a fix available in an upcoming software update\".</p> <p>The issue could affect up to 2m users.</p> <p>Apple didn't offer any other information about timing, nor whether the fix would be rolled into other updates for recently discovered problems with iOS 7 such as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/siri-flaw-apple-ios-7-security\">Siri lockscreen bug</a>&nbsp;discovered over the weekend with its 7.0.2 update.</p> <p>The iMessage service sends messages via the data channel, meaning that they can be any length, unlike the text messages which they effectively replace and which are limited to 160 characters. It also makes them free for users with data allowances, whereas text messages may be charged for.</p> <p>Apple said that until the update is provided, \"we encourage any users having problems to reference our troubleshooting documents or contact AppleCare to help resolve their issue. We apologise for any inconvenience this causes impacted users.\"</p> <p>Apple hasn't indicated how many people are affected by the problem. But on 23 September it said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/23/iphone-5s-5c-apple-record-nine-million\">200m devices had been upgraded to iOS 7</a>. At that point, according to data from Mixpanel, a third-party web and mobile analytics company, about 56% of active iOS devices were running iOS 7. Mixpanel now says the figure is 65%, suggesting that the figure is about 232m devices on iOS 7. (Android 4.1.x, the most-used single version of Google's OS, is on 36.6% of devices, equivalent to about 287m users, according to data from Google.)</p> <p>The large number of installations means that even if only 0.9% of iOS 7 users are affected, it would create problems on 2m devices. A number of posters on Apple's Support site <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5390155?tstart=0\">are reporting problems</a>.</p> <p>Some users have found that they can work around the problem simply by restarting the device. Another suggested option which users have discovered is to disable iMessage (in Settings &gt; Messages), reset the Network Settings (Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings) and then turn iMessage back on.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418854553|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|7c105c4c3858af443c1e0ad98e00a3cd7ecfbadb -->",

        "headline":"Bill Gates: Microsoft investors reportedly call for co-founder to depart",
        "body":"<p>Three of the top 20 investors in Microsoft are lobbying the board to press for Bill Gates to step down as chairman of the software company he co-founded 38 years ago, according to people familiar with matter.</p> <p>The outgoing Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has been under pressure for years to improve the company's performance and share price, but this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at Gates, who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology.</p> <p>A representative for Microsoft declined to comment on Tuesday.</p> <p>There is no indication that Microsoft's board would heed the wishes of the three investors, who collectively hold more than 5% of the company's stock, the sources say. They requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions are private.</p> <p>Gates owns about 4.5% of the $277bn company and is its largest individual shareholder.</p> <p>The three investors are concerned that Gates's presence on the board effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes. In particular, they point to Gates's role on the special committee searching for Ballmer's successor.</p> <p>They are also worried that Gates &ndash; who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation &ndash; wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding.</p> <p>Gates, who owned 49% of Microsoft before it went public in 1986, sells about 80m Microsoft shares a year under a pre-set plan, which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018.</p> <p>Gates lowered his profile at Microsoft after he handed the chief executive role to Ballmer in 2000, giving up his day-to-day work there in 2008 to focus on the $38bn Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p> <p>In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months, amid pressure from activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management.</p> <p>Microsoft is now looking for a replacement, though its board has said Ballmer's strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy.</p> <p>News that some investors were pushing for Gates's departure as chairman provoked mixed reactions from other shareholders.</p> <p>\"This is long overdue,\" said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which owns Microsoft shares. \"Replacing the old guard with some fresh eyes can provide the oxygen needed to properly evaluate their corporate strategy.\"</p> <p>Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, suggested now was not the time for Microsoft to ditch Gates, and that he could even play a larger role.</p> <p>\"I've thought that the company has been missing a technology visionary,\" she said. \"Bill [Gates] would fit the bill.\"</p> <p>Microsoft is still one of the world's most valuable technology companies, making a net profit of $22bn last fiscal year. But its core Windows computing operating system, and to a lesser extent the Office software suite, are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular.</p> <p>Shares of Microsoft have been essentially static for a decade, and the company has lost ground to Apple and Google in the move toward mobile computing.</p> <p>One of the sources said Gates was one of the technology industry's greatest pioneers, but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418797515|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1cf38e2045dad7afee22003af5574912ae05b82c -->",
