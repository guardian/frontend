        "headline":"How much should I pay for free software?",
        "body":"<p><em>I build my own PCs, so I pay for the hardware, the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office and an internet security suite. All the other software I use is free: CCleaner, Exact Audio Copy, TrueCrypt, Anvir, ClassicShell, Dimension 4, xxclone, xxcopy, Firefox and Firefox add-ons Adblock Plus and NoScript etc.</p><p>I use these all the time, and I couldn't do without them, but I've only ever donated to TrueCrypt. I feel that I should be contributing to them all, say on an annual basis.</p><p>Some free software is a free (reduced functionality) version of a product that one can buy. Does one donate less for such software compared with open-source software where there's no product for sale? </p><p>How do you decide how much to donate, and how often?  Is there some sort of norm?  What do you suggest?</em></p><p><strong>Chris</strong></p><p></p><p>Tricky question! There are a few simple cases, which I can cover, but there isn't a single answer.</p><p>Some software publishers – whether companies or individuals – would like to be paid. The usual approach is to have a free version and a paid-for version with added features and/or support. Examples include AnVir, AVG and Malwarebytes. Some companies offer programs free for home use and<br />charge for commercial use, so you can buy the commercial version even if you're a home user. In all these cases, donations aren't really appropriate.</p><p>Some publishers offer \"donationware\", but if so, they should make that clear, and make it easy to pay. They can do this by putting a donation button on their website, or inside the program. For example, if you click Help in Paint.net, the dropdown menu has a PayPal option: Donate. This takes you to a <a href=\"http://www.getpaint.net/donate.html\">web page</a> that says: \"We ask for a donation of  $12.00 US, but of course we appreciate any amount.\" Exact Audio Copy also has a donation page.</p><p>I think $12 is a reasonable sum for Paint.net. You could donate up to $5 for a browser plug-in, $10-$15 for a utility, and $15-$20 for a more substantial program, such as a video editor like Avidemux, depending on the quality and usefulness of the software. You might want to be more, or less, generous but those are ballpark figures.</p><p>The problem is that lots of free software suppliers don't have paid versions and don't solicit donations ... and they may not want them. They would need to set up a PayPal or Visa account or whatever banking system. Also, I think donations would count as income for tax purposes, so they have to be accounted for. Accepting money has overheads, and maybe they just don't<br />think it's worth it.</p><p>However, if you look at <a href=\"http://www.thinkman.com/dimension4/faq.htm\">Dimension 4</a>, the website doesn't ask for money but it does say: \"We love reading and responding to emails from our customers. On any topic ...\"</p><p>So the answer in this and many other cases is to drop the publisher an email, tell them what you really like about their product, and perhaps suggest a feature they might add. Everybody likes getting appreciative emails, and they may be valued more than the anonymous $5 you might have sent instead.</p><p>In your email, you can ask if they have a system for accepting donations, or if they have an Amazon wishlist, so you could buy them a book or CD or whatever. (I don't think they'd feel obliged to declare the odd personal gift to the taxman.) You could also offer to make a donation to their favourite charity.</p><p>It would be fantastic if we all donated even $5 a month as a regular thing. Even a small percentage of 1.5 billion PC users making donations would make an impact. But I don't think it's going to happen.</p><p>PS <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-edge/\">Adblock Edge</a> is a fork of Adblock Plus without the \"acceptable ads\" feature.</p><h2>Not paying for Microsoft Office</h2><p><em>I recently bought a new laptop and needed some kind of office software, so I read your article headed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/apr/25/microsoft-office-which-version-windows-8\">Microsoft Office: which version should I buy?</a> In the article you state: \"The good news is that under the new system, most home users don't need to pay anything for Microsoft Office: they can use the free, cloud-based service in the form of Microsoft Office web apps.\" I created a document in SkyDrive, as you said, but when I saved it to the laptop, it wouldn´t open and said I needed to buy the office software. Sorry, but I am confused!</em></p><p><strong>Tricia</strong></p><p>The Microsoft Office Web Apps allow you to create Office documents online, save them, and email them to people without buying a copy of Office. But, usually, online services only work while you are online. If you want to edit the documents on your own PC, then your PC needs to have software that can handle them.</p><p>If you only want to do word processing, all is not lost. Microsoft Windows includes a free, lightweight word processor called WordPad. Run WordPad, click in the top left to open an existing document, and you can load and edit the document you downloaded from SkyDrive. You will get a message that says \"WordPad does not support all of the features of this document's format. Some content might be missing or displayed improperly.\" However, if you're just doing ordinary stuff, you're unlikely to see any difference.</p><p>WordPad lets you save your documents in several different formats including plain text (.txt), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Microsoft Office Open XML (.docx), and OpenDocument format (.odt). RTF is a good format to choose as you can use different typefaces and almost any word processor can read it, but it isn't very efficient if your documents include pictures or diagrams.</p><p>Many people find it useful to have a copy of Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student both to create documents and to read documents they download or receive in emails. But if you don't want to buy a copy, Microsoft provides free viewers that enable you to view and print these documents on your laptop. You can download the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4\">Word Viewer</a> and use it to read and print, but not edit, the document you created in SkyDrive.</p><p>There are also viewers for Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10\">Excel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download details.aspx?id=\"13\"\">PowerPoint</a>. Again, these will work on your PC.</p><p>You could also try one or two of the free open source word processors. <a href=\"http://www.abisource.com/\">AbiWord</a> is buggy, has an old fashioned interface, and has limited compatibility with Microsoft Office, but at least it's fairly nippy (or was, when I last tried it). There's also <a href=\"http://www.libreoffice.org/features/writer/\">LibreOffice Writer</a> (from the old OpenOffice suite), which is more powerful but slower and even buggier.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420249631|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|12feb1185b14648c04660629d0a4a48fe8663e1b -->",

        "body":"<p>Power plants across the US and Canada could overheat, shut down or be caused to malfunction because of&nbsp;vulnerabilities that leave them open to hacking, <a href=\"http://www.automatak.com/robus/\">according to new research</a>.</p> <p>If exploited, the vulnerabilities could be used to crash or potentially hijack the servers controlling electronic substations, water utilities and power plants.</p> <p>Adam Crain, Chris Sistrunk and Adam Todorski, who are working with industrial consultants Automatak, found 25 zero-day vulnerabilities &ndash; flaws&nbsp;which have never before been seen in the wild &ndash; in the protocol by which power plants and other parts of the electricity grid communicate internally.</p> <p>Such protocols are rarely examined by security researchers because they are isolated from the internet, the usual source of hacking attacks.</p> <p>In addition, the specificity of the protocols, known as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, means that the are thought to have a sort of security through obscurity: if few know how they work, then it is hoped no one will have the knowledge to exploit them.</p> <p>Crain warns this is a false comfort. &ldquo;If someone tries to breach the control center through the internet, they have to bypass layers of firewalls,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/ics/\">he told Wired&rsquo;s Kim Zetter. &ldquo;But someone could go o</a>ut to a remote substation that has very little physical security and get on the network and take out hundreds of substations potentially. And they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to get into the substation either.&rdquo;</p> <p>Project Robus, the name for the team&rsquo;s ongoing search for vulnerabilities, has so far reported nine of the potential exploits to the vendor who designed each one, as well as <a href=\"https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov\">the US Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p> <p>Most of the vulnerabilities allow potential attackers to send controlling servers into infinite loops, rendering them unable to respond to commands from controllers. That isn&rsquo;t the same as rendering them unable to control the utilities, but it could mean that the operators in charge of sections of the power grid are blind to conditions on the ground.</p> <p>The worst of the vulnerabilities exposed so far enables a potential buffer-overflow attack, whereby code stored for one purpose &ldquo;overflows&rdquo; its container, and can end up being executed when it shouldn&rsquo;t be. At its most serious, this allows for code to be injected into servers, which could allow attackers to take over the whole system.</p> <p><strong>&bull; This is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/smart-meters-uk-hacking-electricity\">cyber equivalent of a nuclear strike</a> &ndash;&nbsp;and yet our electricity grid is more vulnerable than ever&nbsp;</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236828|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|3eb01fc9490059a1e6251fb7ee4cfdece5af5806 -->",

        "headline":"Sony Smartwatch 2 review: a second screen for your Android phone",
        "body":"<p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 is the third iteration of Sony’s smartwatch platform that acts as a second screen for almost any Android 4.0 smartphone.&nbsp;</p> <p>With its upgraded interface, slim hardware and waterproof body, Sony has improved its smartwatch in almost all areas, while maintaining its functionality as a solid timepiece.</p> <h2>Designed to look like a watch</h2> <p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 strikes a fine line between looking like a nerdy gadget on your wrist and resembling a regular watch.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6203ad39-0dd6-49e2-b889-2fb11e8091cd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943565041/05b2247c-ed4e-45af-b971-bd193d9dfd34-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: designed to look like a watch.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: designed to look like a watch.</figcaption> </figure> <p>It is square, but as its aluminium body is only 9mm thick it is not that much chunkier than an oversized watch and will fit comfortably under a shirt cuff.</p> <p>Following the lead of recent Sony smartphones such as the Xperia Z and Z Ultra, the Smartwatch 2 is waterproof with an IP 57 rating, which means it is watertight at up to 1m deep for 30 minutes.</p> <p>In reality that means you can wear it day to day without having to worry about getting it wet while washing your hands or running through the British downpours, as long as you’ve ensured the micro USB protective cover is properly closed.</p> <p>Sony sells the Smartwatch 2 with black rubber strap; however, it also offers a range of coloured rubber and leather straps. The Smartwatch 2 also uses a standard 24mm watchstrap fitting, meaning you can customise the strap with one of your own and aren’t tied to Sony’s options.</p> <p>The top of the device is dominated by a 1.6in transflective touchscreen LCD which – unlike most LCD displays currently in use – allows you to see the display without a backlight by reflecting ambient light.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dec64489-9c3c-40f0-a303-85ca865887a8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943728310/5f2eb8e9-d19e-47d3-a532-e2e264ed4b21-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: persistent time display.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: persistent time display. Photograph: /Sony</figcaption> </figure> <p>That means the Smartwatch 2 has a persistent, readable display that shows a watch face by default and makes it very easy to use the smartwatch to actually tell the time, something that’s important if you’re replacing a regular watch with it.</p> <p>Unfortunately the display is decidedly low resolution, which means text from notifications, as well as pictures and even the watch faces, look pixelated at times.</p> <p>The screen is something you can and do get used to, but compared to the high-resolution, pixel perfect screens of most smartphones today, it has noticeably lower fidelity.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 1.6in transflective LCD with 220 x 176 pixels</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> 280MHz single-core processor</li> <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Modified bespoke variant of Android</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 3.0, NFC, micro USB</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 42 x 9 x 41 mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 122.5g</li> <li><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP57</li> </ul> <h2>Intuitive to use, just like Android</h2> <p>Pairing and setup of the Smartwatch 2 is pretty straightforward using NFC and Bluetooth – one tap of an NFC-equipped phone and the software takes care of the rest, prompting you to download any software you need from the Google Play store.</p> <p>For those using an Android phone without NFC – any phone with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and up with Bluetooth will work with the Smartwatch 2 – you simply have to pair the phone and watch via Bluetooth.</p> <p>Sony has given the Smartwatch 2 a low power, single-core processor in an effort to balance battery life with the physical size of the device. Processor power is always a trade-off, and for the most part Sony’s Smartwatch 2 performs well enough.</p> <p>Unfortunately that doesn’t mean the experience completely lag free.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f74e0a0-5740-41ed-84c2-c27a59848407\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943928477/31d54362-7d95-44f3-8d91-680d685eeff6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: slim profiled aluminium body\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: slim profiled aluminium body</figcaption> </figure> <p>Battery life is relatively good, and I got a good four days of usage out of the Smartwatch 2 with quite a few alerts and apps running. You would probably need to charge it once every three days to be on the safe side, but a full charge takes about an hour.</p> <p>The Smartwatch 2 runs a bespoke variant of Android, which resembles the regular platform with a homescreen full of app icons and the usual Home, Back and Options buttons below the screen. There’s even a slide-down notifications tray, just like Android on a smartphone or tablet, which is where the lag creeps in.</p> <p>The Smartwatch 2 can hang when a notification is being accessed, failing to respond to taps and swipes for a second or so. It’s not every time, and seems to be linked to the watch’s Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, but it can be annoying.</p> <p>The watch vibrates to notify you of incoming actions, including phone calls which pop up and allow you to dismiss or answer them, if you have a Bluetooth headset connected – there are no speakers or microphone hidden within the Smartwatch 2.</p> <p>Navigating the interface is relatively intuitive using swipes and taps, which again resembles the way an Android phone or tablet is operated. A long tap brings up an options menu, which is unique to the particular app that’s currently in use. Often that can be a bit confusing, as some apps allow you to clear notifications, and others, such as the Twitter app, allow you to, for example, retweet.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d107aeb9-f349-4813-8d66-155234d3716f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381944297957/91ab1d65-48e9-488a-828b-b6bfbe6ac993-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: NFC pairing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: NFC pairing</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Apps galore</h2> <p>Speaking of the Twitter app, out of the box the SmartWatch 2 comes with limited functionality, offering built-in apps that allow you to set timers or alarms. Everything else needs to be installed from the Sony SmartConnect app, which handles the management of the smartwatch and is available for free in the Google Play store.</p> <p>Sony has produced apps for handling calls, reading text messages, email, Facebook and Twitter updates, as well as calendar alerts, photos and music control.</p> <p>Beyond that, users are reliant on existing Smartwatch apps, available from previous iterations of the Sony platform, which kicked off with the LiveView in 2010. Three years later there are about 300 apps available for the Smartwatch 2.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it would be unfair to say there’s an app for everything – there is no app for handling Google Hangouts for instance – but developers are actively producing apps for services such as WhatsApp.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Smartwatch 2 starts at &pound;149, which comes with the standard black silicon rubber strap and a Runtastic Pro application.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ad22b4f9-54c9-4012-9c10-8ccce07ee1c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381944421672/b7364d67-e5ae-4585-ae64-f22f5e6f8399-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2 review - digital watch face.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: digital watch face.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Verdict: A great second screen for your smartphone</h2> <p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 is more of a second screen for your Android smartphone than a true smartwatch. It has very limited functionality without being paired with a phone.</p> <p>It does, however, function very well as a timepiece, which some other smartwatches certainly don't, and it is readable in any lighting conditions thanks to its transflective display.</p> <p>Sony has managed to foster a relatively large third-party app collection for its Smartwatch range, which bolsters its functionality significantly. Sony says the Smartwatch 2 is a work in progress, and it is actively listening to customer feedback and updating the watch with new software and features.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter notifications are handy, as well as having access to your text messages or email on your wrist, but the Smartwatch 2’s low-resolution screen, limited functionality beyond notifications and &pound;150 price make it more of a novelty than a must-have item.</p> <p>Having said that, if you're after a smartwatch that works with any Android phone with version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and above, then the Smartwatch 2 is arguably your best option right now.</p> <p><strong>• Star rating: 3/5</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420178579|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|f41ac64556055359e356476c686f887c0f886480 -->",

        "headline":"Kim Dotcom's Mega 'not being used for wide-scale copyright infringement'",
        "body":"<p>Kim Dotcom may be seen as a villainous pirate-king by the creative industries, but his Mega cloud storage service is attracting white-collar professionals, according to its chief executive Vikram Kumar.</p><p>\"The segment that seems to be most interested in Mega, and in paying for space, security and privacy tends to be professionals,\" Kumar told the Copyright and Technology conference in London this morning, beaming in for his keynote interview via Skype.</p><p>\"Accountants, lawyers, financial advisers, architects... These are people that want to use the internet, are concerned that their confidential client information may get compromised, and who are willing to pay for security and privacy online.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/20/kim-dotcom-mega-launch\">Dotcom launched Mega in January 2013</a>, a year after his previous company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/23/kim-dotcom-denies-internet-piracy\">MegaUpload was taken down after a police raid</a>. He recruited telecoms exec Kumar in February as CEO of the new company, leaving Dotcom to continue fighting US charges of criminal copyright infringement, while working on a digital music service called Baboom.</p><p>Kumar was keen to stress Mega's credentials as a law-abiding service. \"The simplest explanation of Mega, particularly for those people who've used Dropbox is that its a secure and faster Dropbox,\" he said. \"It's essentially a cloud storage company, but in the future it wants to become more of a cloud collaboration and communication company.\"</p><p>He also stressed that the service, which has 5m customers so far, is currently attracting a very small number of copyright takedown notices from rightsholders. \"Mega has on average about 2-3m files uploaded each day, and we get around 100 takedown notices for alleged copyright infringement every day,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's a very very small number for any online service provider. In comparison, YouTube gets 15m takedown requests every month, so the numbers tell us that Mega is not being used for wide-scale copyright infringement.\"</p><p>One of Mega's main selling points is its end-to-end encryption technology, with the company promising users that since their files are encrypted on their devices before being uploaded, Mega never sees the decrypted versions – and nobody does unless the uploader gives them the decryption key.</p><p>The obvious question is whether this is the real reason Mega gets so few takedown requests: copyright owners can't see infringing files being shared on the service if they don't have the keys, unlike the technologies and partners they use to detect infringement on other online services?</p><p>Kumar suggested that if rightsholders' main concern is their music, films or TV shows being shared, they'll still be able to spot this infringement, since it requires decryption keys to be shared publicly. However, he added that Mega intends to crack down on external search engines claiming to index files stored on the service.</p><p>\"Let's be quite clear: Mega doesn't want that happening. We don't think search indexes or anything that encourages copyright infringement or illegal use of the service should exist,\" he said.</p><p>\"We don't want those websites out there, and to the extend that we can do anything about it, if they're using 'Mega' in a way that conveys the impression to people that it's linked to the company, we are able to take action either for trademark violation, passing off or fraud.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420238834'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382003440929/mega-vikram-kumar.jpg' alt='Mega Vikram Kumar' width='460' height='291' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mega CEO Vikram Kumar Skyped in for his Copyright and Technology interview</figcaption></figure><p>Mega isn't planning to add features that could be seen either as facilitating copyright infringement, or which would require licensing deals with copyright owners: for example, the ability for people to stream music or films directly from their Mega storage, even if they own them.</p><p>\"We are quite clear that we don't want to have files that are uploaded stored and that can be streamed as an audio or video from Mega, because that's not Mega's purpose,\" he said.</p><p>Kumar criticised rightsholders for their approach to copyright takedowns with other companies, suggesting that the automated nature of both sending takedown notices (for rightsholders) and acting on them (for services like YouTube) leaves the process open to false positives.</p><p>\"There are a large number of copyright notices being sent that would truly not stand up to scrutiny in a court of law,\" he said. \"Most service providers are so afraid, they act on every copyright notice. So I think there is a fair amount of files being taken down which, if they were examined individually, would not stand up to scrutiny as meeting the bar for takedown.\"</p><p>Kumar hinted at big plans ahead for Mega to provide storage for other web services, apps and even consumer electronics devices, citing the example of an unnamed manufacturer that's using Mega as the cloud storage provider for its connected TVs.</p><p>\"It has no storage, it has no place to keep any files. So what they do: the apps connect with Mega in the back-end, for storage,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you have a digital video recorder, which time-shifts recordings, the TV can't store the time-shifted recordings anywhere, so it stores them on Mega's cloud storage, and pulls them down whenever it needs it.\"</p><p>Kumar smiled at a follow-up question on how pay-TV providers might respond to this kind of feature, if it starts to disintermediate their own services and hardware.</p><p>\"I think there's a lot of industries that have got disintermediated by the internet and cloud systems,\" he said. \"There hasn't been that much shakeup in the TV industry. I see that coming in the next 2-3 years. Am I concerned? Probably not. As a customer, I would enjoy that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238237|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|ff5223df226291dc140948f9d4adc962a7578a79 -->",

There isn't any \"deception\" going on.</p><p>The larger issue of opt-out vs. opt-in is worthy of discussion in a broader context: when do consumers need to opt-in vs. being permitted to opt-out? As mentioned there's substantial survey based evidence that most consumers would not opt-in to most online advertising programs, which would compromise the ability of publishers and ad networks to serve more targeted ads and maximize revenue.</p></blockquote><p>Would be fascinating to see how it would go if Google were to make such changes opt-in instead. After all, if people approve of the idea, surely they would happily opt in?</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/16/facebook-ad-profit-a-staggering-1790-more-on-iphone-than-android/\">Facebook ad profit a staggering 1,790% more on iPhone than Android &gt;&gt; VentureBeat</a></h2><blockquote><p>A study of 200 billion ads on Facebook advertising says that mobile ads on iPhone generate 1,790% more return on investment than ads on Android. Even worse, advertising on Android actually costs more than it returns.</p><p>The study is by Nanigans, one of the biggest buyers of Facebook ads, and it focuses on retailers, saying that in the past year on Facebook's desktop ads, clickthroughs are up 375% and overall return on investment is 152%.</p><p>But it's when the report focuses on mobile advertising that the really surprising numbers pop up.</p></blockquote><p>Advertising on Android returns only 90% of what it costs. However, it might take some time for the first-order effects of this - whatever they actually are - to come through.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/16/akamai-half-of-all-internet-connections-now-at-4mbps-safari-remains-most-used-mobile-browser-globally/\">Akamai: half of all internet connections now at 4Mbps+, Safari remains most used mobile browser &gt;&gt; TechCrunch</a></h2><blockquote><p>Akamai notes that when it looks at access from mobile devices over cellular networks, Android Webkit is just edging out Mobile Safari, with other browsers trailing quite a ways behind. Webkit, it notes, accounted for 38% of requests, while Safari 34%. When usage was tracked across cellular and other networks (for example, broadband via WiFi), Safari shot into the lead, with 54% of all requests and Android Webkit at 27%+. This could partly be attributed to iPad usage; perhaps also just to the fact that while iOS owners may be proportionally smaller than Android device owners, when you take into account all kinds of usage, they are simply just using their devices more.</p></blockquote><p>Odd.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-16/open-source-everything-the-moral-of-the-healthcare-dot-gov-debacle\">Open-source everything: the moral of the Healthcare.gov debacle &gt;&gt; Businessweek</a></h2><p>Paul Ford: </p><blockquote><p>Put charitably, the rollout of healthcare.gov has been a mess. Millward Brown Digital, a consulting firm, reports that a mere 1% of the 3.7 million people who tried to register on the federal exchange in the first week actually managed to enroll. Even if the problems are fixed, the debacle makes clear that it's time for the government to change the way it ships code — namely, by embracing the approach to software development that has revolutionized the technology industry.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.counterpointresearch.com/top-10-phones-in-september-galaxy-s-4-sales-drop-but-still-leads-the-pack#ystfuv\">Top 10 phones in August: Galaxy S4 sales drop but still leads the pack &gt;&gt; Counterpoint Research</a></h2><blockquote><p>Premium smartphone (above US$400 wholesale) category sales are showing signs of stagnating growth as most of the sales in the premium segment are coming from replacement sales from existing smartphone users. But the overall smartphone market is still growing at the rate of 40~50% a year with major growth thus coming from burgeoning smartphone sales in the sub US$200 price segments</p><p>September month sales are very important to shape the holiday season demand trajectory, a decisive moment distinguishing which phones are going to be top-sellers. Galaxy S4 sales might – pick up again with special holiday pricing though we expect the flagship model to sell 80% more than its predecessor the Galaxy S3 from launch till year end, instead of our previous view of 100% more.</p></blockquote><p>SGS4 sell-through (ie bought by end users) was 5m in August, it says; it counts the iPhone 516GB as a different phone from the iPhone 5 32GB, which seems odd.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/16/when-will-the-european-union-five-reach-smartphone-saturation/\">When will the European Union Five reach smartphone saturation? &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2><blockquote><p>If we define saturation as the end of the \"Late Majority\" period then the number of new-to-smartphone users remaining for the combined EU5 + USA markets is 110m of which 59m will adopt in the US and 51 million in Europe. They will all join ecosystems in the next two years.</p><p>Plan accordingly.</p></blockquote><p>Current US + EU5 adult consumer smartphone population: 315m. Which will grow roughly by a third. Note his caveat: \"The population is defined as adults using phones for themselves. Meaning it excludes children and phones purchased by companies.\"</p><p>Question is whether that is headroom or legroom for growth.</p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a></p><p>To suggest a link, either add it below or tag it with @gdntech on the free <a href=\"http://www.delicious.com/\">Delicious</a> service.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420194999|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|3d78f19e1d8ca65b21cb85b176f5817ecea5a834 -->",

        "body":"<p>Samsung is offering a trade-in program on batteries for its flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone after some users complained they were draining rapidly or even swelling.</p><p>Some reports in Germany claimed that one carrier there had seen up to 30% returns from users who bought the phone. Samsung said <a href=\"http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s4-battery-problems-samsung-offers-free-battery-replacements\">in a statement to TrustedReviews</a> that \"We are aware of this issue, which has affected a limited number of customers.\" It didn't elaborate on how many have been affected.</p><p>The company added: \"We ask all affected customers to please visit their nearest Samsung Electronics service centre, where they can receive a replacement battery for free of charge. We remain committed to providing the best possible user experience for our customers.\"</p><p>The German site Mobiflip <a href=\"http://www.mobiflip.de/samsung-galaxy-s4-akku-aufgeblaeht-und-ohne-leistung/\">claims</a> that it has \"found many users with this problem\".</p><p>However Samsung declined to put a figure on the number of phones affected, or to specify whether it is only some regions or variants of the Galaxy S4 which have been affected.</p><p>The Galaxy S4 was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/15/galaxy-s4-launched-samsung-tracking\">launched</a> in March, bringing a number of features including an eight-core chip, an eye-tracking system and non-touch gestures to control the screen. Samsung has not offered any sales figures for the handset, though analysts reckon that it was the best-selling smartphone worldwide in August. </p><p>Anecdotal reports of problems with battery drain are not unusual on new phones which are made in large numbers. But Samsung's introduction of a wide-ranging replacement program suggests that the difficulties affect more than a few handsets. </p><p>There have been some reports since April on users forums of problems with rapid battery drain, such as <a href=\"http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s4/273969-battery-problems.html\">one on Android Central in April</a> who said that their new S4 discharged within an hour without any use. Similar problems <a href=\"http://www.gottabemobile.com/2013/05/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-problems-battery-life-display/\">were reported in May</a>, with some users saying the phone was getting hot.</p><p> Other users have complained of the battery swelling, <a href=\"http://www.gutefrage.net/frage/handyakku-minimal-aufgeblaeht#answers\">so that the phone doesn't lie flat</a>. A number of users have chosen to buy replacement batteries from retailer sites - which is possible because the S4 has a user-replaceable battery.</p><p>Affected owners can find a service centre <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/support/location/supportServiceLocation.do?page=SERVICE.LOCATION\">via Samsung's UK website.</a>.</p><p>Samsung had not replied to a request for further comment from the Guardian by the time of publication.</p><p>• Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 reviewed: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-is-it-a-tablet-or-a-phone\">is it a tablet, or a phone</a>?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420222061|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|e92295acd875b165fb17851a977557d50bfae2fd -->",

        "body":"<p>What makes a smartwatch smart? If you're Samsung, then you'd say it's the inclusion of phone connectivity and apps, albeit with a hefty price tag (and heft to match) in the form of its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/04/samsung-galaxy-gear-smartwatch\">Samsung Galaxy Gear</a>, launched&nbsp;in September. If you're the Californian startup <a href=\"http://getpebble.com/\">Pebble</a>, it's offering notifications from your phone, and a couple of apps, and a low price. If you're Sony, with the Smartwatch 2, then it's apps plus telling the time, all the time.</p> <p>But industry experts reckon none of the current crop - of which the Pebble is by far the best-selling, claiming more than 250,000 shipped - has truly &quot;smart&quot; functionality. And that&nbsp;leaves the door wide open for something that multiple sources are murmuring about: a Google Now-powered wearable.</p> <p>According to Juniper Research, &quot;smart wearables&quot;, which includes smartwatches and glasses, will have raked in $1.4bn during 2013, rising to $19bn by 2018. That's more than 50% annual growth, making the segment a lucrative addition to the smartphone and connected devices category.</p> <p>T<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/21/pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter\">he Pebble</a>&nbsp;came to notice as the most successful Kickstarter project ever, raising $10.2m last year. After shipping to its 85,000 backers, it has gone on general sale for around &pound;100 at outlets such as Best Buy.</p> <p>But what every smartwatch lacks right now are truly intelligent features that make them a compelling purchase, argues Benedict Evans, telecoms and tech analyst at Enders Analysis, who calls the current crop &quot;pre-iPod&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;In the same way lots of digital music players existed before the Apple iPod, theyjust weren't good enough; they didn't do what the iPod did and revolutionise the sector,&quot; Evans says. &quot;The iPod of smartwatches is needed to really turn the smartwatch category into something useful.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c5b47995-43b8-474a-aae3-8cba6540a0e6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381932167268/7403ea15-9196-49cb-bd34-77343867a1b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work.

For the most part it simply displays notifications, your Twitter feed, text messages or provides music controls for changing track remotely playing on your phone.</p> <p>Despite supporting third-party applications, without an Android smartphone the Smartwatch 2 simply tells the time and provides timers and alarms; it has no built-in capability to connect to the internet or access the third-party apps, which are serviced from the smartphone.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Pebble's primary function is also to display notifications: it connects via Bluetooth to an iPhone or Android phone and shows who's calling or texting, and can also be used to change music tracks. There is an SDK (software development kit) to let developers write apps.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a1e3293b-3400-4442-9dfc-8cb8e5c216b1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381932613591/f2a537cf-fa30-48c0-8d6f-2f676aa0e631-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch is tied to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch is tied to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

The codename is said to be &quot;Gem&quot;. But what can Google bring to this problem?</p> <p>&quot;Just mirroring your smartphone's screen isn't enough. A smartwatch needs to add more value, providing the wearer the right information, but also delving into the health and wellbeing potential of a sensor-packed device on your wrist,&quot; said Ben Wood&nbsp;Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.</p> <p>But&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/apr/29/google-now-ios\">Google Now</a> does exactly that: with your permission (which has to be given explicitly), it learns from your actions, your travels, your searches, your emails, calendars, text messages and hobbies and notifies you with &quot;cards&quot; carrying information that is time, context and location-sensitive.</p> <p>At the end of your work day, it will start telling you about routes for your commute home, and whether trains are delayed or roads congested.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eaffe9fb-f116-4d95-8034-89ac378039fd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381932216933/efb76835-e0bb-4c4f-949f-9dd97b3b3e2f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work. Photograph: Adrian Maciburko</figcaption> </figure> <p>It can pull your flight information from your email and calendar tracking delays, popping up notifications for when to leave for the airport from your current location given the current traffic levels.</p> <p>Google Now also helps you on your commute, notifying of likely delays to your usual journey and suggesting various travel routes from which to choose based on your habitual modes of travel, and offering to keep people of your choosing updated on your progress automatically.</p> <p>When travelling outside of your hometown, Google Now becomes even more useful. It can pull in restaurant and attraction suggestions, currency conversion rates, public transport routes and maps guiding like a local would in a foreign land.</p> <p>It also tracks certain preset conditional information, such as the sports scores of your favourite teams, popping up alerts when someone scores a goal or wins a race.</p> <p>All these notifications are displayed only when deemed necessary by the event, your location, the time of day and even the day of the week.</p> <p>&quot;Google Now is useful. It's Google's evolution of search, trying to predict the information you might want- rather than waiting for you to type your query into a search box, it sends you suggestions and recommendations based on what it knows about you,&quot; explains Ian Maude, at Enders Analysis.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given more data such as a heart rate monitor, pedometer and activity tracker, Google Now could add physical wellbeing information to its data set.</p> <h2>Truly worth wearing</h2> <p>A smartwatch that not only collated but also learnt from its wearer's routines, only popping a notification when necessary – that would truly be worthy of the “smart” moniker.</p> <p>And that's the expectation - that “Gem” will rely heavily on Google Now, providing “serendipitous” information as well as phone alerts, while allowing push-button access to Google’s voice search.</p> <p>Google Now could be the making of an Android smartwatch, with access to a wealth of the user’s data to make it intelligent enough to learn what’s required and when.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cfe83e11-9a5a-4778-80f6-fedcd179560d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381932274047/47bbc2f6-fddd-4134-80ca-d2797618e473-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google Time concept by Adrian Maciburko of how a Google smartwatch could work. Photograph: Adrian Maciburko</figcaption> </figure> <p>&quot;What sits behind this is that the smartwatch could be the end point for a new wave of services like Google Now that leverage prediction based on the measurement, tracking and recording of where you are,&quot; explains Evans.</p> <p>&quot;Whether the piece of glass that shows you that information is in your pocket, on your wrist or strapped to your head [like Google Glass] is almost secondary to the collection and display of that data,&quot; he concludes.</p> <p>Google isn't the only company in a position to create this kind of experience, of course. Apple's Siri digital personal assistant works in much the same way, although it has far less focus on serendipitous information and more on providing answers to questions. Google Now relies on the enormous processing power, public data (such as transport timetables) and personalised information that Google can focus on the question of &quot;what does this person want to know now?&quot;</p> <p>Siri, by contrast, waits to be asked.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet with its latest mobile operating system iteration, iOS 7, Apple has started displaying unprompted context-sensitive information based on your location within Notification Centre, including how long it will take you to get home. (Again, it's a permission-based system which requires the user to enable a &quot;favourite locations&quot; setting.)</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9da81602-247c-4371-b30a-9e57a121324e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381932331012/d0f576c3-90a1-44cd-82c9-6e2091fbde24-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Apple's iOS 7 provides context-sensitive information within its Notification Centre on the iPhone.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Apple's iOS 7 provides context-sensitive information within its Notification Centre on the iPhone.</figcaption> </figure> <p>&quot;Apple has got smartwatches in the lab, but its executives are looking at them and asking &quot;do they make sense? Do they add value? Would you recommend one of these to your friends?&quot; The current answer is obviously, no, not yet, otherwise we'd have an Apple iWatch strapped to our wrists,&quot; said Evans.</p> <p>Apple has long been rumoured to be working on an Apple iWatch, although it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/10/smartwatch-apple-iwatch\">failed to materialise</a>&nbsp;in September at the launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C.</p> <p>Nor is Microsoft out of the running. Windows Phone devices will tell you how long it will take you to get to your next meeting, based on information from your calendar and location. (Again, it's opt-in.) That's driven by Nokia's maps information. The key is the back-end services, which have to understand what you'll probably want to do or know at any time. Arguably, Microsoft got there first with its SPOT watches - introduced in 2004, killed off in 2012 and turned off in 2012, just as the smartwatch revolution was beginning to get into gear.</p> <h2>Smartwatches could be the smartphone of the wrist</h2> <p>&quot;Smartwatches could be to the watch what the smartphone is to the phone - it could replace traditional timepieces and connect to a whole range of devices, not just phones,&quot; says Maude.&nbsp;&quot;But, for that to happen, smartwatches either need to provide something genuinely novel, something that adds value to your daily life that your smartphone, tablet or computer can't,&quot; he continued.</p> <p>There are certain conditions, both technological and economical, that need to be met first.</p> <p>The primary driver of a truly &quot;smart&quot; smartwatch will be battery technology, explained Maude:</p> <p>&quot;Battery technology is the key limiting factor right now - it's improving, but not anywhere near the rate of processor technology, which means that a device that could be powerful enough to do everything we want would only last about 3 hours on a single charge.&quot;</p> <p>The other condition is the price of the watch, &quot;at &pound;300, the Galaxy Gear is a novelty - it will never be mass market,&quot; said Maude.</p> <p>&quot;Until the price of a smartwatch comes down to the point where it's actually competing with Swatch watches [&pound;40-&pound;100] or something like that, it's not going to be a mass market product,&quot; Maude concluded.</p> <p><strong>• Samsung's Galaxy Gear: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/26/analysis-why-samsungs-smartwatch-is-doomed-to-fail\">doomed to fail</a>?</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420045081|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|a275737b8219adbcabd41644f4ea0b19d85402c2 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 is the third iteration of Sony’s smartwatch platform that acts as a second screen for almost any Android 4.0 smartphone.&nbsp;</p> <p>With its upgraded interface, slim hardware and waterproof body, Sony has improved its smartwatch in almost all areas, while maintaining its functionality as a solid timepiece.</p> <h2>Designed to look like a watch</h2> <p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 strikes a fine line between looking like a nerdy gadget on your wrist and resembling a regular watch.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6203ad39-0dd6-49e2-b889-2fb11e8091cd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943565041/05b2247c-ed4e-45af-b971-bd193d9dfd34-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: designed to look like a watch.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: designed to look like a watch.</figcaption> </figure> <p>It is square, but as its aluminium body is only 9mm thick it is not that much chunkier than an oversized watch and will fit comfortably under a shirt cuff.</p> <p>Following the lead of recent Sony smartphones such as the Xperia Z and Z Ultra, the Smartwatch 2 is waterproof with an IP 57 rating, which means it is watertight at up to 1m deep for 30 minutes.</p> <p>In reality that means you can wear it day to day without having to worry about getting it wet while washing your hands or running through the British downpours, as long as you’ve ensured the micro USB protective cover is properly closed.</p> <p>Sony sells the Smartwatch 2 with black rubber strap; however, it also offers a range of coloured rubber and leather straps. The Smartwatch 2 also uses a standard 24mm watchstrap fitting, meaning you can customise the strap with one of your own and aren’t tied to Sony’s options.</p> <p>The top of the device is dominated by a 1.6in transflective touchscreen LCD which – unlike most LCD displays currently in use – allows you to see the display without a backlight by reflecting ambient light.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dec64489-9c3c-40f0-a303-85ca865887a8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943728310/5f2eb8e9-d19e-47d3-a532-e2e264ed4b21-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: persistent time display.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: persistent time display. Photograph: /Sony</figcaption> </figure> <p>That means the Smartwatch 2 has a persistent, readable display that shows a watch face by default and makes it very easy to use the smartwatch to actually tell the time, something that’s important if you’re replacing a regular watch with it.</p> <p>Unfortunately the display is decidedly low resolution, which means text from notifications, as well as pictures and even the watch faces, look pixelated at times.</p> <p>The screen is something you can and do get used to, but compared to the high-resolution, pixel perfect screens of most smartphones today, it has noticeably lower fidelity.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 1.6in transflective LCD with 220 x 176 pixels</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> 280MHz single-core processor</li> <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Modified bespoke variant of Android</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 3.0, NFC, micro USB</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 42 x 9 x 41 mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 122.5g</li> <li><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP57</li> </ul> <h2>Intuitive to use, just like Android</h2> <p>Pairing and setup of the Smartwatch 2 is pretty straightforward using NFC and Bluetooth – one tap of an NFC-equipped phone and the software takes care of the rest, prompting you to download any software you need from the Google Play store.</p> <p>For those using an Android phone without NFC – any phone with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and up with Bluetooth will work with the Smartwatch 2 – you simply have to pair the phone and watch via Bluetooth.</p> <p>Sony has given the Smartwatch 2 a low power, single-core processor in an effort to balance battery life with the physical size of the device. Processor power is always a trade-off, and for the most part Sony’s Smartwatch 2 performs well enough.</p> <p>Unfortunately that doesn’t mean the experience completely lag free.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f74e0a0-5740-41ed-84c2-c27a59848407\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943928477/31d54362-7d95-44f3-8d91-680d685eeff6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: slim profiled aluminium body\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: slim profiled aluminium body</figcaption> </figure> <p>Battery life is relatively good, and I got a good four days of usage out of the Smartwatch 2 with quite a few alerts and apps running. You would probably need to charge it once every three days to be on the safe side, but a full charge takes about an hour.</p> <p>The Smartwatch 2 runs a bespoke variant of Android, which resembles the regular platform with a homescreen full of app icons and the usual Home, Back and Options buttons below the screen. There’s even a slide-down notifications tray, just like Android on a smartphone or tablet, which is where the lag creeps in.</p> <p>The Smartwatch 2 can hang when a notification is being accessed, failing to respond to taps and swipes for a second or so. It’s not every time, and seems to be linked to the watch’s Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, but it can be annoying.</p> <p>The watch vibrates to notify you of incoming actions, including phone calls which pop up and allow you to dismiss or answer them, if you have a Bluetooth headset connected – there are no speakers or microphone hidden within the Smartwatch 2.</p> <p>Navigating the interface is relatively intuitive using swipes and taps, which again resembles the way an Android phone or tablet is operated. A long tap brings up an options menu, which is unique to the particular app that’s currently in use. Often that can be a bit confusing, as some apps allow you to clear notifications, and others, such as the Twitter app, allow you to, for example, retweet.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d107aeb9-f349-4813-8d66-155234d3716f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381944297957/91ab1d65-48e9-488a-828b-b6bfbe6ac993-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2: NFC pairing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: NFC pairing</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Apps galore</h2> <p>Speaking of the Twitter app, out of the box the SmartWatch 2 comes with limited functionality, offering built-in apps that allow you to set timers or alarms. Everything else needs to be installed from the Sony SmartConnect app, which handles the management of the smartwatch and is available for free in the Google Play store.</p> <p>Sony has produced apps for handling calls, reading text messages, email, Facebook and Twitter updates, as well as calendar alerts, photos and music control.</p> <p>Beyond that, users are reliant on existing Smartwatch apps, available from previous iterations of the Sony platform, which kicked off with the LiveView in 2010. Three years later there are about 300 apps available for the Smartwatch 2.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it would be unfair to say there’s an app for everything – there is no app for handling Google Hangouts for instance – but developers are actively producing apps for services such as WhatsApp.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Smartwatch 2 starts at &pound;149, which comes with the standard black silicon rubber strap and a Runtastic Pro application.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ad22b4f9-54c9-4012-9c10-8ccce07ee1c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381944421672/b7364d67-e5ae-4585-ae64-f22f5e6f8399-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sony Smartwatch 2 review - digital watch face.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Sony Smartwatch 2: digital watch face.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Verdict: A great second screen for your smartphone</h2> <p>The Sony Smartwatch 2 is more of a second screen for your Android smartphone than a true smartwatch. It has very limited functionality without being paired with a phone.</p> <p>It does, however, function very well as a timepiece, which some other smartwatches certainly don't, and it is readable in any lighting conditions thanks to its transflective display.</p> <p>Sony has managed to foster a relatively large third-party app collection for its Smartwatch range, which bolsters its functionality significantly. Sony says the Smartwatch 2 is a work in progress, and it is actively listening to customer feedback and updating the watch with new software and features.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter notifications are handy, as well as having access to your text messages or email on your wrist, but the Smartwatch 2’s low-resolution screen, limited functionality beyond notifications and &pound;150 price make it more of a novelty than a must-have item.</p> <p>Having said that, if you're after a smartwatch that works with any Android phone with version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and above, then the Smartwatch 2 is arguably your best option right now.</p> <p><strong>• Star rating: 3/5</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420178579|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|f41ac64556055359e356476c686f887c0f886480 -->",

        "body":"<p>Facebook has removed a restriction for users under 18 that limited who could see their online posts.</p> <p>Facebook said teenagers would now be able to manually alter the setting and share information with the public. Until now, posts by those who registered their age as less than 18 could be viewed only by their friends, and by friends of their friends. </p> <p>\"Teens are among the savviest people using of social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard,\" Facebook said in an announcement of the changes.</p> <p>\"While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services,\" the company said.</p> <p>Facebook is under increasing competition for younger users from a new crop of mobile and social services, such as SnapChat and WhatsApp.</p> <p>The executive director of the non-profit Center for Digital Democracy, Jeffrey Chester, said Facebook was sacrificing the safety and privacy of teenage users to further its business.</p> <p>\"Teens don't necessarily have good judgment and to the extent that they make themselves visible to the wider public, there's all kind of people &ndash; from predators to junk food marketers &ndash; who are surveilling Facebook for new kinds of targets,\" Chester said.</p> <p>Other social media services also allow teens to share information with the broader public. But Chester said the amount of personal information users had on Facebook was much more extensive than on other social services, where users can create accounts with pseudonyms.</p> <p>Facebook said teenage users would now also be allowed to use the \"Follow\" feature, which lets strangers automatically receive public posts from another user without requiring that the two be connected on the service as mutual friends.</p> <p>Facebook's manager of privacy and public policy, Nicky Jackson Colaco, said the changes would allow teenagers to share information that might benefit from dissemination to a broader audience, such as information about fundraising efforts, or a teen rock band trying to promote an upcoming performance.</p> <p>The 16-year-old Pakistani activist&nbsp;Malala Yousafzai would not have been able to use Facebook as a broad communication channel under the previous policy, said Stephen Balkam, of the Family Online Safety Institute, a non-profit body that receives funding from several internet companies, including Facebook.</p> <p>Facebook said it would show teenage users a special notice the first couple of times they attempted to post information to the public, reminding the user that the post can be seen by anyone.</p> <p>The restrictions on teen use of Facebook's private messaging feature will not change, with users under 18 able to receive messages only from their friends and from friends of their friends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198663|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4007eb34e9b72da81a8a237ab2669ff8e6cf565e -->",

        "body":"<p>Power plants across the US and Canada could overheat, shut down or be caused to malfunction because of&nbsp;vulnerabilities that leave them open to hacking, <a href=\"http://www.automatak.com/robus/\">according to new research</a>.</p> <p>If exploited, the vulnerabilities could be used to crash or potentially hijack the servers controlling electronic substations, water utilities and power plants.</p> <p>Adam Crain, Chris Sistrunk and Adam Todorski, who are working with industrial consultants Automatak, found 25 zero-day vulnerabilities &ndash; flaws&nbsp;which have never before been seen in the wild &ndash; in the protocol by which power plants and other parts of the electricity grid communicate internally.</p> <p>Such protocols are rarely examined by security researchers because they are isolated from the internet, the usual source of hacking attacks.</p> <p>In addition, the specificity of the protocols, known as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, means that the are thought to have a sort of security through obscurity: if few know how they work, then it is hoped no one will have the knowledge to exploit them.</p> <p>Crain warns this is a false comfort. &ldquo;If someone tries to breach the control center through the internet, they have to bypass layers of firewalls,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/ics/\">he told Wired&rsquo;s Kim Zetter. &ldquo;But someone could go o</a>ut to a remote substation that has very little physical security and get on the network and take out hundreds of substations potentially. And they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to get into the substation either.&rdquo;</p> <p>Project Robus, the name for the team&rsquo;s ongoing search for vulnerabilities, has so far reported nine of the potential exploits to the vendor who designed each one, as well as <a href=\"https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov\">the US Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p> <p>Most of the vulnerabilities allow potential attackers to send controlling servers into infinite loops, rendering them unable to respond to commands from controllers. That isn&rsquo;t the same as rendering them unable to control the utilities, but it could mean that the operators in charge of sections of the power grid are blind to conditions on the ground.</p> <p>The worst of the vulnerabilities exposed so far enables a potential buffer-overflow attack, whereby code stored for one purpose &ldquo;overflows&rdquo; its container, and can end up being executed when it shouldn&rsquo;t be. At its most serious, this allows for code to be injected into servers, which could allow attackers to take over the whole system.</p> <p><strong>&bull; This is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/smart-meters-uk-hacking-electricity\">cyber equivalent of a nuclear strike</a> &ndash;&nbsp;and yet our electricity grid is more vulnerable than ever&nbsp;</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236828|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|3eb01fc9490059a1e6251fb7ee4cfdece5af5806 -->",

        "headline":"Kim Dotcom's Mega 'not being used for wide-scale copyright infringement'",
        "body":"<p>Kim Dotcom may be seen as a villainous pirate-king by the creative industries, but his Mega cloud storage service is attracting white-collar professionals, according to its chief executive Vikram Kumar.</p><p>\"The segment that seems to be most interested in Mega, and in paying for space, security and privacy tends to be professionals,\" Kumar told the Copyright and Technology conference in London this morning, beaming in for his keynote interview via Skype.</p><p>\"Accountants, lawyers, financial advisers, architects... These are people that want to use the internet, are concerned that their confidential client information may get compromised, and who are willing to pay for security and privacy online.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/20/kim-dotcom-mega-launch\">Dotcom launched Mega in January 2013</a>, a year after his previous company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/23/kim-dotcom-denies-internet-piracy\">MegaUpload was taken down after a police raid</a>. He recruited telecoms exec Kumar in February as CEO of the new company, leaving Dotcom to continue fighting US charges of criminal copyright infringement, while working on a digital music service called Baboom.</p><p>Kumar was keen to stress Mega's credentials as a law-abiding service. \"The simplest explanation of Mega, particularly for those people who've used Dropbox is that its a secure and faster Dropbox,\" he said. \"It's essentially a cloud storage company, but in the future it wants to become more of a cloud collaboration and communication company.\"</p><p>He also stressed that the service, which has 5m customers so far, is currently attracting a very small number of copyright takedown notices from rightsholders. \"Mega has on average about 2-3m files uploaded each day, and we get around 100 takedown notices for alleged copyright infringement every day,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's a very very small number for any online service provider. In comparison, YouTube gets 15m takedown requests every month, so the numbers tell us that Mega is not being used for wide-scale copyright infringement.\"</p><p>One of Mega's main selling points is its end-to-end encryption technology, with the company promising users that since their files are encrypted on their devices before being uploaded, Mega never sees the decrypted versions – and nobody does unless the uploader gives them the decryption key.</p><p>The obvious question is whether this is the real reason Mega gets so few takedown requests: copyright owners can't see infringing files being shared on the service if they don't have the keys, unlike the technologies and partners they use to detect infringement on other online services?</p><p>Kumar suggested that if rightsholders' main concern is their music, films or TV shows being shared, they'll still be able to spot this infringement, since it requires decryption keys to be shared publicly. However, he added that Mega intends to crack down on external search engines claiming to index files stored on the service.</p><p>\"Let's be quite clear: Mega doesn't want that happening. We don't think search indexes or anything that encourages copyright infringement or illegal use of the service should exist,\" he said.</p><p>\"We don't want those websites out there, and to the extend that we can do anything about it, if they're using 'Mega' in a way that conveys the impression to people that it's linked to the company, we are able to take action either for trademark violation, passing off or fraud.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420238834'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382003440929/mega-vikram-kumar.jpg' alt='Mega Vikram Kumar' width='460' height='291' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mega CEO Vikram Kumar Skyped in for his Copyright and Technology interview</figcaption></figure><p>Mega isn't planning to add features that could be seen either as facilitating copyright infringement, or which would require licensing deals with copyright owners: for example, the ability for people to stream music or films directly from their Mega storage, even if they own them.</p><p>\"We are quite clear that we don't want to have files that are uploaded stored and that can be streamed as an audio or video from Mega, because that's not Mega's purpose,\" he said.</p><p>Kumar criticised rightsholders for their approach to copyright takedowns with other companies, suggesting that the automated nature of both sending takedown notices (for rightsholders) and acting on them (for services like YouTube) leaves the process open to false positives.</p><p>\"There are a large number of copyright notices being sent that would truly not stand up to scrutiny in a court of law,\" he said. \"Most service providers are so afraid, they act on every copyright notice. So I think there is a fair amount of files being taken down which, if they were examined individually, would not stand up to scrutiny as meeting the bar for takedown.\"</p><p>Kumar hinted at big plans ahead for Mega to provide storage for other web services, apps and even consumer electronics devices, citing the example of an unnamed manufacturer that's using Mega as the cloud storage provider for its connected TVs.</p><p>\"It has no storage, it has no place to keep any files. So what they do: the apps connect with Mega in the back-end, for storage,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you have a digital video recorder, which time-shifts recordings, the TV can't store the time-shifted recordings anywhere, so it stores them on Mega's cloud storage, and pulls them down whenever it needs it.\"</p><p>Kumar smiled at a follow-up question on how pay-TV providers might respond to this kind of feature, if it starts to disintermediate their own services and hardware.</p><p>\"I think there's a lot of industries that have got disintermediated by the internet and cloud systems,\" he said. \"There hasn't been that much shakeup in the TV industry. I see that coming in the next 2-3 years. Am I concerned? Probably not. As a customer, I would enjoy that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238237|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|ff5223df226291dc140948f9d4adc962a7578a79 -->",

We remain committed to providing the best possible user experience for our customers.\"</p><p>The German site Mobiflip <a href=\"http://www.mobiflip.de/samsung-galaxy-s4-akku-aufgeblaeht-und-ohne-leistung/\">claims</a> that it has \"found many users with this problem\".</p><p>However Samsung declined to put a figure on the number of phones affected, or to specify whether it is only some regions or variants of the Galaxy S4 which have been affected.</p><p>The Galaxy S4 was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/15/galaxy-s4-launched-samsung-tracking\">launched</a> in March, bringing a number of features including an eight-core chip, an eye-tracking system and non-touch gestures to control the screen. Samsung has not offered any sales figures for the handset, though analysts reckon that it was the best-selling smartphone worldwide in August. </p><p>Anecdotal reports of problems with battery drain are not unusual on new phones which are made in large numbers. But Samsung's introduction of a wide-ranging replacement program suggests that the difficulties affect more than a few handsets. </p><p>There have been some reports since April on users forums of problems with rapid battery drain, such as <a href=\"http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s4/273969-battery-problems.html\">one on Android Central in April</a> who said that their new S4 discharged within an hour without any use. Similar problems <a href=\"http://www.gottabemobile.com/2013/05/02/samsung-galaxy-s4-problems-battery-life-display/\">were reported in May</a>, with some users saying the phone was getting hot.</p><p> Other users have complained of the battery swelling, <a href=\"http://www.gutefrage.net/frage/handyakku-minimal-aufgeblaeht#answers\">so that the phone doesn't lie flat</a>. A number of users have chosen to buy replacement batteries from retailer sites - which is possible because the S4 has a user-replaceable battery.</p><p>Affected owners can find a service centre <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/support/location/supportServiceLocation.do?page=SERVICE.LOCATION\">via Samsung's UK website.</a>.</p><p>Samsung had not replied to a request for further comment from the Guardian by the time of publication.</p><p>• Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 reviewed: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-is-it-a-tablet-or-a-phone\">is it a tablet, or a phone</a>?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420222061|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|e92295acd875b165fb17851a977557d50bfae2fd -->",

        "body":"<p>Rural homes stranded without broadband will soon be able to plug into the web via the 4G mobile network – by planting an antenna on the roof or simply switching on a router in the living room.</p><p>EE, Britain's largest mobile operator, is planning to throw down the gauntlet to BT on 11 November by launching what it says will be the UK's first commercially available 4G home broadband service.</p><p>Initially available in Cumbria, the offer will roll out to other hard-to-reach areas over the coming months.</p><p>\"We think 4G can become an affordable alternative to fixed broadband in rural areas,\" said EE's chief executive, Olaf Swantee. \"The government is fixated on fixed, but mobile can provide a solution economically.\"</p><p>As with Wi-Fi, several devices, including laptops, tablets and phones, will be able to connect to the internet wirelessly via a router placed in the home. The only difference is that the router will be connected to EE's 4G mobile network, rather than a fixed broadband line.</p><p>EE has been trialling home broadband over the airwaves in a <a href=\"http://www.northernfellsbroadband.co.uk/pages/eeregister.php\" title=\"\">pilot project</a> in the Northern Fells district of Cumbria since 2012. EE will announce prices next month, but those participating in the trial were charged from £15.99 a month for a connection of 8-12 megabits a second. The speed is equivalent to a typical copper wire broadband service.</p><p>With an area of over 100 square miles and a population of 2,600, the Northern Fells is one of the most poorly connected areas of the country. Local MP Rory Stewart has been at the forefront of the debate over rural broadband, and nearly 900 out of the 1,400 premises have signed up for the service when it launches.</p><p>The government has come under fire for its management of the publicly funded project to bring broadband to the countryside. Delays mean the deadline to reach 95% of UK premises has now been extended to 2017, with no target for 100% coverage beyond then.</p><p>Mobile firms are lobbying now for a share of the £250m in public funds set aside to reach the most remote 10% of homes, saying 4G may offer a cheaper solution than digging cables over long distances.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420189017|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4834201f50ff8ada1fb6de15fcda70b7337ca58e -->",

        "body":"<p>Within four hours of launching a Kickstarter project, <a href=\"http://vincent.etter.io/publications/etter2013cosn.pdf\">three researchers from the Swiss university EPFL can tell whether it will succeed &ndash; with 76% accuracy</a>&nbsp;(PDF).</p> <p>According to their paper, presented at the <a href=\"http://cosn.acm.org/\">Conference on Online Social Networks</a>, Vincent Etter, Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran beats the current best estimates by 8 percentage points. <a href=\"http://egerber.mech.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Crowdfunding-Support-Tools_Predicting-Success-Failure_2013.pdf\">An earlier paper by an American team</a> can predict success with 68% percent accuracy.</p> <p>By combining information on the interest shown on the project on Twitter, the previous projects backed by supporters, and the number of first-time backers &ndash;&nbsp;as well as the all-important figure of how quickly money is coming in&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Swiss team achieve a marked boost in accuracy just a few hours into the project.</p> <p>The academics have also built <a href=\"http://sidekick.epfl.ch/index/sort/elapsed/order/asc\">a tool, \"Sidekick\", applying their theories</a> to live Kickstarter projects. HexFlex, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1370839232/hexflex-the-snowboarding-adventure-tool\">a project to build a snowboarding adventure tool</a>, launched eight hours ago and has already achieved 17% of its $10,000 funding, and Sidekick gives it a 92% chance of success. But <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/territarantula/a-four-song-7-vinyl-ep-from-terri-moeller-to-you\">a four-song EP by indie rock artist Terri Moeller</a>, launched at the same time, is only given a 16% chance, despite having already raised nearly a third of its desired $2,157.</p> <p>&ldquo;The model reaches 85% accuracy after only 10% of the campaign [duration],&rdquo; says Etter. &ldquo;The accuracy is of course close to 100% near the end of the campaign, but this is pretty useless, as there is not much you can do at that point.&rdquo;</p> <p>In a way, higher accuracy is just a way of breaking artist&rsquo;s hearts quicker. If a project has failed to take off in the first few hours, the chance of it recovering is low. &ldquo;It is not impossible to recover from a slow start,&rdquo; Etter adds. &ldquo;There are projects that took a while to take off, but that eventually made it. Nevertheless, I would say that if your project has still not taken off by the middle of the campaign, your chances are quite low.&rdquo;</p> <p>The key difference between the Etter&rsquo;s approach and the earlier paper, led by Michael Greenberg, is that the American team only looks at information available before the Kickstarter has been launched. It uses a large array of categories, including the project category, whether or not the campaign has a video uploaded, and how many rewards are offered, to calculate the likelihood of success.</p> <p>Taking them together, Etter offers some advice to would-be crowdfunders. &ldquo;As shown by Greenberg's work, it is really important to put a lot of effort into the campaign itself: description, introduction video, rewards, etc. But once it has launched, you should try to maintain some activity on social networks.</p> <p>&ldquo;This sounds trivial, but generating tweets about your project, by sharing updates, engaging backers, etc., is the best way to create attention and ultimately get people to back your project.</p> <p>&ldquo;Moreover, one thing that comes out from the many descriptive studies on Kickstarter campaigns is that campaigns that fail usually ask for more money, over a longer time period (with the exception of video games, for which successful campaigns have a higher goal on average). So you should be realistic about what you ask.&rdquo;</p> <p>But would-be inventors should also be realistic about their chances of success overall. Overall, only 44% of Kickstarter campaigns succeed, which means that simply assuming that every campaign will fail will still be correct more than half the time.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/21/kickstarter-above-the-game-ban\">In June, Kickstarter was forced to ban \"seduction guides\" after a book which advised men to \"force her to rebuff your advances\" was funded one the site.</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420139745|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|324caa40cf7b2f8d07aa40fb0ab66a6a458d6931 -->",

        "headline":"From ripe to ruined: why cheap mobile data is what really killed BlackBerry",
        "body":"<p>As an IT professional, I&rsquo;ve been working with BlackBerry since its debut in black and white around the turn of the millennium. Once, BlackBerrys were the hottest property in my department, literally being worn out through overuse. Now? I&rsquo;m seeing devices being returned by staff that are still in &ldquo;as new&rdquo; condition.</p> <p>So what went wrong for the company formerly known as Research In Motion, or RIM? What has changed over the last decade to affect sales quite so dramatically? Here is my perspective.</p> <h2>Different times, different places</h2> <p>In the late 1990s, the world was a very different place. Most people didn't have a mobile phone. Those that did hardly knew how to send a text message. People used to buy contracts that gave them 15 or perhaps 30 minutes of free calls a month. No texts were included; crucially, neither was data. We paid through the nose for those \"free\" minutes, and they were precious. The massive profit on voice allowed the carriers to offer massive subsidies on handsets, like the \"free\" Nokias that everybody had back then.</p> <p>If you wanted email on the move, your only option was a laptop and a dialup modem, which you would plug into a landline&rsquo;s phone socket. Travelling sales reps would spend around half an hour each evening with their laptop plugged into a cable they had stolen from the hotel fax machine to avoid paying the ludicrous charges for using the phone in their hotel room. (Some things don&rsquo;t change.)</p> <p>There was no real money to be made in mobile data back then; it was too slow. A GSM adaptor in a laptop provided just 0.009 megabits per second in today&rsquo;s speeds. (9,600 bits per second, since you ask. Downloading a megabyte of data took about 25 minutes.</p> <p>Instead of data, all the telcos made their money from voice calls. A penny a minute for dial-up to the internet made millions for ISPs such as AOL and Freeserve. For mobile phone carriers, the core market was business users and their 100+ premium mobile minutes each month.</p> <p>Then RIM created BlackBerry. It allowed people to get their email on the move and, critically, it also acted as a phone. Business users climbed over each other to get to this new product, happily ditching their primitive Nokia devices in the process.</p> <h2>Serve one, serve all</h2> <p>Once IT had set up the BlackBerry server, the only cost to the business user might be an extra tenner on their department's phone bill each month. Oddly, in many employers, phones had traditionally been supplied by Facilities or HR - not IT. Blackberry, in contrast, was purely an IT solution, like a laptop. The phone bills for the BlackBerry handsets therefore often ended up in a different cost centre, one with a much higher budget.</p> <p>For IT managers the main attraction was that for this minimal charge, the BlackBerry devices also somehow came with global unlimited data. Imagine being in the early part of this century, when 3G had only just been auctioned off but not yet enabled (and certainly not put into use) and being the IT manager who realised that. Instead of supplying global freephone numbers to racks full of analogue modems, you could simply give the management team a BlackBerry device for &pound;40 per month. Better still, they didn&rsquo;t need a &pound;1500 IBM Thinkpad because these things had a keyboard..</p> <p>It was clearly a good harvest for BlackBerry. Suddenly RIM had this special, secure APN (Access Point Name - the gateway between the mobile network and the computer network) for which the carriers were prepared to pay a monthly fee on each connection. RIM didn't need to worry too much about handset profits; carriers would paying for those devices because they were desperate to get one of their SIMs into the BlackBerry of a global traveller.</p> <p>Why? Because if they succeeded, all of his or her &pound;1+ per minute voice call business was theirs. If you could give a &pound;600/mth Orange mobile phone user a &ldquo;free&rdquo; BlackBerry on Vodafone, all that voice business changed hands. For carriers, the &ldquo;unlimited data&rdquo; BlackBerry business was effectively a loss leader for voice, and they were making millions from it.</p> <h2>Money for nothing, text for (almost) free</h2> <p>Then the SMS (aka texting) business took off and the carriers realised that, at 10p per text, there was millions more to be made. People were carrying over \"free\" minutes from one month to the next, but they simply couldn't get enough inclusive texts. The kids spent all day, every day, texting their friends; but for an extra tenner a month to BlackBerry, they could send unlimited text messages over BBM. BlackBerry became trendy and all the younger generation wanted one; they even started selling them in bright colours to meet the market.</p> <p>RIM made its money through carriers who wanted to dominate the uncapped voice market. It made more money from those same carriers who then wanted a large chunk of the SMS market.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, though, and I think the real problem BlackBerry have is not the consumers, it's those same carriers.</p> <h2>Not carried</h2> <p>In the current age - from the time since the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; smartphone has become available - and for carriers, voice minutes are worth nothing; all the money is in data. Likewise, texts have no value - which renders the advantage of BBM worthless. Everybody wants to boost their data business, as it's used by hungry apps on iPhone and Android smartphones. Customers now have rich email, using more data. They watch video on the bus. All this therefore makes the carriers more money.</p> <p>Businesses didn&rsquo;t buy BlackBerry; they were sold them by the carriers as a solution. Likewise, consumers didn&rsquo;t buy BlackBerry; the networks recommended them to those who sent a lot of texts.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Blackberry, it has lost its unique selling point (USP). Without one, it&rsquo;s simply not going to be recommended by the sales representative at contract renewal time. The result - well, you can see for yourself.

        "headline":"Telefónica strikes up new tune with Napster streaming music deal",
        "body":"<p>Telefónica has become the latest telecoms company to strike a partnership with a streaming music service, choosing Napster over rivals like Spotify and Deezer as its supplier of choice.</p><p>Telefónica is taking an equity stake in Napster's parent company Rhapsody International, with the aim of bundling Napster into the mobile tariffs of its operators in Europe and Latin America.</p><p>The deal will also see Telefónica close its Terra subsidiary's Sonora music service in Latin America, and encourage customers to switch over to Napster when it launches in the region on 1 November.</p><p>The agreement between Telefónica and Rhapsody lays the groundwork for individual operators to start bundling Napster into their tariffs, but each subsidiary will be able to choose other music partners if it prefers.</p><p>In Spain, for example, Telefónica's Movistar operator already has a deal with Spotify, while in the UK, O2 runs its own O2 Tracks service in partnership with startup MusicQubed. Telefónica sees the Napster deal as important for its launch of 4G mobile networks around the world.</p><p>\"As we roll out more 4G networks in Europe and Latin America, it's these kinds of services we think our customers will be interested in,\" Stephen Shurrock, chief executive of new business ventures at Telefónica Digital, told The Guardian.</p><p>\"We looked at all of the options for music service partners. With Napster, we think the product is very strong, for Latin America they have the right focus for local content, and they have very good relationships with the labels that we can build on and help take forward.\"</p><p>Napster's launch of a HTML5-based app for smartphones running the Firefox OS software was also a factor in Telefónica's decision, with the telco looking to preload Napster on the Firefox OS devices it plans to launch in Brazil and other Latin American countries in the coming months.</p><p>The Napster deal follows recent Telefónica partnerships with web services Evernote and Pinterest, which Shurrock said was a sign of how the mobile market has changed in recent years.</p><p>\"What we want to do is bring value-added products to our service,\" he said. \"It's very unlike how it was 5-6 years ago with the big walled gardens. That's not our perspective now: we want to be very open and do partnerships.\"</p><p>The deal is good news for Rhapsody, one of the veterans of subscription music which has been overtaken in its homeland of the US by newer services like Spotify and Muve Music – the latter of which was launched by a mobile operator, Cricket Wireless.</p><p>With around 1m subscribers in the US, Rhapsody is focusing heavily on international expansion, having acquired Napster's European business in January 2012. In June 2013, it launched Napster in 14 new European countries.</p><p>Then in September <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/09/17/new-investment-for-rhapsody-but-also-layoffs-and-management-change/\">Rhapsody laid off 15% of its staff</a> in a restructure intended to \"accelerate its efforts in Europe and emerging markets\". Rhapsody reported revenues of $143.7m and a net loss of $12.3m in 2012.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420139779'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381925590948/napster.jpg' alt='Napster' width='460' height='201' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Napster's partnerships with telcos won't affect its direct-to-consumer business</figcaption></figure><p>\"We will always continue with our direct-to-consumer business: it's really important to have a strong brand and product position in the market in order to win these kinds of telco deals,\" Rhapsody's senior vice president for Europe, Thorsten Schliesche, told The Guardian.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have seen in previous deals with E-Plus in Germany and SFR in France that good, structured partnerships with mobile carriers can definitely help us to increase our business and gain the scale we would like.\"</p><p>Schliesche added that Telefónica's operators will be able to choose from several possible ways to offer Napster to their customers, including as a standalone \"bolt-on\" to their monthly contracts, or by bundling the cost into those contracts.</p><p>\"With E-Plus it's a complete bundle, which is very successful, but with SFR it's a bolt-on,\" he said. \"We have seen the adoption rate and willingness to use it really increase with the bundle option, but of course in certain markets – particularly those where streaming is already popular in the market – the bolt-on could be the solution.\"</p><p>Streaming music is emerging as one of the key selling points for 4G, alongside video. In the UK, Vodafone is offering new 4G customers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/07/vodafone-lures-4g-customers-music-football\">a choice of Spotify or Sky Sports Mobile</a> as part of their contracts, while EE has a partnership with rival service Deezer, building on that company's historically-close relationship with Orange.</p><p>Music industry research firm Midia Consulting recently published a report claiming that there are now <a href=\"http://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/new-report-building-the-new-business-case-for-bundled-music-services/\">nearly 50 telco music service partnerships worldwide</a>, suggesting that \"if a telco puts a music service front and centre and positions around it then success is far more likely\".</p><p>In Sweden, Spotify's partnership with operator Telia Sonera has made that service genuinely mainstream. Schliesche is hoping for similar growth for Napster from its Telefónica deal.</p><p>\"Music streaming is stepping out from its niche market into the mass market, and on its way to that mass market there will be great opportunities,\" he said, adding that while Spotify and Deezer may be the biggest streaming services globally, they can still be challenged. \"I don't think the market is done yet.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420139111|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|7d9cfdb0ca48c3b29d27be37269a0cb1d1493c4e -->",

        "headline":"Amazon set to launch HTC-built smartphone, reports say",
        "body":"<p>Amazon is working with HTC to produce a range of Android-powered smartphones according to a report.</p> <p>According to people familiar with the project <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8751175e-35ab-11e3-b539-00144feab7de.html\">talking to the FT</a>, Amazon and HTC have three devices on their product roadmap, with one likely to be released in 2014.</p> <p>Amazon has long been rumoured to be working on a smartphone to pair with its Kindle Fire range of Android tablets to compete with offerings from Google and Apple.</p> <h2>HTC risks expulsion from Google's OHA</h2> <p>If HTC has worked with with Amazon to produce a \"forked\" version of Google's Android operating system on the phones, then it could face expulsion from the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) - a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/22/google.mobilephones\">consortium of mobile phone makers</a> and networks whose stated purpose is to \"accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer, less expensive, and better mobile experience\".</p> <p>As part of the OHA, HTC gains free access to Google&rsquo;s Android software. It also means HTC can gain Google certification for its Android devices allowing them to come pre-loaded with access to Google Play and its 850,000 standard Android apps, as well as Google&rsquo;s Android app suite, which includes Chrome, Gmail, Calendar, Maps and Search.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amazon \"forked\" Android to produce the software powering its Kindle Fire tablets in 2012, so that they would access its own app store, not Google's. The Kindle Fire range uses Microsoft's Bing for its search engine, maps from Nokia, and its own Silk browser.&nbsp;</p> <p>Previous attempts by another OHA member, Acer, to produce a smartphone with a different variant of Android produced by China&rsquo;s Alibaba, resulted in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/19/android-china-alibaba-acer-strain\">clash with Google</a> which saw Acer abruptly pull out of its partnership with Alibaba.</p> <p>For HTC, which dipped to a heavy loss in the third quarter, the threat of being forced out of the OHA could be double-edged. It is losing ground in the Android space in the west to Samsung's larger marketing spend and phone range, and has set its sights on China - where Google's Android is used on only a tiny percentage of smartphone handsets, most of which run the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) without Google services.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Back to its roots</h2> <p>Founded in 1997 in Taiwan, HTC started life designing and manufacturing devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs based on Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Mobile operating system, for distribution by mobile phone operators like Orange in the UK as own-brand products.</p> <p>By partnering with Amazon and making smartphones to be sold under the Amazon brand, HTC would be returning to its roots after branching out with its own HTC-branded smartphones in 2009.</p> <p><strong>&bull; In October, HTC launched the latest in its One smartphone line and its first \"phablet\", the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/14/htc-one-max-phablet-fingerprint-android-smartphone\">5.9in HTC One Max</a>.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420109598|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|2858cfb782a3faaae62d6d9bfb27100be118c7cc -->",

        "headline":"Yes, Angry Birds Go! could knock Nintendo's Mario Kart off its perch",
        "body":"<p>Hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/18/angry-birds-star-wars-2-review-iphone-ipad-android\">Angry Birds Star Wars II</a>, Finnish firm Rovio has announced plans for its next game. <a href=\"http://go.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds Go!</a> breaks out of the bird-hurling formula though: it's a Mario Kart-style karting game.</p><p>It will be released on 11 December for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10 devices, making it Rovio's most ambitious cross-platform launch yet. Like Angry Birds Star Wars II, there'll be physical \"Telepods\" toys capable of being scanned in to the game, as well as a blitz of licensed products.</p><p>Angry Birds Go! will also be Rovio's first game \"built from the ground up as a free-to-play title\", with revenues coming entirely from in-app purchases and advertising. Neither is new to the Angry Birds series, but until now the games have only been free-to-play on Android.</p><p>Rovio originally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/12/angry-birds-go\">announced plans for Angry Birds Go! in June</a> with a teaser animation, but revealed full details at this week's Brand Licensing Europe conference in London, while publishing a gameplay trailer on YouTube:</p><p>So, Angry Birds Go! versus Mario Kart. Even talking about these two games in the same breath may see steam coming out of the ears of hardcore Nintendo fans. But here are a few reasons why it's not a ridiculous idea at all.</p><p>First, Mario Kart isn't available on the billion-ish Android and iOS devices that are currently out there in the wild, so there's no direct competition here. Rovio may be racing onto Nintendo's turf in terms of genre, but for devices, this is the Finnish firm's home territory.</p><p>Second, there's a generation of children growing up who've not played Mario Kart, don't own a DS or 3DS, but who a.) love Angry Birds and b.) have access to a smartphone or tablet to play games on. They're ripe for Rovio's brand to spread its wings into other genres.</p><p>Here's an interesting tag cloud from a recent survey by children's marketing firm SuperAwesome, which asked British children what present they'd most like to unwrap on Christmas morning:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132967'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381920524398/superawesome.jpg' alt='SuperAwesome word cloud' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is a big part of the potential audience for Angry Birds Go. Squint, and you'll spot Nintendo, Pokemon and other traditional gaming brands.</p><p>These kids don't come with preconceptions that Mario Kart is the yardstick by which all other karting games should be judged, and even if their Apple-dominated present requests turn out to be wishful thinking, they'll be able to play Rovio's next game on their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/23/tesco-hudl-tablet-computer-review\">Tesco Hudl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/kindle-fire\">Amazon Kindle Fire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/argos-mytablet-android-tablet-hudl-kindle-nexus-7\">Argos MyTablet</a> or whatever other device ends up in their stocking.</p><p>British telecoms regulator Ofcom's recent <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/october-2013/research07Oct2013.pdf\">Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes</a> report claimed that 42% of British 5-15 year-olds now use a tablet, and 23% of them play games on it. That's still less than the 60% of 5-15 year-olds using a dedicated handheld games device, but the latter percentage has fallen from 69% in 2012:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132968'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381921587595/ofcom-stats.jpg' alt='Ofcom stats' width='460' height='492' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ofcom's stats comparing devices that children use to play games at home</figcaption></figure><p>That's some context to the suggestion that Angry Birds Go! should be seen as a viable challenger to Mario Kart, particularly for younger gamers. Of course, the game itself will have to be excellent: the trailer makes it look good, but that's what trailers are designed to do.</p><p>One final point on the risks for Rovio, though. Angry Birds has fans of all ages, but a lot of them are children, which is why going fully free-to-play has to be handled carefully by the company.</p><p>You've been able to buy power-ups in Angry Birds games for a long time now, and they were more to the fore in Angry Birds Star Wars II than ever. But with regulators scrutinising children's apps' use of in-app purchases carefully, Angry Birds Go! has a challenge ahead.</p><p>To put it another way: no child ever spent £1,000 of parental cash on mushrooms in Mario Kart. Going free-to-play with a new genre is a big opportunity for Rovio, but it will be firmly in mind that the Angry Birds brand it created from scratch is trusted by parents around the world. Keeping that trust will be the company's priority.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420124806|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|593b3ae754cc1f6e845df892b6beeedc05fca28c -->",

        "headline":"Skylanders twinned with Isle of Skye",
        "body":"<p>Ah, the Isle of Skye, famed for its incredible natural beauty, it's huddled towns, it's looming castles – and now for its association with blockbusting video game franchise, Skylanders. In a bizarre yet no doubt canny joint marketing exercise, the jewel of the Inner Hebrides has been virtually twinned with Skylands, the fantasy setting of the Skylanders series, which has made over $1.5bn (£935m) in revenue for publisher Activision. The announcement marks the imminent release of the latest title, Skylanders: Swap Force.</p><p>\"The Isle of Skye is renowned for its stunning landscapes, which possess an almost ethereal quality, and its abundance of wildlife, making it the perfect place to virtually twin with Skylands, home to Skylanders Swap Force,\" said VisitScotland's Alan Mackenzie. </p><p>\"We're thrilled to be teaming up with the Skylanders franchise for this unique partnership, which will help raise the profile of this beautiful part of the world, encouraging families to enjoy a real-life adventure on the Isle of Skye – nowhere else on Earth comes close!\"</p><p>The Skylanders games pitch an array of fantastical creatures against the evil portal master Kaos, in a series of child-friendly adventures. The game is famed for its compatibility with a  range of action figures, which can be placed on a 'portal of power' (or 'plastic USB peripheral'), thereby transferring their digital likeness into the onscreen action. Wash Buckler, one of the new characters from the Swap Force game has apparently visited the island in a sort of diplomatic mission.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to welcome the Skylanders characters to the Highlands,\" said councillor Thomas Prag of the Highland council's planning environment and development committee. \"This is an unusual project, as we can't sign an actual deed of twinning due to the limitations getting paper work to the Skylands.\"</p><p>Anyway, it is certainly more amusing than the time the BBC One Show twinned itself with my home town of Frome. Plus, this story naturally got us thinking about other possible twinning endeavours between real and video game locations. This is the best we could come up with at short notice:</p><h2><strong>Four other possible twins between real and video game locations</strong></h2><p><strong>Oakvale, the Fable series</strong><br />A quaint seaside town in the fictitious land of Albion, famed as the birthplace of the game's lead protagonist.<br /><strong>Oak Vale, Mississippi</strong><br />A quaint inland town in the south of the state, between Lawrence and Jefferson Davis counties, famed for … well, it has quite a nice <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oak-Vale-MS/164884613592205\">historical FaceBook page</a>.

The 9.7in iPad is expected to get a thinner body and bezels, to match the design of the iPad mini. It is also expected to run Apple's new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/iphone-5s-apple-a7-chip-64-bit-explained\">64-bit A7 chip</a>, and could include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/10/iphone-5s-fingertip-scanner\">Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor</a>&nbsp;introduced in the iPhone 5S in September.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/23/ipad-mini-apple-tablet-google-amazon\">iPad mini</a> is also expected to be updated with a higher-resolution display - although there are mixed reports about whether it will move to a \"retina\" display.</p> <p>Even before the sale date had formally been announced, the retailer John Lewis forecast last Wednesday that the iPad mini will be its best-selling technology device this Christmas.

        "body":"<p>Lavabit, the encrypted email service once used by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, is open for business once more &ndash; at least until Thursday.</p> <p>Ladar Levison, Lavabit&rsquo;s founder, shuttered the service after the FBI demanded he hand over encryption keys that would potentially have given US authorities access to all his customers&rsquo; data.</p> <p>Levison said in a statement Monday night that he was <a href=\"https://liberty.lavabit.com/\">temporarily reinstating</a> the service for 72 hours in order to give customers time to access their information. The move became possible after Levison obtained a new secure SSL key for Lavabit to authenticate his server and encrypt data traveling to and from the site.</p> <p>\"For those who used Lavabit's email service, they were left without a way to access information after the shutdown,\" <a href=\"https://rally.org/lavabit#post_gRdzf0nzD6E\">the statement read</a>. When asked about how his users felt about the loss of personal data, Levison said: \"I'm in the same boat as them. I used my Lavabit email account for 10 years. It was my only email account.'\"</p> <p>The tech entrepreneur is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/edward-snowdens-lavabit-appeals-government-intrusion\">currently tied up</a> in a legal battle with the US authorities over the closure of his service. In court documents filed last week, Levison&rsquo;s lawyers claimed the US authorities&rsquo; demands for the encryption keys to his service had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/fbi-demands-lavabit-violated-fourth-amendment-levison\">breached the fourth amendment</a> of the US constitution, which protects citizens from unfair searches.</p> <p>Levison closed Lavabit in August, signing off with a note that said he had &ldquo;been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit.&rdquo;</p> <p>The service had over 400,000 users at the time of its closure. Court records show that Lavabit had become the target of FBI scrutiny before Snowden sent an email from his Lavabit account inviting media to a press conference in Moscow on 12 July after his flight from Hong Kong.</p> <p>Levison&rsquo;s legal fight has won support from figures including Ron Paul, the former congressman and presidential candidate. A <a href=\"https://rally.org/lavabit\">legal fund</a> has been set up to meet the costs of his case and has so far raised over $93,000.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420059717|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|1ea2e85b414c6f0b21a4d0b100472407039cfbba -->",

        "headline":"Angela Ahrendts leaves Burberry for new job at Apple",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive who led British brand Burberry's transformation into a sexy modern fashion  label, is swapping trenchcoats for a rather different range of macs.</p><p>Ahrendts, who was the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100 last year with a pay package of almost £17m, has been poached by Apple, the world's most valuable company. She is expected to double her income when she becomes the boss of the iPad maker's global retail division next summer.</p><p>Half a billion pounds was wiped off Burberry's stockmarket value as her departure, and the appointment of Burberry's designer Christopher Bailey as her replacement, was announced.</p><p>Yorkshire-born Bailey and Ahrendts, a US fashion executive from Indiana, have worked closely together since her arrival in 2006, with the designer contributing ideas to many aspects of the business. The Royal College of Art graduate is credited with the social media strategy under which Burberry became the first big fashion house to stream catwalk shows live on the internet, but it is almost unknown for a design specialist to lead a company of Burberry's size.</p><p>Ahrendts is moving to a demanding job as Apple's status as the world's most profitable computer and smartphone maker is under pressure from rivals such as Samsung. But earlier this week Apple was named the world's most valuable brand, toppling Coca-Cola, and the stores she will oversee have higher sales per square foot than any other retailer in the world.</p><p>The last person to run Apple's retail empire was also hired from the UK. Former Dixons boss John Browett, was lured to the group's head office in Cupertino, California and handed a \"golden hello\" reported to be worth $56m (£35m). However, Browett never collected the full cash pile as he was fired after less than six months in the role in October last year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420105261'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381857371581/Burberry-share-price-001.jpg' alt='Burberry share price' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Burberry’s share price before and after Angela Ahrendts resigned. Photograph: theguardian.com</figcaption></figure><p>Ahrendts will be well cushioned from any such risk in her new job by a stockpile of cash and shares gathered at Burberry. She currently owns shares worth £6.2m and will receive another tranche worth £7.34m  next month. Meanwhile, Ahrendts is working beyond her six-month notice period, which would end in April, enabling her to collect a bonus worth up to double her £1.1m salary as well as shares worth £6m due to be handed over in June. Including her basic pay that will take her total pay-out over the next six months to nearly £16m.</p><p>Ahrendts said: \"I'm proud of everything we've built, and the management team we have in place around the world and infrastructure we have put in place will provide a rock solid foundation for all [Bailey's] innovation.\"</p><p>Bailey said: \"We've done a lot of dreaming and made those dreams into solid strategies and built an incredible operational and management team to be able to meet those strategies.\"</p><p>Burberry shares slumped nearly 8% as investors worried that Bailey would struggle to run a £7bn company as well as heading the design operation. There were suggestions that Bailey had been handed the top job to stop him following Ahrendts out of the door.</p><p>Burberry insisted Bailey's appointment was the result of a long-term succession plan, but analysts and investors were sceptical. Rahul Sharma, a luxury goods analyst at Neev Capital said Burberry had little choice but to choose Bailey as Ahrendts most likely successor after former finance director Stacey Cartwright left earlier this year. \"I think Angela's move was a surprise to them. I would question whether they had any plan in place,\" she said.</p><p>While Ahrendts said Bailey, the Royal College of Art graduate who has been Burberry's creative visionary for 12 years, would be backed by \"the industry's most powerful management team,\" all the leading players are new. Finance director Carol Fairweather only stepped into the role in July this year while chief operating officer John Smith joined in March. While the company reported strong sales figures on Tuesday, it is still struggling to absorb the fragrance and beauty business it brought in house this spring and next year must tackle the handover of its key Japanese business from a long-term franchise partner.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive of Apple, said he was thrilled that Ahrendts would be joining his team. \"She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record,\" he said.</p><p>Cook is banking on Ahrendts' experience building a global network of stores to build Apple's position as a global luxury brand, particularly in China where Burberry has grown rapidly while the tech company has struggled. Apple's store portfolio remains relatively small and in some areas is straining to cope with the demands of millions of new iPad and iPhone owners.Cook is clearly keen to build Apple's style credentials. Ahrendts joins Paul Deneve, the former chief executive officer of Yves St Laurent, who was recently hired by the iPhone maker to work on special projects.</p><p>The departure of Ahrendts will deplete the already-slim ranks of female chief executives at the UK's biggest companies. Her return to the US means there will be just two women running FTSE 100 businesses – Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Easyjet.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419980276|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|f2d28c6cc5b948c5d6e0af432db62dc7e78e6ee7 -->",

We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some may find that they have already opted out of the policy change.

        "headline":"Silk Road’s alleged mastermind ‘not excessively concerned’ about future",
        "body":"<p>Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old San Francisco man&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">accused of running the world's biggest online drug marketplace,</a> Silk Road, said he is \"not excessively\" concerned about the future in an interview given from Alameda County jail on Monday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/jail-visit-the-alleged-dread-pirate-roberts\">Speaking to Lauren Smiley of San Francisco Magazine</a>, Ulbricht &ndash; inmate ULW981 &ndash; revealed that his arrest two weeks ago was the first of his life.</p> <p>He is now alone for at least 20 hours a day, and has little contact with the outside world, barring a one-hour phone call with the family members and friends.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ulbricht would not comment on his guilt or innocence &ndash; though in court he denied that he used the pseudonym&nbsp;Dread Pirate Roberts - which was used by the operator of Silk Road -&nbsp;and agreed to be extradited to New York City to face charges.</p> <p>Silk Road was a website on the \"dark web\" which could only be accessed via the anonymisation service Tor. Launched in February 2011, it became the hub for a substantial amount of legal and illegal dealing in goods and services, all of which had to be paid for using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/silk-road-underground-market-closed-bitcoin\">The FBI seized the site on 2 Octobe</a>r, and arrested Ulbricht, who has been charged with money laundering, drug trafficking, facilitating computer hacking, and soliciting murder. The FBI also seized more than 28,000 Bitcoins with a value of around $3.6m. A number of other arrests have followed in other countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Of course &ndash; do I need to even ask? &ndash; he isn&rsquo;t permitted internet access,\" adds Smiley, who wasn't allowed to take a pen, paper or recording device in to her interview with the accused.&nbsp;That meant Ulbricht hadn't heard that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2013/10/09/living-with-ross-ulbricht-housemates-say-they-saw-no-clues-of-silk-road-or-the-dread-pirate-roberts/\">his former flat-mates had been interviewed</a>. \"He repeats the statement back to me as a question, unbelieving,\" said Smiley.</p> <p>Ulbricht wouldn't answer any queries about his case, refusing to comment on whether he would be posting bail, or even who had been visiting him in jail.He had been advised by his attorney not to talk to the press at all, but wanted \"to see what it would be like\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve been arrested,&rdquo; Ulbricht volunteers. Really, I ask, no DUIs [driving under the influence, ie while drunk], no college high jinks? &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; He tells me very matter of factly that he spends 20 to 22 hours a day in his cell alone, with just a window in the door to the pod, and a blurred one to the outdoors. He gets let out for showers or to go out to the yard accompanied by guards, but not with other inmates. He can hear other prisoners talking through the walls, but rarely adds anything. His daily interactions: a few comments with guards, one hour of phone time a day to family members and friends who&rsquo;ve registered to receive his calls. He eats in his cell &ndash; the food&rsquo;s not half bad, he says. The other inmates in his pod know who he is from watching the TV news, but Ulbricht has no view of the TV from his cell.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Ulbricht has been in jail, a second major arrest related to Silk Road has been made in Washington state, where police believe they have found one of the biggest dealers on the site.</p> <h2>&lsquo;Really tasty looking methamphetamine&rsquo;</h2> <p>According to the criminal complaint, the dealer went by the pseudonym Nod and allegedly sold more than 2.5kg of cocaine on the site in the last four months, as well as almost 600g of heroin and 100g of methamphetamine. They were in the top 1% of dealers on the site.</p> <p>But despite the timing of the arrests, <a href=\"http://cryptome.org/2013/10/sadler-white-complaint.pdf\">the criminal complaint</a> suggests that Nod was tracked down through old-fashioned detective work, and not with information gleaned from the Silk Road seizure.</p> <p>Christopher Armstrong, a special agent with the department of homeland security, revealed that the trail was picked up during an interdiction targeting drug trafficking. A package sent from an address in Lynnwood, Washington, was intercepted in September 2012. The named sender didn&rsquo;t exist, but the resident at that address gave permission for the package to be opened, and it contained heroin.</p> <p>Over the next four days, more packages were intercepted, with the same packing style but all apparently sent from different addresses, with different non-existent people listed as the sender. More heroin was found, as was a package of cash worth $3,200 (&pound;2,000).</p> <p>From there, the trail was followed back to the UPS store which had sent the $3,200, and to a safe deposit box rented in the name of Aaron Thompson.</p> <p>Looking for further similar packages revealed yet more fake names and other post offices which had been used. Eventually, in March 2013, Armstrong claimed their surveillance linked those packages to a Jenna White.</p> <p>White was driving a car registered to Steven Sadler, who was identified by post office employees as having been the man who took rented safe deposit boxes.</p> <p>The link to Silk Road came when the police received a search warrant to open a package which again had been packed in a similar manner to the September 2012 parcels. It was found to contain heroin and cocaine, and the intended recipient agreed to co-operate, saying that the parcel had been ordered from a Silk Road dealer called Nod.</p> <p>Further investigation apparently strengthened the link between Nod and Sadler.</p> <p>Despite the detail of the criminal complaint, it may not be descriptive of how the investigation was carried out. Such affidavits don&rsquo;t have to describe how investigations actually proceeded, but only how they could have made the link between the accused and the crimes.</p> <p>As a result, there remains the possibility that the actual discovery was made with the help of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/08/silk-road-hack-suspicion-fbi-server\">information gleaned from the Silk Road&rsquo;s servers</a>.</p> <p>The user reviews for Nod on Silk Road reveal them to be a popular and well-respected dealer. Someone who bought 2g of cocaine said it was a &ldquo;1980s Time Machine&rdquo;, while a user who purchased 3.5g of methamphetamine said it was &ldquo;really tasty looking methamphetamine&rdquo;.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-heroin-arrest-nod/\">the Daily Dot&rsquo;s Patrick Howell O&rsquo;Neill reports</a>, Nod had such a reputation for quality before the Silk Road closed that he or she was able to charge a huge markup on the drugs they dealt.</p> <p>&ldquo;In private conversations later leaked by other vendors, Nod claimed he was making $20,000 per month on his cocaine alone,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill reported.</p> <p>&ldquo;He bragged about his profit margin increasing to the point where he was making three times as much as contemporary heroin dealers on Silk Road.&rdquo;</p> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested\">When Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder of the Silk Road, was arrested, the criminal complaint revealed a litany of errors, including asking for coding advice under his real name.</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419942787|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|5a66f2ab67f9bc9b191204adea692468fec3945e -->",

        "headline":"Skylanders twinned with Isle of Skye",
        "body":"<p>Ah, the Isle of Skye, famed for its incredible natural beauty, it's huddled towns, it's looming castles – and now for its association with blockbusting video game franchise, Skylanders. In a bizarre yet no doubt canny joint marketing exercise, the jewel of the Inner Hebrides has been virtually twinned with Skylands, the fantasy setting of the Skylanders series, which has made over $1.5bn (£935m) in revenue for publisher Activision. The announcement marks the imminent release of the latest title, Skylanders: Swap Force.</p><p>\"The Isle of Skye is renowned for its stunning landscapes, which possess an almost ethereal quality, and its abundance of wildlife, making it the perfect place to virtually twin with Skylands, home to Skylanders Swap Force,\" said VisitScotland's Alan Mackenzie. </p><p>\"We're thrilled to be teaming up with the Skylanders franchise for this unique partnership, which will help raise the profile of this beautiful part of the world, encouraging families to enjoy a real-life adventure on the Isle of Skye – nowhere else on Earth comes close!\"</p><p>The Skylanders games pitch an array of fantastical creatures against the evil portal master Kaos, in a series of child-friendly adventures. The game is famed for its compatibility with a  range of action figures, which can be placed on a 'portal of power' (or 'plastic USB peripheral'), thereby transferring their digital likeness into the onscreen action. Wash Buckler, one of the new characters from the Swap Force game has apparently visited the island in a sort of diplomatic mission.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to welcome the Skylanders characters to the Highlands,\" said councillor Thomas Prag of the Highland council's planning environment and development committee. \"This is an unusual project, as we can't sign an actual deed of twinning due to the limitations getting paper work to the Skylands.\"</p><p>Anyway, it is certainly more amusing than the time the BBC One Show twinned itself with my home town of Frome. Plus, this story naturally got us thinking about other possible twinning endeavours between real and video game locations. This is the best we could come up with at short notice:</p><h2><strong>Four other possible twins between real and video game locations</strong></h2><p><strong>Oakvale, the Fable series</strong><br />A quaint seaside town in the fictitious land of Albion, famed as the birthplace of the game's lead protagonist.<br /><strong>Oak Vale, Mississippi</strong><br />A quaint inland town in the south of the state, between Lawrence and Jefferson Davis counties, famed for … well, it has quite a nice <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oak-Vale-MS/164884613592205\">historical FaceBook page</a>.

We know that tablets will feature heavily on Christmas lists this year,” said John Walden, Argos managing director.</p> <h2><strong>Nearly 230m tablets expected to be sold in 2013</strong></h2> <p>According to data provided by research firm IDC, tablet devices are set to overtake PC sales this year, growing to 229.3m units worldwide, while 8.3m tablets were sold in the UK in 2012 according to CCS Insight, with more than half of sales coming in the last quarter of the year alone. Argos sold 1m tablets in the UK in 2012.</p> <p>Argos says the MyTablet will fit within its existing tablet portfolio, covering the low-end “gifting space” while the company continues to offer higher-end tablets and devices.</p> <p>The MyTablet has a standard-definition 1,024 x 600 7in screen, runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean powered by a 1.6GHz dual-core processor with 8GB of storage plus a microSD slot and a five-hour battery life.</p> <p>A front-facing VGA camera enables video chat and a two-megapixel camera on the back will capture photos and video. A micro USB port provides PC connectivity and charging, while HDMI will connect the MyTablet to a television.</p> <p>“Make no mistake, this is no iPad – you are getting a low-cost tablet, which does a job, but there are trade offs when you get down to this kind of price,” said Ben Wood, mobile analyst with research firm CCS Insight.</p> <p>“Argos has built the MyTablet to a price. It has hit that psychologically important price point of &pound;99, and selected a specification specifically to do that, which is the contrast with Tesco’s approach with its &pound;119 Hudl.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b472df94-f00a-438b-8430-7441724a466f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381751327146/9027715c-5685-4b05-9869-33228aca947a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Argos MyTablet is a budget 7in own-brand Android tablet that's available in silver or pink.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Argos MyTablet is a budget 7in own-brand Android tablet that is available in silver or pink.</figcaption> </figure> <p>However, it is not all about price when it comes to buying and using a tablet computer, and not all tablets are created equally warned Wood: “You can be seduced by the price, but be very careful what you’re getting.</p> <p>“The small tablet space is turning into a homogenous category, and at the low end you risk having a relatively mediocre experience compared to the original benchmarks set by Apple’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad\">iPad</a>.”</p> <h2><strong>Smack-bang in the middle of the gifting space</strong></h2> <p>“The MyTablet is now almost at a price where you don’t have to think twice before buying it, and fits smack-bang in the middle of the gifting space, something Argos specifically chases, which is what fuelled the explosive growth of tablets last Christmas,&quot; said Wood.</p> <p>Budget tablet sales have been boosted by the demand for screens from children, says Wood, as parents use them as both education and entertainment tools.</p> <p>“The tablet has almost become the lazy childcare tool. It’s a kid pacifier – just pass the tablet into the back of the car to keep the children happy.”</p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/tesco-hudl-tablet-android-review\">Tesco’s Hudl tablet</a>&nbsp;is aimed at people who wouldn’t ordinarily think of buying a tablet computer but offers a lot of Android for your money.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419903583|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b9fb150391b64ebb214c495ec2cd48a368d5dcd3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Canada's BlackBerry has <a href=\"http://us.blackberry.com/message.html\">published an open letter online</a> and in major publications around the world to try to to reassure customers that they can count on the distressed smartphone company.</p> <p>The letter was <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BlackBerry/status/389851258112475136\">released Monday on Twitter</a> and will be published in 30 publications in nine countries on Tuesday. It acknowledges &quot;these are no doubt challenging times for us and we don't underestimate the situation&quot; but says &quot;you can continue to count on BlackBerry.&quot;</p> <p>The missive notes that BlackBerry has &quot;substantial cash on hand&quot; and is debt free. But it makes no mention of the fact that the company is for sale and could be broken up and sold in pieces – a prospect that analysts think looks increasingly likely as the 4 November deadline for a formal bid approaches.</p> <p>BlackBerry announced last month that Fairfax Financial Holdings, which owns 10% of the company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/sep/23/9-a-share-offer-blackberry-too-late-make-difference\">signed a letter of intent</a> that &quot;contemplates&quot; buying BlackBerry for $9 a share, or $4.7bn (&pound;2.9bn). Fairfax, BlackBerry's largest shareholder, is trying to attract other investors. Meanwhile, former founder and co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/10/blackberry-cofounders-consider-bid-company\">announced</a> his intention to try to buy the company, while the private equity company Cerberus is also said to have expressed interest.</p> <h2>Count on us</h2> <p>&quot;You can continue to count on BlackBerry&quot;, says the letter on the site, which is signed &quot;The BlackBerry Team&quot;. It continues: &quot;These are no doubt challenging times for us and we don’t underestimate the situation or ignore the challenges we are facing. We are making the difficult changes necessary to strengthen BlackBerry.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;One thing we will never change is our commitment to those of you who helped build BlackBerry into the most trusted tool for the world’s business professional.&quot; It notes that it has users among governments and corporations &quot;that simply cannot compromise on security&quot; and which choose BlackBerry.</p> <h2>Analysts doubtful</h2> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/statuses/390041663936413696\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Blackberry will go to its grave in denial.</p>— Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/statuses/390041663936413696\">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>Analysts were scathing, however. &quot;BlackBerry will go to its grave in denial,&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/390041663936413696\">said</a>&nbsp;Benedict Evans of Enders Analysis.

BlackBerry Ltd.'s US-traded shares closed up 7&cent; to $8.14 Monday. At the end of September, it announced that it had had to write off $934m on unsold Z10 handsets – the touchscreen device it launched in January to spearhead its attempt at a comeback.</p> <p>Instead, the BB10 devices have sold slowly, selling a few million in total rather than the &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; that chief executive Thorsten Heins had hoped to see for the keyboard-based Q10 device alone.</p> <p>The company now says it intends to focus on core markets. &quot;Yes, there is a lot of competition out there and we know that BlackBerry is not for everyone. That’s OK,&quot; it says in the open letter.</p> <h2>Incompatibility problem</h2> <p>But the problem for BlackBerry is that users are not upgrading from the older BB7 handsets to the newer BB10 ones. Consumers seem to be jumping ship to iPhones or Android phones, while a number of businesses have held back from upgrading because the BB10 phones cannot be used with the older BB7 server software used to encrypt and send email to corporate customers – but the newer BB10 servers which are compatible with the BB10 handsets do not work with the older BB7 handsets.</p> <p>That has led businesses either to stockpile BB7 handsets, or abandon the platform altogether.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-14/blackberry-seeks-to-reassure-customers-by-running-newspaper-ads.html\">Bloomberg reports</a>&nbsp;that Credit Suisse AG has decided not to upgrade to BB10, and that some of the world's biggest banks which use BlackBerrys are holding off on upgrades, including Morgan Stanley and UBS.</p> <p>And one key supplier, Jabil, suggested last month that it might call time on building parts for the company, which could sound the death knell for its handset business.</p> <p>&quot;We're getting a lot of queries and interest from loyal consumers, from all of our enterprise customers and big government institutions,&quot; Andrew MacLeod, BlackBerry's regional managing director for North America, said in an interview with Associated Press. MacLeod said it's important to communicate with customers while the company goes through a difficult restructuring. He declined to comment on the sale process because a special committee of board members is examining that.</p> <p>The BlackBerry, introduced in 1999, was once the dominant smartphone for on-the-go business people and other consumers. But the advent of a new generation of competing touchscreen smartphones, starting with Apple's iPhone in 2007, made the BlackBerry look ancient. The company's sales and market share shrank and it lost billions in market value.</p> <p>This year's much-delayed launch of BlackBerry 10 system and fancier devices that use the software was supposed to rejuvenate the brand and lure customers. It did not work. The Ontario-based company recently announced 4,500 layoffs, or 40% of its global workforce, and reported a quarterly loss of nearly $1bn.</p> <p>&quot;Candidly, we haven't seen the level of the traction in certain markets that we had hoped,&quot; MacLeod said. &quot;It takes time for new platforms to get traction and we think we need to give BlackBerry 10 more time in the marketplace in order to get to the level of volume that we had hoped.&quot;</p> <p>The letter says BlackBerry continues &quot;to offer the best mobile typing experience no ifs, ands or buts about it.&quot;&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419975737|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b17b02a0b16a7e7015a3e60d50fb32ac7226f587 -->",

        "headline":"Ada Lovelace Day 2013: from nerd cabaret to womenifying Wikipedia",
        "body":"<p>When she was teenager, Dr Helen Scales was obsessed by the environment, but when she learned to scuba dive, her &ldquo;vision turned from green to blue&rdquo;, as she says in a new book.</p> <p>\"Suddenly all I could think about was being in the sea and swimming with fishes,\" Scales writes in A Passion for Science: Stories of Discovery and Invention, an anthology that explores the lives of some of our greatest scientists as part of Ada Lovelace Day.</p> <p>Scuba diving wasn't the only thing that inspired Scales to pursue a career in marine biology. At around the same time, she read two books by Dr Eugenie Clark, known in marine biology circles as <a href=\"http://www.sharklady.com/\">the Shark Lady</a>. &ldquo;I became totally wrapped up in stories of her adventures as she roamed the oceans in search of fish and I saw no reason why I couldn&rsquo;t follow in her footsteps,&rdquo; says Scales.</p> <p>And follow in her footsteps Scales did, not only by pursuing a career in marine biology, but also by following the Shark Lady's lead in becoming a writer, contributing to National Geographic, Geographical, the Globe &amp; Mail and the Guardian.</p> <p>After carving her own career as an ichthyologist, Scales finally got the chance to meet her heroine at Florida&rsquo;s Mote Marine Laboratory, where Clark was a founding director. Clark was just coming up to her ninetieth birthday and, although she has retired from teaching, she is not only still active in her research, she also still scuba dives.</p> <h2>Maths demands 'tension of mind beyond a woman's strength'</h2> <p><a href=\"http://findingada.com/book/eugenie-clark-meeting-the-shark-lady/\">Eugenie Clark&rsquo;s story</a> is just one of hundreds of stories about the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths that have been shared as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ada-lovelace\">Ada Lovelace</a> Day. When I started the day five years ago, my goal was to collect these stories not only to inspire girls to study the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/maths-teacher-add-up-recruits\">STEM</a> subjects, but also to provide support to women pursuing careers in these usually male-dominated fields.</p> <p>Ada Lovelace is the ideal figurehead for this project: She was the world's first computer programmer, and the first person to realise that a general purpose computing machine such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/charles-babbage-analytical-engine-victorian-computer\">Charles Babbage&rsquo;s Analytical Engine</a> could do more than just calculate large tables of numbers. It could, she said, create music and art, given the right inputs. The Analytical Engine, she wrote, &ldquo;weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves\".</p> <p>This daughter of &ldquo;mad, bad and dangerous to know&rdquo; Lord Byron achieved this distinction despite the fierce prejudices of the 19th Century. Her tutor Augustus De Morgan echoed the accepted view of the time when he said that maths problems presented &ldquo;a very great tension of mind beyond the strength of a woman&rsquo;s physical power&rdquo;.</p> <p>But Ada persevered in her studies, and De Morgan recognised her brilliance when he said that had she been a man, she would have had the potential to become &ldquo;an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence&rdquo;.</p> <h2>From nerd cabaret to Wikipedia edit-a-thons</h2> <p>Ada Lovelace Day is not only about raising Ada&rsquo;s profile, but also shining a spotlight on the achievements of all women in STEM, both historic and modern. It&rsquo;s about drawing inspiration from all women, not just the famous ones, and supporting women at every stage of their career, from the choice of what to study at school and university through to often challenging professional milestones.</p> <p>Our flagship event, Ada Lovelace Day Live! - a nerd cabaret featuring talks, science demonstrations, comedy and song - is a cross-discipline celebration of women in STEM, and will be <a href=\"https://ald13.eventbrite.co.uk/\">held at Imperial College London from 6pm</a>, 15 October. Performers include science communicator and demo designer <a href=\"http://www.franscott.moonfruit.com/\">Fran Scott</a>, bioengineer <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.stevens\">Professor Molly Stevens</a>, <a href=\"http://chionwurahmp.com/\">Chi Onwurah</a> MP, Shadow Cabinet Office Minister with responsibility for cybersecurity, and technologist and comedy writer <a href=\"http://finalbullet.com/\">Leila Johnston</a>, amongst others.</p> <p>There will also be <a href=\"http://findingada.com/events-2013/worldwide-events-2013/\">40 independently organised grassroots events across Europe, North and South America</a>, including several Wikipedia edit-a-thons that aim to increase the number of articles in the online encyclopaedia about women in STEM. There are also many other events, including talks, pub meet-ups, conferences and exhibitions covering the work of a plethora of women, from paleontologists to musicians to artists and sewing machine pioneers.</p> <h2>Take part, and share your stories of inspiring women</h2> <p>At its core, Ada Lovelace Day is about sharing stories about the women who have inspired you to dream big and pursue your goals, despite the obstacles in your way.

        "headline":"The horror of sequels – the Chinese Room on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs",
        "body":"<p>Horror game Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs has had some PR trouble. It's the sort of trouble that often hits the sequel to a beloved title, in this case Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That game was popular for its jump-scare qualities, its ability to frighten in small intense doses, to elicit squeals from players and the makers of online Let's Play videos. So when Frictional asked Brighton-based developer the Chinese Room to come onboard to make the sequel to the original, the team knew they had to make something different – and yet somehow similar to its predecessor. It was an interesting problem.</p><p></p><p>And the Chinese Room is an interesting studio. Founded by Dan Pinchbeck and Jessica Curry in 2010, it is famous for its experimental first-person exploration game Dear Esther, a critically polarising adventure that detractors famously wanted to label 'not a game'. Though it was meant to be an experiment in fragmentary, restrained philosophical storytelling through beautiful environments, some self-proclaimed gamers saw it as a direct attack on the first-person shooter genre, unworthy of existence alongside the unchallenged might of their favourite action games. And yet Pinchbeck, the lead designer and writer of the game, was at that time doing his doctorate on first-person shooters primarily because he adores the genre.</p><p></p><h2>Divide and rule<br /></h2><p>Released earlier this year on PC and Mac, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs has been no less divisive, especially among fans of the original Amnesia title – particularly because the sequel departs from the idea of jump scares and shock, and goes for a nihilistic, languishing, pervasive horror, the sort that stains your memory and has you lie awake at night, long after the game has been turned off. It's really a matter of how the developers interpreted the genre.</p><p></p><p>\"We wanted to make a horror game,\" Pinchbeck explains. \"There was a distinction in our mind between making a horror game and making a game with jump scares in it. They're not the same. And we really shared that in the early conversations with Frictional as well - they were really anti-jump scares. That's not horror - that's just jump scares. So making a game that would get under people's skin in quite a deep level … What's interesting is a game that scares you while you are playing it, and what's really interesting is a game that scares you after you've finished playing it.\"</p><p></p><p>This new kind of horror hasn't leant itself to the YouTubers who flourished on the drama of publishing video of The Dark Descent's jump scares. \"And that's what's really interesting about all the emails I've been getting,\" says co-director Curry, responsible for the unsettling soundtrack. \"[There were emails from people saying] 'I've finished it and found it wasn't like the original Amnesia, I felt quite ambivalent about it, quite hostile about it,' and they've written back about three, four, five days later and gone, 'Oh god, that still really … That still really got under my skin.' And that's really interesting to me to have people write twice. Either, 'I loved it,' or 'it's shit', in your emails, in your in tray, but to have so many people come back and say: 'Oh, it's got a really … insidious crawl to it.'\"</p><p></p><p>The developers' deep intelligence about how stories can manipulate the mind shows very much in their work. A Machine for Pigs provides a lasting imprint on players that somehow is more psychologically manipulative. This is not surprising to me as  Curry and Pinchbeck seem sharply intellectual, and interested in the latent power of narrative to create loathing, fear, dread. The nuances of the soundtrack were carefully thought out to unsettle the player, to toy with their nerves.</p><p></p><p>\"Sam Justice did an amazing job with the sound design,\" Curry says. \"With music as well – I really wanted to make the sound of the machine, and that kind of feeling – that grating sound … Uneasy, and just kind of gets under your skin. I love the Klute soundtrack, which I haven't watched in ages and really made an impression on me. It has these weird sounds that you can't quite place, this weird grinding.\"</p><p></p><p>\"It's also got to be beautiful, really really beautiful,\" Pinchbeck elaborates. \"You've got this point where you're going through and it's shredding your nerves, and then suddenly it erupts … and you know you've got nowhere to go if you've taken the player up and up and up … you just drop it and make something that's absolutely still and sad and beautiful. So the player is left going 'I don't know where emotionally to go, I've got this big bag of tension, I've got this hateful horrible environment, and suddenly, I'm feeling sympathy. What the fuck do I do with sympathy at this point?' And that's kind of an emotionally unsettling thing.\"</p><p></p><h2>Genre constraints<br /></h2><p>But expectation really changed the way that people viewed and played A Machine for Pigs. Of course people were eager to embrace the brand 'Amnesia' that is imprinted on the Chinese Room's game, which marketers often think is an asset, but the comparison can often be damaging for people who are interested in making original work. They wrestled with the genre constraints, the interpretation that people had of the last game, and defining their own idea of horror.</p><p></p><p>According to Curry, \"So many people said, if you had taken one word out - Amnesia - you'd have been getting nines and 10s from reviews. And basically every review starts off: 'it's not as scary as the original'. It wasn't trying to beat the scariest story ever told. It wasn't what Frictional were interested in us doing.\"</p><p></p><p>\"I think it's really interesting who the camps are that it's polarised,\" Pinchbeck muses. \"I think it's becoming increasingly clearly delineated what those two camps are. People that might think that Amnesia's about Let's Plays and jump scares absolutely hate it; people who think that it's about the kind of art that Frictional started with Penumbra and followed through to Amnesia love it. If there's a choice between those two camps, I'm happy to sit with the game fans as opposed to the Let's Play fans. Because if we had wanted to make something that's incredibly Let's Play friendly, then we wouldn't have made the game that we made, because we would have made fairly bland corridors, and a shit ton of jump scares.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Just before the game went live,\" Dan continues, \"We got an email from Thomas Grip [of Frictional Games]. 'What you've got to remember, if you get flak, is that you are being compared to a game that never existed. And there were these problems and these problems and we were proud of this … But you will get compared to the memory of a game that's three years old. And that's impossible. You will never measure up to that. If things don't go brilliantly, just remember that.' Which is a really nice email to send. We've been watching the Frictional forums, with people going 'It should have done this like Dark Descent did it', and then people write back and then go, 'Dark Descent didn't do that. And actually there is stuff in there going 'and it was just this and it was just this' …There almost were two Dark Descents.\"</p><p></p><p>I say I was terrified of the Dark Descent. I played 10 minutes of it and then shut myself in an in-game cupboard. I made friends with a broom for a while before quitting.</p><p></p><p>Curry laughs. \"It was a great game,\" she nods, giggling.</p><p></p><h2>Upwards trajectory<br /></h2><p>\"The problem we had with the Dark Descent is that you couldn't do the things that Dark Descent did,\" Pinchbeck says. \"Like hiding in a cupboard is amazing, you couldn't hide in a cupboard in A Machine for Pigs … So you're in this really awful situation where you have to make the same game again, but if we made the same game again, it'd just be a disaster. So you're trying to reconcile that contradiction, you're trying to make it the same game, without it being the same game. In the end we talked about it quite a lot, especially with Thomas and Jens [Nilsson, of Frictional Games], and went 'what's the spirit of the original game, what's the trajectory of the original game? Let's do that, let's not do a mechanical recreation.'\"</p><p></p><p>Pacing was a definite consideration for the Chinese Room: they made a visually enthralling environment that was disturbing in the details, was quite enchanting in its creepy grandeur. In order to get the feeling right, they wanted the player to take their time getting lost in the environment.</p><p></p><p>\"With [The Dark Descent], so many people said they didn't finish it,\" Curry says. \"And since we tell stories, that's a real problem for us. If we'd told it like the original, nobody would have ever found out what the denouement was. It's true of every game, but the ending to Pigs is so … The pivotal moment of the story. It's really interesting that people who haven't got to the end don't really get it.\"</p><p></p><p>\"The whole point of the second half of the game is that it takes everything you've learned in the first half and dissects it one piece at a time,\" Pinchbeck says, \"and said everything you know is wrong.I think that's what makes it uncomfortable for people. Hopefully, the way it was designed, you end the game feeling really, really ambivalent. Any thread that you pull out leads to a really unpleasant place.\"</p><p></p><p>\"The first few levels are really, really slow,\" Pinchbeck goes on to say. \"You sometimes have to get in a mindset of certain experiences. The first half an hour of the game is critical – it's not only teaching you the mechanical way of playing the game, it's teaching you the emotional way of playing the game. If you get it wrong, it can be a disaster, it can take the sort of Assassin's Creed/Fable route – it's just nothing, it's terrible, it's a two-hour learning curve. So we knew Pigs was going to be slow … Tracking the forums there's been a direct correlation between how much people enjoyed the game and how long they took. Anyone who played the game for four hours hated it, and anyone who played over six hours loved it. And that's just about the speed they spent in there, being in this place. We said this in the splash screen: don't play this game to beat it, play it like a game to be in the world for. If you play this like a really old-fashioned role-play game, then you get a lot more out of it.\"</p><p></p><h2>A league of its own<br /></h2><p>Our conversation brought into relief that genre can be agonising for creators. Amnesia: The Dark Descent created a genre for itself that had forum-goers begin to dictate constraints for the Chinese Room's interpretation. But it had happened before to the Chinese Room: their previous game, Dear Esther, was constantly dogged by internet conversation about whether it was a game or not, what made it a game, what made it not a game, ad nauseum, seemingly ignoring their actual personal response to the mechanics of it, more interested in classifying it than they were playing it.</p><p></p><p>\"We were talking about the Sopranos this morning,\" Pinchbeck says of himself and his son. \"Is Sopranos … Is it a black comedy, or is it a thriller? And if you call it a thriller, does that detract from it being what it is? If you look at say, Ace Ventura Pet Detective, and say you're only going to look at it according to a very strict set of rules, let's say action thriller – well, it's a rubbish action thriller. If you take Goodfellas and say: 'I'm only going to examine this as if it's a Jim Carrey slapstick comedy', it's going to fail miserably.</p><p></p><p>\"But if you're the type of person who can only judge something on a pre-existing rigid set of criteria, you've got a big problem anyway. The only question that actually matters is, is it good? There are still people who write about Dear Esther and say: 'I wish I could love it, but it's not a game.' Well you think: 'Well you're just a fucking idiot then, aren't you?' because actually if you have to call it a name before you decide whether you like it or not, you've got a weird kind of hangup.\"</p><p></p><p>Curry took it even further, explaining that she was taken aback by the vehemence of the response to experimentation of the form. \"What I'm really surprised by is that people see [Dear Esther] as an attack on games.\"</p><p></p><p>\"We've destroyed the games industry according to Total Biscuit,\" Dan Pinchbeck says. \"With the greatest amount of pride in [Dear Esther] – it ain't that significant.\"</p><p></p><p>Before I visited the Chinese Room's studios, which were disappointingly brightly lit, not at all gloomy or scary, with nothing to denote Asian influences, I asked the internet what they would like to know about Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. One respondent asked, \"Why pigs?\" And Jim Sterling of Destructoid asked, \"How pigs?\" I put these important questions to Curry and Pinchbeck, who laugh.</p><p></p><p>\"Well, A Machine For Sheep wouldn't really work,\" Pinchbeck says.</p><p></p><p>\"A Machine For Cows sounds really unfrightening,\" Curry says.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Pinchbeck says of pigs, \"Well... it's a smart animal that we kill. In vast numbers. And that's really nice as a metaphor.\"</p><p></p><p><em>* Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is out now on Windows, OSX and Linux via Steam. </em></p><p><em>Dear Esther is still out in the wild, destroying the games industry, as far as we know.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420008201|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|dbf643136ab26933e00f776a6e35a3f78e5e976c -->",

        "headline":"Adblock Plus: the tiny plugin threatening the internet's business model",
        "body":"<p>The letter to Twitter, the US company preparing for a $15bn stock market flotation, sounded reasonable enough - if cheeky. &quot;We would like to partner with you to engineer acceptable, non-intrusive advertising,&quot; said <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-twitter\">the blogpost from Adblock Plus</a>.</p> <p>But the sentence’s continuation seemed to carry a veiled threat: “We want you to do it responsibly, by adhering to our <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads\">Acceptable Ads guidelines.</a>” And if Twitter doesn’t? Then it would remain on the list of sites where adverts are blocked by the browser add-on, which its developer - a Cologne-based company called Eyeo - claims has 30 million daily users, and has been downloaded 200m times.</p> <p>Adblock Plus’s model is straightforward: unless a site is on its “whitelist”, then it blocks all the ads shown there. And, as it makes clear, even big websites whose advertising methods (text only, no flashy gimmicks) it finds acceptable must hand over a share of their advertising revenue for the reward of being on the “whitelist” and showing their ads to visitors. “Small” sites - the precise definition of “small” isn’t given - don’t have to pay if their ads are deemed acceptable.</p> <p>Twitter declined to comment for this article on its thinking about Adblock Plus’s offer. But for the many sites which rely on advertising - not only Twitter, but Facebook, Yahoo and many media organisations (including the Guardian) - the idea of millions of desktop users not seeing the ads that pay a significant part of their bills is a problem. Yet the idea of paying the company which creates the problem to make the problem go away might not seem palatable either.</p> <h2>&quot;First it blocks your ads, and then asks for money to unblock them&quot;</h2> <p>“‘Shakedown’, ‘racketeering’ and ‘extortion’ are common terms publishers we've spoken with have used in relation to [Adblock Plus’s] ‘acceptable ads’,” says Sean Blanchfield of <a href=\"http://pagefair.com/\">PageFair</a>. His company provides analytical services for websites looking to find out how much they are losing to users of ad blockers. “We think this is very unfortunate, as acceptable ads are the only way to avoid more people choosing to install Adblock. The mafia comparisons are not helped by a lack of transparency around the financial terms of being on the whitelist.”</p> <p>Even some users of Adblock Plus agree. “I think the ‘Acceptable Ads’ idea will only work out if there is no money involved,” <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8872&amp;start=30#p53187\">wrote a user called “freakinvibe” on the plugin’s message board when the idea of the whitelist was first announced</a>. “If you were a website owner, would you share the ad income with ABP? I don't think so. First, ABP blocks your ads (without asking) and then asks for money to unblock them. Isn't that extortion?”</p> <p>Eyeo responds that “publishers and websites only participate by their own volition; those that have have been pleased with the results of non-intrusive advertising.” The company does concede that it has “initiated conversations” rather than just waiting for partners to approach it, but emphasises that “the order of approach is secondary to the process”.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a14a045e-e94e-4781-8f09-56f88157d358\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/11/1381504948338/4cd7d578-0d74-42fd-aa15-8ea2de13c74d-460x303.png\" alt=\"Google's acceptable ads\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google's &quot;acceptable ads&quot;. Photograph: Ad screenshot</figcaption> </figure> <p>So powerful is Adblock Plus that even the mighty Google, which relies on showing advertising for 90% of its revenues, has been forced to make a deal with the company to bypass its blockers. But in March&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/google-censoring-android-apps\">it kicked Adblock Plus out of its Google Play store for Android phones</a>, stating that it “interferes with or accesses another service or product in an unauthorized manner”.</p> <p>A spokesman for Eyeo says it “can't speak publicly about specific contracts”, but that “the service we offer paying websites gives them the opportunity to gain more revenue by producing better ads.” He said the fee, which is paid by less than 10% of applicants, “is the main part&quot; of the company's revenue stream.</p> <p>Currently there are just 148 sites on the whitelist out of 777 which applied, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/acceptable-ads-by-the-numbers\">a blogpost from Adblock Plus</a>. For those which have to pay - which includes Google, Amazon and Yandex, Russia’s largest search engine - the fee for not having their ads blocked is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/browsererweiterung-in-der-kritik-wie-adblock-plus-mit-werbung-geld-verdient-1.1715051\">reportedly</a>&nbsp;the cash equivalent of 30% of the revenue generated by showing ads.</p> <p><a href=\"http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/the_rise_of_adblocking.pdf\">PageFair’s data</a>&nbsp;shows that use of ad blocking software – of which there are a number of developers other than Adblock Plus, including Adblock and Adblock Edge – is increasing rapidly. In some particularly tech-savvy sectors, more than a quarter of site visitors block ads, but even general interest sites see between 15% and 20% of visitors using it.</p> <h2>&quot;An ad that is displayed but ignored doesn’t provide value&quot;</h2> <p>In March 2010, technology news site Ars Technica experimented with an outright ban on users who blocked ads. For 12 hours, they were redirected to a blank page, until Ars relented, with editor-in-chief Ken Fisher posting an explanation titled “<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/\">why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love</a>”, saying: “Imagine running a restaurant where 40% of the people who came and ate didn't pay. In a way, that's what ad blocking is doing to us.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/the-unnecesary-ars-technica-rant\">Adblock Plus developer Wladimir Palant responded</a>&nbsp;that Adblock Plus users were unlikely to click on adverts anyway. “An ad that is displayed but ignored doesn’t provide value.”</p> <p>But sites are rarely paid “per click”. Instead, the standard metric for selling web display ads is “CPM”, or “cost per mille” - the cost for a thousand views. Even if users think that they are ignoring adverts, advertisers perceive a value in putting brands in front of them.</p> <p>“In dollar terms, it would be typical to see a general-interest website lose 10%-15% of its revenue,” says Blanchard. “For a site that serves 10 million page views per day, with three ads per page, sold at a rate of $5 CPM, this could translate into daily losses of about $20,000.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-bd4c8f9e-a5a0-4435-818a-78f815002f77\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/11/1381504780739/4deb0471-eb35-4cb0-96a5-21bd22dded99-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"\" one=\"\" weird=\"\" trick=\"\" …\"\"=\"\" width=\"328\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>&quot;Purging bad ads is just a start to a better internet.&quot; Photograph: Ad screenshot</figcaption> </figure> <p>The one thing all sides agree on is that the current state of online advertising is deplorable.</p> <p>“I'd put it like this,” says Patrick Smith, of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.themediabriefing.com/\">TheMediaBriefing</a>. “The TV adverts in between the action at the Superbowl in America are the most talked-about things in the country for a day or so after the event. People genuinely like them because they're funny, interesting, cute or just generally interesting. In fashion magazines, the advertising is part of the content - there's almost no distinction.</p> <p>“But with web advertising we don't yet have this commitment to quality: we have irrelevant, out-of-context flashing banners and low value ad network gifs about losing weight in one easy trick. We have rollovers that go 'over' without being 'rolled'. There are autoplay video ads, and much else, to disrupt the experience.”</p> <p>The debate isn’t about the aims of Adblock Plus, but the tactics. “I do think there's something slightly sanctimonious about Adblock,” says Smith. “I wonder if they'd be more successful as a pressure group campaigning to make the web better, rather than a tollbooth for online content.”</p> <p>“Ironically… Adblock Plus is itself funded by advertising, via the whitelisted publishers,” adds Blanchard. “Overall, I think it would be best for the Acceptable Advertising movement if an alternative business model could be found.”</p> <p>But the plugin also has some unlikely allies. “I think they are doing a good thing blocking those ads. It’s for the good of advertisers,” says Princely Bibi, a research specialist at ad agency Coast Digital. “People should be able to choose whether they are served ads. Advertising is about providing a service, so I should have a choice about what ads are shown to me and what ads aren’t shown to me.”</p> <p>Adblock Plus’s spokesperson says: “It’s likely a long way off, but the logical outcome of Acceptable Ads is a day with only marginal adblocking use – because advertisers would have finally realized that they do not need to annoy users. So in that sense you could say that if our initiative is successful it will lessen the desirability of using ABP or other adblockers – that’s part of the reason that we want to develop additional products with [parent company] Eyeo. As we say, purging bad ads is just a start to a better internet.”</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419726329|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4ce86617e5a1d1dbe0cbb86ff161a81a99d6cee3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rockstar has just the thing for gamers frustrated by the stuttering debut of its Grand Theft Auto Online mode: $500,000 of in-game cash. The company <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51565/grand-theft-auto-online-half-a-million-gta-stimulus-package-this.html\">announced on its Newswire</a> blog on Friday that the 'special stimulus package' would be dropped into the world perhaps as early as this week.</p><p>The cash injection will be provided to any purchaser of Grand Theft Auto V who has attempted to play the Online mode during October. Launched at the beginning of the month, the service has been plagued by technical problems, including disappearing player-characters, and unreliable server access. Many gamers have lost thousands of in-game dollars, during the opening weeks. </p><p>\"In order to keep the current worldwide in-game economy balanced, we will be providing this GTA$ to players via two deposits of $250,000,\" explained Rockstar on its website. \"We will announce specific dates as soon as possible, but are currently hoping to be able to make the first deposit by the end of next week (after we've confirmed that issues causing game progress loss have been fixed) with the second installment to happen by the end of the month. For players who experienced cloud server errors, connection issues, and lost game progress and characters in these first days of GTA Online, we hope this GTA$ helps to facilitate a fresh start or makes your continued life in Los Santos and Blaine County extra sweet.\"</p><p>There has been controversy over Rockstar's decision to include microtransactions in the Online mode, allowing participants to pay real money for packages of in-game cash. The company insists it has balanced the experience to allow players to quickly earn money through in-game activities such as missions and car thefts. This stimulus package will at least allow microtransaction-adverse players to quickly access some of the upper end purchases, such as apartments and multi-car garages (although players will still have to rank up to unlock fancy-pants guns and vehicle upgrades). </p><p>Reactions have, as ever, been mixed. \"Great news,\" wrote one reader of the Rockstar site. \"I've stuck with the game even thou (sic) there have been issues but this just shows rock star have listened and shows respect to us gamers. Cheers Rockstar\". However, one comment on <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/10/11/keep-your-500000-gta-online-stimulus-rockstar-just-fix-the-game/\">Time's coverage of the news</a>, complained, \"I hate the fact they are giving everybody 500K. this is because i worked for a long time dragging myself through missions to earn enough to buy a 150K apartment and a 155K car... and now everybody even the people still on level 5 and such will be able to buy this stuff and they don't deserve it.\"</p><p>It just goes to show that money can't always buy happiness. But it <em>can</em> buy a desirable residence in Rockford Hills and a new spoiler for your Pfister Comet super car.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419885497|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|d61f06e04b12d59f0e9a7883a45e9c87e6606992 -->",

        "headline":"Can Twitter still be special after floating on Wall Street?",
        "body":"<p>So here we go again: another \"free\" web service with a silly name, some revenues (but still not enough to cover its operating costs), and a business model that seems, well, a bit sketchy, heading for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/twitter-founding-investor-evan-williams-1bn-flotation\" title=\"\">stock market flotation</a>.</p><p>Accompanying this we have the usual hoopla: frenzied speculation about \"valuations\"; serious looking bankers in suits touting spreadsheets which purport to give a rational basis for numbers plucked out of the air; gossip columnists speculating on how much the company's founders will be \"worth \"after the first day's trading.</p><p>And there are also legions of \"normal\" people shaking their heads and wondering how a company with a few employees and no physical product can be worth more than an enterprise that makes real things and sells them to customers.</p><p>The obvious comparison is with Facebook. After all, they're both \"social networking services\", aren't they? But Facebook is much bigger – with 1.15 billion users, compared with Twitter's paltry 215 million has grown faster, and earns way <a href=\"http://qz.com/132310/the-definitive-chart-that-shows-why-twitter-is-not-facebook/\" title=\"\">more revenue per user</a>. Twitter is hoping to raise $1bn from its initial public offering (IPO), which is closer to the $1.6bn that Google raised in 2004 than to the $16bn that Facebook aimed at in 2012. And Twitter and Facebook are alike in that all of their business models appear, ultimately, to depend on advertising. Or, to put it more crudely, on \"monetising\" their users.</p><p>But while it's obvious what Facebook is – a social-networking service – a root definition of Twitter is much more elusive. In its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513390321/d564001ds1.htm\" title=\"\">S-1 Filing </a> (the document a company has to file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in order to get the stock market flotation), the company's owners describe it as \"a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time\". By developing \"a fundamentally new way for people to create, distribute and discover content\", they claim to \"have democratised content creation and distribution, enabling any voice to echo around the world instantly and unfiltered\". That sounds about right but it covers a multitude. And what it means is that Twitter is different things to different people.</p><p>For some, it is a way to plug into the thought-stream of people whose work they value or admire. For others, it's an ego-trip amplifier. For celebs, it's just another publicity tool. For their unfortunate fans it's a way of kidding themselves that they are, somehow, gaining admittance to an inner circle.</p><p>For bloggers, it's a way of giving their posts a chance of gaining some traction or attention. For non-bloggers, it's a channel for sharing interesting links and gossip. For sports fans, it's a channel for complaining about the referee.</p><p>For millions, it's a way of having your own broadcasting station for transmitting your exasperated rants about the coalition, Obamacare, the <em>Today</em> programme, call-centre music, Ryanair or whatever is getting under your skin.</p><p>And so on and so on, ad infinitum. And all in what has come to be known, quaintly, as real time. Put all those (and more) into a blender, whizz gently and what do you get? Answer: a strange combination of wire service and coffee shop.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419705867'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/11/1381485997413/Janis-Krums-Twitter-has-b-001.jpg' alt='Janis Krums\nTwitter has become a go-to destination for breaking news. But that wasn't always the' width='220' height='262' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tweet sent by @jkrums.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the seminal moments in Twitter's evolution came on 15 January 2009, when US Airways flight 1549 ran into a flock of birds and crash-landed in the Hudson river. A Twitter user named <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/twitter-user-star-airways-crash-janis-krums-sets-internet-abuzz-iphone-photo-article-1.408174\" title=\"\">Janis Krums </a>tweeted a photograph of the stricken aircraft together with the text: \"There's a plane in the Hudson. I'm on the ferry going to pick up the people. Crazy.\"</p><p>Which is how the world got to know about the accident a full 15 minutes before the \"professional\" news organisations were able to get the word out. And how the rest of us woke up to the fact that we had accidentally acquired the kind of wire service that once was the exclusive prerogative of those aforementioned organisations.</p><p>As for the coffee shop dimension, one didn't have to look further than what happened during the television debates between the British party leaders in the 2010 general election when Twitter became an astonishing back-channel for live, second-by-second commentary on the debate which was far more entertaining, and enlightening, than anything the official participants said. And one realised that, here, finally, was a medium that could cut broadcast television down to size.</p><p>Despite Facebook's size and reach, and its much-vaunted role in the short-lived <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a>, there are reasons for thinking that Twitter may be the more important service for the future of the public sphere – that is, the space in which democracies conduct public discussion. The fact that Twitter has fewer users and that they might not be <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-more-evidence-that-twitter-is-disconnected-from-the-mainstream-2013-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+businessinsider+%28Business+Insider%29\" title=\"\">demographically representative </a>might, paradoxically, make them more influential in shaping opinion for the simple reason that they are more likely than the average Joe to express or articulate political views.</p><p>And there is some evidence to suggest that tweeted sentiment on some ideological issues actually tracks more rigorous methods of opinion polling.</p><p>In a less abstruse way, Twitter has already shown itself to be a useful conduit for circumventing legal or governmental censorship. In the UK, for example, it provided the means for circumventing the intricate web of legal injunctions and super-injunctions which had kept the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/oct/13/twitter-online-outcry-guardian-trafigura\" title=\"\">Trafigura case </a>out of the public domain.</p><p>When WikiLeaks was deprived of DNS services during the \"Cablegate\" controversy – which had the effect of making the site unfindable for a time – Twitter provided the channel by which information on the current URL was disseminated until normal service was  restored.</p><p>To date, the owners of Twitter have been alert to the sensitive role that their system plays in our information ecosystem. They seem to have been slightly better, for example, than some other online providers at pushing back on government demands for personal information <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013\" title=\"\">about their users</a>.</p><p>All of which means that the metamorphosis of Twitter from a privately held company to a public one is more significant than most stock-market flotations.</p><p>Public corporations are like nation states in one respect, namely that while they may bleat (or boast) about their \"values\", in the end they are driven only by their national or corporate interests – which in practice means the interests of shareholders. Standing up to governments on ethical grounds is not something of which shareholders generally approve, especially if doing so might incur legal or financial penalties.</p><p>And here we see the biggest weakness of so-called \"free\" services such as Facebook and Twitter. In order to prosper commercially they have to invent ways of monetising their users. To date, that seems to have been mostly achieved by intruding on their privacy in order to target them with advertisements.</p><p>The trick is to be able to do this without irritating them so much that they eventually pack up and leave. Facebook is now careering down this slippery slope, and every ingenious, manipulative twist of the algorithms it uses to determine what is displayed in a user's timeline seems to increase its downward velocity.</p><p>In contrast, Twitter's monetising drive has been relatively discreet up to now. Its \"promoted tweet\" service, for example, didn't launch until 2010 (four years after the company's foundation), and the frequency of promoted tweets – and of other new services such as \"promoted trends\" – has been fairly unobtrusive up to now.</p><p>The big  question is whether this self-denying ordinance will survive the transition to Wall Street. Personally, I hope it does. I could easily live without Facebook; but Twitter  is something I would really miss.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419594772|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4a1d70f793f24828bc41a135303485fe6947247c -->",

        "body":"<p>Microsoft is updating its Windows Phone software to accommodate larger devices of up to 6in diagonally - classed as a &quot;phablet&quot; (phone-tablet) - and make it easier for motorists to reduce distractions while driving.</p> <p>The move is part of an effort to give its range of mobile devices greater feature parity with Apple's iPhone and Google's Android, even while it lags in sales behind the two ecosystems.</p> <p>It's the third update to the Windows Phone 8 software since the system's release a year ago. Devices with this update will start appearing in the coming weeks, and older phones will be eligible for a free upgrade, too. Microsoft couldn't give a precise date when the software will be sent to older handsets, because that will depend on operators' approval.</p> <h2>Drive time</h2> <p>Something that may appeal to motorists: a new Driving Mode will automatically silence incoming calls and texts so that you can focus on the road. You also can configure the feature to automatically send out a reply to say that you're driving. It can be activated automatically when the phone is linked wirelessly with a Bluetooth device in the car, such as a headset. Apple has a Do Not Disturb feature for iPhones, which can be activated via its Siri voice assistant.</p> <p>What the Driving Mode won't do, however, is block outgoing calls or texts. And there will be ways to override it. The feature won't stop a teenager from texting while driving, but it will help reduce distractions for those who want that, says Greg Sullivan, director for Microsoft's Windows Phone business.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2c25bb80-8820-4c26-a663-cfcd821b7f3e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381770431603/9af3332d-8c90-4e65-b814-e7b368da5e2a-252x420.png\" alt=\"Windows Phone 8 update 3: driving mode\" width=\"252\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Windows Phone 8 update 3 has a special Driving mode. Photograph: /PR/Microsoft</figcaption> </figure> <p>In a <a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2013/10/14/announcing-our-third-windows-phone-8-update-plus-a-new-developer-preview-program.aspx\">blog post about the update</a>, Darren Laybourn, the corporate vice-president for Windows phone points to a number of enhancements, including a rotation lock for the screen (&quot;does your screen keep spinning when you're trying to read emails in bed?&quot;), an easy way to close apps from the multitasking interface, Wi-Fi access when configuring a new phone, and improved Bluetooth. All of those bring Windows Phone closer to feature parity with Apple's iPhone and Google's Android - although there is still no solution for Microsoft's longstanding row with Google over a native app to show YouTube videos.</p> <h2>Phablet time</h2> <p>The new update also will allow for better resolution to accommodate larger phones. Currently, the system supports a maximum resolution of 1280 pixels by 768 pixels, which is adequate for phones with screens no larger than 5in on the diagonal. But video and image quality degrades when stretched out on larger phones, such as a 6.3in (16-centimeter) Samsung Galaxy Mega, one of the largest phablets on sale.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5ecacf82-c825-4a4e-80d4-72ec9c6c3422\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381770827402/f6ac6e37-871a-4ed1-bf57-18d821e3f3ae-236x420.png\" alt=\"Windows Phone 8 update 3 allows for phablets\" width=\"236\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Windows Phone 8 update 3 allows for phablets by allowing up to three columns of large tiles - or more of smaller tiles - on the display. Photograph: /PR/Microsoft</figcaption> </figure> <p>The layout for larger phones also will change. Phones may now sport a third column of tiles, for instance; previously they have been restricted to two, although some have allowed small icons to fit more in. Contact lists and other features will be able to fit in more information. That's a contrast to Android, where larger screens means that text and images simply gets bigger, without actually fitting in more content.</p> <p>Microsoft's Windows Phone software, launched in October 2010, holds a distant third place behind Apple's iOS and Google's Android. It had a worldwide market share of 3.7% in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC. But shipments of Windows Phone devices grew 78% to 8.7m in the April-to-June period, compared with the same time a year ago. In the five largest European countries, its share of sales in the quarter to the end of September&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/Global/News/Windows-Phone-nears-double-digit-share-across-Europe\">approached 10%</a>, hitting 12% in the UK.</p> <p>Microsoft in September said it is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/03/microsoft-swoops-on-nokias-mobile-division-in-54bn-deal---live\">buying the mobile handset division of Nokia</a>, the Finnish company, and will close the deal in the new year. That may mean that it can drive development of the software and hardware together - though it will still be licensing the software to companies including ZTE, Samsung and HTC - the latter having less than 10% of Windows Phone sales, yet still being the biggest provider outside Nokia.</p> <p>Microsoft is launching a program to give app developers early access to the new software. Apple has had a similar program for the iOS software behind iPhones and iPads, while Google often has worked with selected developers on unreleased features.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419942878|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|8d4f166abea63644e1913ac5d7c58f5f3bc45b2a -->",

        "headline":"London's Tech City welcomes its first mainland Chinese firm",
        "body":"<p>London&rsquo;s Tech City is getting its first mainland Chinese firm, now that mobile gaming company Rekoo is moving to the capital and building a new development team.</p> <p>The company is one of China&rsquo;s leading mobile game firms, with 500 employees across Asia and 20 million active daily players worldwide. As well as China, it also has a subsidiary in Japan which opened in 2009 and employs 30 people.</p> <p>To begin with, Rekoo will hire 10 people to work out of its tech city offices, but plans to expand this to 25 within three years. The staff members in the new office will market the games to European consumers, but also be involved in localisation work.</p> <p>&ldquo;As a leading light in China&rsquo;s tech scene, Rekoo&rsquo;s decision is another huge boost for the capital&rsquo;s digital industries,&rdquo; said the Mayor of London Boris Johnson. &ldquo;Making the most of the great minds, talented workforce, and market opportunities within immediate access of our Tech City makes absolute sense which is why London is fast becoming the digital capital of the world.&rdquo;</p> <p>As well as convincing Rekoo to come to the UK, Tech City has also been instrumental in getting it set up so quickly. The company has already appointed a European MD, Tony Hughes, and is moving into a full-service office in Shoreditch. &ldquo;They just have to plug in the computers, and they&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said David Slater of London and Partners, the capital&rsquo;s official promotional organisation.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is a company with 200 million users,&rdquo; Slater added. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve got a customer base like that, they can choose anywhere in the world to build their global business. They&rsquo;ve chosen London, not only London but Tech City, which I think is a great vote of confidence for the Tech City initiative.&rdquo;</p> <p>Rekoo is one of the first Chinese companies to provide games on Facebook, a platform which is still struggling to penetrate the mainland. In its IPO prospectus last year, the social network said its market share in the country was almost zero, and home-grown alternatives like WeChat have filled in the gap.</p> <p>Moving onto Facebook is evidence of Rekoo&rsquo;s outward expansion, but Slater emphasises the &ldquo;two way relationship&rdquo; Rekoo Europe will have. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got 100 million people in asia who are potential customers for UK developed games&hellip; the opportunity it gave as a channel for UK exporters was always part of that greater plan for Rekoo.&rdquo;</p> <p>The company&rsquo;s most popular game, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.funship.findsomething.channel_91\">Find Something</a>, has been played by 100 million gamers, and is already available on the Android app store in the UK, France and Italy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420053837|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|34a664f0df7a9f78d3675c8a408476db994b4749 -->",

        "body":"<p>Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC announced its latest flagship phone on Monday, revealing a fingerprint scanning security feature and 5.9in screen on the HTC One Max.</p> <p>The One Max comes less than one month after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/10/iphone-5s-fingertip-scanner\">Apple revealed the iPhone 5S</a>, which garnered huge attention for its fingerprint sensor which unlocks the device.</p> <p>HTC's phablet - an oversized smartphone, or small tablet -&nbsp;resembles the slim profile and curved metal back design of the well-received 5in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/09/htc-one-review\">HTC One Android smartphone</a>, but features&nbsp;a larger 5.9in full HD screen that makes watching movies and sharing content with friends easier.</p> <p>“The addition of the HTC One max means that we now have an HTC One phone for everyone,” said Peter Chou, chief executive of HTC. “The HTC One max delivers the size and power required to do everything you want, and more, without compromise.”</p> <p>Unlocked with up to three fingerprints</p> <p>The rear of the device features a fingerprint scanner, which sits below the phone’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/09/htc-one-review\">4-Ultrapixel camera</a>&nbsp;and allows the phone to be unlocked with up to three pre-stored fingerprints replacing the need for a PIN or password.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8a1852a0-bce9-405e-ad8b-202464cc2428\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381767852313/2c67d8ec-5382-494d-9272-fe474f1ea79e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"HTC One Max phablet has a fingerprint scanner on the back.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>HTC One Max phablet has a fingerprint scanner on the back.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Security is a concern, according to&nbsp;Carolina Milanesi, vice president at research analysis firm Gartner:</p> <p>&quot;Considering that Apple was not able to avoid spoofing of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/apple-iphone-fingerprint-scanner-hacked\">Touch ID</a> for longer than 48 hours, I doubt HTC will have much more success. Where it has positioned the fingerprint scanner shows it will be more about convenience than security&nbsp;to me.&quot;</p> <p>Each stored fingerprint can also be used to trigger a different app while unlocking the device, providing rapid access to your favourite applications. The fluidity of the experience will be key when it comes to a feature that buyers might actually use on a daily basis, however.</p> <p>&quot;Unlike Apple's use of the technology, HTC's use of the fingerprint of sensor is clunky, not ergonomic and runs the risk of not being used to its full extent - if it's not a smooth experience that genuinely adds value why would the general user actually use it?&quot; said&nbsp;Francisco Jeronimo research director of European mobile devices for research firm IDC.</p> <h2>Like the One, but bigger</h2> <p>The One Max runs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/android\">Android</a> 4.3 Jelly Bean with HTC’s updated “Sense 5.5” user interface customisations with the same 1.7GHz quad-core processor that HTC chose for the original One.</p> <p>The Max has 2GB of RAM and 16 or 32GB of built-in storage with a micro SD slot for adding up to 64GB of additional of space.</p> <p>The One Max also has a larger, 3,300mAh battery to offset the increased demand placed on it by the larger 5.9in screen and maintain battery life.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a6751228-3497-40af-a856-5bf023ce8a39\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381767687109/03f0af85-8b31-4636-9c43-1684e5a915c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"HTC One Max phablet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>HTC One Max phablet</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Stiff competition</h2> <p>The HTC One Max joins a raft of new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/phablets\">phablets</a> that have launched this year, including stiff competition from both the 5.7in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-is-it-a-tablet-or-a-phone\">Samsung Galaxy Note 3</a>&nbsp;and 6.44in Sony Xperia Z Ultra.</p> <p>&quot;There are two markets for the phablet - the multimedia market, where the cheapest largest screen wins, and the professional market, where the phablet with the most value-added features triumphs,&quot; said Jeronimo.</p> <p>Samsung's Galaxy Note line of devices differentiate themselves from the phablet competition, including HTC's new One Max, by coming equipped with a feature-packed stylus that not only allows drawing on the screen but also provides multiple multi-tasking modes such as Samsung's multi-window.</p> <p>It is these value-added features that attract the highly lucrative professional market, according to Jeronimo.</p> <p>&quot;The stylus tips the buyer in the Note's favour at the point of sale because, despite whether or not they will ever use the features, the more features available the more attractive the proposition when the price is equal,&quot; he said.</p> <h2>Phablets outpacing PCs</h2> <p>Analysts predicted that 2013 would be “the year of the phablet” in January, after analysing the rapid rise of the large-screened phones in 2012.</p> <p>Phablet shipments outpaced both tablets and portable PCs in the last year in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), with a total of 25.2m phablets shipped compared to 12.6m tablets (over 7in) and 12.7m portable PCs, according data from IDC.</p> <p>While phablet shipments are still a small proportion of overall global smartphone shipments, they are seeing a marked increase in sales according to IDC's data.</p> <p>&quot;Most vendors need a device in the phablet sector to compete, however, their sales figures are unlikely to be high given the strong competition from Samsung,&quot; concluded Jeronimo.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• HTC insists it will stay out of the low-end as it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/14/htc-one-max-fingerprint-scanner-low-end\">aims to compete with Samsung and Apple</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419921949|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|0116eec7b99ab2049f19bad17361ba273ecdef9c -->",

        "headline":"Xbox One introduces community achievements and Twitter-style feed",
        "body":"<p>Microsoft's Xbox One console will fully embrace the social-media age, a new video has revealed. Official Xbox spokesman Larry Hryb (AKA Major Nelson) has released a tutorial showcasing the machine's Friends App, which will allow owners to add up to 1,000 friends, and then view what these contacts are playing, watching or listening to via a live Activity Feed. </p><p>In a nod to Twitter, gamers will now also be able to 'follow' other players without committing to a friendship. This will give the follower access to elements such as in-game achievements and high scores, but won't reveal when the followed player is online, or other personal information. However, if two players follow each other, the amount of viewable data is increased – although privacy levels can all be personally customised.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://majornelson.com/2013/10/14/new-friends-app-and-multiplayer-features-for-xbox-live-on-xbox-one/\">a blogpost accompanying the video</a>, Hyrb quotes Xbox Live program manager Rob Lehew who explains, &quot;A great driver in 'Forza Motorsport 5,' for example, could have a huge group of thousands or even millions of followers all tracking their performance in-game. Those followers can have this driver on their personal leaderboard so that they can constantly keep track of how they stack-up, and they can potentially connect online with the driver to get into a race with him.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft is also updating its Achievement system, which rewards gamers with points based on specific in-game activities. Introduced for the Xbox 360, Achievements will be retained on Xbox One, but new timed challenges are also being added – these will crop up during certain periods of time, and what you achieve in that limited slot will be converted into rewards for all participants. Interestingly, many of these challenges will be community-based, requiring players to work together in order to complete tasks. It's a concept that's been emerging in online game design for some time, with titles like Eve Online requiring mass participation for certain activities. The idea is now filtering into console titles like Call of Duty Ghosts and The Division. </p><p>The live Activity feed and new communal achievements symbolise a console that is designed for near-constant broadband connection. Indeed, when the machine was first announced in May, a daily internet connection was revealed as a mandatory element – although public outrage forced Microsoft to backtrack on this element. The company is also enhancing other key areas of the online gaming experience, including <a href=\"http://news.xbox.com/2013/07/games-reputation-feature\">its new Smart Match technology</a> to allow better matchmaking for competitive multiplayer gaming, and a refreshed <a href=\"http://news.xbox.com/2013/07/games-reputation-feature\">Reputation system</a>, which flags disruptive players with a red trafficlight warning sign on their GamerCard.</p><p>Launching in major global territories on 22 November, Xbox One will be competing directly against Sony's PlayStation 4, which arrives in North America on 15 November and Europe on 29 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419924444|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|1152892715cedd41e4bc35dd758c9894e4f19430 -->",
