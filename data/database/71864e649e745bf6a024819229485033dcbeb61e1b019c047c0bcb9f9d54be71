UKaid funding from the British government's Department for Intrernational Development is helping the NGO Mercy Corps deliver clean water and sanitation facilities to over 160,000 people in Sindh, as they return home to destroyed houses and partially flooded communities and agricultural land. In some parts of Sindh the water may take many months more to fully drain away, despite the flooding originally occuring in August and September 2010.
