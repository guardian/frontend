There are no such exceptional circumstances here.&quot;</p> <p>The court would have to find the CIA implicitly guilty of a war crime before it could consider whether GCHQ had been involved, the court said.</p> <p>Lawyers for the UK government had argued that the case should not proceed as &quot;a finding by our court that the notional UK operator of a drone bomb which caused a death was guilty of murder would inevitably be understood â€¦ by the US as a condemnation of the US.&quot;</p> <p>Responding to the ruling, Kat Craig, legal director of the human rights charity Reprieve, which is supporting Khan, said: &quot;It is shameful that the risk of embarrassing the US has trumped British justice in this case.</p> <p>&quot;It now appears that the UK government can get away with murder, provided it is committed alongside an ally who may be sensitive to public criticism. It is a sad day when the rights of civilian victims of drone strikes take second place to the PR concerns of the US government.&quot;</p> <p>Khan said: &quot;I used to think that Britain stood for justice, but now it seems as though the government has put itself above the law.</p> <p>&quot;However, I am still determined to get answers from the UK government about the part they have played in the death of my father. The CIA&apos;s drone programme has not only killed hundreds of civilians, but is turning people in Pakistan against the US and its allies.</p> <p>&quot;This is why I was so upset to hear that Britain is helping the CIA to carry out these killings, and even more upset when the government refused to respond to my questions.&quot;</p> <p>Rosa Curling from Leigh Day, which is representing Khan, said: &quot;The court&apos;s decision not to determine the lawfulness of our government&apos;s involvement in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, deadly strikes which have killed many civilians over recent years including my client&apos;s father, simply to spare the US government embarrassment is not only disappointing but also deeply worrying.</p> <p>&quot;The courts must have jurisdiction over the legality of our government&apos;s action irrespective of whether they act alongside a foreign state or not.&quot;</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8577105","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2029264","internalRevision":"1","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Judges say case would involve 'sitting in judgment' on US and block move by Noor Khan, whose father died in a 2011 attack","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Pakistan drone strike relative loses GCHQ court case","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/20/1390219422353/Drones-003.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3m2gp","wordcount":"480","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/20/1390219422353/Drones-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"569501b7e4b060a3548ca81d","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-27T12:09:09+00:00","standfirst":"Judges say case would involve 'sitting in judgment' on US and block move by Noor Khan, whose father died in a 2011 attack","linkText":"Pakistan drone strike relative loses GCHQ court case","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-12T13:38:07.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"427533283"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jan/20/pakistan-drone-strike-relative-loses-gchq-court-case","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/law/2014/jan/20/pakistan-drone-strike-relative-loses-gchq-court-case","sectionName":"Law","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-427533800","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/20/1390219428844/Drones-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*29339315","suppliersReference":"Del6095754","altText":"Drones","caption":"A Pakistani man holds a burning US flag as protesters shout slogans during an anti-drone demonstration in 2012.
