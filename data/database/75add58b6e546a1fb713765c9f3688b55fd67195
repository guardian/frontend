        "headline":"The Dominican Republic and Haiti: one island riven by an unresolved past",
        "body":"<p>When Haiti was hit by the devastating earthquake in 2010, its island neighbour, the Dominican Republic, rushed to help. It was among the first to send rescue workers, food and water, and also allowed overseas relief agency flights to land at Santo Domingo airport.</p><p>But three years on, the goodwill seems to have dissipated and old tensions resurfaced. Just over a week ago <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-26/world/42423002_1_haitian-migrants-dominicans-citizenship\" title=\"\">the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled to revoke the citizenship of children of illegal Haitian migrant workers</a> – a measure to be applied to anyone born after 1929, and thus affecting not only migrants' children, but their grandchildren and, in some cases, even great-grandchildren.</p><p>This is the latest legal attack on the rights of Haitians and their descendants; measures in the past few years have included reclassifying migrant workers as \"in transit\" rather than legal residents. This meant any child born in the Dominican Republic – which had been one basis for citizenship – also needed one Dominican parent, or one who was a legal resident.</p><p></p><p>The latest ruling could leave thousands who identify themselves as Dominican but may have had a Haitian ancestor facing an uncertain future – already some 40,000 people have been told they will not receive identity documents. Without official papers, it is impossible to access services such as schools or healthcare. Human rights groups and local NGOs have expressed their concern, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/30/3662097/un-will-review-dominican-ruling.html\" title=\"\">and the UN will be reviewing this ruling</a>.</p><p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola, where Christopher Columbus established the first European settlement in 1492. Despite their shared history of colonialism and slavery, dictatorship and oppression, a physical and emotional border has long separated them.</p><p>The western third of the island was ceded by Spain to France in 1697, and the entire island by 1795. By 1801 the famed former slave General Toussaint Louverture had freed all the slaves on the island and united it under his governorship, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/600902/Toussaint-Louverture\" title=\"\">though this was short-lived</a>.</p><p>In 1808, a group of Dominicans started  the war of reconquest to drive out the French and return the eastern part the island to Spanish rule – the west by this point was the republic of Haiti. But by 1822  Haiti had established control of the whole island once more. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1217771.stm\" title=\"\">Dominican Republic gained its independence</a> from Haiti, not Spain, in 1844.</p><p>Modern times have been no less complicated. In 1937, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo – who wore makeup to lighten his skin and was obsessed with \"whitening\" the predominantly mixed-race island – ordered the massacre of Haitians in border areas, where many worked cultivating sugar. To determine who was Haitian, soldiers with machetes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880967\" title=\"\">asked dark-skinned people to say the word \"perejil\"</a>, which is Spanish for parsley. For Creole-speaking Haitians, the \"r\" sound was difficult to pronounce, and a slip of the tongue became a death sentence. Estimates of the massacre range from 10,000 to 25,000 people killed over the course of a few weeks. And the bitter irony was that Trujillo's grandmother was Haitian.</p><p>Today the border continues to inspire fear. Dominican-born children of Haitian descent number around 210,000, in a nation of 10 million. Haitians have long been migrant workers,  with many finding seasonal employment in sugar cane fields or other low-wage work, which has become especially crucial in the aftermath of the earthquake. And, like immigrants elsewhere, they are often blamed for taking jobs. At the same time, racialised fears of \"Haitianisation\" are still regularly voiced by politicians and sections of the media, though many Dominicans have expressed shock and anger over the court's decision. But violence is still directed at Haitians; crimes against them often go unreported; <a href=\"http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?NoCache=1&amp;Dato=20130927&amp;Kategori=NEWS&amp;Lopenr=309270154&amp;Ref=AR\" title=\"\">and many continue to live in dire poverty</a>.</p><p>Deportations of workers who have no chance to appeal are common – the Dominican military reported it sent away some <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dominican-ruling-strips-citizenship-20387587\" title=\"\">47,700 Haitians in the past year, up from 21,000 the year before</a>. And now tens of thousands of people who consider themselves Dominicans face a one-way trip to a country where they cannot speak the language, may not have any family, and face extreme economic hardship. The Haitian government  said it \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/haiti-strongly-disagrees-with-dominican-ruling-that-strips-citizenship-of-immigrant-children/2013/10/05/b07141be-2dee-11e3-b141-298f46539716_story.html\" title=\"\">strongly disagrees</a>\" with the decision and <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/01/3663924/haiti-recalls-envoy-activists.html\" title=\"\">has recalled its ambassador to the Dominican Republic</a> for consultations on the implications of the ruling.</p><p>Anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic reaches back decades, if not centuries; unacknowledged and institutionalised, it has been manipulated and put to political use. Rather than being united by their shared histories, the two sides of Hispaniola remain riven by an unresolved past. It is not yet clear how this ruling will be turned into policy, but in facing such an uncertain future, these Dominicans also carry with them a heavy burden of the past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419097404|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|7f1f5dd8deb0d2a90e819146ce8841aee4fb2b83 -->",

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-special-forces-libya-somalia\" title=\"\">US attacks on Somalia and Libya </a>over the weekend were against lawless parts of the world that harbour dangerous people intent, so we are told, on causing mayhem outside their borders. Someone needs to deal with them. Yet both these countries have been subject to massive western intervention, supposedly to set them on the path to democracy and good order. As with the failed Somalian kidnap, something went wrong there too.</p><p>The attempt to curb international violence is taking ever newer forms. In Britain the centralisation of crime-fighting has been a bad joke for years, as the Home Office invents one \"British FBI\" after another. It has splurged money on bureaucrats, while the frontline is cut back. This week the government has invented yet another body, the £450m <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/national-crime-agency-theresa-may-europol-keith-bristow\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>, with the crass motto \"We instil fear\".</p><p>The reality is that ordinary policing of terrorism in most European countries has a decent record. There have been no serious terrorist massacres in Britain since 2005. The US seems equally safe. The stories that have emerged suggest this is largely the result of local tip-offs and good intelligence work rather than any drastic extension of police powers or global derring-do.</p><p>All the best police work is local. The best tip-offs are local, the best knowledge is local. It was a failure of local intelligence in Pakistan that meant it took the Americans more than a decade to find Osama bin Laden. The future of western security lies not in the courage of special forces or the deployment of drone squadrons and snatch squads. It lies in dogged police work, and in not provoking or abusing the sovereignty of countries that may so readily offer refuge and support to terrorists.</p><p>If one thing has been proved beyond a doubt, the surest way to endanger the west is to proliferate the hamfisted interventions that have made Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere a ready refuge for those who want to take revenge on westerners. To go crashing about the world arresting and doubtless mistreating suspects is a desperate throw. It makes good headlines but it does no good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419231327|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|f6d28659359cad54f33fdf4408c1f44b38b1e46e -->",

        "headline":"Is Buddhism a religion?",
        "body":"<p>What first attracted me to Buddhism in the years that followed my slow abandonment of formal Christianity wasn't anything intellectual but had to do rather with imagination, with images of liberation. I was struck by the serenity of the figure of the Buddha, its representation of self-possession and calm. There was danger there, the temptation towards a too-easy and precipitate appropriation of a demeanour that depended upon arduous and sometimes unappetising struggle. Nevertheless, Buddhism was attractive and it seemed to be a way of rediscovering something that seemed to be missing, without requiring an entrance fee in the form of religious or metaphysical belief.</p><p>I suppose that what was missing was \"spirituality\". But this raises the question of whether \"spirituality\" can be extricated from those belief-commitments. Some commentators have pointed out that there is no shortage of metaphysical beliefs in the Buddhist traditions and that its practices and rituals are embedded in worldviews of some complexity and sophistication. They wonder whether Buddhist practices really can be extracted from this environment without damage to their identity, whether the Buddhisms to be found in the contemporary west have become deracinated, cut off from the necessary nourishment of their cultural and metaphysical roots. It may well look like this. Thus, people attest to the therapeutic value of meditation and the NHS is more comfortable with a mindfulness-based psychotherapy than one that makes use of the Christian practice of prayer because it is an efficacious technique with measurable health benefits and it is not \"religious\". Clients don't need a background of religious belief in order to settle down to a spot of meditation.</p><p>Some contemporary groups go out of their way to insist that Buddhism is not \"religious\" and what they seem to imply is, again, that engaging in its practices doesn't depend upon the belief-subscription. These same groups, however, are also quite traditional in their language and their rituals and this should give us pause as we consider this charge of deracination. It is true that many contemporary Buddhist practitioners have done the same de-mythologising job as a previous generation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/04/death-god-theology-elson\" title=\"\">Death of God theologians</a> who were themselves accused of rendering the New Testament into an inoffensive and pallid humanism.</p><p>But it is one thing to seek to liberate Buddhist practice from unsustainable or unbelievable worldviews and another to reduce it to a mere technique, even one that is therapeutic. The usual culprit is the calming technique that makes it easier to carry out the bombing run or makes one a more sharply predatory capitalist. The reason one might want to say that meditation has been reduced to a technique is that it has lost its essential rootedness as a practice of ethical preparation.</p><p>It is traditional to distinguish forms or aspects of meditation in terms of what calms the egocentric or the communal passions and to say that this prepares the practitioner for the essential Buddhist experience of enlightenment or awakening. Now one of the temptations of former Christians is to think that what they might find in Buddhism is some kind of transcendent experience. But this seems too much like nostalgia for God. If there is any kind of transcendence in Buddhism it is a matter of transcending ego-centric self-enclosure. The calming of the passions that Buddhism is interested in is the calming that reduces the dominance of those self-interested feelings that prevent one from seeing what is staring one in the face: one's own real condition and that of others. One is surrounded by the real world but is too preoccupied to notice it.</p><p>In that case Buddhist practice becomes a form of ethical preparation, reducing the forms of self-preoccupation that impede a concern for justice. This aspect of Buddhism has led some commentators to say that it is more like a philosophy of life than a religion. This contrast with religion relies too heavily on the assimilation of religion to religious belief and it neglects the ceremonial and ritual and community-building aspects of the various religions, including Buddhism.</p><p>More positively, though, thinking of Buddhism as a philosophy brings it into dialogue with the ancient conception of philosophy, one of whose essential components was precisely what was called spiritual practice or exercise, the various ways in which one is able to liberate oneself from illusion and make oneself better capable of ethical action and, of course, the ethical refusal to act. It is worth noting that the ancient philosophers tried to live in communities and one can think of a philosophical community, whether instantiated in a Christian congregation, a Buddhist sangha, a humanist group, as serving to protect and support the conditions for that undeluded perception of the world from which issues moral action.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419071811|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|d7406b7d9633d916a76d96038dcabcb17d5046f0 -->",

        "headline":"Kenya terror attack: corruption wasn't to blame",
        "body":"<p>It was difficult to read Giles Foden's article squarely blaming the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi</a> on alleged inadequacies of the Kenyan government and, as he puts it \"rampant corruption\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-behind-terror-rampant-corruption\" title=\"\">Behind terror is corruption</a>, 24 September). The Kenyan military led the operation to free hostages and kill or capture those who had trapped them, and we are proud of the professionalism and determination of our forces.</p><p>Foden says: \"In Kenya crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either.\" And he continues: \"These attacks are part of a spectrum of banditry, with corruption at one end, terrorism at the other, and regular robbery in the middle.\"</p><p>Make a brief comparison with other terrorist attacks. The disasters of 9/11 or the more recent Boston marathon in the US and 7/7 in the UK – both highly developed countries – could hardly be blamed on corruption, so why Kenya? We do not recall Foden blaming corruption within the security agencies involved.</p><p>\"A lot of money has gone into commercial property, and particularly the building of supermarkets. But without governance it all looks very shaky,\" says Foden. But he seems unaware of how much Kenya has changed in the past decade. The country's first truly free and fair multiparty election only took place in 2002, and since then the country has been transformed by a new constitution that gives power to all communities. Less than 10 years ago we introduced free primary education, now over a million children a year go to school.</p><p>Judicial reform, in some cases supported by international experts and donors – including the US and UK – has put the courts out of the political influence that once was common. Anti-corruption campaigns by government and civil society, the requirement for open tenders for government contracts, and the development of a lively media, have transformed the country.</p><p>This is not to say Kenya is perfect – far from it. A multinational forensic investigation currently under way – including with British agents – will examine the tragedy and assess the government's response to it. It shows the extent of our openness that we allow foreign security forces to share in an investigation we could probably manage ourselves.</p><p>At the same time, we will strive to be as open as possible in our actions against al-Qaida and its regional ally al-Shabaab in the coming months, without compromising the security of our country and the safety of our military personnel.</p><p>It is important that there is responsible international reporting. In this age of budget cuts in the international media there are too few foreign journalists with expert experience of Africa living in and reporting from the continent. Kenya suffered a terrible tragedy at Westgate. As information is released in the coming days and weeks, it is crucial – for the sake of the victims and the survivors – that reporting reflects the Kenya of today, and that we are judged by today's reality, not memories of a Kenya past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179702|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|93dbcb21324e39417e66a4a610b3dd331f4f418c -->",

        "headline":"Women: naked realities",
        "body":"<p>Barely a week goes by without a row over whether women should take their clothes off, keep them on or be allowed to cover up completely. Last week, singer Sinéad O'Connor became the latest to offer a view, writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\" title=\"\">an open letter to teen sensation Miley Cyrus</a> advising her not to be so frequently or conspicuously naked lest she allow the music business to act as her \"pimp\".</p><p>On university campuses this term, student unions have been attempting to hold back what they see as a tide of casual misogyny by banning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/20/robin-thicke-blurred-lines-ban\" title=\"\">Robin Thicke's hit Blurred Lines</a>, with lyrics described by one critic as \"rapey\".</p><p>The campaign to persuade the Sun newspaper to drop its topless models has, by contrast, studiously avoided talk of a ban. <a href=\"http://nomorepage3.org/\" title=\"\">No More Page Three</a> wants Rupert Murdoch voluntarily to put the naked \"lovelies\" out of their misery. Nevertheless, the campaigners have been hampered by many public figures immediately assuming that to voice disapproval of Page 3 might associate them with an illiberal wish to introduce censorship.</p><p>Might our nervousness about returning to the days when the lord chancellor could stride on to the stage to stop an objectionable play have made us too tolerant of publishers, musicians and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10355275/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-is-designed-deliberately-to-degrade-women.html\" title=\"\">video game designers </a>who trade in images of women that many find degrading and even dehumanising? Because, for good or ill, the female body and its drapery remains territory where we do battle over our ideas of liberty as well as specific examples of personal choice. \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c782x\" title=\"\">This is a free country</a>,\" David Cameron asserted last week, promising in the next breath full backing to institutions that wish to forbid Muslim women from wearing the niqab, or full-face veil.</p><p>Excessive interference? Or an uncomfortable reminder that the UK's laudable ideal of tolerance and religious freedom has led, in some cases, to moral relativism – a blindness to injustices and injuries that undermine those very freedoms that we cherish, particularly for women. The idea of \"a national debate\" is often decried as a thin disguise, a veil if you like, to partially conceal intolerant ideas. But in these three very different cases – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/sep/20/how-many-wear-niqab-uk\" title=\"\">the still-rare niqab</a>, the daily diet of Page 3 \"lovelies\", and the monotonously omnipresent naked females in popular music – we should keep the conversation alive about our cultural discomforts.</p><p>We applaud Ms O'Connor, the No More Page Three campaigners and Mr Cameron for at least questioning the values of organised religion and commercial entertainment: but no blanket prohibitions, please. Rather, let us have an open discussion – initiated and led by the UK's female citizens, and not merely prompted by some Las Vegas shock merchant making shareable pop videos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419202270|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|ffd617b87b4b1f4974e74b5c64f60a32b457d9dc -->",

        "headline":"Help to Buy: George's marvellous medicine",
        "body":"<p>This Tuesday George Osborne will make arguably his most significant economic intervention since the austerity budget of June 2010. Sadly, it has all the makings of being just as big an error. Like his cuts plan, Mr Osborne's extension of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a> comes with an economic justification but is driven by political motivation. The political imperative was again made clear last week when David Cameron, rattled by Ed Miliband's energy-price cap, decided to bring forward the launch of the scheme from next year to this week. For the austerity Conservatives, this is about being seen to be on the voters' side. By no means is this a new theme, but it has taken on an added sharpness and urgency after the conferences.</p><p>It is in this light that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/10343793/Help-to-Buy-Key-questions-answered.html\" title=\"\">the coalition's new mortgage market booster</a> should be seen. Until this week, the government's Help to Buy scheme allowed first-time buyers to borrow up to 20% of the value of a new-build home from the government, interest-free for the first five years. The Treasury justified this policy as both helping would-be homeowners on to the housing ladder, and spurring on Barratt's and other giant construction firms to do more building. These explanations cannot apply to this latest extension of Help to Buy.</p><p>As of this week, any household – whether first-time or not – will be able to get help buying any kind of home, whether the paint is still drying or it has been around since George&nbsp;II, worth up to £600,000, as long as they can get together a deposit of 5% of the property value. The government will then provide a guarantee to the mortgage lender of a further 15% of the value. On Tuesday Mr Osborne will lay out further details – such as how much the guarantee will cost lenders (a cost which they&nbsp;will presumably recoup from the customers in higher borrowing rate). And after that, going by what housing market analysts are already saying about interest from would-be buyers, there may well be clouds of dust on British high streets as punters rush to their local estate agents.</p><p>Nearly a quarter-century on from the Lawson boom, stoked by another Conservative chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/03/uk-economic-boom-could-be-boomlet\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne may well succeed in creating his own boomlet</a>. It may be patchy, it might be temporary, and it may well be dangerous. But the Tories surely hope that it will give them a fighting chance at the next general election, because electoral calculation runs through this policy like words on a stick of rock. Consider: the average price of a property across Britain is £172,000. Yet the government is underwriting purchases on homes worth up to £600,000.</p><p>It may be cynical to suggest that the cap has been set so high to entice wavering voters in key marginals in the pricier property markets of London and the south-east; then again, it may be blunt common sense. One group who will not benefit from Mr Osborne's £12bn intervention are those who cannot save up the 5% deposit. To help them, the government would need to either: improve regulations on landlords and lettings agents (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/letting-agents-cowboy-and-cowboy\" title=\"\">when ministers are doing the opposite</a>); provide more social or public housing (some hope); or allow property prices to come down from what remain their stratospheric highs. This policy doesn't help the first two objectives, and it positively blocks the last. Instead, it will push a few more Britons up the housing ladder and then yank that ladder away from the estimated 20% who'll have to fight it out in the underregulated private rented sector.</p><p>From the chancellor who inveighed against Labour's culture of debt and the government that vowed to focus on rebalancing the economy, Help to Buy smacks either of hypocrisy or an admission of defeat. If it works, this policy will get economic growth by luring households to borrow more and pump up Britain's historic housing bubble. What's more, it will subsidise banks to lend on property rather than productive enterprise. Encouraging debt rather than creating jobs, Help to Buy poses as a vote-winner. Perhaps, but it is also an economic dead end.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201408|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|12be58408c56e31bd3516c8245bdde5d5300e1cb -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Eddie would go!\" This is the line surfers use to encourage one another to tackle big waves and show some bravado. Eddie Aikau was an Hawaiian lifeguard and fearless surfer who died on duty in 1978 aged 31, and whose achievements are celebrated in <a href=\"http://xgames.espn.go.com/surfing/article/9749881/legend-eddie-aikau-premieres-espn-films-30-30\" title=\"\">a new documentary</a>, Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau. In 10 years, he made more than 500 rescues in Waimea Bay. No lives were lost under his watch, though he often had to brave monstrous 9ft waves. A dedicated peacemaker, he also worked tirelessly to break up fights between the Australian and US surfing teams. In the 1980s, shortly after his death, the sport morphed into a heavily branded multimillion-dollar industry: all logos and big money. But stripped from those artifices, surfing remains much more than just an athletic endeavour: it's a practice that teaches you to be respectful of the environment, courageous in the face of danger, and compassionate towards others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201222|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|95384003b60e09246a085b7ad9e2ef2a9d6f7920 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Stronger oversight\" is frequently demanded as a way of reassuring people about the spying activities and conduct of GCHQ. The problem is that trust has been lost in the current mechanisms: parliament's <a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">intelligence and security committee (ISC)</a> lacks the necessary knowledge and experience and is woefully under-resourced; the interception and intelligence commissioners have a limited remit and are also reluctant to challenge the spooks; senior politicians who sign warrants are unlikely to have the necessary background to ask tough questions, particularly in relation to the effects of changing technologies.</p><p>Some tightening of UK and EU data protection laws may be desirable but, in the end, who wants to be going to the courts all the time?</p><p>The key bits of the two most important pieces of legislation in this area, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) and the Intelligence Services Act, will always require flexible interpretation. There is no perfect oversight solution – any new regime will still lack total transparency – and will involve individuals, almost certainly with high levels of security clearance, sitting in secret.</p><p>But it is important to ask: what do we want oversight to achieve? Similarly, it is necessary to test the current assessment of the threat and whether this justifies the levels of agencies current intrusion (and expenditure).</p><p>It is worth noting there have been fewer than 60 mainland deaths from domestic terrorism since 1989. In 2005, when 52 people died in the London bombings, another 3,201 died in traffic accidents. Is terrorism the persistent existential threat so often used to justify whole-population surveillance?</p><p></p><p></p><p>While it might be desirable for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption\" title=\"\">GCHQ to \"master the internet\"</a>, the range and extent of material now available for harvesting, plus the ease of large-scale data mining, changes the intrusion equation. Is \"you never know, all this data might be useful someday\" a good enough reason to initiate large schemes for mass collection? And do we really think that intrusion only occurs when globally collected data is actually searched?</p><p>There are circumstances when encryption must be broken but, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden's revelations</a>, trust in e-commerce, e-banking and routine business confidentiality precautions, all reliant on crypto and all essential to the economy, is under threat. Who understands and tests GCHQ's judgments on the balance of risk in these matters?</p><p>There is probably not a perfect oversight regime to satisfy all the competing interests, but there is great scope for improvements. In my view, ministers should retain operational authorisation for agency activities – but warrants for interception, including the broad-based section 8(4) Ripa \"certificated\" warrants – should be passed for approval to a court, with short-term provision for retrospective warrant-granting in emergencies. The government should publish an annual fact-based national threat assessment rather than the current simplistic references to \"moderate\", \"substantial\" and \"severe\".</p><p>The ISC should become a proper select committee of the Commons and Lords with no pre-nomination by the prime minister and preferably with a robust chair person. It should have extended permanent staff, including a privacy advocate and academic technical experts not drawn from the intelligence community. And the ISC should hold at least one public session a year with the heads of the agencies and also with key ministers who should provide full, candid information in secret sessions.</p><p>In addition, all future annual ISC reports should cover the changing strategic objectives of agencies and address issues such as transparency, value for money, impact of technological change and commentary on intrusion limitation. The committee should have powers to demand access without the current limitation of potential ministerial veto, as well as the power of no-notice visits.</p><p>The intelligence service commissioners should be given more resources and be authorised to publish the types, purpose and quantity of the interception warrants that have been approved. Meanwhile, GCHQ should also follow the NSA and appoint a civil liberties and privacy officer to advise on all aspects of strategy. Snowden's documents provided details of what the agencies can and are seeking to do. Now that some of that detail is in the public domain GCHQ can, paradoxically, be more candid in discussing some of its activities and judgements. And, rather than concentrating on Snowden's \"traitorous\" nature, perhaps the debate should now turn on ways to achieve greater public support and legitimacy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419184619|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|28ab6bcd5debd5d130a0716fb5cc978eeda8550b -->",

        "headline":"Scientists do speak up, but politicians decide policy",
        "body":"<p>George Monbiot likens me to a dictator who has \"shut down programmes that produce unwelcome findings and sought to muzzle scientists\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/scientists-democracy-dissent-reasonable-boyd\" title=\"\">Muzzle scientists, bin data: this is the new Lysenkoism, 1 October</a>). He goes on to say that \"this is a modern version of Soviet Lysenkoism: crushing academic dissent on behalf of bad science and corporate power\". Nothing can be further from the truth.</p><p>Monbiot selectively quotes me: \"Scientists should be 'the voice of reason, rather than dissent, in the public arena'. Vladimir Putin? Kim Jong-un? No, Professor Ian Boyd,\" he says. The article to which he refers clearly explains that it is indeed the scientist's job to explain their field of work to the public and to ensure that any uncertainties are made clear. This most definitely involves scientists speaking up and the need for transparency in government. The point I was making, which Monbiot obviously didn't grasp, was that it is not their job to make politicians' decisions for them – when scientists start providing opinions about whether policies are right or wrong they risk becoming politicised. A politicised scientist cannot also be an independent scientist.</p><p>\"To be reasonable, when a government is manipulating and misrepresenting scientific findings, is to dissent,\" Monbiot says. But his adversarial politicisation of science is not the solution. Instead, the scientific community needs to understand its role in the complex field of policymaking to ensure that its contribution can be maximised. This means sticking to the scientific evidence and clearly explaining the risk associated with different policy options. It does not mean passing off personal opinion as scientific evidence.</p><p>Monbiot says the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs \"claimed that its field trials of neonicotinoid pesticides on bees showed that 'effects on bees do not occur under normal circumstances'. Hopelessly contaminated, the study was in fact worthless.\" He assumed the government (and implicitly I) had based its position on a single study. This is emphatically not true. It was based on a balanced assessment of all the available scientific evidence. The view arrived at was that the evidence behind the proposed ban of certain neonicotinoid pesticides was poor. Of course, lack of evidence does not amount to lack of impact. But we have little evidence that a ban will eliminate the problems Monbiot believes exist.</p><p>Last, Monbiot questions the link between badgers and bovine tuberculosis. He picks on only one part of a broad evidence base, suggesting figures we have been using have \"been sexed up from inadequate data\". Epidemiological modelling, based on data from <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.badger.org.uk%2F_Attachments%2FResources%2F322_S4.pdf&amp;ei=Y4dRUqr0L4OY0AXyp4GADw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtTi5TpepP4ZkD5-BC1PLBCBzAgQ&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.d2k&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">the Randomised Badger Culling Trial</a>, suggests badgers account for about 50% of bovine TB occurrences in the areas where it is prevalent. There is uncertainty around this number but particular genetic strains of the disease exist in badgers and cattle in the same geographic location. The trial also showed that reducing the density of badgers reduces TB in cattle. Badgers are a part of the disease cycle of bovine TB. However, it is possible to pursue quite different policy options. If scientists start to say one or other option is right or wrong, they begin to take the position of politicians and devalue the scientific evidence they claim to present.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189765|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|5a67b2a3cbbc36ad8fdf09e8cd9ddf0089504dd7 -->",

        "headline":"The US government shutdown is a playground spat that badly damages credibility",
        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|1d5226d3d704630c88921b684a5006897c145d13 -->",

        "headline":"Prism and Tempora: the cabinet was told nothing of the surveillance state's excesses",
        "body":"<p>I received a letter last week from a very senior civil servant warning me not to reveal in this column any \"privileged information\" acquired as a minister. But I have a revelation of another kind to make. Readers would be shocked not by what ministers know when they are taking decisions, but by what they do not know, and are not told.</p><p>When it comes to the secret world of GCHQ and the US National Security Agency (NSA), the depth of my \"privileged information\" has been dwarfed by the information provided by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> to the Guardian. The cabinet was told nothing about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">GCHQ's Tempora</a> or the NSA's Prism, or about their extraordinary capability to vacuum up and store personal emails, voice contact, social networking activity and even internet searches.</p><p>I was also on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-security/groups/national-security-council\" title=\"\">National Security Council</a>, attended by ministers and the heads of the secret and security services, GCHQ and the military. If anyone should have been briefed on Prism and Tempora, it should have been the NSC. I do not know whether the prime minister or the foreign secretary (who has oversight of GCHQ) were briefed, but the NSC was not.</p><p>This lack of information, and therefore accountability, is a warning that the supervision of our intelligence services needs as much updating as their bugging techniques. The state should not feel itself entitled to know, see and memorise everything that the private citizen communicates. We cannot even rely on incompetence as a bulwark for our freedoms. The state increasingly has the capability to retain everything as the cost of computer memory collapses.</p><p>I have been shocked but also mystified by Snowden's revelations. Throughout my time in parliament, the Home Office was trying to persuade politicians to invest in \"upgrading\" Britain's capability to recover data showing who is emailing and phoning whom. Yet this seems to be exactly what GCHQ was already doing. Was the Home Office trying to mislead?</p><p>The latest name for its super-surveillance project is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/23/woolwich-nick-clegg-communications-bill-risk\" title=\"\">communications data bill</a>, touted by the home secretary, Theresa May, and stalled by Nick Clegg. It comes with a £1.8bn price tag, so this is no small decision either politically or financially.</p><p>At present, police, tax staff and others can ask communications providers for records of the contact between a suspect and other people. They are not allowed to intercept the content of the calls without a warrant signed by a secretary of state, but they can analyse the listing of numbers and the duration of calls – as you get on your phone bill – to search for gangs, drug dealers or terrorists.</p><p>The weak Blair-Blunkett era safeguards on these trawls need only the approval of a police inspector, and there are more than half a million a year. The sign-off should be tougher. After all, information that someone is calling Alcoholics Anonymous or the Samaritans may be embarrassing and damaging, although neither illegal nor suspicious. Information is power, and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom. If GCHQ cannot keep its own secrets, what price keeping yours or mine?</p><p>Of course, investigators find this who-calls-whom data useful, and want the communications data bill because more calls are being made outside the traditional telecoms providers, often through non-UK outfits such as Viber and Skype. The Home Office argued that we need a new law to make these providers retain records – including emails and phone calls – to provide to the police and MI5.</p><p>The civil liberties implications are nauseating, but my inner economist also doubts this government IT project could come in on budget and specification. How long would it take the bad guys to switch to services in the 15% of all contacts not covered by the programme? Would we spend all that money merely to keep tabs on the lawful and the stupid? But the question is not the risk-reward balance of the Home Office programme, but why it needs the communications data bill at all. GCHQ and the NSA are tapping into the fibre-optic superhighways, collecting and storing not just the who-calls-whom data but the communications themselves.</p><p>Some of the explanations for this political mystery are not pretty. Maybe GCHQ is not as confident as it claims about the legality of what it has been doing. Maybe it has even been jurisdiction-swapping (though it denies this). Under this long-suspected arrangement, GCHQ would bug people that the NSA wants to bug, but is not allowed to do so because they are Americans. And the NSA would return the favour. Both could then protest their lawfulness.</p><p>There are other explanations. Maybe GCHQ is not as capable as its now-leaked boasts claim: every public body has a budget to protect. Or it might have been embarrassing, pre-Snowden, to admit to GCHQ's capability, so maybe the securicrats thought that £1.8bn was a modest price to duplicate what they were already doing. I doubt, though, that hard-pressed taxpayers would agree.</p><p>Whatever the explanation, the Home Office was happy to allow the NSC and the cabinet – along with parliament – to remain in utter ignorance of Prism/Tempora while deciding on the communications data bill. The Snowden revelations put a giant question mark into the middle of our surveillance state. It is time our elected representatives insisted on some answers before destroying the values we should protect.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187762|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|e76e0b3cb6d7782da2fc0a8b2ea108e10d2c7542 -->",

        "body":"<p>Navy seals storm ashore on Brighton beach. They race to a murky boarding house and bundle its occupants into a Mercedes and rush them to a ship offshore. Don't worry, they tell passers by, they are terrorists. The innocent have nothing to fear. What would we think? The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-special-forces-libya-somalia\" title=\"\">US attacks on Somalia and Libya </a>over the weekend were against lawless parts of the world that harbour dangerous people intent, so we are told, on causing mayhem outside their borders. Someone needs to deal with them. Yet both these countries have been subject to massive western intervention, supposedly to set them on the path to democracy and good order. As with the failed Somalian kidnap, something went wrong there too.</p><p>The attempt to curb international violence is taking ever newer forms. In Britain the centralisation of crime-fighting has been a bad joke for years, as the Home Office invents one \"British FBI\" after another. It has splurged money on bureaucrats, while the frontline is cut back. This week the government has invented yet another body, the £450m <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/national-crime-agency-theresa-may-europol-keith-bristow\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>, with the crass motto \"We instil fear\".</p><p>The reality is that ordinary policing of terrorism in most European countries has a decent record. There have been no serious terrorist massacres in Britain since 2005. The US seems equally safe. The stories that have emerged suggest this is largely the result of local tip-offs and good intelligence work rather than any drastic extension of police powers or global derring-do.</p><p>All the best police work is local. The best tip-offs are local, the best knowledge is local. It was a failure of local intelligence in Pakistan that meant it took the Americans more than a decade to find Osama bin Laden. The future of western security lies not in the courage of special forces or the deployment of drone squadrons and snatch squads. It lies in dogged police work, and in not provoking or abusing the sovereignty of countries that may so readily offer refuge and support to terrorists.</p><p>If one thing has been proved beyond a doubt, the surest way to endanger the west is to proliferate the hamfisted interventions that have made Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere a ready refuge for those who want to take revenge on westerners. To go crashing about the world arresting and doubtless mistreating suspects is a desperate throw. It makes good headlines but it does no good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419231327|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|f6d28659359cad54f33fdf4408c1f44b38b1e46e -->",

        "headline":"I'd much rather be a slag than a slut",
        "body":"<p>Last week I got asked to speak at an event called <a href=\"http://www.run-riot.com/think/slut-night-other-club\" title=\"\">Slut Night</a>, at a new venture called The Other Club in central London. Organised by some bright young feminists, Slut Night sold out surprisingly fast, as it offered various female writers and performers talking explicitly about the joys of sluttishness. The fanny jokes ran as freely as the wine; it was a right laugh. But when I first heard the name of the event, my immediate reaction was, ugh. That word. Slut. No.</p><p>My immediate reaction should probably have been more specifically – ugh, slut is a grubby little insult and I want no part of it. Ugh, slut is used to pass judgment on women's desires, their social life, the tightness of fabric around their bum, and I'm not interested in trying to reclaim that degree of damage because language reclamation is a pseudo-alchemy and no abusive thing ever turned into a good thing because you sucked the poison out of the sting yourself. Also, ugh, sluttishness – if sexual promiscuity is as emancipatory as I used to think it was, then how come it could only ever emancipate me in cahoots with tequila, kebabs and a really uncomfortable feeling when anyone used highly stressful words such as \"commitment\" or \"love\"?</p><p>But no, my immediate reaction was: ugh, no to sluts – I'd much rather be a slag. You know where you are with the word slag. You are, in my mind, in the closing scene of the greatest film ever made, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091859/\" title=\"\">Rita, Sue and Bob Too</a>, written by the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/12/theatre\" title=\"\">Andrea Dunbar</a> and filmed in 1980s Bradford.</p><p>This is a spoiler, so look away now if you haven't yet seen the greatest film ever made. It closes with the two teenagers, Rita and Sue, lying in Bob's bed. His wife has left him because he's been sneaking off and shagging these schoolgirls in his car. The girls' home lives have fallen apart, too, so one after the other, they've moved in with him. Yes, this is all very creepy, and nobody's saying it's a film that depicts a utopian model of living to which we should all aspire. It's grim. Still, after everything has gone really, horribly wrong, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9-79fHwqpM\" title=\"\">there is a moment of sheer joy when Bob finds them both in his bed and dives right into it</a>. They all beam with happiness. The film ends there – on that dive – a moment of joy that we know can't and won't last. The pure joy of being a slag – as the other characters in the film have already labelled them – Bob, of course, being the biggest slag of them all.</p><p>Why I like slag so much is not because I want to cast aspersions on people's sexual shenanigans, but because it has now become a great all-round handy insult. If you're not convinced, look how skilfully the actor Danny Dyer once deployed the term to discuss terrorism. \"Can't believe it's been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,\" <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/danny-dyer-calls-911-attackers-slags-on-twitter/285600\" title=\"\">he tweeted on 11 September 2012</a>. \"It still freaks my nut out to this day.\"</p><p>Still, I should admit here that my fondness for the word slag doesn't always end well for me. I still shudder with guilt when I think of the time I tweeted a friend and told her to bring another friend, \"that slag\", with her to my house. As a joke. It's a word we use between ourselves, fondly. Only, when I tagged the slag friend, I got her Twitter name slightly wrong and accidentally directed the message to a total stranger with a similar name – who turned out to be a 15-year-old girl in a coma. Whose Twitter account was being run by her loving dad to raise awareness of his daughter's condition. All he could see was that London journalists were insulting his sick child – it took quite a lot of explanation to dig my way out of that one and apologise. Possibly not helped by my friend tweeting him and saying: \"No, you don't understand, it was definitely meant for me and not your daughter, because I really am a massive, massive slag.\"</p><p>I recently met a media studies lecturer who told me he uses #slaggate as an example for his students of how not to use Twitter. Oh God.</p><p>Still, slut feels like a very American word – even if British grandmothers did use it to describe a messy woman who left things on her bedroom floor, not a woman who left her knickers on other people's bedroom floors. Slut is now a word for online porn ads, popping up all over your screen saying that horny sluts with breasts like balloons and buttocks like boiled eggs would like to live-chat with you now.</p><p>Indeed, it turned out that the Slut Night I went to was not about praising the word at all. As the organiser Amelia Abraham explained: \"The goal isn't to reclaim the word 'slut'; it's to completely undermine it.\"</p><p>Slutwalks, organised in cities across the world in defence of women dressing how they want without fear of assault, received criticism from some feminists who felt the word was wrong. I realise they were named after the exact words of a Canadian policeman, but still – I'd probably have gone if they were called slagwalks instead. Let's not put the word slag on the linguistic slagheap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100719|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|9367850b16b6979360333ff03cdb47da9b368e3d -->",

        "headline":"NHS England is finally taking expert advice – from the patients",
        "body":"<p>Why don't we listen to Jonathan? We listen to politicians, doctors, nurses' trade union leaders, commentators and academics … but we don't listen to Jonathan. Jonathan is the ultimate health expert. He has had kidney failure for 30 years, has spent 14 years on dialysis and is currently on his fourth kidney transplant. If you want to know about managing kidney conditions, he's your man. Yet it has taken 30 years for someone to ask him what his views are.</p><p>Look away now because – shock, horror – this is a good news story. At last he and people like him have been advising the country's top health professionals and administrators on how to shape the health service of the future.</p><p>Jonathan, and 13 other people with a long-term medical conditions, ranging from permanent paralysis through incurable bowel disease to severe heart problems, have been  part of a \"people's panel\", attending a two-day conference last week on the way the NHS needs to change.</p><p>There have been, of course, endless conferencesut in the past one thing has been missing: the patients. Yet now for Dr Martin McShane, the director of long-term conditions for NHS England, patients' voices are needed for what he calls the \"radically new approach\" in the NHS. <a href=\"http://www.futureofhealth.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Future of Health</a>, organised by NHS England along with UCL Partners and the political information company Dods, brought together more than a thousand experts to hear the views of the \"people's panel\".</p><p>The need for change is obvious. According to McShane, 70% of current health spending goes on the 15 million people in England who suffer from one or more long-term conditions. The twin challenges of people living longer and with unhealthier lifestyles (smoking, alcohol, obesity) means that number is set to increase dramatically. It's called modern life.</p><p>For many of those with a long-term condition, it is not about \"getting better\". That won't happen. It's about managing the condition as well as possible, with the right support, the right medication and the right medical conversation.  And according to the \"people's panel\", that's rare.</p><p>Listen to Anya, who had to drop out of Cambridge where she was studying medicine when she developed a neurological condition: \"There's too much talk about clinical pathways, what we need are real pathways.\" Anya strongly supports self-management of long-term diseases, but this is only possible where the patients' needs are seen as more than just a clinical issue.</p><p>That means bringing the Cinderellas of the healthcare system – mental health and social care – much higher up the agenda. Dementia is all around us – you could almost call it the new cancer. Depression, unsurprisingly, follows incurable illness like a faithful dog. Help around the house, to perform the most basic tasks, can make the difference between someone really living and someone merely being kept alive.</p><p>Patients spot the simple things that can make a difference, such as a new ward for people undergoing the transition to rehabilitation; better curtains for privacy; less absurd form-filling (is it necessary to ask a 63-year-old whether she's on the contraceptive pill?).</p><p>During the course of the conference, NHS professionals had many Homer Simpson \"doh\" moments. One professor admitted he finally understood that self-management was about the patient trying to regain control, and that quality of life was the important thing. Doctors were asked to commit to spending five minutes a day talking to \"a person\" rather than seeing people as just \"patients\". Co-production is the new watchword, getting patients at every level to design services.</p><p>McShane's \"doh\" moment was realising that it's not just what goes on in hospital that is important. That's the sexy part, the bit that hospital dramas focus on. \"I was a surgeon for nine years, heroically striding around in green scrubs,\" he says, \"but all of that is futile if it's not followed up when the patient leaves hospital.\" That's just one of the challenges he has promised to report back to the people's panel on in six months' time.</p><p>All credit must go to NHS England for its bravery in staging such an event. It is the first time I have heard the most senior health professionals in the country being blasted by patients, rather than lecturing to attentive audiences. But there is still a long way to go.</p><p>Unhappily, the patients were not involved in planning the conference, so long distances had to be walked, an over-full programme left no time for rest and many of those involved had to spend a couple of days recovering.</p><p>This is real news. The pathetic point-scoring spat between health secretary Jeremy Hunt and his opposite number, Andy Burnham, over a past hospital scandal is dominating the headlines. But the health challenges this country faces are huge, complex, intractable; and away from the barneys and bluster, good work is being done. Jonathan and his friends are being heard.</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/JackieAshley\" title=\"\"><em>Twitter: @JackieAshley</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419188273|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|2d874444e9118da26f5288bbd38377aa6b9c59fc -->",

        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|1d5226d3d704630c88921b684a5006897c145d13 -->",

Likewise, I suspect everyone's internal concept of a crocodile is based on <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=quentin+blake+crocodile&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=vST&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VkpRUt3gO8ir0gXP4IHQAg&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017&amp;dpr=1\" title=\"\">Quentin Blake</a>'s iconic shape (he obviously loves drawing them, as they pop up everywhere).</p><p>For me, it is that image of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Lucy+and+Mr+Tumnus&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZU5RUvb_K9ST0AW6v4DYBQ&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017&amp;dpr=1\" title=\"\">Lucy and Mr Tumnus</a>, heads bent together in conversation as they walk, with armfuls of brown paper parcels, onwards, past the lamppost, to a place I can never go, which is seared on my heart.</p><p>The wonderful new exhibition at the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/picturethis/index.html\" title=\"\">British Library, Picture This: Children's Illustrated Classics</a>, traces the development of illustrations for children through 10 pivotal texts, including The Railway Children and the Paddington Bear books. Mr and Mrs Brown are, apparently, clearly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Michael-Bond/e/B001H6NIBE\" title=\"\">Michael Bond</a>'s real parents, though any recent purchasers will know that something has been tweaked in Paddington, in a mysterious fashion that makes him both more and less himself (there are updated electronic signs at the station, for example). To the generation reading the books aloud, this is a discombobulating experience.</p><p>There is Peter Pan, the cruel boy dressed in leaves, so closely described in the novel that he varies little over the decades. Conversely, there is Willy Wonka, who looms more or less terrifyingly depending on the mood of the day – the first edition, illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Joseph+Schindelman&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IktRUtiQMa-Z0QWX_YCYAg&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017&amp;dpr=1\" title=\"\">Joseph Schindelman</a> in 1964, depicts a frankly horrifying elf sitting on Charlie's arm. And there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Man_%28novel%29\" title=\"\">The Iron Man</a> – it was a surprise to me to learn that what I had always thought of as the definitive sombre robot wasn't drawn (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-24387013\" title=\"\">by Andrew Davidson</a>) until nearly 20 years after the book was published with artwork by George Adamson.</p><p>Alas, missing is that deep wellspring of fantasy for girls of a certain age: the classic Ladybird Well-Loved Tales series, with its immaculately oil-painted 1960s hair; the Elves and the Shoemaker's dainty shoes; the three shiny dresses of Cinderella; the bewitching tresses of Snow White and Rose Red. These books currently start at about £20 a pop on eBay, their appeal never quite matched by the cheaper, faster line drawings of recent editions.</p><p>The curator of the exhibition, Matthew Eve, has pointed out how few of the illustrators were married or had families of their own. It is a truism to talk of how many people in children's literature are not particularly fond of the blighters, and equally difficult not to speculate that the success of their work has a lot to do with their refusal to pander. They simply do not care about not frightening children or wanting to keep them too safe, in the way that parents must.</p><p>By ignoring this, by creating their own towering worlds, they give children the space and freedom they truly crave for their imaginations to roam, before they come home to be fretted and worried over. Children will always risk a nightmare as long as there is somebody there to soothe them when they wake.</p><p>For after all, every child knows – certainly by the 10th, 20th, 100th reading – that there are dangers aplenty in Narnia, in Middle Earth, in Neverland, in the Chocolate Factory. And yet every child (and every invalid, and every captive) would still go, would vanish into that book, in a heartbeat, in a second</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419178213|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|aa92c0ef0c164db1a53d981c66af49483e778e41 -->",
