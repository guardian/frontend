He was the first major composer who was not a servant, either of an aristocrat, or of the Church. The idea of the artist as hero, of the work of art being a triumph of the human will over adversity (and Beethoven had his fair share), was an utterly Beethovenian one. He pushed this idea beyond art and onto the world stage, in the fight against tyranny and for human freedom. The two Beethoven pieces in this concert are firmly in this heroic mould.</p> <p>Beethoven&apos;s overture to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egmont_%28play%29\" title=\"\">Goethe&apos;s play </a> about Count Egmont&apos;s unsuccessful attempts to free the Netherlands from Spanish oppression carries this message of freedom so powerfully that it was adopted as the unofficial musical symbol of the 1956 Hungarian uprising against the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The overture begins in dark vein, as F minor string chords punch out an oppressively heavy rhythm, countered by plaintive cries of pain in the winds. These musical motives battle it out in a stormy central section until, ultimately light and right triumph.</p> <h2><br />Benjamin Britten: Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra</h2> <p>Benjamin Britten was much less concerned with the idea of the artist as hero as he was with the desire for his music to be useful. The commission to write a piece of music for a film that introduced the instruments of the orchestra to an audience of children might have been, in other hands, a dry and worthy exercise, but Britten&apos;s turned out an exuberant masterpiece in his Young Person&apos;s Guide. The first good choice he made was to structure the piece as a set of variations on a majestic, minor key theme by Henry Purcell, taken from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OPO3ORYgOo\" title=\"\">Purcell&apos;s incidental music to Aphra Behn&apos;s play The Moor&apos;s Revenge</a>. After introducing the theme, Britten&apos;s variations one by one, show off what the orchestral sections can do, starting from the highest woodwinds, going down through strings and brass and ending with a great dance for the percussion section. Then, in the climactic masterstroke, he brings all the instrumental groups back, one by one, in a scurrying fugue (fugue meaning a musical game of chase). <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HhTMJ2bek0&amp;feature=related#t=15m45s\" title=\"\">The moment when the big Purcell theme comes blazing back in the brass</a> with all of the other instruments still skirling around it might just be the most ecstatically joyful moment in all music.<br /><em><br /><strong>25-minute interval </strong></em></p> <h2><br />Beethoven: Eroica Symphony (No3)</h2> <p>Beethoven&apos;s Heroic Symphony was written as a defiant and life-affirming statement immediately following a major crisis in his life when, unable to fight his encroaching deafness, <a href=\"http://www.beethovenseroica.com/Pg2_hist/history.html\" title=\"\">he had written his will and contemplated suicide</a>. This daring symphony was longer, louder, more dissonant and contained more extremes of sound and of mood than any symphony to date. In keeping with its grand ambition, Beethoven originally dedicated it to Napoleon, but the manuscript <a href=\"http://etonmess.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/beethoven-eroica.jpg\" title=\"\">clearly shows where he violently scrubbed out the name of his former hero</a> on learning that he had declared himself &quot;Emperor&quot;.</p> <p>The Eroica is in four movements, following the classic Beethovenian journey from darkness into light. The first is a tour de force of emotional narrative, of contrasts and extremes, with violent mood swings, in which the opening rocking melody is quickly transformed into music which is more dark, dramatic and defiant. Beethoven allows the dark side to triumph in the second movement, a funeral march which seems to pre-shadow Mahler, and which treads an inexorable, minor key path towards a terrifying, loud climax before retreating back to a heartbreakingly fractured version of the original march. A demonic, fast dance (scherzo) breaks the mood in the third movement before giving way to the extraordinary finale. A tentative, plucked rhythm on the strings creeps in. The music builds up line by line, growing in confidence until the full orchestra blazes in with a broad, triumphant melody which Beethoven then uses as the basis of a set of exuberant variations.</p>","wordcount":"679","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2012-06-21T16:57:47Z","internalComposerCode":"5691bb7de4b0f2d1f22ba562","internalOctopusCode":"6331206","internalPageCode":"1763353","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-09-11T13:00:26Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-23T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/38fna","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/38fna"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/22/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-23-june-programme-notes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/22/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-23-june-programme-notes","webTitle":"Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra with Gustavo Dudamel - 23 June","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-22T08:52:00Z","sectionName":"Music","sectionId":"music","type":"article","id":"music/2012/jun/22/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-23-june-programme-notes","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","editions":[{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1764225","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-395980796","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/6/24/1340547920249/Dudamel-conducts-the-Simo-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Dudamel conducts the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra","caption":"Grounded in experience … Dudamel conducts the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra.

Performing two of the orchestral works with which Beethoven redefined the idea of music as an art, here was a grown-up orchestra offering themselves for comparison with the world&apos;s best.</p> <p>Yet for all that, the orchestra remains incomparable simply because its young members have grown up together. Their sound is given energy not by grandly conceived notions about the implicit nobility and virtue of the music they play, but by a knowledge, grounded in experience, that this music is creating a new world for them and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/20/dudamel-bolivar-sistema-raploch-bignoise\" title=\"\">can do for others</a>.</p> <p>I have heard more penetrating interpretations of the Eroica than this, but I&apos;ve never heard a performance in which the symphony&apos;s spirit – the embodiment of an idea of man as author of his own destiny – shone through with more brilliance and force. There were moments when Dudamel might have sought to extract more tension – the funeral march sagged, and the extraordinary decrescendo before the finale&apos;s last Presto explosion, in which flute and bassoon play chicken with the strings, could have gone further – but the quality and collective precision of the playing still raised the experience far above what is normally achieved with this work.</p> <p>Dudamel&apos;s instinctive virtuosity was better displayed in the Egmont Overture and in Britten&apos;s Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra, for which the stage was rammed full of players, including the 14 double-basses whose breathtaking clarity of tone completely overhauled the hall&apos;s dry acoustic. The grand opening and the extraordinary controlled collisions in Britten&apos;s closing fugue showed Dudamel at his best, just as the solo sections revealed the orchestra&apos;s extraordinary depth of talent (as well as Britten&apos;s exceptional ear for instrumental colour), giving the entire work a sense of dynamism and urgency I&apos;ve never heard in it before.</p> <p>The single encore was a beautifully voiced performance of Elgar&apos;s Nimrod – a tribute, Dudamel suggested, to a London audience now firmly part of the orchestra&apos;s history. As the ensuing 15-second silence proved, these inspirational musicians have certainly earned their place in ours.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"23","starRating":"4","wordcount":"374","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-24T09:59:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2012-06-24T09:59:39Z","internalComposerCode":"5691c074e4b0f2d1f22ba7fa","internalOctopusCode":"6339017","internalPageCode":"1764225","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-09-11T12:50:07Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/38hxt","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/38hxt"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/24/simon-bolivar-dudamel-review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/24/simon-bolivar-dudamel-review","webTitle":"Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra/Dudamel – review","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-24T10:16:00Z","sectionName":"Music","sectionId":"music","type":"article","id":"music/2012/jun/24/simon-bolivar-dudamel-review","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","editions":[{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1765052","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[],"tags":[{"id":"music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","type":"series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Dudamel and Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra - live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","references":[],"description":"Conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela perform at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London 2012 festival and the Southbank Centre's Sounds of Venezuela series.

They are separated by a century, and written by composers who, themselves, were born a century apart (Esteban Benzecry, born 1970 and Richard Strauss, born 1864). </p> <p>Although Dudamel and his orchestra have triumphantly made the mainstream European classical repertoire their own, they are also passionate champions of music by South American composers. The motivation behind Benzecry&apos;s Rituales Amerindios (American Indian Rituals) is, in the Argentinian composer&apos;s words, &quot;my wish to write something that would represent the three great pre-Columbian Latin-American cultures - the Aztec (in Mexico), the Mayan (in Southern Mexico and Central America) and Inca (mostly in Peru).&quot; </p> <p>In this 25-minute piece divided into three movements,. Benzecry skillfully uses the colours in his giant orchestra to depict nature, water, evocations of forests, thunder, as well as ritualistic dances. The opening movement is dedicated to Ehecati, the Aztec god of the wind. We hear a fanfare-type flourish which will turn up again in different guises in the other two movements. Chaac, the Mayan water god, inspires the second slow movement of the work, full of liquid percussion, including slides upwards on timpani, low marimba sounds and the miraculous noise of the rain-stick. Things get moving again in the last movement, with an evocation of the Inca thunder God Illapa: a storm gathers, rushing up through the orchestra which, this being Latin music, inevitably transforms itself into a dance.<br /> <br /><strong><em>25-minute interval</em></strong></p> <h2>Richard Strauss: An Alpine Symphony</h2> <p>Richard Strauss&apos;s gigantic Alpine Symphony is a very different hymn to nature - this is the complex and ecstatic relationship between man and nature, with no place for any Gods. Strauss revered Nietschze, (his most famous piece, Also Sprach Zarathursta, best known from Kubrick&apos;s 2001: A Space Odyssey) and only at the last minute did he think better of calling the symphony The Antechrist. </p> <p>The Alpine Symphony could be subtitled &quot;A Day in the Life of a Mountain&quot; and, throughout its unbroken 50-minute span, it shows Strauss the painter of musical pictures and the teller of stories at his blazing best. We start in the shadows of night. A descending scale creeps downwards through the orchestra, leaving a harmonic trail behind it suggesting, perhaps, the outline of a huge, dark mountain as it emerges from darkness. About three minutes in, the descending scale becomes a blazing, triumphant melody - the sun rising on the mountain. Moments later, Strauss introduces the bold human character with an energetic, upwards melody which he titles &quot;the climb&quot; in the score. Strauss uses his vast orchestra to depict the experiences of his character on the mountain: a distant hunting party (listen for the 12 offstage horns), waterfalls, meadows, a dark, threatening forest, losing the path, the triumphant view from the summit and the best storm in music since Rossini&apos;s William Tell Overture (listen out for the wind machine). But Strauss&apos;s painting of nature in sound is far from naïve and literal. By the time the dark music of night returns, we feel that through all of the dangers, the moments of being lost and the triumphant conquests, we have been on a rich psychological journey.</p>","wordcount":"550","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2012-06-26T10:42:45Z","internalComposerCode":"5691c972e4b0962b6cc02d95","internalOctopusCode":"1765052","internalPageCode":"1765052","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-06-26T12:59:18Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/38t58","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/38t58"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/26/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-26-june-programme-notes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-26-june-programme-notes","webTitle":"Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra with Gustavo Dudamel - 26  June","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-26T12:50:00Z","sectionName":"Music","sectionId":"music","type":"article","id":"music/2012/jun/26/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-26-june-programme-notes","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","editions":[{"id":"music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1765524","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-392253717","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2012/6/27/1340791224387/Gustavo-Dudamel-conducts--008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Gustavo Dudamel conducts the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra","caption":"'The playing was immaculate'.

It&apos;s also likely, however, to divide opinion. Even though the music pulverises, its eclecticism is also very apparent. The influence of Bartók, Stravinsky and, above all, Prokofiev in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL_69tdTn8Q\">primitivist-constructivist</a> mode is too overt. The playing dazzles, but the piece itself is at times unoriginal.</p> <p>Another enormous work, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Alpine_Symphony\">Strauss&apos;s Alpine Symphony</a> came after the interval. Once again, the decibel count was immense and the playing immaculate. Conducting from memory, Dudamel gave us a measured<br />interpretation that compensated for an occasional lack of excitement<br />at the start with some extraordinary things in the second half, where<br />Strauss uses extended chromatic suspensions to suggest the constantly<br />shifting perspectives with which he views natural landscapes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-392253718\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2012/6/27/1340791094817/Bryn-Terfel-with-the-Simo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bryn Terfel with the Simon Bolivar Orch/Dudamel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryn Terfel in old-fashioned Wotan gear, who made a surprise appearance for the encore.

He was appointed music director for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, while over the past few years he has guest-conducted for many of the world&apos;s leading orchestras and opera houses. </p> <p>Venezuela&apos;s El Sistema, meanwhile, has been successfully imported all over the world, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/20/dudamel-bolivar-sistema-raploch-bignoise\">not least in Scotland</a>, where last night <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/22/the-big-concert-review\">the London 2012 festival was launched by our very own Big Noise orchestra playing alongside their Venezuelan mentors</a>.</p> <p>Dudamel and his orchestra, the &quot;Youth&quot; of its name dropped now many of the players were heading for their 30s and beyond, returned to the Proms last year to play Mahler&apos;s second symphony, a work of great theatricality that played to the orchestra&apos;s strengths, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/06/prom-29-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-review\">as our reviewer noted</a>.

Now mainly in their early 30s, they have already played together for almost two decades. No one really knows how far, and in what ways, they will develop.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jun/21/simon-bolivar-orchestra-dudamel-beethoven?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">Tom Service points out </a>that their choice of repertoire, notably Beethoven&apos;s Eroica symphony (the climax of Saturday&apos;s Royal Festival Hall concert) leaves the players more exposed than their more usual choice of works. &quot;The thing with Beethoven, especially the Eroica, is that there&apos;s nowhere to hide, no gigantic perorations of brassy virtuosity to disguise any interpretative infelicities or flaws in the ensemble, as there can be in the barnstorming late-romantic and 20th-century repertoire the Simón Bolívars often play.&quot; </p> <p>Their two London concerts (23 and 26 June) sold out long since, but wherever you are in the world, you can watch them.

The come-hither intensity of the music and the teasing combination of apparent proximity but actual distance producing a frisson really worth savouring.</p> <p>When musician and audience want to, they can really egg each other on. But it doesn&apos;t happen that often, and when it comes to London audiences, the process can be tough, with English sangfroid mixing with the capital&apos;s dreaded sophistication. No wonder few make it past the first flirt. But witness Daniel Barenboim <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH9zXfblklI\" title=\"\">with his London fans</a> – whether in the Festival Hall or last year in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/09/daniel-barenboim-tate-turbine-hall\" title=\"\">surreal appearance in Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall</a> – and you see a master and his adoring audience at work. Together.</p> <p>The most powerful instance of this &quot;coupling&quot; that I can recall was on 19 August 2007, when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms\" title=\"\">Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela appeared in London</a> with their famous music director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gustavo-dudamel\" title=\"\">Gustavo Dudamel</a>. Inside the Albert Hall was a mindboggling frenzy. &quot;Absolutely the best EVER Proms night I have seen in 35 years.&quot; &quot;By far the most exhilarating and life-affirming concert I have ever experienced.&quot; &quot;The greatest Prom of all time.&quot; Those are just <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2007/interact/reviews/19aug.shtml\" title=\"\">a few from thousands of such comments online</a>. I asked Dudamel recently about his reactions to this concert. &quot;When we came here to London,&quot; he said, &quot;we experienced and we felt that warmth of the Proms. It was something we&apos;ve never forgotten.&quot;</p> <p>Not surprisingly, when Dudamel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/20/simon-bolivar-gustavo-dudamel-review\" title=\"\">returned to London in 2009 for a residency at the Southbank Centre</a>, there was an air of expectation. He didn&apos;t disappoint: 60,000 people mobbed the Bolívars that week, with not much letting up of the intensity from 2007. This time, instead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/dmitri-shostakovich\" title=\"\">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> and Leonard Bernstein&apos;s Mambo, they brought Béla Bartók, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pyotr-tchaikovsky\" title=\"\">Pyotr Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/igor-stravinsky\" title=\"\">Igor Stravinsky</a>. Plus Latin encores galore, performed in their <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/06/25/Bolivar460x276.jpg\" title=\"\">trademark brightly coloured jackets</a> that got twirled and thrown as the concerts gave way to on-stage parties that were more indie rock than classical. The love affair was still on, and with a week to enjoy it, even more passionate.</p> <p>Then, last summer, they returned to the Proms, and something odd happened. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/06/prom-29-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-review\" title=\"\">They played Gustav Mahler&apos;s monumental Resurrection symphony</a>. But now there were no coloured jackets, no madcap encore behaviour. Of course, this was Dudamel&apos;s well-placed reaction to the symphony. You don&apos;t follow a piece of that gravity with fun &quot;pop&quot; stuff. Yet it was fascinating watching some of the Proms audience who had turned up for the usual &quot;mambo-madness&quot; looking almost crestfallen at no fun to follow Mahler&apos;s triumphant resolution. Like all good programming there was something clever at play here: a concert revealing something deeper not just about the music but also the musicians.</p> <p>Dudamel and his orchestra are growing up. It&apos;s not just that they now wear the tailcoats of more established orchestras, or that they have changed their name from &quot;youth&quot; to &quot;symphony&quot;. These changes are a sign of something more profound: this is an orchestra and music director on a frontier. The truth is, there has never been an orchestra like this one. Now mainly in their early 30s, they have already played together for almost two decades. No one really knows how far, and in what ways, they will develop.</p> <p>Dudamel, meanwhile, clearly thrives in London. &quot;London will always be a place with many special and diverse memories,&quot; he says. &quot;Much of my early work was here, learning with great conductors and orchestras, I had the opportunity to visit London often – my relationship with your city and your arts scene started then. I went to the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Opera House</a>, spent time at the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">British Museum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Tate</a>, ate almost every lunch at <a href=\"http://www.wagamama.com/\" title=\"\">Wagamama</a> and explored your concert halls and learned what makes the &apos;London orchestra&apos; such a one-of-a-kind in the world. My relationship with the <a href=\"http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Philharmonia Orchestra </a>brought me many times to London and I will always reflect positively on that early period of development with them – their patience, their warmth, their dedication.&quot;</p> <p>But there is something else special about London. &quot;You have achieved something unique – it&apos;s sort of like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/14/abreu-el-sistema-venezuela-interview-clemency-burton-hill\" title=\"\">our Centre for Social Action in Music</a>, transported piece by piece, concept by concept, to the <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/festivals-series/sounds-venezuela-2012\" title=\"\">Southbank Centre</a> – that is one of a kind outside of Venezuela,&quot; says Dudamel. &quot;Everywhere will be music this week in London. A &apos;pop-up&apos; nucleo, I don&apos;t think, has ever happened before in this form. We&apos;re going to share a little of what happens, every day, for 500,000 kids in some 350 nuclei around Venezuela in the heart of London. And I think that is perhaps why we feel so at home working and performing here in London.&quot;</p> <p>Talking with the orchestra&apos;s players a few weeks ago as they rehearsed in Caracas, I heard the usual youthful bonhomie, and as they boarded UK-bound flights on Saturday, Facebook was humming with posts – principal viola player Ismel Campos still typing as he got on the plane. &quot;The UK,&quot; replied one of his friends immediately, &quot;Take umbrellas!!&quot; Off stage it is still fun, but will the London audience buy the developing on-stage Bolívars?</p> <p>Dudamel has certainly decided to play the stakes high. <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/dudamel-sim%C3%B3n-bol%C3%ADvar-symphony-orchestra-of-venezuela-56273\" title=\"\">He opens the residency on 23 June with Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, a composer he has never performed in London with this orchestra.

Their <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/series/sounds-venezuela\">programmes at the South Bank</a> - part of a well-curated weekend of music-making that celebrates not only Venezuela&apos;s El Sistema and its Scottish and English outposts, but at least a soupçon of the spectrum of some other London-based music education projects - contain some repertoire that belongs firmly in the Bolívar party-piece category, such as Britten&apos;s Young Person&apos;s Guide and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/24/simon-bolivar-youth-orchestra-review\">Strauss&apos;s Alpine Symphony</a>. But Beethoven&apos;s Eroica Symphony, the climax of their first concert on Saturday (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bolivarlive\">which you can watch live here</a>) decidedly is not. This is a chance for the orchestra, and for Dudamel, to prove how, as Marshall Marcus puts it, they&apos;ve &quot;grown up&quot; - as their changed moniker suggests that they have (a youth orchestra no longer, they are now a &quot;Symphony Orchestra&quot;, pure and simple, with many of the same personnel who grew up with Dudamel now in their 30s). </p> <p>They made a disc of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/dec/08/classicalmusicandopera.art1\">Beethoven&apos;s Fifth and Seventh</a> a few years ago, a mixed bag of excitement and interpretative thrills and spills that proved how dynamic this orchestra and conductor could be, but also how far they still had to go to be up there with the best.</p> <p>The thing with Beethoven, especially the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTQy1kWmhA\">Eroica</a>, is that there&apos;s nowhere to hide, no gigantic perorations of brassy virtuosity to disguise any interpretative infelicities or flaws in the ensemble, as there can be in the barnstorming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn85GysPT7E&amp;feature=fvst\">late-romantic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZbJOE9zNjw\">20th century</a> repertoire the Simón Bolívars often play. The test of this performance will be whether it&apos;s a beacon of the Bolivars&apos; increasing musical maturity, whether their Beethoven can be as revelatory, as subtle, and as thrilling as that of, say, the Philharmonia or the London Philharmonic - or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/08/spira-mirabilis-eroica-review\">Spira Mirabilis</a>, who played this same piece on their first appearance in London.</p> <p>And talking of beacons: the Bolívar&apos;s concert tonight with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/20/dudamel-bolivar-sistema-raploch-bignoise\">Big Noise in Stirling</a> ought to have the same effect for music education. (You may, at this point, have the sensation of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tomserviceblog/2010/jun/22/el-sistema-big-noise-music\">old saw being re-oiled</a>, so to speak.) For me, the real point about the Big Noise or In Harmony is not that they demonstrate the unique power of El Sistema, and how that model can be rolled out in other parts of the world. It&apos;s rather that El Sistema, like any good programme of socially cohesive music education, reveals the power of music to change lives. And if governments in Scotland and the rest of the country buy into El Sistema (the council in Stirling is now using taxpayers&apos; money to fund the Big Noise project), then the result ought to be increased support for music education across the board, from community music projects to youth orchestras, for the whole social and educational ecology that generations of inspirational, pioneering musicians have developed in the UK over the last few decades.

Photograph: Sandra Bracho/PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Maestro <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/jose_antonio_abreu.html\" title=\"\">José Antonio Abreu</a> works in an office situated in an unremarkable shopping mall in central Caracas, a few steps from one of the city&apos;s major thoroughfares. On the afternoon we meet, the sun is shining and the streets are bustling. Nevertheless, to make the short journey by foot from a nearby car park, we are accompanied by three conspicuously armed guards.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/10/venezuela-caracas-gang-warfare-murder\" title=\"\">Caracas</a>, one of the most violent cities in the world. Venezuela&apos;s murder rate is three times that of Iraq and four times that of Mexico. On average, 53 people are murdered here every day.</p> <p>This grisly statistic is on my mind as I am ushered in to meet Abreu, the 73-year-old former economist and conductor whose visionary philosophy has, since 1975, been based on the notion that a free, immersive classical music education for the poorest of the poor might positively influence the social problems plaguing the country.</p> <p>Abreu&apos;s hypothesis has been overwhelmingly vindicated, with more than 380,000 children engaged in national music programmes, more than 80% of whom come from low- or middle-income areas. Of the two million graduates of the programme since its inception, many have gone on to become not just musicians, but lawyers, teachers, doctors and civil servants. Yet it remains one of the great paradoxes of &quot;El Sistema&quot;, as Abreu&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.fesnojiv.gob.ve/en/el-sistema.html\" title=\"\">Fundación Musical Simón Bolívar</a> has come to be known, that no matter how successful it is, how many <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/16/gustavo-dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra\" title=\"\">Gustavo Dudamels</a> it creates, how many <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/03/britain-children-orchestra-sistema\" title=\"\">wealthier nations</a> seek to emulate it, the Venezuelan crime rate still climbs.</p> <p>Abreu agrees that the statistics are &quot;extremely grave&quot;. But he points to evidence that also seems to prove that without El Sistema&apos;s extensive network of <em>nucleos</em> (community music schools), orchestras and choirs, they would be considerably grimmer. &quot;The Inter-American Development Bank, the Venezuelan State and the Andean Development Corporation are continually supervising the foundation&apos;s projects,&quot; he says, &quot;because they have invested so many resources. Wherever there is an impact evaluation study, the results are unanimous. Children engaged in the programme attain above-average results in school and show a tremendous capacity for collective community action. The orchestra and the choirs, the heart of the programme, help create a sense of solidarity. Involvement becomes a weapon against poverty and inequality, violence and drug abuse.&quot;</p> <p>Abreu himself is a humble and ascetic figure who has dedicated his life to what he describes categorically as a &quot;human development&quot; project. &quot;The idea came to me because I saw that in Venezuela, music education did not include orchestras for young people,&quot; he explains, &quot;but I also could see, in the few existing music schools at that time, that the children who were participating in orchestras developed with a much more humane perception of their role within society. They had a completely different set of values.&quot;</p> <p>The scheme was launched, famously, with just 11 kids in a local garage – a far cry from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEMIX-N3B5Q\" title=\"\">scenes at</a>, say, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms\" title=\"\">Royal Albert Hall 30-odd years later</a>, but his conviction of the possibility of social transformation through music was absolute even then. &quot;At our first rehearsal, I was certain of it,&quot; he says, beady brown eyes glittering. &quot;I told those first 11 members of the orchestra that we were creating the beginning of a network that would eventually turn Venezuela into a musical power by rescuing children from low-income families.&quot;</p> <p>A few days later, I ask Frank di Polo, the violinist and original leader of the orchestra, if he remembers the moment. &quot;Of course,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Maestro Abreu knew all along what he was creating and what it could achieve.&quot;</p> <p>El Sistema, despite the nickname, is not actually a &quot;system&quot; of music education, but, as Abreu insists, &quot;a conception regarding the function of music within society&quot;. It is a vast network of schools, orchestras and choirs that now extends to all 23 provinces in Venezuela, and touches an estimated three adults for every child engaged in the programme. Whether Hugo Chávez or Henrique Capriles triumphs in October&apos;s forthcoming presidential elections, it is inconceivable that they should withdraw support for the programme. Seven successive Venezuelan administrations from across the political spectrum have supported El Sistema – to the tune of around 90% of its operating budget. The funds, tellingly, have always been disbursed by the social services rather than culture departments. This is surely down to the laser political vision of Abreu, whose tiny form and Mother Theresa-esque manner belie a formidable, strategic intelligence. &quot;The fundamental element that has determined support has been the results El Sistema has proved in the social field,&quot; he says. &quot;For Venezuelans, music education is now a constitutional and legal right.&quot;</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-391429554\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120611Bernstein/120611Bernstein.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Next week, the most visible and thrilling exponent of that principle returns to the UK, when Dudamel, 31-year-old music director of <a href=\"http://www.laphil.com/\" title=\"\">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a>, brings his &quot;other&quot; orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Symphony, to <a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000961369\" title=\"\">Raploch, Scotland</a>, for a concert alongside the El-Sistema-inspired initiative <a href=\"http://makeabignoise.org.uk/big-noise-raploch/\" title=\"\">Big Noise</a>. The gig launches the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/apr/26/jeremy-hunt-london-2012-festival\" title=\"\">London 2012 Festival</a> and, along with the orchestras&apos; subsequent residency at the Southbank Centre, which will be live-streamed on the Guardian website, is likely to unleash a new wave of Dudamania in Britain.</p> <p>Did Abreu always realise what he had on his hands with Gustavo? &quot;Of course,&quot; he says; he knew &quot;from the very beginning&quot; that his was a &quot;superlative&quot; talent. Yet Dudamel is far from unique.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-391839263\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/6/14/1339677443444/A-young-girl-practises-vi-008.jpg\" alt=\"A young girl practises violin at home in a slum area of Caracas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young girl practises violin at home in a slum area of Caracas.

It is not at all fanciful to propose that in coming years, many more European, American and Asian music institutions will have a spirited young Venezuelan at their helm, usually with terrifically emotive hair.</p> <p>This represents something of a dilemma for Abreu, mentor and father figure to all these wildly gifted young maestri. One reason why El Sistema works so well is its familial mechanism: as soon as a child is accomplished enough, they begin to help teach younger generations. If the most talented teenagers leave as soon as the big musical agencies – including the Berlin Philharmonic, in the case of Sistema double bassist <a href=\"http://edicsonruiz.com/index.php\">Edicson Ruiz</a> – come calling, the system may falter.</p> <p>Abreu admits it can be difficult to reconcile the need to allow his brightest proteges to spread their wings internationally with the need to keep them in Venezuela as all-important role models, but he repeats that this is a &quot;human development project&quot;. El Sistema exists, he maintains, &quot;to strengthen the moral and spiritual development of the country&quot; in whichever form that takes.</p> <p>There are many who believe this quietly charismatic man should be in line for the Nobel peace prize. Sir Simon Rattle, who describes El Sistema as &quot;nothing less than a miracle&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/03/jose-antonio-abreu-sistema-rattle\" title=\"\">has been advocating it</a> since 2008. But Abreu shakes his head. &quot;The biggest reward is the opportunity to keep doing our work,&quot; he says. The international attention his system receives &quot;creates a great sense of reward and responsibility&quot;. He indicates a poster on the wall emblazoned with the phrase &quot;<em>Tocar y Luchar</em>&quot;, the official motto of the programme ever since that afternoon in the garage. &quot;To play and to struggle: that came from our earliest experience when we had so many obstacles for undertaking the project – lack of spaces, instruments, financial resources,&quot; he explains. &quot;To play – it&apos;s a form of striving, so we can show the validity of the efforts we are committing ourselves to. The struggle is against the obstacles that present themselves. So there was always this double meaning within the kids, to be both artists and social fighters.&quot;</p> <p>The slogan is more applicable today than ever. &quot;We are still facing the gravest social problems, and we have a challenge to incorporate as many excluded children as possible,&quot; Abreu admits. &quot;We need more teachers, instruments, space, funding.&quot; The number of kids engaged in El Sistema programmes is estimated to hit the half-million mark by 2015, which seems mind-boggling; but Abreu points out that 33% of Venezuela&apos;s 30m population is under 14. I get the sense that he will not rest until every one of those children has access to a local nucleo.</p> <p>&quot;We know that the efforts we put into it are not enough, given the size of the challenge ahead. But this is our dream. And we will keep fighting for it, every day.&quot;</p> <p><em>Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra open London 2012 Festival in Raploch on 21 June, then perform at the Royal Festival Hall on 23 and 26 June as part of Southbank Centre&apos;s Festival of the World.
