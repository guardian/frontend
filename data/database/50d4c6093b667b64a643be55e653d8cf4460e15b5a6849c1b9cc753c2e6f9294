This contributed to the death of between 400 and 1,200 mainly elderly patients.</p> <p>&quot;The events at Stafford hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind,&quot; he told MPs. &quot;A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt, who was presenting the government&apos;s initial response to the appalling care catalogued in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">last month&apos;s landmark report by Robert Francis</a>, had trailed some changes in advance. These included a requirement for nurses to spend up to a year getting hands-on experience on hospital wards at the start of their training and the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals. But there was disappointment that the duty of candour would be a legal requirement for NHS organisations rather than staff and managers.</p> <p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn&apos;t already in place.</p> <p>&quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s proposals failed to impress Patient Concern, a patient campaign group. Roger Goss, its co-director, criticised the minister&apos;s refusal to implement what he called a core recommendation of the Francis inquiry – mandatory minimum staffing levels for hospitals. &quot;Hunt&apos;s refusal to implement this, claiming that there is no relationship between nurse numbers per ward and quality of care or patient safety, is preposterous. &apos;Not the government&apos;s problem or responsibility&apos; appears his attitude.&quot;</p> <p>Goss added: &quot;Whether nurses will retain an interest in tender loving care when they graduate after a mandatory year as healthcare assistants seems questionable. But the requirement is worth a try.&quot; Making nursing a degree-based profession already excluded many potential candidates who could be excellent caring and compassionate nurses, he said.</p> <p>The health service ombudsman, Dame Julie Mellor, while welcoming Hunt&apos;s statement, called it a &quot;first step&quot;. She said: &quot;Complaints are key to learning and improving … Ensuring that hospital trust boards receive and take action from meaningful complaint information to identify patterns, trends and themes will be central to making this change happen.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a new ratings system for hospitals closely based on the way Ofsted assesses the performance and quality of schools in England. Hospitals could be rated &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;requiring improvement&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; by a newly created chief inspector of hospitals, who Hunt said would become the NHS&apos;s new whistleblower-in-chief. Individual departments, such as cancer care and maternity services, would be rated separately and the hospital given an overall score.</p> <p>In addition, senior doctors will be brought from other hospitals to join beefed-up inspections and help assess the quality of care in certain departments. Tougher inspections could last for a month, Hunt said, in a new drive to identify and stop poor care emerging.</p> <p>Hunt also said nurses would have their performance subjected to regular review known as &quot;revalidation&quot;, along the lines of the same system that has recently been agreed for doctors, and that NHS pay would include an element related to their performance and how well they treated patients. NHS managers who have been responsible for failures will be barred from working in the service again. Gagging clauses on staff who leave the service will be banned.</p> <p>The healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will in future be responsible for the toughened inspection regime but not for putting right failures. This will be the responsibility of Monitor, the body that at present regulates the NHS&apos;s foundation trusts.</p> <p>The CQC chief executive, David Behan, said it would inspect acute hospitals and mental health trusts by focusing &quot;on the four key areas that are most important to people: safety, caring, effectiveness and how well they are led.&quot;</p> <p>The NHS Employers organisation was lukewarm about the new duty of candour. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don&apos;t improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p> <p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service organisations, said Hunt had found &quot;the right balance between external assurance measures and internal changes focused on transforming the NHS culture&quot; but added this would not happen overnight.</p> <p>Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer at NHS England, formerly called the NHS commissioning board in the runup to next month&apos;s structural change to the health service, said: &quot;There are so many NHS staff doing brilliant work for their patients. But we all know there is a serious job to be done to rebuild public confidence. The NHS must grasp this positively and seize the opportunity to drive change.&quot;</p> <p>A final decision on new legal sanctions against staff will depend on the outcome of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Don Berwick, a global expert in patient safety who has advised the US president, Barack Obama. Berwick will report before parliament&apos;s summer recess in July. Many medical organisations have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p> <p>Regulation of the 500,000-600,000 healthcare assistants working in both the NHS and social care would result in &quot;a bureaucratic quagmire&quot;, Hunt said. Instead, there will be a new code of practice governing their behaviour and new minimum training standards.</p> <p>Hunt again defended Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS in England, who has been under growing pressure from MPs and relatives of the patients who died to resign for failing to do more to stop the poor care unfolding when he headed the NHS&apos;s regional strategic health authority in 2005-06.</p> <p>Nicholson was responsible for 50 hospitals in the West Midlands at the time and no one in the NHS system at the time flagged major concerns to him about the emerging problems at Stafford hospital, Hunt said.</p> <p>Although the NHS&apos;s overall boss bears &quot;some responsibility&quot; for the NHS&apos;s failure to spot the poor care sooner, Nicholson had also ensured that the NHS met key waiting times targets and brought levels of healthcare-acquired infections down very

This contributed to the death of between 400 and 1,200 mainly elderly patients.</p> <p>&quot;The events at Stafford hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind,&quot; he told MPs. &quot;A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt, who was presenting the government&apos;s initial response to the appalling care catalogued in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">last month&apos;s landmark report by Robert Francis</a>, had trailed some changes in advance. These included a requirement for nurses to spend up to a year getting hands-on experience on hospital wards at the start of their training and the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals. But there was disappointment that the duty of candour would be a legal requirement for NHS organisations rather than staff and managers.</p> <p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn&apos;t already in place.</p> <p>&quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s proposals failed to impress Patient Concern, a patient campaign group. Roger Goss, its co-director, criticised the minister&apos;s refusal to implement what he called a core recommendation of the Francis inquiry – mandatory minimum staffing levels for hospitals. &quot;Hunt&apos;s refusal to implement this, claiming that there is no relationship between nurse numbers per ward and quality of care or patient safety, is preposterous. &apos;Not the government&apos;s problem or responsibility&apos; appears his attitude.&quot;</p> <p>Goss added: &quot;Whether nurses will retain an interest in tender loving care when they graduate after a mandatory year as healthcare assistants seems questionable. But the requirement is worth a try.&quot; Making nursing a degree-based profession already excluded many potential candidates who could be excellent caring and compassionate nurses, he said.</p> <p>The health service ombudsman, Dame Julie Mellor, while welcoming Hunt&apos;s statement, called it a &quot;first step&quot;. She said: &quot;Complaints are key to learning and improving … Ensuring that hospital trust boards receive and take action from meaningful complaint information to identify patterns, trends and themes will be central to making this change happen.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a new ratings system for hospitals closely based on the way Ofsted assesses the performance and quality of schools in England. Hospitals could be rated &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;requiring improvement&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; by a newly created chief inspector of hospitals, who Hunt said would become the NHS&apos;s new whistleblower-in-chief. Individual departments, such as cancer care and maternity services, would be rated separately and the hospital given an overall score.</p> <p>In addition, senior doctors will be brought from other hospitals to join beefed-up inspections and help assess the quality of care in certain departments. Tougher inspections could last for a month, Hunt said, in a new drive to identify and stop poor care emerging.</p> <p>Hunt also said nurses would have their performance subjected to regular review known as &quot;revalidation&quot;, along the lines of the same system that has recently been agreed for doctors, and that NHS pay would include an element related to their performance and how well they treated patients. NHS managers who have been responsible for failures will be barred from working in the service again. Gagging clauses on staff who leave the service will be banned.</p> <p>The healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will in future be responsible for the toughened inspection regime but not for putting right failures. This will be the responsibility of Monitor, the body that at present regulates the NHS&apos;s foundation trusts.</p> <p>The CQC chief executive, David Behan, said it would inspect acute hospitals and mental health trusts by focusing &quot;on the four key areas that are most important to people: safety, caring, effectiveness and how well they are led.&quot;</p> <p>The NHS Employers organisation was lukewarm about the new duty of candour. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don&apos;t improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p> <p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service organisations, said Hunt had found &quot;the right balance between external assurance measures and internal changes focused on transforming the NHS culture&quot; but added this would not happen overnight.</p> <p>Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer at NHS England, formerly called the NHS commissioning board in the runup to next month&apos;s structural change to the health service, said: &quot;There are so many NHS staff doing brilliant work for their patients. But we all know there is a serious job to be done to rebuild public confidence. The NHS must grasp this positively and seize the opportunity to drive change.&quot;</p> <p>A final decision on new legal sanctions against staff will depend on the outcome of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Don Berwick, a global expert in patient safety who has advised the US president, Barack Obama.

Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Jeremy Hunt has had just seven weeks to consider no fewer than 290 recommendations from the Francis inquiry, which itself was the product of a 31-month public inquiry featuring more than 250 witnesses and a million pages of evidence.</p> <p>So he can be forgiven for giving what he acknowledged was an initial – rather than full or final – response. Pretending to have finalised a view on so much in so short a time would not have yielded practical and beneficial changes – to safety of care, NHS culture, the service&apos;s accountability and, especially, boosting the role of patients – that the scale of the horror at Mid Staffs requires. They will take time.</p> <p>The key objective is safe care for every patient every time – a culture of zero avoidable harm. It is an understandable but also arguably unrealistic goal, as healthcare everywhere inevitably involves risk. It is naive to think a service that serves so many patients each year can completely eradicate the possibility that a nurse, looking after too many for her comfort, will misread a doctor&apos;s scrawled handwriting and give the patient the wrong drug. The review of patient safety being led by Don Berwick, an internationally recognised authority, may prompt ministers to temper their expectations of zero harm being achievable.</p> <p>More realistic is the coalition&apos;s response to several of Francis&apos;s more far-reaching suggestions, such as regulation of healthcare assistants and criminal prosecutions for NHS staff who harm or kill patients. The latter is on hold until Berwick reports in July. He will also form a view on whether the promised new statutory duty of candour, requiring NHS organisations to tell patients and relatives when mistakes are made, should be extended to their staff too, as the Mid Staffs relatives and patient safety groups such as Action against Medical Accidents want.</p> <p>The same principle applies to the planned disclosure of data showing what outcomes patients experience when receiving 10 types of common and important surgery. Until now such information has been available only for heart surgery, but this is accepted to have helped reduce the unacceptable variation that means patients seeking vital care face a postcode lottery. Revealing more of the contents of the NHS&apos;s treasure trove of performance data – some of which is not yet collected – will happen slowly and prove painful for hospitals where patients have the lowest chance of success.</p> <p>Other Hunt plans – banning gagging orders and the fiddling of mortality data, and blacklisting failed NHS managers like the former Mid Staffs chief executive Martin Yeates – will help plug obvious gaps in NHS practice, as judged against the strict new requirement for accountability. But the most important figure in all the change is the planned new chief inspector of hospitals, who is to be unforgiving in demanding high standards in all units, exposing poor care and deciding whether a hospital should be rated as poor, good or whatever. His or her identity, like so many of the key elements of the government&apos;s plan to overhaul the NHS, is still not known. Hunt&apos;s response to Francis, therefore, is just beginning. .</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"4","wordcount":"511","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2013-03-26T20:04:15Z","internalComposerCode":"5692d9a5e4b0962b6cc0b85b","internalOctopusCode":"7410690","internalPageCode":"1886010","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:32Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3em36","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3em36"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-mid-staffs-beginning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-mid-staffs-beginning","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt's response to Mid Staffs report is just beginning","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T20:20:33Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-mid-staffs-beginning","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1886032","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406286589","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364334258213/Stafford-hospital-where-c-010.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Stafford hospital, where care failings contributed to the deaths of between 400 and 1,200 patients","caption":"Stafford hospital, where care failings contributed to the deaths of between 400 and 1,200 patients.

He said greater numbers of staff result in better healthcare: &quot;Simply leaving the setting of staffing levels to local discretion clearly isn&apos;t working and the time has come for mandatory, legally enforceable safe staffing levels.&quot;</p> <p>Action against Medical Accidents (Avma), which has campaigned for years for a duty of candour, was concerned ministers had apparently not been convinced by the recommendation from Francis that individual NHS employees should be made liable for mistakes – and urged the Department of Health not to discount it.</p> <p>But the department&apos;s 82-page response to Francis&apos;s 290 recommendations warned that there was a risk of &quot;unintentionally create[ing] a culture of fear. This in turn could prevent lessons being learned and could make services less safe&quot;.</p> <p>Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Avma, said Hunt&apos;s statement was &quot;vague&quot; – but welcomed the statutory duty on NHS organisations to tell the truth when patients have been harmed or killed as tougher measures would &quot;help change the culture of cover-up and denial that has been eating away at the NHS like a cancer&quot; and be &quot;the biggest advance in patient safety and patients&apos; rights in the history of the NHS.</p> <p>A final decision on the proposal of personal accountability will not be made until later, subject to the findings of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Professor Don Berwick, a global expert in safe care who has advised President Barack Obama, who will report by July. Many medical organisations, including the British Medical Association, have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p> <p>Many of Hunt&apos;s proposals had been carefully trailed in the past few days. Failing hospitals would be monitored with a system of performance ratings based on Ofsted&apos;s existing assessments of schools in England. Meanwhile, managers responsible for failures will be barred from working elsewhere in the health service, while clauses gagging ex-NHS staff from raising concerns publicly will be banned.</p> <p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn&apos;t already in place. &quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p> <p>Emma Jones, from the law firm Leigh Day, who represented over 120 victims of abuse at Stafford hospital in successful claims for compensation, called Hunt&apos;s measures &quot;a small step in the right direction to keep the NHS true to its founding principles and the envy of the world.&quot; She said the duty of candour &quot;needs to apply to individual hospital employees as well as the hospital itself. The majority of my clients complained about their treatment and care but either received a very bland or misleading response or no response at all.&quot;</p> <p>But the NHS Employers organisation however was lukewarm about the new obligation. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don&apos;t improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p> <p>Francis said that although ministers had not accepted all his 290 recommendations, &quot;the government&apos;s statement indicates its determination to make positive changes to the culture of the NHS, in part by adopting some of my recommendations and in part through other initiatives.&quot;</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"4","wordcount":"920","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2013-03-26T21:39:42Z","internalComposerCode":"5696a858e4b052a54e7ed183","internalOctopusCode":"7410674","internalPageCode":"1886032","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:30Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3em4x","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3em4x"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-measures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-measures","webTitle":"NHS care overhaul measures don't go far enough, say patient groups","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T21:44:52Z","sectionName":"Society","sectionId":"society","type":"article","id":"society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-measures","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","editions":[{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1885938","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406272345","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364320743128/Nurses-to-face-hands-on-s-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Nurses to face hands on stint","caption":"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, address the Commons.

Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Imagine if you lived in a world in which there was a single metric that defined the &quot;truth&quot; about the &quot;good quality&quot; of a car. Imagine if the career progression of car designers depended on how well they scored on this miraculous metric. It is hard to picture exactly what mode of transport we would all be using but it would, without doubt, be a worse world to live in.</p> <p>This is not an attack on Which? or What Car? that regularly line up cars on various league tables of quality. They are very useful publications. It is an illustration of what was probably the most absurd part of Jeremy Hunt&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">statement</a> in response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">Francis report </a>on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p> <p>He promised us that &quot;in the future the chief inspector will ensure that there is a single version of the truth about how their hospitals are performing, not just on finance and targets, but on a single assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients&quot;.</p> <p>In itself, having a single official assessment of how well hospitals are performing is a perfectly sensible idea and should be welcomed. Indeed, most of what Hunt proposed was welcome and should, if executed effectively, go a long way to addressing the problems that occurred in Mid Staffordshire</p> <p>But there was a problem in the way he presented this particular aspect of his plans – one that risks repeating the failures of the past, one that reeks of the old NHS culture: the culture that led to the tragedies at Mid Staffordshire.</p> <p>A single assessment can be a useful tool. But not if you begin to believe it is the &quot;truth&quot; about quality or that you have made &quot;an assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients&quot;. After all, there are roughly 50 million NHS patients in England, ranging from infants to old people with dementia. You might be able to fully reflect what matters to some of them; or partially reflect what matters to all of them. But, as Abraham Lincoln would have said, had he worked in the NHS, you are never going to assess all of what matters to all of them.</p> <p>Hunt has identified quite rightly that we need more expert inspectors, more detailed information on quality, and regulators that exercise real judgments about where care is being provided to a good standard. But if quality in healthcare is not to be reduced once again to a tick-box exercise, we must avoid a world in which large central government agencies are tasked with identifying the &quot;single version of the truth&quot; when it comes to quality in healthcare.</p> <p>In Hunt&apos;s statement, most of the proposed changes related to increasing accountability upwards to regulators and government. Relatively few – such as the duty of candour – related to accountability directly to patients. This is pragmatic, in that it will have the biggest immediate effect. But it ignores the essential longer-term goal of increasing accountability directly to patients.</p> <p>Francis had some good ideas on how to achieve this. Unfortunately, they appear rather late in the report. That may be why they seem to have been ignored. It is a shame because they point towards a much more radical rebalancing of power and accountability in healthcare.</p> <p>Recommendation 244 says: &quot;Patients need to be granted user-friendly, real-time and retrospective access to read their records, and a facility to enter comments. They should be enabled to have a copy of records in a form usable by them, if they wish to have one.&quot; And: &quot;Systems should be designed to include prompts and defaults where these will contribute to safe and effective care, and to accurate recording of information on first entry.&quot;</p> <p>I want an NHS in which information about the standards of care I receive come to me first and regulators second. Currently we are building an NHS that does this the other way round. This needs to be reversed.</p>","wordcount":"670","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T18:15:19Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-26T17:49:15Z","internalComposerCode":"5685b7c0e4b0741a0d9c1239","internalOctopusCode":"7410647","internalPageCode":"1885938","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:36Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3emvf","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3emvf"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt's dangerous belief in a single 'truth' about hospitals | Roger Taylor","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T18:15:19Z","sectionName":"Opinion","sectionId":"commentisfree","type":"article","id":"commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","editions":[{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","code":"default"},{"id":"au/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/commentisfree","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/commentisfree","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/commentisfree","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1885789","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406255587","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364311149439/Jeremy-Hunt-010.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Jeremy Hunt","caption":"Jeremy Hunt has resisted pledging to implement all of Francis’s 290 recommendations.

For that to have a chance, all Hunt&apos;s plans need to work – and others too.</p> <p>The litmus test of all these new policies, initiatives and laws will be whether they, individually and collectively, provide an answer to the key question that underpinned Robert Francis QC&apos;s mammoth public inquiry: will they mean that the appalling care seen at Mid Staffs never happens again?</p> <p>Only the most ardent optimist would answer unequivocally yes. But while they cannot realistically prevent any individual member of staff being cruel, callous or recklessly incompetent, they should greatly reduce the chances of Mid-Staffs-type failings recurring, given they were uniquely sustained and widespread.</p> <p>A beefed-up inspection regime involving month-long poking around for the biggest trusts and inclusion of medical experts among the inspectors will help put hospitals under the sort of pressure that the unique responsibilities of publicly funded healthcare demand, and embrace the need for constant improvement, especially if Hunt&apos;s intention of the public being able to see ratings for individual departments proves viable.</p> <p>He wants something akin to Ofsted&apos;s simple, parent-friendly ratings – an at-a-glance signal that a hospital is &quot;good&quot;, &quot;outstanding&quot; or something less. But, as the Nuffield Trust health thinktank told him just last week, the complexity and range of what hospitals do – providing many different types of care, potentially – makes one overall score, which he also wants, very hard to give.</p> <p>The yet-to-be appointed first-ever chief inspector of hospitals will have to resolve this, and other tricky issues about how new key processes will actually work.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s ideas combine an admirable amount of practicality as well as pragmatism. He has wisely resisted pledging to implement all of Francis&apos;s 290 recommendations. Instead, he said, ministers are following the spirit of them.</p> <p>Some of Francis&apos;s key recommendations are the subject of various ongoing reviews, such as whether individual NHS staff should become liable to prosecution if they harm or kill a patient. The American patient safety expert Prof Don Berwick is looking into that, though the Department of Health already has well-developed and well-grounded concerns about it, as do organisations representing doctors and other health professionals.</p> <p>The fear is that such sanctions could deter staff from reporting that they have seen risky things being done by mistake to patients, and thus undermine the culture of openness which is central to the post-Francis-report NHS that ministers, NHS organisations and patients&apos; representatives all want to see.</p>","wordcount":"480","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T15:20:26Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-26T15:15:19Z","internalComposerCode":"5691fd1ee4b060a3548bf4fc","internalOctopusCode":"7409768","internalPageCode":"1885789","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2013-03-26T15:36:31Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3eymx","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3eymx"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-jeremy-hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"NHS care overhaul: Jeremy Hunt's plan is ambitious but possibly unrealistic","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T15:20:26Z","sectionName":"Society","sectionId":"society","type":"article","id":"society/2013/mar/26/nhs-care-overhaul-jeremy-hunt","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","editions":[{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1885974","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406275405","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364323396222/Nurse-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Nurse","caption":"'If you want nurses to perform more of these 'caring' tasks then employ more nurses.'

As a student nurse, I already do this. My alarm goes off at 5.30am and I am in my ward for 7am. For the next 13 hours I work alongside my mentor who teaches me the responsibilities of nursing. These will include, feeding, washing, dressing, performing observations, administering drugs, preparing IV drugs, wound dressing, admission and discharging of patients, pre- and post-operation care, working with deteriorating patients, catheterisation and preparing and giving injections. Not to mention dealing with the emotional needs of individual patients.</p> <p>Most of these duties used to be performed by doctors, but because of people living longer and the growing complexity of medicine, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/nursing\" title=\"\">nurses</a> have taken some of these responsibilities. In turn, healthcare assistants (HCAs) have been employed to perform some of the tasks of nurses. I have never had such a &quot;hands-on&quot; learning experience in any of my previous jobs.</p> <p>At university we&apos;ve had many lectures about care and how we care for patients but the subject always come back to this: can we teach how to care? Can we teach how to deal with emotional and stressful situations? How do we teach about death, pain, anger, anxiety? Is this something you can teach, or something you are born with, or something you gain from life experience? I don&apos;t know the answer but if we didn&apos;t care, why would we go into a profession that every day deals with life and death at its most core, with pain, with long shifts, with pay packets that barely pay our rent?</p> <p>I care and all my fellow students care but with high demands on the NHS, HCAs have been employed to perform these tasks because nurses simply don&apos;t have the capacity to perform these duties alongside the complexity of patients&apos; healthcare needs and ward procedures. If you want nurses to perform more of these &quot;caring&quot; tasks then employ more nurses. Six to eight patients to one nurse is too much and makes it impossible for that nurse to attend to every patient&apos;s individual care needs.</p> <p>I love being a student because I have the time to perform all the fundamentals of nursing care, to comb patients&apos; hair, to talk to them about their personal lives while I help feed them their lunch, as well as learning from qualified nurses about other duties and responsibilities. But while I am reading a book to a patient, my mentor nurse is running around making sure that these patients stay alive and keep well.</p> <p>This time next year I will be nearly qualified and will be out on the wards. It is vital that HCAs, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and all the other ward staff work together to give the patient the best level of care and also to support each other as colleagues. There is a hierarchy in the NHS but everybody on the ward is responsible for life and death, for care, for recognising risk and acting accordingly. So why are HCAs paid £9 an hour and made to work 13-hour shifts? If this is fundamental to care then why aren&apos;t HCAs valued more and why isn&apos;t money given to train HCAs and improve standards? Instead, the government wants to put more untrained workers on to wards to perform these tasks. This will surely add to the problems rather than solve them.</p> <p>As I write, I&apos;m eating into my revision schedule for a bioscience exam for which I have to learn about the cardiovascular system, cells, renal system, homoeostasis, central nervous system, genetics and reproduction, applied pharmacology pain and inflammation, gastrointestinal system, antibiotics, bones and muscle, renal system, respiratory system … &quot;gasp&quot; – yes that&apos;s your respiratory system working overtime, and it&apos;s what happens to student nurses on a daily basis. After all, I&apos;m sure you want the nurse looking after your relative to be knowledgeable and to care. It upsets me greatly that the government thinks that nursing equates to wiping arses all day long. Perhaps the government should wake up to the fact that about 80% of the student nurses I know actually work as HCAs as a part-time job to fund their way through studying.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-30T10:00:03Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-26T18:36:22Z","internalComposerCode":"5685b7c0e4b0073bf25b6450","internalOctopusCode":"7410978","internalPageCode":"1885974","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:23Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3emxz","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3emxz"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/nurses-hands-on-work-jeremy-hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/nurses-hands-on-work-jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"Nurses already do hands-on work and of course we care about patients | Geraldine Williams","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-27T10:00:03Z","sectionName":"Opinion","sectionId":"commentisfree","type":"article","id":"commentisfree/2013/mar/27/nurses-hands-on-work-jeremy-hunt","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","editions":[{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","code":"default"},{"id":"au/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/commentisfree","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/commentisfree","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/commentisfree","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1885474","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406219865","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/25/1364253040219/nurses-training-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"nurses training","caption":"Any nurses who refuse to carry out basic caring tasks will be denied NHS funding for their degree.

Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Nurses will have to spend up to a year helping patients eat, wash and get dressed – work usually done by healthcare assistants – under government plans to shake up NHS care in response to the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal that left between 400 and 1,200 to die as a result of poor care.</p> <p>Any would-be nurse who refuses to undertake such hands-on work will be denied NHS funding for their degree, which is worth about £40,000 over three years and relied upon by almost all the 20,000 new student nurses a year. In effect they will be debarred from training.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is expected to announce the move on Tuesday when he sets out the government&apos;s response to Robert Francis QC&apos;s report into the scandal.</p> <p>At the moment the basic tasks of caring for patients, which also include helping them get out of bed and going to the toilet, are mainly done by healthcare assistants or health support workers, who are paid much less than nurses and do not have their status.</p> <p>Ministers see the move as essential to ensuring the nursing profession rediscovers the values of compassionate care which critics claim has been lost amid pressure to meet NHS targets, rising numbers of patients and some nurses displaying appalling behaviour towards some patients. Critics also fear that too many nurses have become too detached from the fundamentals of patient care and avoid too much routine contact with patients, such as help with feeding and moving around for those who need it.</p> <p>Hunt will tell parliament on Tuesday what the coalition intends to do to overhaul many aspects of NHS care given Francis&apos;s damning criticisms of the &quot;NHS system&quot; and its self-interested &quot;culture&quot; which did not give enough priority to giving patients the best possible care.</p> <p>Ministers, civil servants and NHS chiefs have spent seven weeks studying the 290 recommendations made by Francis following his 31-month public inquiry into why such inadequate care at Stafford hospital was allowed to continue for so long.</p> <p>&quot;Frontline, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training. These measures are about recruiting all staff with the right values and giving them the training they need to do their job properly, so that patients are treated with compassion,&quot; Hunt said.</p> <p>In a speech last November he castigated some NHS staff for their involvement in cases of patient care which he said had included &quot;contempt&quot; and &quot;a kind of normalisation of cruelty&quot;.</p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing, which represents most nurses and student nurses, may not welcome new entrants to the profession having to perform tasks usually done by colleagues who are less well-trained and not strictly part of the clinical workforce, either before or during their training. They may see it as an unwanted blurring of the dividing lines between two groups of NHS staff and even as demeaning to nurses.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s initiative follows an almost identical suggestion made by Francis. Recommendation 187 in his report said: &quot;There should be a national entry level requirement that student nurses spend a minimum period of time, at least three months, working on the direct care of patients under the supervision of a registered nurse. Such experience should include direct care of patients, ideally including the elderly, and involve hands-on physical care.&quot;</p> <p>He recommended: &quot;Satisfactory completion of this direct care experience should be a pre-condition to continuation in nurse training. Supervised work of this type as a healthcare support worker should be allowed to count as an equivalent.&quot;</p> <p>The change will be piloted before being made routine in England, Department of Health (DoH) sources said. Ministers will consider making other health professionals, notably health professionals such as physiotherapists, but not doctors, do the same as student nurses, depending on what those trials show.</p> <p>Hunt will on Tuesday also publish new minimum training standards and a code of conduct for support workers in health and social care, following concerns that some lack the skills needed. They will include what DoH sources described as &quot;clear requirements on behaviour and attitude&quot;. The standards will include training them in handling complaints from patients and relatives, reporting errors they have made or seen, recognising when a patient is undernourished or dehydrated, and talking properly to patients.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","wordcount":"728","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T00:02:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-25T23:07:20Z","internalComposerCode":"5696a825e4b052a54e7ed165","internalOctopusCode":"7406557","internalPageCode":"1885474","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:45Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

This contributed to the death of between 400 and 1,200 mainly elderly patients.</p> <p>&quot;The events at Stafford hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind,&quot; he told MPs. &quot;A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high quality, compassionate care they deserve.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt, who was presenting the government&apos;s initial response to the appalling care catalogued in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">last month&apos;s landmark report by Robert Francis</a>, had trailed some changes in advance. These included a requirement for nurses to spend up to a year getting hands-on experience on hospital wards at the start of their training and the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals. But there was disappointment that the duty of candour would be a legal requirement for NHS organisations rather than staff and managers.</p> <p>Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn&apos;t already in place.</p> <p>&quot;Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained &quot;as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes&quot;.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s proposals failed to impress Patient Concern, a patient campaign group. Roger Goss, its co-director, criticised the minister&apos;s refusal to implement what he called a core recommendation of the Francis inquiry – mandatory minimum staffing levels for hospitals. &quot;Hunt&apos;s refusal to implement this, claiming that there is no relationship between nurse numbers per ward and quality of care or patient safety, is preposterous. &apos;Not the government&apos;s problem or responsibility&apos; appears his attitude.&quot;</p> <p>Goss added: &quot;Whether nurses will retain an interest in tender loving care when they graduate after a mandatory year as healthcare assistants seems questionable. But the requirement is worth a try.&quot; Making nursing a degree-based profession already excluded many potential candidates who could be excellent caring and compassionate nurses, he said.</p> <p>The health service ombudsman, Dame Julie Mellor, while welcoming Hunt&apos;s statement, called it a &quot;first step&quot;. She said: &quot;Complaints are key to learning and improving … Ensuring that hospital trust boards receive and take action from meaningful complaint information to identify patterns, trends and themes will be central to making this change happen.&quot;</p> <p>Hunt is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a new ratings system for hospitals closely based on the way Ofsted assesses the performance and quality of schools in England. Hospitals could be rated &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;requiring improvement&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; by a newly created chief inspector of hospitals, who Hunt said would become the NHS&apos;s new whistleblower-in-chief. Individual departments, such as cancer care and maternity services, would be rated separately and the hospital given an overall score.</p> <p>In addition, senior doctors will be brought from other hospitals to join beefed-up inspections and help assess the quality of care in certain departments. Tougher inspections could last for a month, Hunt said, in a new drive to identify and stop poor care emerging.</p> <p>Hunt also said nurses would have their performance subjected to regular review known as &quot;revalidation&quot;, along the lines of the same system that has recently been agreed for doctors, and that NHS pay would include an element related to their performance and how well they treated patients. NHS managers who have been responsible for failures will be barred from working in the service again. Gagging clauses on staff who leave the service will be banned.</p> <p>The healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), will in future be responsible for the toughened inspection regime but not for putting right failures. This will be the responsibility of Monitor, the body that at present regulates the NHS&apos;s foundation trusts.</p> <p>The CQC chief executive, David Behan, said it would inspect acute hospitals and mental health trusts by focusing &quot;on the four key areas that are most important to people: safety, caring, effectiveness and how well they are led.&quot;</p> <p>The NHS Employers organisation was lukewarm about the new duty of candour. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement &quot;makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don&apos;t improve culture by creating a climate of fear.&quot;</p> <p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service organisations, said Hunt had found &quot;the right balance between external assurance measures and internal changes focused on transforming the NHS culture&quot; but added this would not happen overnight.</p> <p>Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer at NHS England, formerly called the NHS commissioning board in the runup to next month&apos;s structural change to the health service, said: &quot;There are so many NHS staff doing brilliant work for their patients. But we all know there is a serious job to be done to rebuild public confidence. The NHS must grasp this positively and seize the opportunity to drive change.&quot;</p> <p>A final decision on new legal sanctions against staff will depend on the outcome of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Don Berwick, a global expert in patient safety who has advised the US president, Barack Obama. Berwick will report before parliament&apos;s summer recess in July. Many medical organisations have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.</p> <p>Regulation of the 500,000-600,000 healthcare assistants working in both the NHS and social care would result in &quot;a bureaucratic quagmire&quot;, Hunt said. Instead, there will be a new code of practice governing their behaviour and new minimum training standards.</p> <p>Hunt again defended Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS in England, who has been under growing pressure from MPs and relatives of the patients who died to resign for failing to do more to stop the poor care unfolding when he headed the NHS&apos;s regional strategic health authority in 2005-06.</p> <p>Nicholson was responsible for 50 hospitals in the West Midlands at the time and no one in the NHS system at the time flagged major concerns to him about the emerging problems at Stafford hospital, Hunt said.</p> <p>Although the NHS&apos;s overall boss bears &quot;some responsibility&quot; for the NHS&apos;s failure to spot the poor care sooner, Nicholson had also ensured that the NHS met key waiting times targets and brought levels of healthcare-acquired infections down very dramatically.</p>","wordcount":"1292","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T13:09:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-26T13:00:45Z","internalComposerCode":"56ac9b1ae4b04fd0f986e30d","internalOctopusCode":"7408937","internalPageCode":"1885666","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:36Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3eyhd","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3eyhd"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"Failing

There is more about Osborne&apos;s comments on Cyprus <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/26/eurozone-crisis-cyprus-banks#block-5151bf0a95cbbc3a59c25eae\">on our business live blog.</a></p> <p><strong>• Vince Cable has said that in principle he is in favour of a financial transaction tax.</strong> Although the government is opposing a European attempt to introduce one, the Lib Dem business secretary told a committee of MPs that he was &quot;quite disposed&quot; to using a financial transaction tax as a way of trying to change behaviour in the financial sector.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have got no objection to the ... well, I would put it more positively - I think there is a case if you are trying to change behaviour from using a market instrument of that kind to make it happen ...</p> <p>The reason why the British government has been pretty negative about it is mainly on grounds of practicality and the other reason we have been sceptical about it, of course, is that most of the revenue would be generated in the UK and under the European Union&apos;s proposal would be repatriated to Brussels, which understandably, we are not too happy about.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• David Cameron has indicated that he will not consider devolving power over corporation tax to Northern Ireland until after the referendum on Scottish independence in September 2014.</strong> After discussing the matter at Number 10 with Cameron, Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland&apos;s first minster, and Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister, both expressed disappointment. McGuinness said Cameron had made it &quot;absolutely clear&quot; that there would not be a decision until after the Scottish referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It&apos;s very, very clear from the meeting that the whole issue of the referendum in Scotland is playing in big time to this debate on corporation tax and I think it is absolutely clear that no decision will be taken on this issue this side of the Scottish referendum. I think we have to face that reality.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/mar/26/foreign-lawsuits-uk-legal-fees\">Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has announced a review that could lead to higher court fees for foreign businessmen and Russian oligarchs who pursue their multimillion-pound disputes in British courts</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>• A council has launched a misconduct investigation into the Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock.</strong> As the Press Association reports, Hancock, who sits on Portsmouth City Council as well as being MP for Portsmouth South, is to be subjected to the three-month probe following an allegation made to the council. The local authority&apos;s governance and audit and standards committee has assessed the complaint and ordered the investigation by an independent lawyer. Michael Lawther, solicitor for Portsmouth City Council, said: &quot;A sub-committee of Portsmouth City Council today decided to refer a complaint against Cllr Mike Hancock for investigation.&quot; The move comes as a &quot;vulnerable&quot; constituent is suing the MP in the High Court, accusing him of sexual assault after she contacted him for help in a neighbour dispute. Hancock, who vigorously denied the claims, was arrested by police over the allegations in 2010 but no action was taken as the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution. A spokesman for Hancock said that the allegations had been investigated by the police and that no action had been taken and that Hancock strongly denied breaking the code of conduct.</p> <p><strong>• Unions, politicians, comedians and protest groups have joined forces to launch a new campaign against the government&apos;s spending cuts.</strong> As the Press Association reports, <a href=\"http://www.coalitionofresistance.org.uk/\">the People&apos;s Assembly</a> is backed by Unite, the National Union of Teachers, the Public and Commercial Services union, Labour and Green MPs and activists, with the aim of launching &quot;mass resistance&quot; to austerity. A rally will be held in June and meetings will be organised across the UK to draw as many people as possible into the campaign against cuts ranging from library closures to welfare reforms.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/75276/lougton_v_toryeducation_this_time_its_war%3F.html\">The controversial Tory education Twitter feed has accused the former education minister Tim Loughton of lying about an incident that happened in the Department for Education when he was a minister</a>.</strong> The account is thought to be linked to Michael Gove&apos;s advisers. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/feb/02/michael-gove-department-twitter-attacks\">They have dismissed claims that they are involved, although, when the Observer invited them to provide a firm denial, they declined. </a></p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21937193\">Martha Lane Fox has taken her seat in the House of Lords</a>.</strong></p> <p>That&apos;s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T16:46:57.881Z\">at 4.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5151c424b5795d794abf44eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T15:52:05.085Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here&apos;s a short afternoon reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2013/03/labour-hires-obamas-backroom-brit-as-it-seeks-to-make-2015-the-digital-election/\">• Mark Ferguson at LabourList says the Labour party has hired the expert who ran Digital Rapid Response for Obama for America.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you believe that online campaigning matters (I do) and that the Labour Party has historically lagged behind the Tories on investment in this area (I certainly do), then you’ll see this as a significant upgrade in the party’s capacity. I won’t be expecting fireworks straight away – but I’d expect a noticeable improvement in the party’s online offering in the coming months.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/alex-massie/2013/03/the-scottish-tories-cross-their-rubicon/\">• Alex Massie at the Spectator says Ruth Davidson&apos;s speech today - see 12.13pm - has moved the Scottish Conservatives towards embracing proper fiscal home rule.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The nationalists will instinctively suggest this is only weak toast and little more than a renewed outbreak of <em>Douglas-Homeism</em> on the Tory benches. We have been here before. Perhaps. But Davidson’s speech helps give the lie to the idea that constitutional change can only be achieved with a vote for independence. It suits the SNP to peddle that line but it suffers from being untrue.</p> <p>Granted, there remain questions. The Scottish Tories may be willing to make a manifesto commitment to some form of fiscal autonomy but that does not compel their Westminster brethren to look so fondly upon the notion.</p> <p>And there’s one rub: this is a British matter too, one that has obvious consequences south of the Tweed. But is Westminster - far less England at large – paying attention? I suspect not. There was not a cheap about Davidson’s speech in this morning’s email from <em>Conservative Home</em>. Nor have the London papers devoted much attention to this development.</p> <p>But perhaps they should. Because the Tweed seems broader and deeper than ever. A rather more formidable barrier, in fact, than the piddling Rubicon of ancient renown. Scotland is presently semi-detached from the rest of the United Kingdom and Davidson’s speech today both confirms that and makes it clear that even the Scottish Tories now accept there’s no going back.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T15:53:11.137Z\">at 3.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5151bd91b5795d794abf44e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T15:24:01.686Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Keith Vaz,</strong> the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has put out this statement about the UKBA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The home secretary has done the right thing in putting the UK Backlog Agency out of its misery.</p> <p>As yesterday&apos;s home affairs committee report shows, the organisation is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>However, this cannot be an excuse not to clear the backlogs, which stand at a third of a million cases.</p> <p>Ministers are now on the front line.</p> <p>Proper accountability and scrutiny of our immigration system must continue, and it will need effective and strong leadership if the home office is serious about having a fully functional immigration system.</p> </blockquote> <p>The home affairs committee is now taking evidence about this from Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary at the Home Office, Rob Whiteman, the UKBA chief executive, and Simon Hayes, acting directo of the UKBA&apos;s international directorate.</p> <p>The BBC&apos;s Norman Smith is monitoring it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/316565666041823232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Shake up of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23UKBA\">#UKBA</a> to take effect from Monday</p>&mdash; norman smith (@BBCNormanS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/316565666041823232\">March 26, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/316567058018099200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Perm Secretary at Home Office Mark Sedwill says despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23UKBA\">#UKBA</a> changes \"most of us will be doing same job in same place\"</p>&mdash; norman smith (@BBCNormanS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/316567058018099200\">March 26, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5151b6b695cbbc3a59c25ea9\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T14:54:46.726Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May's statement on breaking up the UK Border Agency - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here&apos;s a summary of the main points in Theresa May&apos;s opening statement, with all the key quotes.</p> <p><strong>• May announced that the UK Border Agency (UKBA) was being split up.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government is splitting up the UK Border Agency. In its place will be an immigration and visa service and an immigration law enforcement organisation. By creating two entities instead of one, we will be able to create distinct cultures. First, a high-volume service that makes high-quality decisions about who comes here, with a culture of customer satisfaction for businessmen and visitors who want to come here legally. And second, an organisation that has law enforcement at its heart and gets tough on those who break our immigration laws.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said the two new units would be part of the Home Office because giving UKBA agency status was a mistake.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UKBA was given agency status in order to keep its work at an arm&apos;s length from ministers. That was wrong. It created a closed, secretive and defensive culture. So I can tell the House that the new entities will not have agency status and will sit in the Home Office, reporting to ministers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said she was setting up a new immigration strategic oversight board in the Home Office, chaired by the permanent secretary, Mark Sedwill.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In making these changes it is important that we do not simply create new silos. And that is why we are creating a strategic oversight board for all the constituent organisations in the immigration system — immigration policy, the Passport Service, Border Force and the two new entities we are creating — and that oversight board will be chaired by the Home Office permanent secretary.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said she was setting up a programme to modernise immigration IT.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UKBA&apos;s IT systems are often incompatible and are not reliable enough. They require manual data entry instead of automated data collection, and they often involve paper files instead of modern electronic case management. So I have asked the permanent secretary and Home Office Board to produce a new plan, building on the work done by Rob Whiteman, UKBA&apos;s chief executive, to modernise IT across the whole immigration system.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said she would introduce an immigration bill in the next session of parliament to make removing illegal immigrants easier.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Agency is often caught up in a vicious cycle of complex law and poor enforcement of its own policies, which makes it harder to remove people who are here illegally. That is why I intend to bring forward an Immigration bill in the next session of parliament that will address some of these problems.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said UKBA was being split up because its performance was &quot;not good enough&quot;.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Agency struggles with the volume of its casework, which has led to historical backlogs running into the hundreds of thousands. The number of illegal immigrants removed does not keep up with the number of people who are here illegally. And while the visa operation is internationally competitive, it could and should get better still. The home affairs select committee has published many critical reports about UKBA&apos;s performance. As I have said to the House before, the Agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008, and its performance is not good enough.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said Labour&apos;s decision to allow mass immigration was partly to blame of UKBA&apos;s problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In truth, the Agency was not set up to absorb the level of mass immigration that we saw under the last government. This meant that the Agency has never had the space to modernise its structures and systems and get on top of its workload.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She said UKBA had four specific problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe the Agency&apos;s problems boil down to four main issues. First, the sheer size of the Agency means it has conflicting cultures, and all too often focuses on the crisis in hand at the expense of other important work. Second, its lack of transparency and accountability. Third, its inadequate IT systems. And fourth, the policy and legal framework within which it has to operate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T14:54:59.130Z\">at 2.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5151b376b5795d794abf44de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T14:40:54.544Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>May&apos;s statement is now over. </p> <p>I&apos;ve got a text of her opening remarks, and I will post a summary soon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5151b29895cbbc3a59c25ea0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T14:37:12.517Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jane Ellison</strong>, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that high-performing business people will be able to get visas quickly.</p> <p>May says that is her plan.

It appears more like the scene of a Whitehall farce then a government agency operating in the 21st century.</p> <p>No sooner is one backlog closed, than four more are discovered. At this rate it will take 24 years to clear the backlog which still stands at the size of the population of Iceland. We were astonished to discover that MPs and applicants had been writing about cases yet 59,000 applications had not even been loaded onto the Agency’s computers. </p> <p>We are worried that given UKBA’s poor record of being transparent with the committee, the delays we know about could only be the tip of the iceberg. UKBA must publish a definitive list of all its backlogs and senior staff should not receive any bonuses until the backlogs are cleared.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5151a69795cbbc3a59c25e8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:45:59.363Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here&apos;s some reaction to the Mid Staffs statement.</p> <p>From <strong>Norman Lamb</strong>, the Lib Dem health minister</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The new duty of candour] is a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment that we are delivering on in Coalition. Poor care is simply unacceptable and staff at every level have a professional duty to speak up about it – and we will support them in doing so.</p> <p>The last Labour government ignored calls from the Liberal Democrats and campaigners to introduce a duty of candour.</p> <p>The new statutory duty of candour sends a very clear message about the importance of transparency and openness in the NHS.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Andy Burnham</strong>, the shadow health secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst we welcome much of what the Health Secretary has said today, it falls short of the full response to the Francis Report that the Prime Minister promised last month.</p> <p>Robert Francis made a very clear case for a new system of regulation of healthcare assistants to improve basic standards. Yet this didn’t feature in today’s response. Labour supports moves to rebalance nurse training to include more hands-on experience, but safe staffing is the glaring omission today. We will never get the right culture on our wards if they are understaffed and over-stretched.</p> <p>Things are already going in the wrong direction - the Care Quality Commission has recently reported that 1 in 10 hospitals in England do not have adequate staffing levels and just last week figures showed that there had been a reduction of 843 nurses between November and December last year. It is difficult for the NHS to deliver the standard of care that we all expect when there are now 5,000 fewer nurses. In last week’s Budget, the Department of Health handed £2.2bn from the NHS budget back to the Treasury - surely that money would have been better invested in the front-line and bringing all hospitals in England back up to safe staffing levels.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Mark Jones</strong>, head of the department of adult nursing at City University London</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Hunt has called for &quot;Front-line, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training.” But this is already a feature of our three year nursing degrees which have a 50/50 split between academic education and clinical practice experience.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Liz Kendall,</strong> the shadow care minister</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leicesterliz/status/316542031352696832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>V partial, pick &amp; mix response to Francis Report.

A culture in which the needs of patients are central, whatever the pressures of a busy, modern health service.</p> <p>As Robert Francis said: &quot;The system as a whole failed in its most essential duty – to protect patients from unacceptable risks of harm and from unacceptable, and in some cases inhumane, treatment that should never be tolerated in any hospital.&quot;</p> <p>At the heart of this problem, the current definitions of success for hospitals fail to prioritise the needs of patients. Too often the focus has been on compliance with regulation rather than on what those regulations aim to achieve. Furthermore, the way hospitals are inspected is fundamentally flawed, with the same generalist inspectors looking at slimming clinics, care homes and major teaching hospitals – sometimes in the same month ...</p> <p>We must also build a culture of zero-harm throughout the NHS. This does not mean there will never be mistakes, just as a safety-first culture in the airline industry does not mean there are no plane crashes. But it does mean an attitude to harm which treats it as totally unacceptable and takes enormous trouble to learn from mistakes ...</p> <p>The events at Stafford Hospital were a betrayal of the worst kind. A betrayal of the patients, of the families, and of the vast majority of NHS staff who do everything in their power to give their patients the high-quality, compassionate care they deserve.</p> <p>But I want Mid Staffs not to be a byword for failure, but a catalyst for change.</p> <p>To create an NHS where everyone can be confident of safe, high quality, compassionate care.</p> <p>Where best practice becomes common practice.</p> <p>And where the way a person is made to feel as a human being is every bit as important as the treatment they receive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5151a02d95cbbc3a59c25e88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:18:42.742Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a summary of the main points in the announcement. I have taken the text from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/putting-patients-first-government-publishes-response-to-francis-report\">the Department of Health&apos;s news release.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A culture of zero harm</p> <ul> <li>There will be a new regulatory model under a strong, independent Chief Inspector of Hospitals.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Chief Inspector will introduce single aggregated ratings. The Nuffield Trust rightly said that in organisations as large and complex as hospitals a single rating on its own could be misleading. The Chief Inspector will also develop ratings of hospital performance at department level. This will mean that cancer patients will be told of the quality of cancer services, and prospective mothers the quality of maternity services.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Chief Inspector of Hospitals will assess hospital complaints procedures.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The CQC will move to a new specialist model based on rigorous and challenging peer-review. Assessments will include judgements about hospitals’ overall performance including whether patients are listened to and treated with dignity and respect, the safety of services, responsiveness, clinical standards and governance.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A new Chief Inspector of Social Care will ensure the same rigour is applied across the health and care system. The merits of having a Chief Inspector of Primary Care are also being explored.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The NHS Confederation will review how we can reduce the bureaucratic burden on frontline staff and NHS providers by a third.</li> </ul> <p>Detecting problems quickly</p> <ul> <li>A new statutory duty of candour will ensure honesty and transparency are the norm in every organisation overseen by the CQC.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The new Chief Inspector of Hospitals will be the nation’s whistleblower- in-chief.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Publishing survival results improves standards, as has been shown in heart surgery. Survival rates for a further 10 disciplines, including cardiology, vascular and orthopaedic surgery will now be published.</li> </ul> <p>Deal with problems quickly.</p> <p>• A new set of fundamental standards will be introduced to make explicit the basic rights that anyone should expect of the NHS. They will be produced by the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, working with NICE, patients and the public.</p> <p>• Where these standards are breached, a new failure regime will ensure that firm action is taken swiftly. If it is not, the failure regime could lead to special administration with the automatic suspension of the Board.</p> <p>Accountability</p> <ul> <li>Health and social care professionals will be held more accountable.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>We will consider the introduction of legal sanctions at a corporate level for providers who knowingly generate misleading information or withhold information from patients or relatives.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the other professional regulators have been asked to tighten and speed up their procedures for breaches of professional standards.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Chief Inspector of Hospitals will also ensure that hospitals are meeting their existing legal obligations to ensure that unsuitable healthcare assistants are barred.</li> </ul> <p>Leadership</p> <ul> <li>NHS-funded student nurses will spend up to a year working on the frontline as healthcare assistants, as a prerequisite for receiving funding for their degree. This will ensure the people who become nurses have the right values and understand their role.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Nurses’ skills will then be revalidated, as doctors’ are now, to ensure their skills remain up to date and fit for purpose.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Healthcare support workers and adult social care workers will now have a code of conduct and minimum training standards, both of which are published today: <a href=\"http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/about-us/news/code-of-conduct-and-national-minimum-training-standards-for-healthcare-support-workers/\">www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/codeofconductandtrainingstandards</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Chief Inspector will ensure that hospitals are properly recruiting, training and supporting healthcare assistants, drawing on the recommendations being produced by Camilla Cavendish.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Department of Health will become the first department where every civil servant will gain real and extensive experience of the frontline.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:23:35.184Z\">at 1.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51519e6cb5795d794abf44d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:11:08.532Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Asked how will pay for the extra year that nurses have to spend as healthcare assistants, Hunt says the government will pilot this scheme, so that nurse training does inaccessible to applicants because of the cost.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51519db195cbbc3a59c25e87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:08:01.261Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Cash</strong>, a Conservative, says Sir David Nicholson should resign as NHS chief inspector because of his role in Mid Staffs.</p> <p>Hunt says he does not agree with Cash on this point.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51519d8795cbbc3a59c25e86\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-26T13:07:19.242Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour&apos;s <strong>Barbara Keeley</strong> accuses Hunt of ignoring the issue of staffing levels.</p> <p>Hunt says he is not ignoring this issue.

For over 60 years the NHS has done no more than pay lip service to the fundamental principle that if something goes wrong and a patient is harmed the health service should be open and honest about it. It&apos;s a cancer, if you like, that has been eating away at the NHS, it creates a culture of cover up and denial, which permits and tolerates bullying and intimidation of whistleblowers, as well as dishonesty with patients.</p> </blockquote> <p>An MP asks Hunt about Walsh&apos;s comments.</p> <p>Hunt says he heard them.

The threat has dispersed and diversified to the point where it might require more resources, because we&apos;re having to spread those resources across a wider geographical area.&quot; <br />There were 1,274 people referred to the Channel programme between January 2011 and December 2012, of whom 243 people received support. <br />The people referred to Channel vary in age, but schoolchildren have been supported by the initiative, Farr said. <br />Among the cases covered by the programme was an Asian man convicted of burglary who expressed anti-Western views in jail and was known to have viewed extremist videos online. <br />After a Channel-backed intervention, the man returned to education and re-established contact with his family.</p> <p>Farr said: &quot;I really believe Channel is an essential part of our counter-terrorism.

For that to have a chance, all Hunt&apos;s plans need to work – and others too.</p> <p>The litmus test of all these new policies, initiatives and laws will be whether they, individually and collectively, provide an answer to the key question that underpinned Robert Francis QC&apos;s mammoth public inquiry: will they mean that the appalling care seen at Mid Staffs never happens again?</p> <p>Only the most ardent optimist would answer unequivocally yes. But while they cannot realistically prevent any individual member of staff being cruel, callous or recklessly incompetent, they should greatly reduce the chances of Mid-Staffs-type failings recurring, given they were uniquely sustained and widespread.</p> <p>A beefed-up inspection regime involving month-long poking around for the biggest trusts and inclusion of medical experts among the inspectors will help put hospitals under the sort of pressure that the unique responsibilities of publicly funded healthcare demand, and embrace the need for constant improvement, especially if Hunt&apos;s intention of the public being able to see ratings for individual departments proves viable.</p> <p>He wants something akin to Ofsted&apos;s simple, parent-friendly ratings – an at-a-glance signal that a hospital is &quot;good&quot;, &quot;outstanding&quot; or something less. But, as the Nuffield Trust health thinktank told him just last week, the complexity and range of what hospitals do – providing many different types of care, potentially – makes one overall score, which he also wants, very hard to give.</p> <p>The yet-to-be appointed first-ever chief inspector of hospitals will have to resolve this, and other tricky issues about how new key processes will actually work.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s ideas combine an admirable amount of practicality as well as pragmatism. He has wisely resisted pledging to implement all of Francis&apos;s 290 recommendations. Instead, he said, ministers are following the spirit of them.</p> <p>Some of Francis&apos;s key recommendations are the subject of various ongoing reviews, such as whether individual NHS staff should become liable to prosecution if they harm or kill a patient.

In effect they will be debarred from training.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is expected to announce the move on Tuesday when he sets out the government&apos;s response to Robert Francis QC&apos;s report into the scandal.</p> <p>At the moment the basic tasks of caring for patients, which also include helping them get out of bed and going to the toilet, are mainly done by healthcare assistants or health support workers, who are paid much less than nurses and do not have their status.</p> <p>Ministers see the move as essential to ensuring the nursing profession rediscovers the values of compassionate care which critics claim has been lost amid pressure to meet NHS targets, rising numbers of patients and some nurses displaying appalling behaviour towards some patients. Critics also fear that too many nurses have become too detached from the fundamentals of patient care and avoid too much routine contact with patients, such as help with feeding and moving around for those who need it.</p> <p>Hunt will tell parliament on Tuesday what the coalition intends to do to overhaul many aspects of NHS care given Francis&apos;s damning criticisms of the &quot;NHS system&quot; and its self-interested &quot;culture&quot; which did not give enough priority to giving patients the best possible care.</p> <p>Ministers, civil servants and NHS chiefs have spent seven weeks studying the 290 recommendations made by Francis following his 31-month public inquiry into why such inadequate care at Stafford hospital was allowed to continue for so long.</p> <p>&quot;Frontline, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training. These measures are about recruiting all staff with the right values and giving them the training they need to do their job properly, so that patients are treated with compassion,&quot; Hunt said.</p> <p>In a speech last November he castigated some NHS staff for their involvement in cases of patient care which he said had included &quot;contempt&quot; and &quot;a kind of normalisation of cruelty&quot;.</p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing, which represents most nurses and student nurses, may not welcome new entrants to the profession having to perform tasks usually done by colleagues who are less well-trained and not strictly part of the clinical workforce, either before or during their training. They may see it as an unwanted blurring of the dividing lines between two groups of NHS staff and even as demeaning to nurses.</p> <p>Hunt&apos;s initiative follows an almost identical suggestion made by Francis. Recommendation 187 in his report said: &quot;There should be a national entry level requirement that student nurses spend a minimum period of time, at least three months, working on the direct care of patients under the supervision of a registered nurse. Such experience should include direct care of patients, ideally including the elderly, and involve hands-on physical care.&quot;</p> <p>He recommended: &quot;Satisfactory completion of this direct care experience should be a pre-condition to continuation in nurse training. Supervised work of this type as a healthcare support worker should be allowed to count as an equivalent.&quot;</p> <p>The change will be piloted before being made routine in England, Department of Health (DoH) sources said. Ministers will consider making other health professionals, notably health professionals such as physiotherapists, but not doctors, do the same as student nurses, depending on what those trials show.</p> <p>Hunt will on Tuesday also publish new minimum training standards and a code of conduct for support workers in health and social care, following concerns that some lack the skills needed. They will include what DoH sources described as &quot;clear requirements on behaviour and attitude&quot;. The standards will include training them in handling complaints from patients and relatives, reporting errors they have made or seen, recognising when a patient is undernourished or dehydrated, and talking properly to patients.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","wordcount":"728","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T00:02:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-25T23:07:20Z","internalComposerCode":"5696a825e4b052a54e7ed165","internalOctopusCode":"7406557","internalPageCode":"1885474","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:45Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Hospital doctors sweep in their white coats, wave their magic wands, and sweep out again. They may do the curing, but it is the nurses who the patient remembers from their stay in hospital. This is why the standard of nursing has to be high, and why the appalling care received by the patients at Stafford is a debacle for the whole NHS.</p> <p>Inquiry chairman Robert Francis QC was tough on nurses and particularly their leaders in his report. &quot;At Stafford, <a href=\"http://www.rcn.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Royal College of Nursing</a> (RCN) was ineffective both as a professional representative organisation and as a trade union. Little was done to uphold professional standards among nursing staff or to address concerns and problems being faced by its members.</p> <p>He added: &quot;A prime reason for this was the lack of effective representation from elected officers on site. Further, the support available from RCN officials at a regional and national level was limited.&quot;</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report\" title=\"\">report</a> is peppered with words like &quot;poor leadership, tolerance of poor standards, inadequate staffing levels, recruitment and training&quot;. Staff at Mid Staffs &quot;received only ineffective representation of concerns from the RCN&quot;. These criticisms were not just made about Mid Staffs. On 15 March, Ann Clwyd MP followed up her devastating attack on the nursing treatment her dying husband received at the University of Wales hospital in Cardiff, by saying that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21785732\" title=\"\">she had received 2,000 letters and emails from all over the UK</a>, with similar stories. If I were a leader of the RCN faced with such comments, I would go into a corner and hide.</p> <p>But not the leadership of the RCN. Its response seemed to shovel off most of the blame for Mid Staffs onto others who imposed inadequate staffing levels. &quot;There are important lessons that we all need to learn from the Francis inquiry, but surely one of the first is that trusts cannot be allowed to let staffing levels, particularly clinical posts such as nurses, fall to unsafe levels&quot;.</p> <p>So, it&apos;s not me guv; it&apos;s those nasty hospital managers. But, surely, it is the job of the RCN, to ensure that staffing levels are adequate for nursing standards to be maintained? The RCN welcomed Francis&apos;s recommendation for the registration and regulation of healthcare assistants. But it would, wouldn&apos;t it? One of Francis&apos;s main concerns about the RCN was that &quot;there is a concerning potential for conflict between the RCN&apos;s professional role of promoting high standards in nursing, and its union role of negotiating terms and conditions and defending members&apos; material and other narrow interests.&quot; The RCN has agreed to look into this, but I sense that its heart is not in it. It is altogether too big a change to contemplate.</p> <p>Indeed, the RCN&apos;s whole response is not focusing on Francis&apos;s damning criticisms about compassion and its failure to support or listen to the concerns of nurses at Mid Staffs. It appears to be in denial. I believe the leadership&apos;s response shows that it will be incapable of making the necessary changes called for by Francis. Bureaucrats do not change their spots.</p> <p>They must all resign. This is not scapegoating. Their initial response to Francis shows that they are not up to the massive task of splitting the RCN into two independent bodies – one for nursing standards and one a trade union. While on the subject of resignation, I announce my solidarity with <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-02-28/julie-bailey-we-want-his-resignation-if-not-his-sacking/\" title=\"\">Julie Bailey&apos;s campaign for the resignation of Sir David Nicholson</a>. Patients and their families have to stick together, particularly as the leaders of the medical profession, a string of former health secretaries and the prime minister have sprung to his defence. My own slant on Sir David is to compare him with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/28/british-approach-falklands-neglect-hope\" title=\"\">Lord Carrington, who resigned when the Argentinians invaded the Falklands in 1982</a>. For him it was a matter of honour, a quality absent from our political masters nowadays. </p> <p>PS: A neighbour, visiting her brother-in-law aged 93 in hospital last weekend, found him in a filthy condition. The nurses did jump to when she complained, but she should not have had to complain. The spirit of Mid Staffs lives on for the old in hospital. The RCN and the nursing profession have a massive mountain to climb. They do not appear to have the empathy, the will or the leadership skills to reach the top of that mountain.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>","wordcount":"791","commentCloseDate":"2013-04-08T07:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-21T13:02:49Z","internalComposerCode":"569669f2e4b0f2d1f22cf631","internalOctopusCode":"7389390","internalPageCode":"1883669","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2013-03-25T09:36:06Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-25T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3etze","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3etze"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2013/mar/25/mid-staffordshire-scandal-royal-college-of-nursing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/mar/25/mid-staffordshire-scandal-royal-college-of-nursing","webTitle":"How will nurses and their leaders respond to the Francis report?","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-25T08:30:00Z","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","sectionId":"healthcare-network","type":"article","id":"healthcare-network/2013/mar/25/mid-staffordshire-scandal-royal-college-of-nursing","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"healthcare-network","webTitle":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network","editions":[{"id":"healthcare-network","webTitle":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1885938","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-406272345","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364320743128/Nurses-to-face-hands-on-s-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Nurses to face hands on stint","caption":"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, address the Commons.

Imagine if the career progression of car designers depended on how well they scored on this miraculous metric. It is hard to picture exactly what mode of transport we would all be using but it would, without doubt, be a worse world to live in.</p> <p>This is not an attack on Which? or What Car? that regularly line up cars on various league tables of quality. They are very useful publications. It is an illustration of what was probably the most absurd part of Jeremy Hunt&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/26/failing-hospitals-nhs-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">statement</a> in response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-francis-report\" title=\"\">Francis report </a>on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p> <p>He promised us that &quot;in the future the chief inspector will ensure that there is a single version of the truth about how their hospitals are performing, not just on finance and targets, but on a single assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients&quot;.</p> <p>In itself, having a single official assessment of how well hospitals are performing is a perfectly sensible idea and should be welcomed. Indeed, most of what Hunt proposed was welcome and should, if executed effectively, go a long way to addressing the problems that occurred in Mid Staffordshire</p> <p>But there was a problem in the way he presented this particular aspect of his plans – one that risks repeating the failures of the past, one that reeks of the old NHS culture: the culture that led to the tragedies at Mid Staffordshire.</p> <p>A single assessment can be a useful tool. But not if you begin to believe it is the &quot;truth&quot; about quality or that you have made &quot;an assessment that fully reflects what matters to patients&quot;. After all, there are roughly 50 million NHS patients in England, ranging from infants to old people with dementia. You might be able to fully reflect what matters to some of them; or partially reflect what matters to all of them. But, as Abraham Lincoln would have said, had he worked in the NHS, you are never going to assess all of what matters to all of them.</p> <p>Hunt has identified quite rightly that we need more expert inspectors, more detailed information on quality, and regulators that exercise real judgments about where care is being provided to a good standard. But if quality in healthcare is not to be reduced once again to a tick-box exercise, we must avoid a world in which large central government agencies are tasked with identifying the &quot;single version of the truth&quot; when it comes to quality in healthcare.</p> <p>In Hunt&apos;s statement, most of the proposed changes related to increasing accountability upwards to regulators and government. Relatively few – such as the duty of candour – related to accountability directly to patients. This is pragmatic, in that it will have the biggest immediate effect. But it ignores the essential longer-term goal of increasing accountability directly to patients.</p> <p>Francis had some good ideas on how to achieve this. Unfortunately, they appear rather late in the report. That may be why they seem to have been ignored. It is a shame because they point towards a much more radical rebalancing of power and accountability in healthcare.</p> <p>Recommendation 244 says: &quot;Patients need to be granted user-friendly, real-time and retrospective access to read their records, and a facility to enter comments. They should be enabled to have a copy of records in a form usable by them, if they wish to have one.&quot; And: &quot;Systems should be designed to include prompts and defaults where these will contribute to safe and effective care, and to accurate recording of information on first entry.&quot;</p> <p>I want an NHS in which information about the standards of care I receive come to me first and regulators second. Currently we are building an NHS that does this the other way round. This needs to be reversed.</p>","wordcount":"670","commentCloseDate":"2013-03-29T18:15:19Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2013-03-26T17:49:15Z","internalComposerCode":"5685b7c0e4b0741a0d9c1239","internalOctopusCode":"7410647","internalPageCode":"1885938","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T16:27:36Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3emvf","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"11","internalShortId":"/p/3emvf"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt's dangerous belief in a single 'truth' about hospitals | Roger Taylor","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-26T18:15:19Z","sectionName":"Opinion","sectionId":"commentisfree","type":"article","id":"commentisfree/2013/mar/26/jeremy-hunt-hospitals-mid-staffs","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","editions":[{"id":"commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree","code":"default"},{"id":"au/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/commentisfree","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/commentisfree","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/commentisfree","webTitle":"Opinion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/commentisfree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/commentisfree","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":" Failing hospitals to be named and shamed in NHS care overhaul ","lastModified":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z"}]}}
