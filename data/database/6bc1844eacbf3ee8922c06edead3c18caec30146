The committee – which oversees GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 – will confirm that the investigation is a response to concerns raised by the Edward SNowden leaks. As my colleagues report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, said &quot;an informed and proper debate was needed&quot;. One Whitehall source described the investigation as &quot;a public inquiry in all but name&quot; …</p> <p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee also announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p> <p>It will also take written evidence from interested groups and the public, as well as assessing secret material supplied by the intelligence agencies. The Guardian will also consider submitting evidence.</p> <p>Conceding that public concerns had to be addressed, Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, added: &quot;There is a balance to be found between our individual right to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy\"> privacy</a> and our collective right to security.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>This inquiry is separate to a Commons home affairs select committee investigation into whether the Guardian endangered national security and potentially broke the law through its revelations.</strong> This will be part of a broader investigation into counterterrorism. This came after David Cameron told the Commons yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary, to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.</p> <p>So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.</p> </blockquote> <p>A spokesperson for the Guardian said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging. We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p> <p>That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded – along with the Guardian – for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>In other news, Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/16/pierre-omidyar-ebay-glenn-greenwald\">revealed</a> more details of the media organization he is creating with journalist Glenn Greenwald.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/15/glenn-greenwald-announces-departure-guardian\">Greenwald announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the Guardian</a>, where he has broken a series of stories on the National Security Agency, based on documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Greenwald will work alongside two of the investigative journalists at the heart of the NSA story, Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras.

Here are today’s headlines:</p> <p>• <strong>Former Labour cabinet minister Nick Brown has warned that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq\"> GCHQ</a> and Britain's other intelligence agencies appear to be undertaking mass<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> without parliament's consent because the coalition failed to get the communications data bill – the so-called &quot;snoopers' charter&quot; –&nbsp;passed into law after Liberal Democrat opposition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/15/former-labour-minister-spies-surveillance\">reports Rowena Mason</a>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The communications data bill – dubbed the &quot;snoopers' charter&quot; by critics – would have given GCHQ,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi5\"> MI5</a> and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\"> MI6</a> much greater powers to gather and save information about people's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet\"> internet</a> activities but it was shelved in the spring amid Lib Dem fears that it intruded too much into<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy\"> privacy</a>.</p> <p>Brown, a Labour MP, said that it &quot;looks very much like this is what is happening anyway, with or without parliament's consent&quot; under GCHQ's secret Tempora programme, which was revealed by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian\"> the Guardian</a> in July in reports based on files leaked by Snowden. Tempora allows GCHQ to harvest, store and analyse millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries by tapping the transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic …</p> <p>On Tuesday night, two other Liberal Democrat members of the joint committee also questioned why the Home Office did not reveal the extent of GCHQ's spying capabilities during the committee's inquiry, which concluded the bill carried a risk of &quot;trampling on the privacy of citizens&quot;. Lord Strasburger, a businessman, said nothing was mentioned about Tempora during two private &quot;no holds barred sessions with the Home Office&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>•&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mps-peers-may-snoopers-charter\">Here Alan Travis looks back</a> at the parliamentary scrutiny of the communications data bill.</strong> The bill is now stalled but, as Travis reports, reports of its death are likely to prove exaggerated. He quotes Strasburger as saying: &quot;I sat on the committee and the Home Office misled parliament by concealing that they were already doing what the bill would have permitted.&quot;</p> <p>•<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>, the home secretary, told the home affairs select committee there was nothing in the Snowden files that changed the case for new laws giving the security services more powers to monitor the internet.</strong> She also described the Guardian's publication of the material as &quot;damaging to the public interest&quot; and repeatedly rejected the need for a debate on oversight of the intelligence agencies. Afterwards, it emerged that Julian Smith, a Conservative MP, had written to the Metropolitan police asking the force to investigate whether the Guardian has broken the law by communicating intelligence information obtained from Snowden. The MP wrote to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to ask if offences had been committed under Section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>A Guardian spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The high public interest in the stories we have responsibly published is evidenced by the debates, presidential review and proposed legislative reforms in the US Congress, throughout Europe and in Westminster. We're surprised that, once again, it is being proposed that terror legislation should be used against journalists.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, mounted a defence of the ability of journalists at her own paper and at the Guardian to publish public interest stories based on the files leaked by Snowden.</strong> &quot;I think … that those articles are very much in the public interest and inform the public,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03dv2f0/Newsnight_15_10_2013/\">she said on BBC's Newsnight</a>. On claims by MI5 director general Andrew Parker that newspaper reports were causing &quot;enormous damage&quot; to the fight against terrorism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/16/new-york-times-snowden-leaks-abramson\">Abramson said</a> that there had been no proof of actual harm to security.</p> <p>•<strong> In a leader column, the Guardian argues that comments by four public figures have illustrated the security services’ lack of accountability.</strong> Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne said the National Security Council was never briefed on the Prism or Tempora surveillance programmes. Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, said parliamentary oversight was “sickly” and intelligence and security committee chair Sir Malcolm Rifkind badly compromised. And former ministers Lord Blencathra and Nick Brown revealed that the committee scrutinising<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/23/clegg-veto-snoopers-charter\"> the government's abandoned data communications bill</a> was never informed about GCHQ's existing and far more sweeping mass surveillance capabilities.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, therefore, is the pressing problem that faces Britain's political leaders. Our security services practice mass collection of communications metadata which, as an NSA official admits, &quot;tells you everything about somebody's life&quot;, terrorist or not. Neither the cabinet nor the parliamentary oversight, nor the legislative committee looking into snooping laws, has provided real accountability over such sweeping activity. In this, as in other respects, the security services enjoy a degree of legal and operational autonomy that exceeds what many MPs and ministers, if they knew about it, would judge appropriate. The head of MI5 says such discussion helps the nation's enemies. That is untrue. It is the unregulated surveillance that poses a threat to the nation, along with the threat from our enemies. Parliament urgently needs to exert a proper grip and to find a better balance.

QKD uses light protons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first part is the same: Data is encrypted using an algorithm. But then the data itself is encoded on a light particle known as a photon. Because photons are smaller than atoms, they behave in some pretty crazy ways. For example, you can “entangle” two photons so their properties correlate with one another. A change to one photon (which can occur as easily as by someone observing it) will cause a change in the other photon, even if the two are a universe apart.</p> <p>After entanglement occurs, the sender transmits the first photon through a fiber cable to the receiver. If anyone has measured or even observed the photon in transit, it will have altered one of the properties of photon no. 1, like its spin or its polarization. And as a result, entangled photon no. 2, with its correlated properties, would change as well, alerting the individuals that the message had been observed by a third party between point A and point B.</p> <p>This obviously makes no sense. Einstein called it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/427174/einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-paradox-older-than-thought/\">“spooky action at a distance.”</a>Richard Feynman said, “If you think you understand quantum theory, you don’t understand quantum theory.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Researchers have previously managed to send QKD 150 miles, but after that the photons began to &quot;decohere&quot;, and ID Quantique is working to extend that range. Its technology has already been used as part of <a href=\"http://www.battelle.org/media/press-releases/-first-commercial-quantum-key-distribution-protected-network-in-u.s\">Battelle's first commercial QKD</a> network in the US.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The victory of the NSA over existing encryption standards ... was a political one, as the agency used its influence to muscle technology companies into setting up backdoors. In other words, we can use the most unbreakable, state-of-the-art encryption techniques we want, but if the gatekeepers of this technology succumb to government pressure, then all the spooky science in the world can’t help us.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b6f7ab1-642b-4528-8e5b-76f20f089573\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/31/1338485543176/Protons-collide-in-the-La-008.jpg\" alt=\"Protons collide\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Two protons collide.

Indeed, one of the best reporters in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.duncancampbell.org/content/GCHQ\">Duncan Campbell</a>, works for Blackhurst's newspaper, and he was arrested and prosecuted by the UK government in the 1970s for the &quot;crime&quot; of disclosing the existence of the GCHQ.

If it’s that the security services monitor emails and phone calls, and use internet searches to track down terrorists and would-be terrorists – including, I now read, something called the “dark net” – I cannot get wound up about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>His second issue was this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the security services insist something is contrary to the public interest, and might harm their operations, who am I (despite my grounding from Watergate onwards) to disbelieve them?</p> </blockquote> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In August, this paper also received information from the Snowden files. We did not publish much of the information we were given because the Government, in the shape of a Defence Advisory Notice or “DA” notice, asked us to desist, in the interests of national security. Several times in my career, I’ve been served with a DA notice. On each occasion, I confess, I’ve not published. Does that make me a coward and an establishment lackey?

If the oversight politicians are as well-informed as they claim, they must have known that this was in part a cynical attempt to create retrospective legal cover for surveillance tools that were already secretly being used, but they said nothing. And when parliament refused to pass that law, clearly indicating that there was no democratic mandate for those tools, they still stayed silent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• And a Guardian leader column <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/13/press-freedom-state-surveillance-straw-editorial\">asks whether politicians can be trusted to supervise the security services</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do those who have oversight really understand today's technologies? And are they themselves free of personal inclinations? The former home secretary<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/11/jack-straw-edward-snowden-guardian_n_4084258.html?ir=UK+Politics\"> Jack Straw has been critical</a> of the Guardian's reporting.

In<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7szDhMKFRxcC&amp;q=sister#v=snippet&amp;q=sister%20communist&amp;f=false\"> his autobiography</a> there is a revealing passage in which MI5 tells him in 1974 that he and his family have been under<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> since Mr Straw was a teenager. They questioned him about his sexuality. They believed (probably falsely) that his sister was a communist. MI5 had notes of a pub conversation he had had with a &quot;politically suspect&quot; friend years earlier. Many people would find this deeply disturbing. Not Mr Straw, who was &quot;neither surprised nor shocked&quot;.</p> <p>Is it reassuring for the rest of us that Mr Straw went on to have responsibility for the work of our spy agencies as home and foreign secretary? Mr Straw accepted<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1473951/Straw-admits-Iraq-intelligence-was-wrong.html\"> the unreliable intelligence assessments</a> which led us into war in Iraq. He faces troubling questions (and<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17746561\"> civil proceedings</a>)<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215902/Jack-Straw-Misled-MPs-secret-rendition-Libyan-suspects.html\"> about rendition</a>.
