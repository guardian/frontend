Warner smashed 139 off 126 balls to reassert himself in the minds of selectors. In all, he hammered 13 fours and six sixes in his innings.</p><p>Warner's animated celebration upon bringing up his century from 96 balls, gave an indication of how much he needed a big score. However, his jubilation later turned to disgust, when he spooned one down the ground off Michael Neser.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was a major personal victory for Warner. To start the Ryobi Cup the left-hander had fallen for 4, 0 and 17, with pressure beginning to mount on his Test spot.</p><p>Warner missed the opening two Tests of the Ashes series in England after he was stood down for the Champions Trophy for punching Joe Root in a nightclub. He forced his way back into the team for the third Test at Manchester, after scoring a massive ton for Australia A in South Africa, but despite a 71 in the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street his place at the top of the Australian order was far from secure in a batting line-up that was struggling for consistency.</p><p>Warner was given a slap on the wrist for missing a Sydney grade match, and was warned by NSW chief executive Andrew Jones to cut out off-field distractions. Thursday, though, saw Warner return to his free-hitting best, as he scored his runs all around the ground.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208790|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|6e941062696a890f26e57eca7580194fa5ce32b5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The former Test bowler Craig McDermott will return as Australian bowling coach ahead of the Ashes series.</p><p>McDermott shocked Cricket Australia when he quit his post in May 2012 after a successful 12 months in the role.</p><p>He returns in a revised role specialising as Test bowling coach, with the incumbent Ali de Winter moving into a new position overseeing the limited overs' pace bowlers.</p><p>\"There is obviously a huge focus on regaining the Ashes this summer and I'll work as hard as possible to prepare our bowlers for the challenge ahead,\" McDermott said.</p><p>De Winter said he enjoyed coaching the T20 and 50-over formats and was excited by the \"challenge\" of his new role.</p><p>During his previous tenure, McDermott was credited for revitalising Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus and he was also behind the introduction of James Pattinson, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc into Test cricket. His philosophy was simple, wanting Australia's pace attack to bowl full and swing the ball.</p><p>McDermott said on Thursday he will work with Siddle on his consistency. \"I would like to get him [Siddle] up just a little bit higher with his consistency,\" said McDermott. \"We've got to have four-to-six guys bowling well from a fast bowling point of view to bowl in conjunction with our spinners ... we've got to make sure they're all firing.</p><p>\"I'd just like to talk to [Siddle] about a few things I've noticed over the last couple of months, and the same with a number of the other bowlers I've been watching on TV around the place.\"</p><p>McDermott added he would be taking a look at Mitchell Johnson. \"He's changed his run up, he's well balanced ... he's getting through the crease and his arm is higher than what it used to be,\" McDermott said. \"He's bowling anywhere between 145 and 153kph over the last couple of months ... and, if you're up around those figures and moving the ball a little bit either way, it's a handful and certainly his bouncer will be a handful as well.</p><p>\"We've got some good young guys in behind the scenes, who have been on some tours of late in Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Coulter-Nile. Obviously there's Ben Hilfenhaus who is back in the fray, fully fit.\"</p><p>In 2012, McDermott said he was quitting because of the impact of touring life on his young family. However, the narrowed role means McDermott won't have to spend as much time on the road and can work with the state and BBL teams in Australia.</p><p>\"Appointing coaches to specific roles is something the team performance department has been considering for some time,\" said the general manager of team performance, Pat Howard. \"Given the amount of cricket played now in all three forms of the game, we've been considering our coaching structure to get the best out of the players across the varied formats.\"</p><p>The Australia head coach, Darren Lehmann, said with the ICC World Twenty20 and the 50-over World Cup coming up over the next two years, it was important to specialise the assistant coaching role.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420200477|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|f851ccf7302ed44ace40fb930bfb8353ffcc4915 -->",

        "body":"<p>There will be no tears or fears for England in Australia, according to Jimmy Anderson. In the face of expected hostility from fiery crowds, England's second-highest wicket-taker insists the squad are well prepared for another Ashes tour full of drama, tension and \"pommy-bashing\".</p><p>Alastair Cook's side depart for the southern hemisphere on Wednesday in search of a fourth successive Ashes series win for the first time since the 19th century. Three years have passed since the start of England's last campaign down under, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/07/the-ashes-2010-11-england-australia\" title=\"\">which ended in a 3-1 victory for the tourists and a first series win on Australian soil since 1986-87</a>, and since then tensions between the two teams have simmered gently below boiling point.</p><p>For Anderson, who on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/england-james-anderson-new-deal-lancashire\" title=\"\">signed a one-year contract extension with Lancashire until 2015</a>, he will embark on his third tour of Australia having played in the 2002-03 one-day international series. A number of other players in the squad have featured twice in Ashes series on Australian soil and Anderson believes they already know what to expect from the home crowds.</p><p>\"In 2006-07 when we played there it was very apparent that they were not our greatest fans, so I don't think what has happened [since] will make it any worse. I think it will be a very partisan crowd, it always has been and it always will be,\" Anderson says.</p><p>\"It can't really get more hostile than when we've played there before. Australia in general is a quite intimidating place to play, they are very passionate and very vocal. It's something that thankfully we have experienced in the team, having played there before in good times and bad times. Hopefully we have enough experience to cope with it well.</p><p>\"I think the focus this time will be on Pommy-bashing. The best way to shut them up is to perform well, certain players cope with it in their own way. First and foremost it's important to win and hopefully that will silence the crowd.\"</p><p>The Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, stated in August that he wanted home fans to \"give it\" to Stuart Broad and make him cry following his decision not to walk in the opening summer Test at Trent Bridge when edging to slip.</p><p>Broad may be the prime target for abuse from spectators but Anderson has no concerns about his team-mate's ability to handle the pressure.</p><p>\"He got quite a lot in 2010-11 and dealt with it brilliantly,\" Anderson says. \"We all get stick when we go there, some more than others, and I think if you accept that, prepare for it and have a plan of how to deal with it, that goes a long way to dealing with it once you are there.\"</p><p>Anderson points to the change of management in 2009 as a key moment when the players' ability to handle abuse improved. During the ill-fated 2006 tour he admits the squad were too \"guarded\" but after Andy Flower's appointment as team director he says there was a fresh approach when confronted with hostility.</p><p>\"In 2006 I definitely felt that, and I certainly know that a number of wives and girlfriends felt that, walking down the street we were getting abuse,\" he says. \"But I think in 2010 we dealt with it better, we tried to interact more with the public and embrace their culture. In 2006 we were quite guarded and tried to stay in our own little bubble. I think we did things slightly wrong, we learned from that and last time we went there and tried to embrace it.</p><p>\"I remember a situation where we played golf and there were some people in the clubhouse by the tee, a couple of our guys duffed it and they said: 'I bet you're cricket is the same,' something like that. It was light-hearted and we had some interaction, rather than getting our heads down and shooting off.\"</p><p>The players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/hot-spot-england-ashes-australia\" title=\"\">will not have the benefit of Hot Spot when reviewing decisions during the upcoming series after Channel Nine opted to drop the infrared camera system</a> because of funding reasons – something Anderson describes as \"frustrating\".</p><p>However, the 31-year-old is relishing the opportunity to move closer to Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets and is hoping more consistency across the board will see England return victorious.</p><p>\"Australia are going to be fairly confident, I imagine, that they can beat us,\" Anderson says. \"We're going to have to improve on our performances throughout the summer if we are going to have a chance of winning out there.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420189401|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|38bb4ea43c9061dc60496f8135161982e520e040 -->",

        "body":"<p>The India trio Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan put on a batting masterclass as they chased down a huge target of 360 to win the second one-day international against Australia by nine wickets. Australia had looked set to take a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series after compiling 359 for five at Jaipur, with all of their top five contributing half-centuries and captain George Bailey leading the way with a brilliant unbeaten 92.</p><p>However, those knocks were all overshadowed by India's top three as  Sharma (141 not out), Kohli (100 not out) and Dhawan (95) saw the host nation romp home with more than six overs to spare.</p><p>Kohli's 52-ball knock, which included seven sixes and eight fours, was the fastest ODI century by an Indian and the seventh fastest ever, while Sharma was similarly destructive as he hit 17 fours and four maximums in his 123-ball innings.</p><p>Dhawan was no slouch either as he collected 14 boundaries before falling just short of his century when he edged the 86th ball he faced, bowled by James Faulkner, behind to Brad Haddin, who had earlier dropped the opener off a steepling leading edge when he was on 18. That wicket brought an end to an opening stand of 176 in 26 overs but was the only success Australia's bowlers enjoyed on what was a batsman's day.</p><p>Earlier, it was the India attack who found themselves on the receiving end of some brutal batting as Australia, who won the first ODI by 72 runs after scoring 304, again set what had appeared to be a tough target.</p><p>Their captain, Bailey, led the from the front with 92 off 50 balls, including five sixes and eight fours, while Phil Hughes (83), Shane Watson (59), Glenn Maxwell (53) and Aaron Finch (50) were also among the runs. The  total proved to be nowhere big enough as India chased it down in style to level the series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177686|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|b795d99389cda8b67e66971240a91d0947a4ffaf -->",

        "body":"<p>Moving day at the England and Wales Cricket Board, a cabinet reshuffle if you like. First came a surprise in the announcement of the former England wicketkeeper Paul Downton as the new managing director of England cricket in succession to Hugh Morris, thereby simultaneously giving headline writers a field day and securing the populist vote.</p><p>Then hot on the heels came a further announcement that Geoff Miller, the national selector, and a good diligent one at that, had, during the Ashes series this summer, asked to stand down at the end of the year. He will be replaced by James Whitaker, a natural progression for him as he has been one of three selectors for the past five years.</p><p>Downton, 56, who kept wicket first as a young prodigy for Kent and then, following a frustrating time as understudy to Alan Knott, Middlesex, as well as playing 30 Test matches for England, is an intriguing choice. His cricket career came to an abrupt end when a bail deflected into his eye while standing up to the stumps, severely damaging it in much the same way as was to happen to the South African keeper Mark Boucher last year.</p><p>He was, though, already pursuing a career in the City, and he went into this full time with JP Morgan Cazenove, the investment bankers with whom he has been for 17 years. His business experience will sit alongside a law degree from Exeter University as well as his playing and coaching qualifications. In addition to international success, which included playing in the 1981 and 1985 Ashes wins, the 1984-85 winning tour of India and the 1987 World Cup final, he won six county championship titles with Kent and Middlesex, and played in six winning finals at Lord's. He has for many years been an active committee member with Middlesex, the MCC and the ECB.</p><p>It is quite a CV and certainly he would appear to have the multifarious qualities that none of the numerous names mentioned in connection with the job could match and will be well received by both Andy Flower and England's one-day coach, Ashley Giles, both of whom were consulted and met Downton as part of the appointment process. On top of that he is an extremely decent fellow, which was not part of the job description but will stand him in good stead nonetheless.</p><p>The task he faces might well be seen as a different one to that of Morris, who came into the job - indeed was a party to creating it as part of the committee that produced the Schofield Report following the 2006-07 Ashes debacle. Most if not all of those recommendations are in place now, including the upgrading of the academy to a performance centre of excellence, and a beefing-up of the coaching structure. There has been a feeling that in the past year or so the system, if not stagnating exactly, had lost some dynamism. The new broom might just pep it up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420174650|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|e56b5d76dec605141a09b42c90c65f5aa992a673 -->",

        "body":"<p>Australia have set a date of 12 November for the announcement of their Ashes squad, more than a week before the start of the first Test in Brisbane. That leaves the players who have been encouraged by the coach Darren Lehmann to force their way into contention with early-season form only two rounds of Sheffield Shield fixtures in which to impress, and would seem to confirm the risk that England could be facing sketchy opposition in their three warm-up games.</p><p>England's first three-day match against Western Australia in Perth starts on 31 October, the day after the state side have started their Shield fixture against Victoria in Melbourne. It was very different on the last Ashes tour three years ago, when England faced a WA team including players such as Adam Voges, Steve Magoffin and captain Marcus North – and there have already been suggestions that Andy Flower will request the opposition is strengthened by the inclusion of \"spare\" players from other states.</p><p>Simon Katich, the former Test veteran currently playing in only limited-overs cricket for WA, has also been mentioned as a possible fill-in captain, although he still sounds reluctant to commit to first-class cricket at home after spending almost a full English summer playing for Lancashire.</p><p>England's second warm-up game is against an Australia A team in Tasmania. But the strength of that will be entirely down to the Australia selectors, and Lehmann will also presumably be consulted on whether his Test contenders would be better off facing England, or playing another game for their states. All six states are in action, with Tasmania in Queensland, WA at home to South Australia, and Victoria facing New South Wales – a likely fixture for Michael Clarke assuming the captain has recovered from the back problems that have ruled him out of the one-day tour of India.</p><p>England will then complete their preparations for The Gabba with a four-day match against NSW at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Again, they seem likely to be facing a state second team, as the game clashes with a Shield match between NSW and Queensland up in Brisbane – which could provide Clarke and any other Test players with a chance to familiarise themselves with the conditions at The Gabba a week before the Test.</p><p>But by that stage Australia's Test squad will have been picked. In arranging a media event to coincide with the announcement, this time for the unveiling of their new Centre of Excellence in Brisbane – the base for the former England batsman Graeme Hick, among others, in his new role as a batting coach – Cricket Australia has stirred unfortunate memories of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/07/the-ashes-2010-11-england-australia\" title=\"\">2010-11 series</a>, when for some reason they announced a 17-man squad for a home series, in miserable weather at Sydney's Circular Quay which set the tone for what was to follow, at least from an Australian point of view.</p><p>However, this time the squad is expected to be smaller and specifically geared to the first Test, as there is an unusually long break before the second match in Adelaide begins a full two weeks later.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420116666|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|922d087d3e63185f3bafaf320813f711891550cb -->",

        "headline":"Notes from the Pavilion: the week in Australian cricket",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/india-australia-odi-pune\">Australia have made the ideal start to their one-day series against India with a resounding 72-run win</a>. The victory also raises (slightly) the faint hope that Australia could achieve a 6-1 or better result in the series to claim an unlikely and frankly quite ludicrous first place in the ODI rankings.</p> <p>The captain, George Bailey, led the way with 85 at better than a run a ball and Aaron Finch (72 from 79 balls) played with uncharacteristic but pleasing restraint in another valuable top-order contribution. Glenn Maxwell played a virtually perfect “Glenn Maxwell innings”, with three sixes and a boundary before holing out at exactly the wrong time for a frenetic 31. The bowlers executed Bailey’s plans to perfection, spreading the wicket-taking load and never giving the Indian batsmen a moment of comfort. Mitchell Johnson regularly hit the 150kph mark and James Faulkner (27not out and 3-47) capped off another purposeful all-round performance with some crucial breakthroughs.</p> <p>The only real bum note for the Aussies was Faulkner’s calamitous attempted high-five on Brad Haddin, which ended with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/brad-haddin-injured-high-five-cricket\">the keeper leaving the field for treatment to an eye injury</a>. There’s always room for improvement.</p> <h2>Ponting spills the beans … again</h2> <p>One of the great things about the dawn of a new Australian summer is that it brings a slew of cricket books. Hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/673693.html\">Mike Hussey’s tales of splits and spats</a> comes Ricky Ponting’s, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/679155.html\">At the Close of Play</a>, the former Test captain’s first full-career retrospective. Advanced extracts of the book have proven controversial – as is the general intention of advanced extracts – with Ponting questioning the contribution of Michael Clarke’s contribution his successor’s stint as vice-captain.</p> <p>It has Ponting remembering, “It wasn't that he was disruptive or treacherous, and publicly he said all the right things, but he had never been one to get too involved in planning sessions or debriefs at the end of a day's play.” Ponting also laments that in downtimes, Clarke would “go into his shell”, but he concludes the passage by noting his concerns about Clarke’s suitability for the top job proved unfounded.</p> <p>The thing that really stuck out like a sore thumb was the use of the word “treacherous”. I can’t ever recall hearing Ponting use it, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/597878.html\">but then he’s always been at ease letting the ghostwriters go off and do their thing</a>.</p> <p>That all might be natural enough for a man with as many time commitments as Ponting but it's a shame when he uses ghostwriters because <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/ricky-ponting-says-cricket-australia-must-prioritise-national-squad-performance-over-big-bash-marketing/story-e6frf3g3-1226684111515\">when given the opportunity to speak his mind without a filter, he often delivers in spades</a>. This week Ponting also shot from the hip <a href=\"http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/215388-darren-lehmann-calls-on-former-australia-cricket-greats-for-ashes-answers\">when questioned by Fox Sports en route to Australia’s “batting camp” forum</a>, laying partial blame for Australia’s underperforming domestic batsmen at the feet of unsympathetic Australian curators.</p> <p>Ponting himself clattered 911 runs at an average of 75.91 on those very pitches in last summer’s Sheffield Shield, so the point probably bears some scrutiny.</p> <h2>The SACA Spuds</h2> <p>What a difference a week makes in domestic cricket. Having lambasted the stodgy opening cluster of games in last week’s blog, I couldn’t be more effusive in my praise of the Ryobi Cup this week. Big hitting, spectacular catching, tight finishes and the sight of fringe internationals running themselves into form have been just the fillip the competition needed. Dare I also say that the standard of cricket we’ve seen this week will far outstrip anything that’s coming in the Big Bash? Not bad for a supposedly unloved competition.</p> <p>South Australia suffered two narrow losses to Tasmania that has seen them slip almost completely from contention. In the first, Kane Richardson presided over a delightfully <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-domestic-2013-14/engine/current/match/669239.html\">shambolic final over Redbacks’ two-wicket loss to the Tigers</a> and I don’t think it’s hyperbole to call this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsIJ2JNvBQA\">the worst botched run-out in cricket history</a>, especially given that Richardson virtually threw the match away as a result. Sadly, Michael Klinger’s unbeaten 140 was rather lost amid the Richardson-induced laughter.</p> <p>In the follow-up bout at Bankstown, Klinger again gave Messrs Inverarity and Marsh a gentle nudge with 74 of his side’s 210 before Ben Hilfenhaus clubbed the winning boundary off Joe Mennie’s penultimate ball to virtually end South Australia’s tilt at the title. The Redbacks need to win all of their remaining games to be a chance.</p> <h2>Not much Cutting but plenty of biffing</h2> <p>In contrast to the woes of the Redbacks, Queensland opened their account with two spirited wins against Western Australia and Victoria respectively. Against the Warriors, veteran gloveman Chris Hartley (64) and man-of-the-match Nathan Reardon (92) navigated the Bulls out of early trouble to post a respectable total of 202 before their bowlers made short work of a patchwork Western Australian outfit, who crumbled to be all out for 118 inside of 43 overs.</p> <p>Two days later against the undefeated Bushrangers, a patient 62 from Usman Khawaja and a typically freewheeling 41 from Chris Lynn set the platform for lower-order biffer Ben Cutting to unleash <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-domestic-2013-14/engine/current/match/669245.html\">a succession of hail marys onto the banks of North Sydney Oval</a>. The tall paceman clubbed an unbeaten 98 from just 48 deliveries with nine towering sixes.</p> <p>In truth the Vics only had themselves to blame, with John Hastings looking to solve the problem of having his full tosses and half-trackers bashed around by, well, bowling more full tosses and half-trackers. Cutting had entered the crease at 6-168 and a total of 250 looking optimistic. In the end the late flurry dragged them to an unassailable 305. Despite half-centuries to Rob Quiney and the resurgent Cameron White, the Bushrangers fell 26 runs short with Luke Feldman snaring 5-57 from his nine overs and Cutting picking up two wickets and man-of-the-match honours, a whopping $500 cheque from Ryobi. He deserved a meat tray as well.</p> <p>Elsewhere Steve Smith (73 not out) kept his momentum in <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-domestic-2013-14/engine/current/match/669247.html\">guiding NSW to a five-wicket win against the Warriors at Hurstville Oval</a>. At Hurstville Oval the Bulls were limited to 241 (Khawaja 66, Moller 50) by Evan Gulbis’s four wickets before Tassie’s slow-burning chase ended with a grandstand finish. Tigers spinner Clive Rose (26*) <a href=\"http://p.imgci.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/86900/86937.jpg\">was surely told by society that he should be an accountant</a> but he didn’t listen, rising to the occasion and smashing a six to claim a last-gasp win for his side.</p> <p>One man missing from the Tigers line-up at the moment is injured crowd favourite Mark Cosgrove, who has done his <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/mark-cosgrove-hopes-it-will-all-be-worth-the-weight/story-fndpt0dy-1226738617396\">Australian chances no harm by shedding 16kg in the off-season</a>.</p> <p>On the North Sydney Postage Stamp, the Bushrangers ran rampant to the tune of 331. Cameron White continued to make hay with a brutish 76 from 50 deliveries, while new skipper Matthew Wade chipped in with 74 of his own. The Warriors were at first strangled by Scott Boland’s tight opening spell before losing their heads and their wickets; when Marcus North (13) and John Rogers (37) both holed out in the one over of Jon Holland’s (4-48) spin, the game was as good as over. Simon Katich (67) did his damnedest to drag the Warriors back into it but they fell 59 runs short.</p> <h2><strong>Cricket Australia mixing their drinks</strong></h2> <p>It would appear that cricket Australia wants to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-15/ca-panned-for-knocking-back-anti-alcohol-ad/5022760\">have their beer and drink it too</a>. Or not have their beer, depending on which sponsor they’re speaking to. With the Healthway-backed “Alcohol. Think Again Western Warriors” due to face off against the “XXXX Gold Queensland Bulls” again next week, things have quickly come to a head with CA bouncing the “alcohol and sport don’t mix” component of Healthway’s ground advertising.</p> <p>Healthway are basically trying to get Wilt Chamberlain to wear a promise ring at this point but as beer-soaked as Australian cricket history may be, it would be silly to suggest that this was anything other than a purely commercial decision. It’s less a case of whether CA’s glass is charged, more remembering how their bread is buttered.</p> <p>The scuffle can be quickly reduced to these bare facts: alcohol sponsorship like CUB’s reported $65m five year deal with Cricket Australia is always going to take strategic precedence over Healthway’s $2.1m three-year deal with the Waca. Feel-good philosophy aside, Healthway have brought a can of lemonade to a gun fight. That might not be fair but it’s business. So rather than just decrying this reliance on sponsorship from breweries and betting agencies, perhaps a more constructive conversation would centre on just exactly how Australian cricket would cope without their money. We might also ask whether CA is doing enough to find such considerable sponsorship dollars elsewhere.</p> <p>Right <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/health-groups-hit-out-as-cricket-chiefs-bat-for-alcohol-ads-20131014-2viv4.html\"><strong>here</strong> </a>I will give Healthway some leeway though, because it’s a little bit rich for CA to claim that their advertising slogan “conflicted with our continuing position on the relationship between alcohol and sport, which is one of consumption in moderation.” If CA honestly believes that “Australian cricket has a responsible relationship with alcohol”, I guess we’re to take it that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMvV9RaNZAQ\">certain high profile CUB promotions</a> of the recent past were merely aberrations. If you’re talking about David Boon’s drinking prowess, “moderation” is hardly the first word that springs to mind.</p> <p>I’m scoring this one a nil-all draw between the marketing people.</p> <h2>Some digital food for thought</h2> <p>It may be de rigeur to give Cricket Australia a regular kicking and their current website is quite rightly the butt of many jokes, but one brilliant thing they have done for fans in the past few seasons is make a live stream available for domestic games. For the time being that means an online simulcast of GEM’s Ryobi Cup coverage, but if you like your cricket with less Brad McNamara, the commentary-free Sheffield Shield stream is not far away on the horizon. Others have meditated on the appeals of this service <a href=\"http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/cutsandglances/index.php/theaustralian/comments/silent_running/\">with much more depth than I</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/670523.html\">In a far-reaching post from Mike Jakeman</a>, which is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Saving-Test-Mike-Jakeman/dp/0957141033/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380619807&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=saving+the+test\">an edited extract from his forthcoming book</a>, we can see that CA might have really hit on something substantial with the streaming content. Drawing conclusions based on the similarities between international cricket and privately-owned US sports franchises may be fraught, but CA no doubt has one eye on the gains made by Major League Baseball in embracing digital platforms in the US. In the meantime, free online access to domestic cricket is something for every cricket fan to enjoy.</p> <h2>Player of the week</h2> <p>He took wickets, <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/domestic-cricket/queensland-allrounder-ben-cutting-leads-bulls-to-victory-over-victoria/story-fn5k3dvc-1226739199609\">he pasted the Victorians to all corners of the North Sydney Oval </a>and our inaugural player of the week also managed to bypass Channel Nine’s stump-cam swearing filter in a succinct rebuttal of some John Hastings sledging. Hats off, Ben Cutting!</p> <h2>Tweet of the Week</h2> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/13DSmith/statuses/387531658447949824\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Horrible bosses on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel9\">@Channel9</a> one of the greats!

Playground bragging rights this week must surely go to Toombul Cricket Club’s Under 13s. Dedicated to the point of training on Saturday mornings, the boys were thrilled to receive a surprise visit from some of their cricketing idols as they finished up their weekend net session.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to the group, Australian fast bowler Ryan Harris had been cleared to make a rare appearance for the club’s seniors and stopped by the session with club captain Chris Lynn and fellow Bull Luke Pomersbach. “When the boys saw Ryan Harris they were speechless,” said their coach and Warehouse Cricket Association president Damian Sharry. After an impromptu Q&amp;A session with the players, the juniors hung around to see Harris steam in and take a wicket with his third delivery. If that doesn’t turn them into cricket lifers, nothing will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419974257|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|cff96022f81ebbcedc2e713eb5cf9253d305c536 -->",

        "body":"<p>To the uninitiated, cricket is as esoteric as the Kabbalah. To those in the know it, is a game of grace, speed and power. And therein hides the magic, because for many of its fans cricket is almost a philosophy, a way of life embodying a certain sporting spirit that can be carried into other areas of life. Some of the spectators may look half asleep, but in fact they're meditating on the finer points of play while keeping one eye on the weather and the other on the bar.<br /> <br />We begin with <strong>Papa M's I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</strong>, which is worth its selection as an opener for the title alone. A beautiful and strange instrumental, building its guitar structures slowly, evoking a hot day at county level, and lasting about as long as it takes to sip a pint in the sun.<br /> <br />History is inseparably tied to sport. <strong>Latif Nangarhari's Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</strong> celebrates his country's admission to the highest level of world cricket. The music is traditionally based and very energetic, while the lyrics are in Pashto, giving Latif access to about 60 million speakers, though he lives in Birmingham these days.<br /> <br />Across the world in Los Angeles, the Compton Cricket Club is bigged in by <strong>Cloth's Bullets</strong> – a song, like the CCC itself, dedicated to fighting homelessness and gang culture with civility and dignity.<br /> <br />Over to the south-eastern Caribbean to Trinidad and Tobago now for an exuberant soca take on the game, <strong>Machel Montano and Claudette Peters's Come Rise with Me</strong>. Guaranteed to get the crowd on its feet.<br /> <br />While we're in the Caribbean we might as well catch <strong>I-Roy's Tribute to Michael Holding</strong>. Known as \"Whispering Death\" because of his quiet approach to the crease, Holding was one of the fastest bowlers ever to play Test cricket. \"Michael Holdin', his performance was golden\", declares I-Roy, in reference to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYyJllsj68\">Holding's six-ball destruction of England captain Geoffrey Boycott in Bridgetown in 1981</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>The Duckworth Lewis Method's Third Man</strong> melodically shares with us the thoughts of an unsuccessful fielder who has been stranded in the middle of nowhere by his team captain in order to keep him out of trouble. He's dreaming of tea, in between recalling film scenes from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36181/third.man\">The Third Man</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>Roots Manuva's Again and Again</strong> describes the improvement gained by a poor batsman. Or at least the video does, expressing amusingly some of the philosophy embedded in cricket's traditions.<br /> <br /><strong>Jah Thomas's Cricket Lovely Cricket</strong> informs us that the game is actually quite straightforward. Forget philosophy: \"All you got do is lick the ball before it reach the wicket.\"<br /> <br />It's not all glory though – as one country ascends, another declines. Back in 1990, fans of the Windies were wallowing in disappointment. Calypsonian <strong>David Rudder's Rally Round the West Indies</strong> pleads with the fans not to give up hope, using the team's misfortunes as a metaphor for wider political struggles.<br /> <br />In an earlier song, <strong>Lord Relator's Gavaskar Calypso</strong>, we note cricket's innate sportsmanship as Relator tells us that India's Sunil Gavaskar was the master batsman: \"We just couldn't get him out.\"<br /> <br />Apparently rain stopped play in <strong>Pavement's Carrot Rope</strong>. They got beaten, and \"the wicket keeper is down\". In the video they're adequately attired for British cricket in yellow rain macs.<br /> <br /><strong>The Cavaliers' It's a Beautiful Game</strong> simply wants us to love the sport of cricket, encasing the names of dozens of its most famous exponents within a gorgeous melody.</p><h2>The list</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDNANxKOVbM\">Papa M – I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FKZNQrfug\">Latif Nangarhari – Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKa2mp5ePes\">Cloth – Bullets</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN7rMnuxYIU\">Machel Montano and Claudette Peters – Come Rise with Me</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzJ5PpZ1BdE\">I-Roy – Tribute to Michael Holding</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WHQpg_3ZS4\">The Duckworth Lewis Method – Third Man</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRxYNTH-5Go \">Roots Manuva – Again and Again</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZWCRCgRsI\">Jah Thomas – Cricket Lovely Cricket</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MgkoLKMr0\">David Rudder – Rally Round the West Indies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tBp1ClIDys\">Lord Relator – Gavaskar Calypso</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxehrvhNMY8\">Pavement – Carrot Rope</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8FczAAeHM\">The Cavaliers – It's a Beautiful Game</a></p><p>• Listen to these songs on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4N9xNEcg2jtJlPUOZfmk_&amp;feature=mh_lolz\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p><p>• See all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jul/18/readers-recommend-songs-cricket\">last week's blog</a>, from which sonofwebcore selected the songs above.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413611530|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|e83d929e21d3a6539dfb6512d632dd1952f680a7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Who would dare call Test cricket boring now? In a nerve-shredding denouement to an opening Ashes Test that had already contained enough plot twists to last the entire summer, England sealed a narrow victory in dramatic circumstances.</p><p>With Australia requiring just 15 runs to secure an unlikely victory thanks to a heroic last wicket stand of 65, England fast bowler and man of the match Jimmy Anderson claimed his 10th and final wicket – but not before a lengthy delay while the decision was referred to the third umpire, Marais Erasmus, in a Test where the use of technology has become a significant talking point.</p><p>Eventually, as the decision was confirmed, the England players in the middle and the majority of the crowd erupted in an explosion of joy and relief.</p><p>On the pitch the umpire Aleem Dar was forced to overturn his original decision and confirm that Brad Haddin, who had taken Australia to the brink of victory with a defiant innings of 71, had nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Matt Prior, awarding England victory in a Test match that had swung as wildly as some of Anderson's bowling.</p><p>The match had already taken in a teenage debutant, Ashton Agar, who had scored 98 batting at No 11, a controversial incident in which England player Stuart Broad had refused to walk despite clearly being out, and an innings by Ian Bell for the home side that was widely regarded as his best ever.</p><p>\"I don't think I've played in a Test where the momentum has changed quite so quickly and so often. I'm glad we managed to scrape through in the end,\" said a relieved England captain, Alastair Cook.</p><p>\"I always said I would be the only England captain not to go bald in the job but days like this won't help that.\"</p><p>For those England fans among the packed crowd watching in almost eerie silence as fingernails were bitten to the quick and early optimism evaporated, there were unmistakable echoes of the Edgbaston Test during the summer of 2005. Then, during an epic series that ultimately saw England regain the Ashes after a gap of 18 years, the home side had prevailed by just two runs following a similarly unlikely run chase by Australia that fell just short.</p><p>After the emotion and drama of last summer's London Olympics and with no major international football tournament, 2013 was supposed to be a quieter sporting summer.</p><p>Yet in the space of eight dramatic days, the British and Irish Lions have won their first series since 1997, Andy Murray has become the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years and now England have secured victory in the opening Ashes Test of a back-to-back home and away series in thrilling style.</p><p>The use of the controversial DRS system that became a huge talking point when Broad refused to walk after edging a ball to slip at a crucial point during England's second innings again worked to England's benefit at the climax of the match.</p><p>Australia captain Michael Clarke, who was unable to review the dismissal of Broad because he had already made two unsuccessful appeals during that innings, said afterwards he would have to \"get better\" at using the system.</p><p>In the case of Haddin, who had set England hearts racing as he took Australia to the brink of victory in conjunction with 11th man James Pattinson, the decision was the right one.</p><p>Such a nailbiting climax had looked unlikely earlier in the day as Anderson secured three wickets in 24 seemingly game-changing balls, including that of Agar.</p><p>But then Haddin and Pattinson began spraying the ball around Trent Bridge as England's momentum stalled. Steven Finn dropped Haddin in the deep and Jonny Bairstow missed a chance to run the same player out.</p><p>The Barmy Army fell silent and the Australians began dreaming of just the 13th one wicket victory in Test history.</p><p>Australia emerged from lunch needing just 20 to win, buoying the mood of the Fanatics in the crowd and leaving the singer employed to serenade the players with Land of Hope and Glory during the break in danger of looking foolishly premature. But then came one final twist.</p><p>After the game Anderson, who bowled 13 overs in an energy sapping spell before lunch before succumbing to cramp, playfully chided Cook for also dropping a catch earlier, off his bowling, that might have helped avoid the need for such drama.</p><p>Given all the breathless action so far, it seems scarcely credible that the Test that will begin at Lord's on Thursday is just the second of the summer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412809738|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|ccd5b9e8b215367dca9cf72a07b880af58c23db6 -->",

        "headline":"Ashes 2013: all eyes turn to cricket for a great British summer",
        "body":"<p>The oldest rivalry in cricket reconvenes on Wednesday when, from 11am, England take on Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, a moment eagerly anticipated by players and supporters alike, not least because it's been known for an entire series to be shaped by events on the first morning.</p><p>Whether they will still be as enthusiastic by 7 January next year, after the teams have played 10 Test matches at up to five days apiece home and away, not to mention a slew of Twenty20 and one-day clashes, is a moot point to say the least. With back-to-back Ashes Tests in the same year for the first time, the next six months represent the most concentrated spell of Ashes cricket in its 131-year history.</p><p>But for David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the impending avalanche of Ashes can't be too much of a good thing.\"On the contrary, it has created intense excitement. I don't see how it can diminish the achievement. If we can retain the Ashes over two series, then it would be an even greater achievement,\" Collier said.</p><p>\"All the tickets are gone. Sold out. You've only got to look at the demand for tickets, at the fact we've got 300 clubs signed up to show the action on big screens, to see how big it is. I don't think anything in cricket captures the imagination of the British public more than the Ashes series.\"</p><p>Collier said England's cricketers would go into Wednesday's first Test hoping to build on the feelgood factor created by the Lions rugby union side and Wimbledon winner Andy Murray. Following a wet summer in 2012 that was dominated by the Olympics, this year is seen as a crucial barometer for the health of the sport in a year without a major football tournament to draw the attention.</p><p>The climactic fifth Ashes Test in August  at the Oval, south London, was sold out before Christmas for the first time and the same was true at Trent Bridge. \"We couldn't process the orders quickly enough,\" said a Trent Bridge spokesman.</p><p>David Cameron, the day after his No 10 reception with Murray, released a message of support for England: \"Whether you remember Botham and Willis at Headingley, like I do, or Kevin Pietersen's defiant stance at the Oval in 2005 – I remember where I was when that happened – nothing captures the public's imagination quite like a Test match against Australia. The nation's got high hopes. We're right behind the team, and I'm sure they're going to rise to the occasion. So best of luck from everyone at Downing Street to [England captain] Alastair Cook and the boys.\"</p><p>Collier said the huge demand for tickets proved the switch to pay TV in 2005 had not diminished cricket's appeal,  despite concerns it had lessened its ability to become part of the national conversation.</p><p>The back-to-back series have been scheduled to realign the Ashes so they do not take place in the same year as a cricket World Cup, which is due to be held in Australia and New Zealand in 2015.By next January, Cook's sside could have won four Ashes series in a row.</p><p>The Australians are in some disarray, after a 4-0 Test series defeat in India and a disappointing showing in the Champions Trophy, interspersed with an unsavoury incident in a bar when David Warner aimed a punch at young England batsman Joe Root at 2am. Warner, a batsman, was fined £7,000 and suspended until the start of the first Test.</p><p>As a result, Cricket Australia sacked their coach Mickey Arthur just 16 days before Wednesday's opener. He was replaced by straight-talking Darren Lehmann, a move which former players including Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath have said can give Australia back their momentum.</p><p>But some former England players, including Sir Ian Botham, have predicted a 10-0 whitewash.</p><p>Collier said it would be closer than that and, even if England won relatively easily, it wouldn't diminish the appeal of one of the oldest and most keenly fought rivalries in sport. When England won in 2005, it was the first time they had captured a series since 1987.</p><p>The ECB points to the strength of the elite game, where England have prospered since regaining the Ashes in 2005, and further investment in the grassroots to justify the removal of live coverage of the sport from free-to-air TV.</p><p>Sky, gearing up for a battle with BT Sport, has renamed one of its channels Sky Ashes and will screen only cricket on it for the summer.</p><p>Aside from the investment of £260m over four years, Sky says it is able to devote more resources and airtime to the sport. Yet some insist something has been lost along the way, including the ability to inspire children whose parents may not be cricket fans.</p><p>\"All the objective facts totally rubbish that argument. What is critical to engaging people is local club facilities and local coaches. We have invested a lot of time and a lot of effort and that's paid off. People tend to forget there was no terrestrial bid for cricket on the table, so it's a redundant argument,\" said Collier.</p><h2>No fanfare for fans</h2><p>England's players have failed in an attempt to get Billy Cooper – aka Billy the Trumpet – into Trent Bridge so he can help England's \"Barmy Army\" create a raucous atmosphere.</p><p>Players Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann, among others, have been lobbying administrators to force the ground to change its policy of not allowing entry to those with musical instruments, but to no avail.</p><p>Pietersen said the team's pleas had \"fallen on deaf ears\", while Swann added: \"Personally, I think it's a shame. I know the whole team are behind Billy, and the Barmy Army are a massive part of the English team.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412490118|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|a6e51fd85a21e6f578202001f084dbb3041ca161 -->",

        "headline":"Harold 'Dickie' Bird: this much I know",
        "body":"<p><strong>I gave my life to cricket, it's as simple as that. </strong>I never got married because I&nbsp;was married to the game.</p><p><strong>My father came to watch me play often, </strong>but I never knew he was there. That's&nbsp;how parents should be. He worked as a miner from when he was a boy until the day he turned 65 and retired. He kept on to me: \"This is no life for you.\" We both saw sport as a way out.</p><p><strong>For the first time in my life I'm beginning to feel my age.</strong> Four years ago I had a stroke, but I'm soldiering on. It has made me very emotional – I have always felt things very deeply, but more so now. Some mornings I can't face getting up, but you force yourself. I do my exercises, have a shave, and get on with it.</p><p><strong>I realised early on that nothing would come easy. </strong>One time I scored 181 not out, and straight after the chairman came to me and said: \"Well played, but you&nbsp;will be back in the second XI next week.\"</p><p><strong>My mother made me go to church every Sunday, </strong>morning and evening, and I'm glad she did. I still go, and I say my prayers every night, though since I have a new knee I have to sit on the edge of the bed rather than kneel.</p><p><strong>You learned a lot about politics in Yorkshire cricket. </strong>You learned to be hard, determined. That wasn't natural for me. But I did it all the same.</p><p><strong>I always lived out of a suitcase, </strong>but it never struck me as a lonely life. Depression seems to have come in the game more these days.</p><p><strong>I do believe in miracles.</strong> One morning I woke up completely blind.  The doctor said it was down to all the years I had stood on a cricket field in  the sun. The operation was a huge gamble and it took three months for me  to see again. But&nbsp;I thanked the good Lord – and the surgeon – when I did.</p><p><strong>A good night's sleep </strong>was my best friend as an umpire.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/dec/28/guardianobituaries.cricket\" title=\"\"><strong>Kerry Packer</strong></a><strong> offered me a huge amount of money</strong> to join his tour in the 1970s. I thought about it a lot, then and since, but I wanted to stand by the establishment, the game I knew. <strong>As an umpire you had to be a bit detached.</strong> But watching those great players at close quarters – Dennis Lillee, Garfield Sobers, Ian Botham – was a thrilling thing. What you really wanted to do was applaud.</p><p><strong>I never found it hard to see the ball. </strong>The quickest bowler I ever saw was Frank&nbsp;Tyson. Fifty-odd years ago when I was batting he hit me with a ball on the inside of the jaw at Scarborough. I can still feel that now.</p><p><strong>Whatever job you do –</strong> dustman, cricketer, doctor – any pressure you bring you bring on yourself.</p><p><strong>Before I went out in the middle I would meditate,</strong> have a bit of quiet. You&nbsp;see, you need to relax to be ready for anything.</p><p><strong>If I have one regret, it is not having a family. </strong>I'd have liked to watch a lad or a&nbsp;grandson playing sport. I miss it more now than ever.</p><p>80 Not Out: My Favourite Cricket Memories <em>by Dickie Bird is out now (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £20).

Boult was spent but to the roars of the crowd, he thrashed the ball into an unresponsive pitch for the last time, Prior defended and then raised his arms in triumph. England had survived the match and earned themselves a draw in the series by the skin of their teeth. </p><p>It was a day for heroes, players who reined in their natural instincts to carve out one of the great rearguards for only three teams previously had entered the final day of a Test with four wickets down and survived to the end of the day.</p><p>First came Ian Bell, who batted with skill and monumental application for almost six hours, making 75, only to be dismissed, to his obvious distress, on the very stroke of tea. Then there was Stuart Broad, whose batting has deteriorated to such an extent since his century against Pakistan that the life expectancy of each innings since has been four overs. Broad batted for two hours and seventeen minutes, the first 103 minutes of which were scoreless, longer than anyone in Tests has ever gone without opening their account and in terms of deliveries, 62 balls, only 15 shy of that record. He survived until the shadows were lengthening and there were just 21 deliveries remaining.</p><p>Then there was Monty Panesar, called upon at the very death to reprise his Cardiff heroics and doing so nervelessly apart from one harem-scarem scampered single to get off the strike that ended with a swallow dive so mistimed that it left him still a foot short of the crease and scrabbling desperately to get home.</p><p>Above it all though was Prior. His unbeaten 110 was the seventh century of his Test career and by a distance his best given the responsibility he was handed in seeing things through once Bell had departed head down to the dressing room. Only Les Ames, of England wicketkeepers, has more, with eight.</p><p>Prior rode his luck. An early attempted pull was mistimed barely out of reach of a desperately backpedalling mid wicket. One ferocious bouncer to him clipped him on the head, looped over him and dropped onto the stumps without dislodging the bails. He had 28 then. Indeed the only time he seemed disconcerted was when Neil Wagner, the battling left armer, hurled in his clever variations of slow and faster bouncers. Prior felt the need to take them on as the best means of defending against them, and several times pulled the ball just out of reach of fielders placed short on the legside for that purpose. That which he just scraped over the top of midwicket to bring up his hundred was greeted with his own cry of admonishment, furious with himself for getting sucked in. Given the defensive nature of his task, his innings, over 182 deliveries, still ranks as brisk and there were 20 boundaries. </p><p>Although the result means that they just retain their position as the number two ranked side, and the extra cash that goes with it, the England euphoria that accompanied the result cannot camouflage the fact that in the course of the three matches they have been outplayed overall by a good New Zealand side that Graham Gooch, the batting coach, has confessed they underestimated. In Dunedin, where a day was lost to the weather, it is likely New Zealand would have won, while in Wellington, the dreadful weather probably prevented England from doing likewise. Here it has been New Zealand who have bossed the game. Whether they would have won had Brendon McCullum enforced the follow-on is a moot point, but aside from some help from the bowlers rough there was precious help for spin or seam even on the fifth day once the new ball had been negotiated by England. </p><p>England had begun the day with Bell and Joe Root at the crease and the pair managed to stay together until shortly before lunch when McCullum handed the second new ball to Boult. His first delivery with it was perfect, swinging down the line of the stumps and catching Root in front. If the young batsman has ambition to be an international opener then, fine delivery as it was, he ought to have anticipated the possibility. Then came two rare mistakes by New Zealand, one costly the other not, for in the space of two deliveries, Bell, who had made 40 by then, was dropped at third slip by Dean Brownlie, and Jonny Bairstow was missed in the gully. Bairstow, hopelessly but not unexpectedly, out of touch, was caught at first slip straight after the interval but Bell was able to bat for almost another full session, with Prior, before he lost concentration, flicked at Wagner and was caught at third slip. At that point , with 32 overs still remaining,the game really did seem up. </p><p>But Broad entrenched himself, overcoming a nervy start and surviving one close lbw call, a thin edge saving him as he was knocked off his feet by a yorker, but his bat handle jamming itself into his neck as he fell. It did appear that he would be able to see things through with Prior, until McCullum called up Kane Williamson to send down his gentle offspin to the left hander. Broad pushed, the ball spun out of the rough and Ross Taylor took the catch, the combination repeating itself two balls later when Anderson, who had shared the Cardiff heroics with Panesar, also edged. When Panesar, left to face the final over, managed to get off strike with the third ball, the relief was palpable.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406216762|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|4cbdbe333a6935c166702090159da52cf30662cb -->",

        "headline":"England on brink of defeat as New Zealand take total command",
        "body":"<p>England were in a desperate position at the close of the fourth day of a match dominated by a vibrant New Zealand team. Battered and bruised in the field by a second century in the match from Peter Fulton and McCullumed into oblivion for the umpteenth time in the past two months, England were set the notional target of 481 to win – uncharted territory in that regard for any side in the history of the game – but more realistically 143 overs to bat out and claim a share of the three-match series.</p><p>They do have history of surviving such a challenge, most recently the 141 overs they used up against South Africa in Cape Town three years ago, when Paul Collingwood – Brigadier Block – spent four and a half hours over 40 and Ian Bell as long over 78. </p><p>As the shadows lengthened though, and the teams left the field, the innings, at 90 for four, was in tatters once more, surely along with their hopes. They lost Nick Compton in the third over of the innings and later Jonathan Trott, a second bastion, to the first delivery purveyed from round the wicket by the indefatigable Neil Wagner, a wide ball at which the batsman drove without due care and attention and edged, an uncharacteristic lapse in his concentration: it was a dismissal that had its roots, perhaps, in the time spent in the field watching the ball sail into the stands.</p><p>It appeared that the captain Alastair Cook had the resolve at least to see things through to the close, with Bell digging in alongside him. But like Trott even Cook's powers of concentration wavered and with fewer than four overs of the day remaining he too drove vigorously at Kane Williamson's offbreak where he need not have done, and Dean Brownlie held a stupendous reflex catch at slip. Cook had made 43 from 145 balls. One further wicket went to what proved the final ball of the day, when Steve Finn, the nightwatchman who survived more than two sessions in Dunedin, prodded a catch, from Williamson once more, to gully where Tim Southee held a second reflex catch. Such things stick when you are on a high. Bell at least remained, with eight runs from 89 balls. </p><p>England have been unravelled by the New Zealanders at Eden Park, outbatted by Fulton, a revelation after a four-year absence (to himself as much as anyone no doubt) and recipient of a message from the prime minister for his efforts; outbowled by Trent Boult, Southee and Bruce Martin; outfielded (although that might be harsh for England's rarely flagged under the assault and Matt Prior was terrific throughout); and certainly outgeneralled by McCullum.</p><p>It is easy to captain when you have a team on the ropes but New Zealand were able to reach that stage in the first place through his proactivity. The pity is that few Aucklanders have bothered to turn up, even over the weekend, for this has the makings not just of a team that punches above its weight (the default position for Kiwi sides of the past) but with a couple of additions – another top flight batsman for instance, and the return of pacemen such as Doug Bracewell – could be regarded as one of the best around. Indeed the return series in England, in May, can no longer be looked at as the safe bet it is viewed as by many. A loss here and England will have slipped down the rankings to third place, below India. </p><p>Until McCullum pulled the plug on the innings at 241 for six, with a little more than an hour to tea, England had been reduced to rubble. New Zealand already had a sizeable lead at the start of play and after a little early reconnaissance, with licence then, and no consequences, to swing like the Krankies on a Saturday night, batting becomes easier.</p><p>England did try a different strategy to Fulton, whose disdain for the offside is matched by his penchant for the onside, by setting a short midwicket and bowling straighter. It might have brought his wicket when he had 32, Anderson unable to cling on in that very position, but it was the last offering he gave until Joe Root held a mishit at long on.</p><p>By then he had made 110, his last 60 runs coming from 44 balls, including five sixes as he opened his considerable shoulders: his stand with McCullum was worth 94 from 81 balls and at one time England employed every fielder on the fence except Prior, who in order to do so would have been compelled to hand in his gloves and pads. Later, as England defended, New Zealand had every man bar one around the bat. </p><p>Once again they were monstered by McCullum, who should become the threat of choice for errant children: \"Be quiet or Brendon McCullum will come and belt your attempted yorker into the stands.\" In the course of 10 innings in all formats he has made 576 runs at considerably more than a run a ball, hit seven half-centuries and 24 sixes, three of them in his unbeaten 67 here. It is an astounding run of form given the manner in which he plays.</p><p>As for his team, they managed 16 sixes in this match, just two short of the record of 18 by West Indies (against England in Antigua in 1986) for a single team in a Test. England's only one thus far has come from Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406161122|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|ba51fdb6f2136b2ea41e6c365a251979b51c2918 -->",

        "body":"<p>This was not one of England's finest days. With New Zealand put in to bat by Alastair Cook they suffered through a day in the field that yielded a maiden Test century, 124 not out, for Peter Fulton at the age of 34, another approaching for the brilliant young tyro Kane Williamson who left the field unbeaten on 83, and the single wicket, to Steve Finn, of Hamish Rutherford. Already, by the close of the first day, New Zealand, at 250 for one, had the solid foundations of a draw and thus a drawn series that one suspects has been the primary ambition since the first two matches ended in stalemate, with anything beyond that a bonus.<br /> <br />To this end they have had a compliant groundsman who, while capable of producing a drop-in pitch with genuine pace and bounce, has seen how Steve Finn got the ball through during the limited overs matches and appears to have top-dressed this offering with Mogadon. The bowlers, who have suffered their way through the featherbeds in Dunedin and Wellington, were made to do so again now in Eden Park, where they would get more help from a surly teenager asked to tidy his room. It might help New Zealand's cause and hinder that of England but it does very little for the game as a spectacle. </p><p>The debate will rage long and hard on whether Cook's decision to bowl first constitutes a blunder, and no doubt there will be the usual kneejerk reaction that inevitably accompanies such a day. It is a facile way of thinking. Nothing proves a decision such as this to be right or wrong until there is a much broader picture on which to draw.</p><p>England might reasonably have expected more assistance from a pitch that because of the Warriors rugby league team's match on the ground last Saturday would not have been put in place until Sunday at the earliest and must have had some residual moisture in it as a result. This is the first Test match at Eden Park in seven years so there is no real precedent on which to draw in terms of its behaviour. Even so it is the nature of drop-in pitches elsewhere generally to improve as matches wear on, as indeed it is for many natural surfaces: the days of always batting regardless are long since gone and sides now see bowling first as just as important in establishing a hold on a match as supposed scoreboard pressure.</p><p>The fullness of time may prove it a bad decision should New Zealand's bowlers make their way through the England order when their turn comes, or Cook and his advisers may be vindicated by England racking up a large total themselves, but it it would not be unreasonable to expect the most help for the seamers, whatever that might be, to be on the first day. Brendon McCullum has said he would have adopted the same strategy himself, as indeed he did in the first two Tests. It is just the modern way. </p><p>Nothing though should be taken away from Fulton, Two Metre Peter, whose Test career, which began in 2006, has been resurrected after a four-year absence, and as a makeshift opener. In the first two matches he had moderate success with one half-century but the feeling was that he was static, a bat-hanger, and did not make use of his height. But here, over the course of six hours' batting, he scarcely put a foot wrong, discrete outside offstump when England attacked him there and prolific on the legside both when the ball was pitched up or when dropped short. Only twice was he troubled: first, early on, when there was still hardness in the ball, Jimmy Anderson found the outside edge and the ball flew high to the right of Joe Root at third slip who could not quite get there; and once, off Anderson again, when an attempted hook spiralled high off the top edge but carried for six over the minuscule fine leg boundary.</p><p>He took his chances too against Monty Panesar – who had kept his place, despite a temptation to go with four seamers – clubbing him into the stand and once to the longest boundary. His century, reached with a single to mid-on, was marked with nice understatement and a look of mild relief that his career had gained some fulfilment. </p><p>Williamson, on the other hand, is a young player with the cricket world before him. The contrast at the crease between he and Fulton, during their unbroken second wicket stand of 171, could scarcely be greater. But diminutive batsmen, or the best ones at any rate, tend to be the best judges of length simply because they have to be. Essentially Williamson is a proficient cutter and puller as might be expected. Bowlers though will tend to overcompensate to someone who hangs back in the crease, and as such he is very quick and solid into the drive. In simple terms he looks a composed, solid, technically sound all-round batsman who might be troubled only by bounce on more flirty pitches than this.<br /> <br />The England seamers found no swing or seam movement and the bounce died once the hardness left the ball. Reverse swing is not an option with a thick lush outfield and no used pitches on which to scuff the ball. So they were reduced to attempting novelty field-placings, angles of attack, 10 minutes of short stuff – anything to break the rhythm of batting – to no avail until they took the second new ball 10 overs from the close and Anderson and Broad managed to sneak a couple past the bat of tiring <br />batsmen.</p><p>Panesar meanwhile twirled away, trying to mix things up occasionally and suffering when he did so. This is not turning into one of his more prolific series but a first day pitch is no place to be expecting any spinner to run through a team.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406043785|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|24bfa38a8d64d1f1fdd3b638d9c931af7d7f8cdd -->",
