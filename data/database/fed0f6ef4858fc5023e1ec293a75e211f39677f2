        "trailText":"Steve Harmison, who played a key part in England's thrilling 2005 Ashes victory, has announced his retirement from cricket",
        "headline":"Steve Harmison retires: former England fast bowler bows out",
        "body":"<p>Steve Harmison has joined his former England team-mates Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles in retirement, leaving the notoriously injury-prone Simon Jones as the unlikely last man standing of the 2005 Ashes-winning attack.</p><p>Even Jones recently confirmed that he will play only Twenty20 cricket in the future, so Harmison's announcement – which was only ever a question of time, as the 34-year-old has not played a first-class match since July 2012 – has a feeling of finality.</p><p>He will turn 35 this month, and played the last of his 63 Tests in the 2009 home Ashes series at The Oval – allowing him to bow out of international cricket with Flintoff, his great mate throughout their careers going back to junior representative teams.</p><p>\"I have known for a while I would be calling it a day,\" Harmison admitted in an article in Newcastle's Sunday Sun. \"But I did not want to take the shine off such a magnificent campaign for Durham by announcing it before the end. I may not have been able to contribute in the way I wished, but at least I have got what I most wanted out of the 2013 season – the County Championship trophy back in the cabinet at Chester-le-Street.\"</p><p>Harmison and Paul Collingwood, now the captain, would be seen as the twin personifications of Durham's remarkable rise over the past two decades, from Minor Counties cricket to a major power in the English game. Harmison grew up in Ashington, came through Durham's junior teams and made his England debut at the age of 23 against India at Trent Bridge in 2002, alongside Flintoff and Hoggard.</p><p>He returned sound figures in that game, a draw, and was selected for the winter's Ashes tour, where he played in four Tests despite bowling seven consecutive wides in the first warm-up match at Lilac Hill –an indication of the odd embarrassment to follow, notably the notorious loosener in the first Test of the 2006-07 series in Brisbane that set the tone for Australia's whitewash.</p><p>But for a period in 2004-05, after an unlikely breakthrough against Bangladesh in Dhaka, he was as formidable as any fast bowler in the world, and officially ranked No1 for several months. He took seven for 12 against West Indies in Jamaica in March 2004, and deserves to be remembered for the hostility with which he shook up Australia in the first Test of the 2005 series at Lord's, rather than that wide in Brisbane.</p><p>His final tally of 222 Test wickets for England from 62 appearances at an average of 32 leaves him 12th on the all-time list, three wickets ahead of Flintoff but four places below Hoggard. He also took 458 first-class wickets for Durham. \"I loved coming back to play alongside my mates,\" he said. \"People would often put pressure on me not to play for Durham in between England appearances. It wasn't just the management, it was team-mates who didn't want me to show them up with their counties. Perhaps playing so much cricket then has cost me now.</p><p>\"No one's more frustrated than me at how little I've played for Durham in the last few years, but injuries are part of being a fast bowler.</p><p>\"The picture which gives me the most pleasure was of me walking off the field at Canterbury on the day we won Durham's first Championship. One hand, with its wrist broken, is clutching a stump, the other is around my brother Ben. A handful of people have won Championships with Durham, but we are the only brothers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419174094|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|4486047dbcb537e22b447841bfd8bd8d954f370c -->",

        "body":"<p>Afghanistan will be heading to Australia and New Zealand in 2015 after qualifying for the 50-over World Cup for the first time by finishing second in the World Cricket League Championship.</p><p>The war-torn country beat Kenya by seven wickets at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium to join Ireland as the second Associate team in the tournament, in February and March 2015.</p><p>Opting to field after winning the toss, Afghanistan, who have played in the past two Twenty20 World Cups, bundled out Kenya for 93 and romped home with seven wickets to spare.</p><p>It was a dream come true for the captain, Mohammad Nabi, who shone for his team with his two wickets for 10 runs from 8.3 overs and an unbeaten 46. \"I can't express my feelings. It is a very big day in my life. I'm&nbsp;sure there will be huge celebrations back home,\" Nabi told the International Cricket Council website. \"I'm happy for the people of Afghanistan and look forward to playing in Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>\"I didn't expect to play in a World Cup when I started playing cricket. But now I can cherish this moment and look forward to playing against the best sides in some of the best facilities.</p><p>\"Playing in a World Cup will be one grade up and we'll try to work hard and do better.\"</p><p>Afghanistan will be in Pool A with England, Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and another qualifier.</p><p>Dave Richardson, the ICC's chief executive, congratulated Afghanistan on their success and said they would prove to be a thorn in the side of the more established teams. \"Afghanistan's journey has been a remarkable one,\" he said. \"It started in World Cricket League division five in 2008, and will now make its maiden appearance at the ICC's flagship 50-over event.</p><p>\"Afghanistan is a talented team who will prove a competitive opponent for any team that comes up against it.\"</p><p>The former Pakistan fast bowler Kabir Khan, the coach of Afghanistan, is hoping his team get experience of playing the top sides before the World Cup. \"I'm expecting a great response in Australia and New Zealand,\" he said. \"The big teams will like to punish us but we'll prepare as best as we can and try to show the world what we're capable of.</p><p>\"I would like to play more against the full member countries in the lead-up to the World Cup. I'm expecting that our neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, India and Pakistan will play some matches against us and help us prepare for our biggest tournament.\"</p><p>India won the last 50-over World Cup at home in 2011. The remaining two associate places for 2015 will be decided by a qualifying tournament in New Zealand next year. <strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419060110|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|30fd531d2a0f90e381fb58ed9d25d4ac16e629af -->",

After he was forced to fly home from Australia's disastrous Test tour of India in March, he did not play again until the first four-day match of their Ashes tour in late June, having been ruled out of the Champions Trophy – although that was down to a recurrence suffered after the Australians had arrived in England.</p><p>This time he has been ruled out of a seven-match one-day series in India for which Lehmann and the team fly out later this week. George Bailey will assume the captaincy, as he did in the Champions Trophy, and he has been told by Australia's selectors that good performances on the tour will boost his prospects of earning a place in the middle order for the Ashes.</p><p>Clarke will be anxious to return in time to play some first-class cricket for New South Wales in the build-up to the first Test, having stressed the importance for Australia's batsmen of building form in the Sheffield Shield.</p><p>Australia's bowling options have suffered one further blow with confirmation that James Pattinson, who was the first of several seamers forced to leave the Ashes tour early – with back problems after the second Test defeat at Lord's – will not be fit for the start of the series. Pattinson has also admitted that he may struggle to make the second Test in Adelaide in early December and although he remains hopeful of being in contention for the third Test in Perth, there must be a danger that he will struggle to force his way back into the team for the whole series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418985901|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|ebd47b320bd0a58ff822817cb71fce52d18fbede -->",

        "headline":"Dominic Sibley can learn the difficult lessons of prodigies past",
        "body":"<h2>THE PHENOM'S PROGRESS</h2><p></p><p>Dominic Sibley had last Sunday off. Come Monday he was back at school. \"One of the stranger days\" he called it. From first-class to his first class. As he walked in, his limbs were surely still sore but his step light, after Surrey's match against Yorkshire. Over 10 hours spread across three days, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/26/surrey-dominic-sibley-youngest-double-century\" title=\"\">Sibley, playing his third first-class match, scored 242</a>, one of the most remarkable innings of the season. When Sibley was born, Blur were at No1, Pierce Brosnan was playing Bond, and Dominic Cork was the new Botham. He is so young that for most of his life, England have been a successful Test side.</p><p></p><p>Sibley has made a habit of such scores. He plays his club cricket for Ashtead, like his father and his grandfather before him. When he was 15 he made 200 against Weybridge in the Surrey Premier League. Jimmy Ormond was opening the bowling. He had lost whatever pace he once had, but none of his skill or savvy. He finished with figures of 20-0-80-1. Later that same summer Sibley made 224 for Surrey Under-17s against Worcestershire. Playing for the same side the next season, he made 220 not out against Kent. Between the two innings, he made his debut for Surrey's second XI, against Sussex. He made 37, the top score in the team's 151.</p><p></p><p>He has always had the aptitude, and the appetite too. David Ward, the old Surrey batsman who is now the head of cricket at Whitgift, says it is \"the start of a glittering career\". England agree, and have picked Sibley for their Under-17 and Under-19 teams. They will want to keep a close eye on him. The transition into the professional game can be hard for any talented teenage player, but for a phenom, of which Sibley seems to be one, it can be particularly perilous.</p><p></p><p>Only 13 men have been younger when they scored a double century in first-class cricket. They make an odd list. WG Grace is one, of course, an exception rather than the rule, as he is in so many things. In more modern times, two Pakistanis – Javed Miandad and Hanif Mohammad – went on to have exceptional careers, and two more – Ijaz Ahmed and Hanif's brother, Mushtaq – very good ones. Umar Akmal may yet join them. He is 23 now, and more gifted than his average of 35 after 16 Tests suggests. His future may depend on how well he recovers from the seizure he suffered while he was on a flight between Barbados and Jamaica in August.</p><p></p><p>The remaining eight provide some salutary lessons. They would make a good subject for Sibley's studies now that Whitgift have started to give him time off from school so he can concentrate on his cricket career. The first of them is Hasan Raza, who was, they say, only 15 years and 215 days old when he made 204 for Karachi against Bahawalpur in 1997. He had already made his Test debut by that point. He was supposed to have been just 14 at the time, but even the Pakistan Cricket Board admitted they found that figure hard to swallow. Raza went on to play seven Tests in nine years, never managing more than two in a row.</p><p></p><p>Infuriated with the selectors, Raza ended up playing in the rebel Indian Cricket League, along with the two Indians ahead on the list. One was Reetinder Sodhi, who made 200 not out for Punjab against Delhi when he was 17. Sodhi was a brilliant captain of the Indian Under-15 side, and won them their age group World Cup with an innings of 82 in the final. He did similar things in the Under-19 edition, as the man of the match award in the final. He made his ODI debut soon after, in 2000. He played another 17 one-day games for India, the last of them in 2002. If Raza was picked too early, Sodhi may have been discarded too soon.</p><p></p><p>Ambati Rayudu, on the other hand, had had to wait a decade for his first cap. In 2002 he made 210 for Hyderabad against Andhra when he was 17. He went off the rails because, his old head coach Vivek Jaisimha once told Cricinfo: \"He had been playing the victim too long when he should have gone out there with his bat in his hand and proved his talent.\" Rayudu quit Hyderabad, blaming the wicked pitch for a run of poor form. He became prickly, resentful that he wasn't enjoying the success that he expected and others predicted. He fell out with his teammates, and his management, and joined the ICL in a funk. He was banned for that, but has worked his way back. Now 28, he finally made his ODI debut this season, against Zimbabwe.</p><p></p><p>From South Africa, there is Johann Myburgh. A prodigy from Pretoria, the 203 he scored in 1998 made him the youngest man to score a double century in South African first-class cricket, beating Graeme Pollock. He left South Africa soon after, irritated at the lack of opportunities, to try to qualify for New Zealand. That didn't work out. He has never won an international cap, and was last seen in playing for Sutton in the same Surrey Premier League that Sibley has been playing in.</p><p></p><p>Then there is Ian Craig, who, as Gideon Haigh has written, was \"precocious in every cricket deed\". He was 17 when he made 213 not out for New South Wales against the South Africans in 1953. Burdened with the brand \"the new Bradman\", Craig was picked for Test cricket too soon, and endured a dismal tour of England later that year. By 1957, after he had completed his university degree and his national service, he was back, and soon became captain of the national team. A teetotaller, he even took up smoking because he was under such stress. He was struck down with hepatitis, and ended up quitting cricket at the age of 26, after just 11 Tests, to start another, more productive, career with Boots.</p><p></p><p>That leaves one – Taslim Arif, who played six Tests for Pakistan in the 1970s after he scored 205 for Karachi against Hyderabad shortly before his 18th birthday. Arif suffered the straightforward misfortune of being a good player kept out of the Test side by a better one. He had to compete with Wasim Bari right through his career.</p><p></p><p>In the County Championship, Sibley beat the record of David \"Jumble\" Sales, who hit 210 on his debut for Northamptonshire in 1996. He was a few months older than Sibley is now. \"Given his phenomenal talent, quite how he never played for England is beyond me,\" Graeme Swann wrote of Sales in his recent autobiography, echoing the view of many English fans. \"His face just didn't fit ... there was a perception within the game that he never wanted it badly enough.\"</p><p></p><p>The England and Wales Cricket Board loves to talk about \"player pathways\", and it is always tempting to tease them for using such gobbledegook. But looking at that lot it is easy to see why a young player like Sibley might need help steering a compass course around the potential pitfalls. Illness, early selection, outside temptations, personal frustrations, high expectations, under-motivation, ensuing irritations, even depression. Cricket can be hardest on those it comes to easiest.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\" title=\"\">• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian's weekly take on the world of cricket.

They dominated the Kenyan batsmen, bowling them out for a paltry 89 runs, cruising to victory in the 17th over. Captain Nawroz Mangal finished unbeaten on 52, blasting a six to win the game. Man of the match Hamid Hassan, who finished with figures of four for 19, says the team is hungry to reach the World Cup and aren't taking any chances heading into the final match on Sunday",

        "body":"<p>With less than two months to go to the start of the Ashes, the Australia captain, Michael Clarke, admits he does not know when he will be fit to play.</p> <p>\"Where I sit now is I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back playing cricket,\" said Clarke, who will miss Australia&rsquo;s tour to India due to his long-standing back problems, at a press conference on Thursday.</p> <p>\"We have no idea how long it's going to take, but in Australia I've got the physio in Sydney that I've been working with since I was 17 and I'm in consistent contact with [Australia team physio] Alex Kountouris, who will fly back and forth from Melbourne to Sydney to see me and make sure I&rsquo;m improving.</p> <p>\"There's certainly no guarantee at this stage. It&rsquo;s hard for me to say that because I&rsquo;m trying my best not to look at it like that.</p> <p>\"I'm always positive and if you ask me I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll be fit in a week&rsquo;s time but if you ask Alex, who knows me very well, he&rsquo;ll certainly say there&rsquo;s doubt that I won&rsquo;t be right [for the first Ashes Test]. So I just need to make sure I do everything I can to give myself the best chance.\"</p> <p>Clarke is not the only injury problem for Australia though. James Pattinson said it was unlikely he would be able to play before the third Test, due to a back stress fracture.</p> <p>\"I&rsquo;m not even running yet, which is not great,&rdquo; Pattinson said. \"I&rsquo;ll get a scan in two-weeks' time just to determine whether the fracture's healed or not and then I'll go from there. When I get the results back from the scan I&rsquo;ll probably start running.</p> <p>\"I won&rsquo;t be back for the first Test, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be right for the second, but hopefully all going well I could push for that Waca Test.\"</p> <p>Australia lost the last Ashes series, which ended in August, 3-0. A positive showing in the subsequent one-day series against England was tempered by injury issues surrounding several key players, including Ryan Harris, Pattinson and Clarke.</p> <p>The first Ashes Test in the 2013-14 series starts in Brisbane on 21 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418911546|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|bdac95c74c1d0c381a643c61e44050807c5907e4 -->",

        "headline":"Jos Buttler joins Lancashire from Somerset to boost England prospects",
        "body":"<p>Jos Buttler was formally unveiled as a Lancashire player at Old Trafford on Wednesday and explained that it was his desire to stop being stereotyped as a one-day wicketkeeper-batsman that drove his move north from Somerset.</p><p>\"I'm keen to get rid of that tag, I'm more ambitious than that – I want to play Test cricket for England,\" said the 23-year-old, who has played 25 Twenty20 internationals and 19 50-over matches since making his debut against India in Manchester in 2011. \"I think Lancashire can be the stepping stone to aid me to get to that.\"</p><p>There will be further evidence of that determination as he sits out the auction for next spring's Indian Premier League, in which he would surely have commanded plenty of interest, to concentrate on his first-class development – mindful of the example of Eoin Morgan, who has fallen well down England's Test pecking order since he prioritised the IPL.</p><p>Buttler, who was born in Taunton and first represented Somerset at the age of nine, has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of wicketkeeping opportunities with his home county – because Craig Kieswetter, a good friend who he usurped in the England one-day set-up last winter – has remained their first choice with the gloves.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419041259'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379377696053/Jos-Buttler-008.jpg' alt='Jos Buttler' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Buttler hopes to keep wicket for England.</figcaption></figure><p>\"Keeping wicket for England in one-day cricket, and not doing it for Somerset, you're bound to be a little bit frustrated,\" he added. \"That's obvious to anyone – if you're going to keep wicket for England, then you've got to be keeping wicket day in and day out. I'd be doing myself a disservice and taking a huge risk if I wasn't plying my trade in county cricket as a wicketkeeper.</p><p>\"I'm really excited about the potential of what lies ahead. It's a great opportunity for me to move my cricket on to the next level. It was a big decision but I've made the right decision.\"</p><p>He confirmed that the chance to work with Peter Moores, Lancashire's former England coach and an ex-wicketkeeper himself, was \"one of the factors\" behind the move. Slightly less significant, and more of an added bonus, was the chance to be nearer Ewood Park, as Buttler is an unlikely Blackburn Rovers supporter.</p><p>\"From watching [Alan] Shearer and [Chris] Sutton win the league [in 1995, when Buttler was four] – a glory supporter to start with,\" he explained. \"Unfortunately there's not been much since then.\"</p><p>Moores is enthused by the addition to Lancashire's squad following their promotion back to Division One of the County Championship, especially given the boost Buttler will also give to the club's hopes of winning a first major one-day title since 1999. His absences with England, at least in the near future, are likely to be for ODI series and t20 internationals only, and even then Lancashire have exciting cover in Alex Davies, another gifted wicketkeeper batsman who has represented England Under-19s.</p><p>\"From what I've seen the potential for him as a keeper is very high – he makes it look pretty easy,\" Moores said of Buttler. \"He's obviously a great athlete, he's got a great eye and a great set of hands. He just needs to play more to build up the experience of playing in games.\"</p><p>Essex have signed their all-rounder Graham Napier, who had arguably his best season yet in 2013 at the age of 33, on a new two-year contract, and Northamptonshire have offered a new deal to their veteran batsman David Sales.</p><p>Northants, who won promotion to Division One of the County Championship with Lancashire in addition to lifting the Twenty20 Cup, have also confirmed they are hoping to sign a new left-arm spinner. However, they have already dropped a strong hint that they will not be aiming to bring Monty Panesar back to the county after his disciplinary problems at Sussex and are instead thought to have lined up Graeme White, who started his career with them before joining Nottinghamshire in 2010 and spent time with them on loan last season.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418882511|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|276ea64a6f909d79d4adf3ddb4e8dcf194765507 -->",

        "headline":"Saeed Ajmal adds to criticism of Pakistan coach Dav Whatmore",
        "body":"<p>Saeed Ajmal has added to Dav Whatmore's troubles as the coach of Pakistan after their defeat in Zimbabwe by suggesting that he has made \"no difference\", and comparing him unfavourably to his predecessors Waqar Younis and Mohsin Khan.</p><p>Ajmal, the mystery spinner who is rated the fourth best bowler in the world, told the Geo TV channel that \"Waqar handled us better\", and that \"Mohsin did well\" – whereas Whatmore, the Australian who made his name as the coach of the Sri Lanka team who won the 1996 World Cup, was damned with faint praise as \"not that bad\".</p><p>It was an embarrassing and untimely interview for Whatmore after Pakistan became the first team other than Bangladesh to lose a Test to Zimbabwe in more than a decade when they lost in Harare last month, and only two weeks before they play the first of two \"home\" Tests against South Africa in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Whatmore tweeted: \"Deeply upset and hurt by his remarks. Just when you think you know someone!!!\" He later attempted to defuse the row, adding that \"Ajmal has personally come to apologise to me and explained the context of what he meant and I have accepted\", and that \"Ajmal is a very nice person but has fallen prey to a few tricky questions\".</p><p>But the comments will be seized on by the growing number of former players who have been critical of Whatmore since well before the Zimbabwe defeat, pointing out that he has still to win a Test since succeeding Mohsin in 2012 – shortly after Pakistan had thrashed England 3-0 in the Emirates.</p><p>On the question of having an overseas coach, Ajmal said: \"There is no difference, just that we are paying more to him, otherwise there is no difference. Waqar handled us better. He used to stress on fitness and he used to say that if your fitness is good then you are 80% OK on the ground but if it's only 20% then you cannot do anything on the ground.</p><p>\"Mohsin did well. He would scold in front [of the team] if anyone is not taking wickets or a batsman is not scoring, irrespective of if he is senior or junior. If a junior was not performing then he would say that if you don't, then you will not be able to keep your place.</p><p>\"Dav is a foreign coach, he doesn't know our language much, but he is a coach and has done coaching for various countries and has helped other teams win, he is not that bad. We had our coaches, we have our language.\"</p><p>Confusingly, however, Ajmal went on to praise Whatmore as \"a good coach [who] helped Sri Lanka lift the World Cup.</p><p>\"He helps us get everything on what the batsmen are doing wrong. He tells us instantly what we have to do. He can't go [on to] the field. His job is to tell us what to do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418877334|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|30d9311975c5191ab647d3bfa8a9437fdaed15c9 -->",

        "body":"<p>To the uninitiated, cricket is as esoteric as the Kabbalah. To those in the know it, is a game of grace, speed and power. And therein hides the magic, because for many of its fans cricket is almost a philosophy, a way of life embodying a certain sporting spirit that can be carried into other areas of life. Some of the spectators may look half asleep, but in fact they're meditating on the finer points of play while keeping one eye on the weather and the other on the bar.<br /> <br />We begin with <strong>Papa M's I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</strong>, which is worth its selection as an opener for the title alone. A beautiful and strange instrumental, building its guitar structures slowly, evoking a hot day at county level, and lasting about as long as it takes to sip a pint in the sun.<br /> <br />History is inseparably tied to sport. <strong>Latif Nangarhari's Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</strong> celebrates his country's admission to the highest level of world cricket. The music is traditionally based and very energetic, while the lyrics are in Pashto, giving Latif access to about 60 million speakers, though he lives in Birmingham these days.<br /> <br />Across the world in Los Angeles, the Compton Cricket Club is bigged in by <strong>Cloth's Bullets</strong> – a song, like the CCC itself, dedicated to fighting homelessness and gang culture with civility and dignity.<br /> <br />Over to the south-eastern Caribbean to Trinidad and Tobago now for an exuberant soca take on the game, <strong>Machel Montano and Claudette Peters's Come Rise with Me</strong>. Guaranteed to get the crowd on its feet.<br /> <br />While we're in the Caribbean we might as well catch <strong>I-Roy's Tribute to Michael Holding</strong>. Known as \"Whispering Death\" because of his quiet approach to the crease, Holding was one of the fastest bowlers ever to play Test cricket. \"Michael Holdin', his performance was golden\", declares I-Roy, in reference to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYyJllsj68\">Holding's six-ball destruction of England captain Geoffrey Boycott in Bridgetown in 1981</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>The Duckworth Lewis Method's Third Man</strong> melodically shares with us the thoughts of an unsuccessful fielder who has been stranded in the middle of nowhere by his team captain in order to keep him out of trouble. He's dreaming of tea, in between recalling film scenes from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36181/third.man\">The Third Man</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>Roots Manuva's Again and Again</strong> describes the improvement gained by a poor batsman. Or at least the video does, expressing amusingly some of the philosophy embedded in cricket's traditions.<br /> <br /><strong>Jah Thomas's Cricket Lovely Cricket</strong> informs us that the game is actually quite straightforward. Forget philosophy: \"All you got do is lick the ball before it reach the wicket.\"<br /> <br />It's not all glory though – as one country ascends, another declines. Back in 1990, fans of the Windies were wallowing in disappointment. Calypsonian <strong>David Rudder's Rally Round the West Indies</strong> pleads with the fans not to give up hope, using the team's misfortunes as a metaphor for wider political struggles.<br /> <br />In an earlier song, <strong>Lord Relator's Gavaskar Calypso</strong>, we note cricket's innate sportsmanship as Relator tells us that India's Sunil Gavaskar was the master batsman: \"We just couldn't get him out.\"<br /> <br />Apparently rain stopped play in <strong>Pavement's Carrot Rope</strong>. They got beaten, and \"the wicket keeper is down\". In the video they're adequately attired for British cricket in yellow rain macs.<br /> <br /><strong>The Cavaliers' It's a Beautiful Game</strong> simply wants us to love the sport of cricket, encasing the names of dozens of its most famous exponents within a gorgeous melody.</p><h2>The list</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDNANxKOVbM\">Papa M – I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FKZNQrfug\">Latif Nangarhari – Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKa2mp5ePes\">Cloth – Bullets</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN7rMnuxYIU\">Machel Montano and Claudette Peters – Come Rise with Me</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzJ5PpZ1BdE\">I-Roy – Tribute to Michael Holding</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WHQpg_3ZS4\">The Duckworth Lewis Method – Third Man</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRxYNTH-5Go \">Roots Manuva – Again and Again</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZWCRCgRsI\">Jah Thomas – Cricket Lovely Cricket</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MgkoLKMr0\">David Rudder – Rally Round the West Indies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tBp1ClIDys\">Lord Relator – Gavaskar Calypso</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxehrvhNMY8\">Pavement – Carrot Rope</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8FczAAeHM\">The Cavaliers – It's a Beautiful Game</a></p><p>• Listen to these songs on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4N9xNEcg2jtJlPUOZfmk_&amp;feature=mh_lolz\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p><p>• See all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jul/18/readers-recommend-songs-cricket\">last week's blog</a>, from which sonofwebcore selected the songs above.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413611530|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2c7fb8a59a0df0b7dc02686fc5ce80f2003ffb22 -->",

        "body":"<p>Who would dare call Test cricket boring now? In a nerve-shredding denouement to an opening Ashes Test that had already contained enough plot twists to last the entire summer, England sealed a narrow victory in dramatic circumstances.</p><p>With Australia requiring just 15 runs to secure an unlikely victory thanks to a heroic last wicket stand of 65, England fast bowler and man of the match Jimmy Anderson claimed his 10th and final wicket – but not before a lengthy delay while the decision was referred to the third umpire, Marais Erasmus, in a Test where the use of technology has become a significant talking point.</p><p>Eventually, as the decision was confirmed, the England players in the middle and the majority of the crowd erupted in an explosion of joy and relief.</p><p>On the pitch the umpire Aleem Dar was forced to overturn his original decision and confirm that Brad Haddin, who had taken Australia to the brink of victory with a defiant innings of 71, had nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Matt Prior, awarding England victory in a Test match that had swung as wildly as some of Anderson's bowling.</p><p>The match had already taken in a teenage debutant, Ashton Agar, who had scored 98 batting at No 11, a controversial incident in which England player Stuart Broad had refused to walk despite clearly being out, and an innings by Ian Bell for the home side that was widely regarded as his best ever.</p><p>\"I don't think I've played in a Test where the momentum has changed quite so quickly and so often. I'm glad we managed to scrape through in the end,\" said a relieved England captain, Alastair Cook.</p><p>\"I always said I would be the only England captain not to go bald in the job but days like this won't help that.\"</p><p>For those England fans among the packed crowd watching in almost eerie silence as fingernails were bitten to the quick and early optimism evaporated, there were unmistakable echoes of the Edgbaston Test during the summer of 2005. Then, during an epic series that ultimately saw England regain the Ashes after a gap of 18 years, the home side had prevailed by just two runs following a similarly unlikely run chase by Australia that fell just short.</p><p>After the emotion and drama of last summer's London Olympics and with no major international football tournament, 2013 was supposed to be a quieter sporting summer.</p><p>Yet in the space of eight dramatic days, the British and Irish Lions have won their first series since 1997, Andy Murray has become the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years and now England have secured victory in the opening Ashes Test of a back-to-back home and away series in thrilling style.</p><p>The use of the controversial DRS system that became a huge talking point when Broad refused to walk after edging a ball to slip at a crucial point during England's second innings again worked to England's benefit at the climax of the match.</p><p>Australia captain Michael Clarke, who was unable to review the dismissal of Broad because he had already made two unsuccessful appeals during that innings, said afterwards he would have to \"get better\" at using the system.</p><p>In the case of Haddin, who had set England hearts racing as he took Australia to the brink of victory in conjunction with 11th man James Pattinson, the decision was the right one.</p><p>Such a nailbiting climax had looked unlikely earlier in the day as Anderson secured three wickets in 24 seemingly game-changing balls, including that of Agar.</p><p>But then Haddin and Pattinson began spraying the ball around Trent Bridge as England's momentum stalled. Steven Finn dropped Haddin in the deep and Jonny Bairstow missed a chance to run the same player out.</p><p>The Barmy Army fell silent and the Australians began dreaming of just the 13th one wicket victory in Test history.</p><p>Australia emerged from lunch needing just 20 to win, buoying the mood of the Fanatics in the crowd and leaving the singer employed to serenade the players with Land of Hope and Glory during the break in danger of looking foolishly premature. But then came one final twist.</p><p>After the game Anderson, who bowled 13 overs in an energy sapping spell before lunch before succumbing to cramp, playfully chided Cook for also dropping a catch earlier, off his bowling, that might have helped avoid the need for such drama.</p><p>Given all the breathless action so far, it seems scarcely credible that the Test that will begin at Lord's on Thursday is just the second of the summer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412809738|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|41f0e795e1476df420f6ec16ea4e8b0ac03d495c -->",

        "headline":"Ashes 2013: all eyes turn to cricket for a great British summer",
        "body":"<p>The oldest rivalry in cricket reconvenes on Wednesday when, from 11am, England take on Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, a moment eagerly anticipated by players and supporters alike, not least because it's been known for an entire series to be shaped by events on the first morning.</p><p>Whether they will still be as enthusiastic by 7 January next year, after the teams have played 10 Test matches at up to five days apiece home and away, not to mention a slew of Twenty20 and one-day clashes, is a moot point to say the least. With back-to-back Ashes Tests in the same year for the first time, the next six months represent the most concentrated spell of Ashes cricket in its 131-year history.</p><p>But for David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the impending avalanche of Ashes can't be too much of a good thing.\"On the contrary, it has created intense excitement. I don't see how it can diminish the achievement. If we can retain the Ashes over two series, then it would be an even greater achievement,\" Collier said.</p><p>\"All the tickets are gone. Sold out. You've only got to look at the demand for tickets, at the fact we've got 300 clubs signed up to show the action on big screens, to see how big it is. I don't think anything in cricket captures the imagination of the British public more than the Ashes series.\"</p><p>Collier said England's cricketers would go into Wednesday's first Test hoping to build on the feelgood factor created by the Lions rugby union side and Wimbledon winner Andy Murray. Following a wet summer in 2012 that was dominated by the Olympics, this year is seen as a crucial barometer for the health of the sport in a year without a major football tournament to draw the attention.</p><p>The climactic fifth Ashes Test in August  at the Oval, south London, was sold out before Christmas for the first time and the same was true at Trent Bridge. \"We couldn't process the orders quickly enough,\" said a Trent Bridge spokesman.</p><p>David Cameron, the day after his No 10 reception with Murray, released a message of support for England: \"Whether you remember Botham and Willis at Headingley, like I do, or Kevin Pietersen's defiant stance at the Oval in 2005 – I remember where I was when that happened – nothing captures the public's imagination quite like a Test match against Australia. The nation's got high hopes. We're right behind the team, and I'm sure they're going to rise to the occasion. So best of luck from everyone at Downing Street to [England captain] Alastair Cook and the boys.\"</p><p>Collier said the huge demand for tickets proved the switch to pay TV in 2005 had not diminished cricket's appeal,  despite concerns it had lessened its ability to become part of the national conversation.</p><p>The back-to-back series have been scheduled to realign the Ashes so they do not take place in the same year as a cricket World Cup, which is due to be held in Australia and New Zealand in 2015.By next January, Cook's sside could have won four Ashes series in a row.</p><p>The Australians are in some disarray, after a 4-0 Test series defeat in India and a disappointing showing in the Champions Trophy, interspersed with an unsavoury incident in a bar when David Warner aimed a punch at young England batsman Joe Root at 2am. Warner, a batsman, was fined £7,000 and suspended until the start of the first Test.</p><p>As a result, Cricket Australia sacked their coach Mickey Arthur just 16 days before Wednesday's opener. He was replaced by straight-talking Darren Lehmann, a move which former players including Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath have said can give Australia back their momentum.</p><p>But some former England players, including Sir Ian Botham, have predicted a 10-0 whitewash.</p><p>Collier said it would be closer than that and, even if England won relatively easily, it wouldn't diminish the appeal of one of the oldest and most keenly fought rivalries in sport. When England won in 2005, it was the first time they had captured a series since 1987.</p><p>The ECB points to the strength of the elite game, where England have prospered since regaining the Ashes in 2005, and further investment in the grassroots to justify the removal of live coverage of the sport from free-to-air TV.</p><p>Sky, gearing up for a battle with BT Sport, has renamed one of its channels Sky Ashes and will screen only cricket on it for the summer.</p><p>Aside from the investment of £260m over four years, Sky says it is able to devote more resources and airtime to the sport. Yet some insist something has been lost along the way, including the ability to inspire children whose parents may not be cricket fans.</p><p>\"All the objective facts totally rubbish that argument. What is critical to engaging people is local club facilities and local coaches. We have invested a lot of time and a lot of effort and that's paid off. People tend to forget there was no terrestrial bid for cricket on the table, so it's a redundant argument,\" said Collier.</p><h2>No fanfare for fans</h2><p>England's players have failed in an attempt to get Billy Cooper – aka Billy the Trumpet – into Trent Bridge so he can help England's \"Barmy Army\" create a raucous atmosphere.</p><p>Players Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann, among others, have been lobbying administrators to force the ground to change its policy of not allowing entry to those with musical instruments, but to no avail.</p><p>Pietersen said the team's pleas had \"fallen on deaf ears\", while Swann added: \"Personally, I think it's a shame. I know the whole team are behind Billy, and the Barmy Army are a massive part of the English team.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412490118|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|308fea65bf707112cb13199fbaeafecf632c5ac0 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>I gave my life to cricket, it's as simple as that. </strong>I never got married because I&nbsp;was married to the game.</p><p><strong>My father came to watch me play often, </strong>but I never knew he was there. That's&nbsp;how parents should be. He worked as a miner from when he was a boy until the day he turned 65 and retired. He kept on to me: \"This is no life for you.\" We both saw sport as a way out.</p><p><strong>For the first time in my life I'm beginning to feel my age.</strong> Four years ago I had a stroke, but I'm soldiering on. It has made me very emotional – I have always felt things very deeply, but more so now. Some mornings I can't face getting up, but you force yourself. I do my exercises, have a shave, and get on with it.</p><p><strong>I realised early on that nothing would come easy. </strong>One time I scored 181 not out, and straight after the chairman came to me and said: \"Well played, but you&nbsp;will be back in the second XI next week.\"</p><p><strong>My mother made me go to church every Sunday, </strong>morning and evening, and I'm glad she did. I still go, and I say my prayers every night, though since I have a new knee I have to sit on the edge of the bed rather than kneel.</p><p><strong>You learned a lot about politics in Yorkshire cricket. </strong>You learned to be hard, determined. That wasn't natural for me. But I did it all the same.</p><p><strong>I always lived out of a suitcase, </strong>but it never struck me as a lonely life. Depression seems to have come in the game more these days.</p><p><strong>I do believe in miracles.</strong> One morning I woke up completely blind.  The doctor said it was down to all the years I had stood on a cricket field in  the sun. The operation was a huge gamble and it took three months for me  to see again. But&nbsp;I thanked the good Lord – and the surgeon – when I did.</p><p><strong>A good night's sleep </strong>was my best friend as an umpire.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/dec/28/guardianobituaries.cricket\" title=\"\"><strong>Kerry Packer</strong></a><strong> offered me a huge amount of money</strong> to join his tour in the 1970s. I thought about it a lot, then and since, but I wanted to stand by the establishment, the game I knew. <strong>As an umpire you had to be a bit detached.</strong> But watching those great players at close quarters – Dennis Lillee, Garfield Sobers, Ian Botham – was a thrilling thing. What you really wanted to do was applaud.</p><p><strong>I never found it hard to see the ball. </strong>The quickest bowler I ever saw was Frank&nbsp;Tyson. Fifty-odd years ago when I was batting he hit me with a ball on the inside of the jaw at Scarborough. I can still feel that now.</p><p><strong>Whatever job you do –</strong> dustman, cricketer, doctor – any pressure you bring you bring on yourself.</p><p><strong>Before I went out in the middle I would meditate,</strong> have a bit of quiet. You&nbsp;see, you need to relax to be ready for anything.</p><p><strong>If I have one regret, it is not having a family. </strong>I'd have liked to watch a lad or a&nbsp;grandson playing sport. I miss it more now than ever.</p><p>80 Not Out: My Favourite Cricket Memories <em>by Dickie Bird is out now (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £20).

Boult was spent but to the roars of the crowd, he thrashed the ball into an unresponsive pitch for the last time, Prior defended and then raised his arms in triumph. England had survived the match and earned themselves a draw in the series by the skin of their teeth. </p><p>It was a day for heroes, players who reined in their natural instincts to carve out one of the great rearguards for only three teams previously had entered the final day of a Test with four wickets down and survived to the end of the day.</p><p>First came Ian Bell, who batted with skill and monumental application for almost six hours, making 75, only to be dismissed, to his obvious distress, on the very stroke of tea. Then there was Stuart Broad, whose batting has deteriorated to such an extent since his century against Pakistan that the life expectancy of each innings since has been four overs. Broad batted for two hours and seventeen minutes, the first 103 minutes of which were scoreless, longer than anyone in Tests has ever gone without opening their account and in terms of deliveries, 62 balls, only 15 shy of that record. He survived until the shadows were lengthening and there were just 21 deliveries remaining.</p><p>Then there was Monty Panesar, called upon at the very death to reprise his Cardiff heroics and doing so nervelessly apart from one harem-scarem scampered single to get off the strike that ended with a swallow dive so mistimed that it left him still a foot short of the crease and scrabbling desperately to get home.</p><p>Above it all though was Prior. His unbeaten 110 was the seventh century of his Test career and by a distance his best given the responsibility he was handed in seeing things through once Bell had departed head down to the dressing room. Only Les Ames, of England wicketkeepers, has more, with eight.</p><p>Prior rode his luck. An early attempted pull was mistimed barely out of reach of a desperately backpedalling mid wicket. One ferocious bouncer to him clipped him on the head, looped over him and dropped onto the stumps without dislodging the bails. He had 28 then. Indeed the only time he seemed disconcerted was when Neil Wagner, the battling left armer, hurled in his clever variations of slow and faster bouncers. Prior felt the need to take them on as the best means of defending against them, and several times pulled the ball just out of reach of fielders placed short on the legside for that purpose. That which he just scraped over the top of midwicket to bring up his hundred was greeted with his own cry of admonishment, furious with himself for getting sucked in. Given the defensive nature of his task, his innings, over 182 deliveries, still ranks as brisk and there were 20 boundaries. </p><p>Although the result means that they just retain their position as the number two ranked side, and the extra cash that goes with it, the England euphoria that accompanied the result cannot camouflage the fact that in the course of the three matches they have been outplayed overall by a good New Zealand side that Graham Gooch, the batting coach, has confessed they underestimated. In Dunedin, where a day was lost to the weather, it is likely New Zealand would have won, while in Wellington, the dreadful weather probably prevented England from doing likewise. Here it has been New Zealand who have bossed the game. Whether they would have won had Brendon McCullum enforced the follow-on is a moot point, but aside from some help from the bowlers rough there was precious help for spin or seam even on the fifth day once the new ball had been negotiated by England. </p><p>England had begun the day with Bell and Joe Root at the crease and the pair managed to stay together until shortly before lunch when McCullum handed the second new ball to Boult. His first delivery with it was perfect, swinging down the line of the stumps and catching Root in front. If the young batsman has ambition to be an international opener then, fine delivery as it was, he ought to have anticipated the possibility. Then came two rare mistakes by New Zealand, one costly the other not, for in the space of two deliveries, Bell, who had made 40 by then, was dropped at third slip by Dean Brownlie, and Jonny Bairstow was missed in the gully. Bairstow, hopelessly but not unexpectedly, out of touch, was caught at first slip straight after the interval but Bell was able to bat for almost another full session, with Prior, before he lost concentration, flicked at Wagner and was caught at third slip. At that point , with 32 overs still remaining,the game really did seem up. </p><p>But Broad entrenched himself, overcoming a nervy start and surviving one close lbw call, a thin edge saving him as he was knocked off his feet by a yorker, but his bat handle jamming itself into his neck as he fell. It did appear that he would be able to see things through with Prior, until McCullum called up Kane Williamson to send down his gentle offspin to the left hander. Broad pushed, the ball spun out of the rough and Ross Taylor took the catch, the combination repeating itself two balls later when Anderson, who had shared the Cardiff heroics with Panesar, also edged. When Panesar, left to face the final over, managed to get off strike with the third ball, the relief was palpable.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406216762|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|6e4443421d0c334dea7c69e7e822a0bf2f58ccc3 -->",

        "headline":"England on brink of defeat as New Zealand take total command",
        "body":"<p>England were in a desperate position at the close of the fourth day of a match dominated by a vibrant New Zealand team. Battered and bruised in the field by a second century in the match from Peter Fulton and McCullumed into oblivion for the umpteenth time in the past two months, England were set the notional target of 481 to win – uncharted territory in that regard for any side in the history of the game – but more realistically 143 overs to bat out and claim a share of the three-match series.</p><p>They do have history of surviving such a challenge, most recently the 141 overs they used up against South Africa in Cape Town three years ago, when Paul Collingwood – Brigadier Block – spent four and a half hours over 40 and Ian Bell as long over 78. </p><p>As the shadows lengthened though, and the teams left the field, the innings, at 90 for four, was in tatters once more, surely along with their hopes. They lost Nick Compton in the third over of the innings and later Jonathan Trott, a second bastion, to the first delivery purveyed from round the wicket by the indefatigable Neil Wagner, a wide ball at which the batsman drove without due care and attention and edged, an uncharacteristic lapse in his concentration: it was a dismissal that had its roots, perhaps, in the time spent in the field watching the ball sail into the stands.</p><p>It appeared that the captain Alastair Cook had the resolve at least to see things through to the close, with Bell digging in alongside him. But like Trott even Cook's powers of concentration wavered and with fewer than four overs of the day remaining he too drove vigorously at Kane Williamson's offbreak where he need not have done, and Dean Brownlie held a stupendous reflex catch at slip. Cook had made 43 from 145 balls. One further wicket went to what proved the final ball of the day, when Steve Finn, the nightwatchman who survived more than two sessions in Dunedin, prodded a catch, from Williamson once more, to gully where Tim Southee held a second reflex catch. Such things stick when you are on a high. Bell at least remained, with eight runs from 89 balls. </p><p>England have been unravelled by the New Zealanders at Eden Park, outbatted by Fulton, a revelation after a four-year absence (to himself as much as anyone no doubt) and recipient of a message from the prime minister for his efforts; outbowled by Trent Boult, Southee and Bruce Martin; outfielded (although that might be harsh for England's rarely flagged under the assault and Matt Prior was terrific throughout); and certainly outgeneralled by McCullum.</p><p>It is easy to captain when you have a team on the ropes but New Zealand were able to reach that stage in the first place through his proactivity. The pity is that few Aucklanders have bothered to turn up, even over the weekend, for this has the makings not just of a team that punches above its weight (the default position for Kiwi sides of the past) but with a couple of additions – another top flight batsman for instance, and the return of pacemen such as Doug Bracewell – could be regarded as one of the best around. Indeed the return series in England, in May, can no longer be looked at as the safe bet it is viewed as by many. A loss here and England will have slipped down the rankings to third place, below India. </p><p>Until McCullum pulled the plug on the innings at 241 for six, with a little more than an hour to tea, England had been reduced to rubble. New Zealand already had a sizeable lead at the start of play and after a little early reconnaissance, with licence then, and no consequences, to swing like the Krankies on a Saturday night, batting becomes easier.</p><p>England did try a different strategy to Fulton, whose disdain for the offside is matched by his penchant for the onside, by setting a short midwicket and bowling straighter. It might have brought his wicket when he had 32, Anderson unable to cling on in that very position, but it was the last offering he gave until Joe Root held a mishit at long on.</p><p>By then he had made 110, his last 60 runs coming from 44 balls, including five sixes as he opened his considerable shoulders: his stand with McCullum was worth 94 from 81 balls and at one time England employed every fielder on the fence except Prior, who in order to do so would have been compelled to hand in his gloves and pads. Later, as England defended, New Zealand had every man bar one around the bat. </p><p>Once again they were monstered by McCullum, who should become the threat of choice for errant children: \"Be quiet or Brendon McCullum will come and belt your attempted yorker into the stands.\" In the course of 10 innings in all formats he has made 576 runs at considerably more than a run a ball, hit seven half-centuries and 24 sixes, three of them in his unbeaten 67 here. It is an astounding run of form given the manner in which he plays.</p><p>As for his team, they managed 16 sixes in this match, just two short of the record of 18 by West Indies (against England in Antigua in 1986) for a single team in a Test. England's only one thus far has come from Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406161122|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|a14dde4539c7d912ca8298af706741bfaee3346f -->",

        "headline":"England's bowlers struggle after putting New Zealand into bat on day one",
        "body":"<p>This was not one of England's finest days. With New Zealand put in to bat by Alastair Cook they suffered through a day in the field that yielded a maiden Test century, 124 not out, for Peter Fulton at the age of 34, another approaching for the brilliant young tyro Kane Williamson who left the field unbeaten on 83, and the single wicket, to Steve Finn, of Hamish Rutherford. Already, by the close of the first day, New Zealand, at 250 for one, had the solid foundations of a draw and thus a drawn series that one suspects has been the primary ambition since the first two matches ended in stalemate, with anything beyond that a bonus.<br /> <br />To this end they have had a compliant groundsman who, while capable of producing a drop-in pitch with genuine pace and bounce, has seen how Steve Finn got the ball through during the limited overs matches and appears to have top-dressed this offering with Mogadon. The bowlers, who have suffered their way through the featherbeds in Dunedin and Wellington, were made to do so again now in Eden Park, where they would get more help from a surly teenager asked to tidy his room. It might help New Zealand's cause and hinder that of England but it does very little for the game as a spectacle. </p><p>The debate will rage long and hard on whether Cook's decision to bowl first constitutes a blunder, and no doubt there will be the usual kneejerk reaction that inevitably accompanies such a day. It is a facile way of thinking. Nothing proves a decision such as this to be right or wrong until there is a much broader picture on which to draw.</p><p>England might reasonably have expected more assistance from a pitch that because of the Warriors rugby league team's match on the ground last Saturday would not have been put in place until Sunday at the earliest and must have had some residual moisture in it as a result. This is the first Test match at Eden Park in seven years so there is no real precedent on which to draw in terms of its behaviour. Even so it is the nature of drop-in pitches elsewhere generally to improve as matches wear on, as indeed it is for many natural surfaces: the days of always batting regardless are long since gone and sides now see bowling first as just as important in establishing a hold on a match as supposed scoreboard pressure.</p><p>The fullness of time may prove it a bad decision should New Zealand's bowlers make their way through the England order when their turn comes, or Cook and his advisers may be vindicated by England racking up a large total themselves, but it it would not be unreasonable to expect the most help for the seamers, whatever that might be, to be on the first day. Brendon McCullum has said he would have adopted the same strategy himself, as indeed he did in the first two Tests. It is just the modern way. </p><p>Nothing though should be taken away from Fulton, Two Metre Peter, whose Test career, which began in 2006, has been resurrected after a four-year absence, and as a makeshift opener. In the first two matches he had moderate success with one half-century but the feeling was that he was static, a bat-hanger, and did not make use of his height. But here, over the course of six hours' batting, he scarcely put a foot wrong, discrete outside offstump when England attacked him there and prolific on the legside both when the ball was pitched up or when dropped short. Only twice was he troubled: first, early on, when there was still hardness in the ball, Jimmy Anderson found the outside edge and the ball flew high to the right of Joe Root at third slip who could not quite get there; and once, off Anderson again, when an attempted hook spiralled high off the top edge but carried for six over the minuscule fine leg boundary.</p><p>He took his chances too against Monty Panesar – who had kept his place, despite a temptation to go with four seamers – clubbing him into the stand and once to the longest boundary. His century, reached with a single to mid-on, was marked with nice understatement and a look of mild relief that his career had gained some fulfilment. </p><p>Williamson, on the other hand, is a young player with the cricket world before him. The contrast at the crease between he and Fulton, during their unbroken second wicket stand of 171, could scarcely be greater. But diminutive batsmen, or the best ones at any rate, tend to be the best judges of length simply because they have to be. Essentially Williamson is a proficient cutter and puller as might be expected. Bowlers though will tend to overcompensate to someone who hangs back in the crease, and as such he is very quick and solid into the drive. In simple terms he looks a composed, solid, technically sound all-round batsman who might be troubled only by bounce on more flirty pitches than this.<br /> <br />The England seamers found no swing or seam movement and the bounce died once the hardness left the ball. Reverse swing is not an option with a thick lush outfield and no used pitches on which to scuff the ball. So they were reduced to attempting novelty field-placings, angles of attack, 10 minutes of short stuff – anything to break the rhythm of batting – to no avail until they took the second new ball 10 overs from the close and Anderson and Broad managed to sneak a couple past the bat of tiring <br />batsmen.</p><p>Panesar meanwhile twirled away, trying to mix things up occasionally and suffering when he did so. This is not turning into one of his more prolific series but a first day pitch is no place to be expecting any spinner to run through a team.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406043785|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|39fb3bf45b827fd4aa63551320bb648b45e0099e -->",
