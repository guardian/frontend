In 1786, the army captain Robert Bruce returned home from India with a five-year-old child he claimed was the daughter of a friend of his.  The girl did not know that Robert Bruce was her father.  Bruce kept the secret from his family for two years \u2013 and then he told them, right before he prepared to return to India, leaving the child in their care.  And so, in a genteel Edinburgh house, Robert Bruce\u2019s unmarried brother and sister, both very proud and very fearful, were left to tend their brother\u2019s secret.  Margaret Bruce arrived in Britain without a name.  She would become one of 19th-century Scotland\u2019s richest women",

But the history of learning disabilities tells a story that is almost precisely the opposite.  During the 19th century, the children who arrived at the Normansfield institution, founded in 1868 by Dr John Langdon Down for the education of so-called \u2018imbeciles\u2019 and \u2018feeble-minded\u2019, came accompanied by trunks full of fashionable clothes.  When they returned home for visits, their parents took them to garden parties and teas.  For the Victorians, an imbecile child was certainly an affliction, but not one that would be hidden away from friends and neighbours.  Such disabilities reflected no wicked choice in life and no moral failing \u2013 the categories of transgressions that for the Victorians incurred the largest burdens of shame",

Not only were the mentally disabled now believed ineducable, but they were suspected of furnishing the ranks of degenerates of all types.  The idea that feeble-mindedness was transmitted down the generations struck fear in the heart of families, especially those of the middle and upper classes.  So several generations of otherwise privileged children \u2013 including Reginald\u2019s own son, John, born with Down\u2019s syndrome \u2013 disappeared into Normansfield and its sister institutions.  Founded to promote the integration of the mentally disabled, institutions such as Normansfield instead became the means by which they could be isolated from society for a lifetime",

The interwar years marked the start of mass adoption, the first time that significant numbers of Britons took as their own the children of strangers.  At a time when illegitimacy was widely construed as evidence of \u2018bad blood\u2019 and a symbol of degeneracy, adoptive parents regarded it as a defect that did not matter so long as it could be hidden.

Families concocted elaborate schemes to claim an adopted child as their own biological kin.  They forged birth certificates, told lies to friends and neighbours, even moved to different towns to elude the pursuit of birth mothers.  According to Miss Edith Hart, the Mission of Hope\u2019s adoption secretary in the 1920s, it was so much nicer for children never to know they were adopted.  In the bound volumes where she kept track of the Mission\u2019s adoptions, Miss Hart noted with approval the ruses adoptive parents had engineered to carry out their deception.  To conceal an adoption was to show love:  James Fox\u2019s parents were \u2018terrified in case James should know he is not their own son!

Bruce kept the secret from his family for two years \u2013 and then he told them, right before he prepared to return to India, leaving the child in their care.  And so, in a genteel Edinburgh house, Robert Bruce\u2019s unmarried brother and sister, both very proud and very fearful, were left to tend their brother\u2019s secret.

But the history of learning disabilities tells a story that is almost precisely the opposite.  During the 19th century, the children who arrived at the Normansfield institution, founded in 1868 by Dr John Langdon Down for the education of so-called \u2018imbeciles\u2019 and \u2018feeble-minded\u2019, came accompanied by trunks full of fashionable clothes.  When they returned home for visits, their parents took them to garden parties and teas.  For the Victorians, an imbecile child was certainly an affliction, but not one that would be hidden away from friends and neighbours.  Such disabilities reflected no wicked choice in life and no moral failing \u2013 the categories of transgressions that for the Victorians incurred the largest burdens of shame",

Not only were the mentally disabled now believed ineducable, but they were suspected of furnishing the ranks of degenerates of all types.  The idea that feeble-mindedness was transmitted down the generations struck fear in the heart of families, especially those of the middle and upper classes.  So several generations of otherwise privileged children \u2013 including Reginald\u2019s own son, John, born with Down\u2019s syndrome \u2013 disappeared into Normansfield and its sister institutions.  Founded to promote the integration of the mentally disabled, institutions such as Normansfield instead became the means by which they could be isolated from society for a lifetime",

The interwar years marked the start of mass adoption, the first time that significant numbers of Britons took as their own the children of strangers.  At a time when illegitimacy was widely construed as evidence of \u2018bad blood\u2019 and a symbol of degeneracy, adoptive parents regarded it as a defect that did not matter so long as it could be hidden.

Families concocted elaborate schemes to claim an adopted child as their own biological kin.  They forged birth certificates, told lies to friends and neighbours, even moved to different towns to elude the pursuit of birth mothers.  According to Miss Edith Hart, the Mission of Hope\u2019s adoption secretary in the 1920s, it was so much nicer for children never to know they were adopted.  In the bound volumes where she kept track of the Mission\u2019s adoptions, Miss Hart noted with approval the ruses adoptive parents had engineered to carry out their deception.  To conceal an adoption was to show love:  James Fox\u2019s parents were \u2018terrified in case James should know he is not their own son!
