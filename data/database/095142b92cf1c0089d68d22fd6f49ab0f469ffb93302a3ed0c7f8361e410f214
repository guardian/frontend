The third figure, with the hockey stick still clenched tightly in his hand, stayed still for a moment, checking to see whether there was any movement in the other beds.”<br></p><p>“ He began to pound the mouth below him, using his clenched ﬁst as a hammer; he hit with more and more passionate hysteria as the face became slippery. A knee jerked up between his legs and he fell sideways, busying himself with his pain, and the ﬁght rolled over him.”</p><p>“Steph produced a lighter and played it expertly over this end of the joint. He had a little puff and then coughed vigorously and puffed again. This time he was more successful and was able to keep the smoke down for a moment or two before it all came spluttering out.”</p><p>“He got all undressed, down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren’t allowed to smoke in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke.”</p><p>“He leaned right across Mitch until his face was in front of Devon’s, then bellowed ‘Cunt!’ out the window.”</p><p>“Come on, shift it, you daft cunt. I need more beers before I sober up.”</p><p>“The urgency now bordered on panic. Then she had his cock in her wet hand. He gasped. The next thing was he felt a fluttering convulsion and came immediately, draping the wall of the bathroom with a ribbon of sperm.”</p><p>“He kissed the slight, rose-coloured trench that remained from her knicker elastic, running around her belly like the equator line circling the world.”</p><p>Their mutual need was the only goal and with each couping they became more practised, more daring, more successful. When they had finished they ran back to their other lives, still glowing with the warmth of their secret.”</p><p>“’Were you fucking?’ ‘Jamie!’ ‘<em>That’s not a bad word . . . hate and war are bad words</em> but fuck isn’t.’”</p><p>“He kept repeating. ‘You fucken, fucken cunt. I’m gonna kill you.’ Hartnell looked up at the crowd that now surrounded them. ‘Whoooo! I’m real scared! See the headlines - ‘Hartnell mugged by angry black fag.’”</p><p>“All at once, Robert was screaming and struggling with the strength of frenzy. Jack had him by the hair and was brandishing his knife. Behind him was Roger, fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually, as at the last moment of a dance or a hunt.”</p><p>“He was able to raise and lower her easily in the bobbing water and she gasped in his ear as he drove deeper.”</p><p>“He laid his hand on her shoulder, and softly, gently, it began to travel down the curve of her back, blindly, with a blind stroking motion, to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand softly, softly, stroked the curve of her flank.”</p><p>“On days when I feel lost or caught between two paths, there is a room I go to. It is a long narrow room and I stand on the threshold, peering into its darkening depths at the line of figures who await my call.”</p><p>“There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.”</p>","embedType":"interactive"}}]},{"id":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/2000.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/2000.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"1200","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"2000"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/1000.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/1000.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"600","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"1000"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/500.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/500.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"300","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"500"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/140.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/140.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"84","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"140"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/3543.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/3543.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"2126","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"3543"}},{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9/0_113_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg","source":"Random House  New Zealand","isMaster":"true","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Ted Dawe, New Zealand author of Into the River","height":"2126","credit":"Photograph: Random House  New Zealand","mediaId":"4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4d51ff0d3b39b23d2e3f5465fc337759f8eac7b9","width":"3543"}}]}],"rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"type":"article","sectionId":"books","webTitle":"Can you pick the quotes from Ted Dawe's banned novel Into the River?","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-09-08T15:33:56Z","fields":{"wordcount":"78","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4c7hb","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"New Zealand has banned Ted Dawe’s award-winning young adult novel Into the River following objections from Christian group Family First over its “detailed descriptions of sex acts, coarse language and scenes of drug-taking”.
