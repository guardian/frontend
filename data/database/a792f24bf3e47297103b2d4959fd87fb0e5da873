        "body":"<p>Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann from a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 have received almost 1,000 phone calls and emails from the public after their fresh appeal on Crimewatch for information.</p><p>A number of people have provided police with the same name of an individual who they believe matches the description of a man seen carrying a young child away from the resort in Praia da Luz towards the beach area at what detectives now believe is a crucial time the night Madeleine vanished.</p><p>More than 700 people called the appeal numbers and more than 20 people emailed information after police released new efit images of possible suspects, Scotland Yard said, in what the senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said was an \"overwhelming response\".</p><p>Detectives on the Metropolitan police inquiry believe the disappearance of Madeleine bears all the hallmarks of a \"pre-planned abduction\". In a significant development the Met police team has ruled out a sighting of a man carrying a child who was treated for six years as the prime suspect in the case. They now believe that individual was an innocent British tourist, carrying his child from the night creche on the resort back to his apartment.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419997370'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/25/1335348828936/Madeleine-McCann-007.jpg' alt='Madeleine McCann' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Madeine McCann aged three, left, and how police think she may have looked 18 months ago. Photograph: Teri Blythe/Metropolitan police/PA</figcaption></figure><p>The elimination of that suspect has focused attention on to another sighting later in the evening of a dark-haired man carrying a child with blond hair, possibly wearing pyjamas, towards the beach in the town. The shift in emphasis has raised the possibility that Madeleine's mother, Kate McCann, could have missed her abductor by minutes when she went to check on the child and her siblings in the family's apartment in a holiday resort in Praia da Luz at 10pm on the night she was taken.</p><p>At around the same time an Irish family saw a man aged between 20 and 40 with brown hair carrying a young child with blond hair dressed in pyjamas towards the beach in the town. They produced an efit of the individual in 2008 for private detectives hired by the McCanns but the image was only made public this week by the Met police who are leading the new investigation into the child's abduction in a £5m inquiry being paid for by the Home Office.</p><p>The publication of efits of the man has led to a huge response from the public, with a number of people providing the same name for the individual, it is understood. Police say among those who have contacted them are tourists who were at the resort at the time of Madeleine's disappearance, but have never spoken to investigators before.</p><p>Redwood said he was \"extremely pleased\" with the response to the programme.  \"We will now take the time to follow up these lines of inquiry.\"</p><p>Madeleine was nearly four when she went missing on 3 May 2007 from the ground-floor holiday apartment in the Ocean Complex while her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant. Redwood believes the child may have been abducted in an organised, planned operation by a group of individuals who might have checked out the layout of the resort in the days before. Redwood said one reading of the evidence was that it was a kidnapping which had \"all the hallmarks of a pre-planned abduction that would have undoubtedly involved reconnaissance\".</p><p>Police are also pursuing links to a sharp rise in burglaries in the area, and bogus charity workers approaching individuals on the resort. Efits of a fair-haired man said to have been seen \"lurking around\" the apartment have also been issued. The man could be Dutch or German.</p><p>Appeals are to be made in the coming days in Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland.</p><p>The Crimewatch editor, Joe Mather, said those calling the programme included many British people who were in Praia da Luz at the time of the child's disappearance. Some had given police new names, and the same name had been mentioned several times. \"It's been a truly unprecedented response,\" he said. \"We were genuinely pleased with the response and the police were too.\"</p><p>Mather said he could not reveal new lines of inquiry but it was \"always significant\" if people called in with the same name of an individual.</p><p>New leads could be hampered by the fact that there are no plans to show the fresh appeal for information in Portugal, according to the criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas, a former police officer and child protection expert.</p><p>British officers needed to resolve their differences with Portuguese police in order for the investigation to make a breakthrough, Williams-Thomas told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. \"We need to get [the Portuguese police] to show the appeal, set aside their political differences, set aside their pride and get to the position where [the forces] are both focused, working together.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419997368'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381830430978/Madeleine-McCanns-parents-009.jpg' alt='Madeleine McCann's parents, Gerry and Kate, speak on Crimewatch' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gerry and Kate McCann speak on Crimewatch. Photograph: Enterprise News and Pictures</figcaption></figure><p>Redwood said: \"Our appeal continues and later today I will be travelling to Holland, and tomorrow Germany, to continue the appeal for information.</p><p>\"Madeleine remains at the heart of everything we do and I will continue to update the McCann family as more information is received by the incident room.\"</p><p>During the programme Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, urged people to rack their brains and come forward with information. Her father said he was hopeful and optimistic at the progress of the new investigation: \"These cases can get solved. That is what the public need to think about tonight.\"</p><p>Kate McCann said: \"It doesn't matter how much heartache we put ourselves through so long as we get the result that we need.\"</p><p>On Crimewatch, viewers were shown two images of a man with dark hair, based on descriptions from two witnesses who were staying in Praia da Luz at the time. Witnesses described the man as white, aged 20-40, with short brown hair, of medium build, medium height and clean-shaven.</p><p>Investigators have also released efits of two fair-haired men seen near the McCanns's apartment at the time. One was seen twice by the same witness nearby. He was 30-35, thin, with short hair, shaving spots on his face and was wearing a black leather jacket. Another witness saw a similar-looking man in the resort.</p><p>Police are also investigating a spate of break-ins in the area, one of which happened in the same week a year before Madeleine went missing involving a man who entered a flat where young children were sleeping.</p><p>Redwood said: \"[H]e appears to have come through the patio door, had a look around inside and definitely had a look into one of the cots and then left without taking anything. Then one of the children raised the alarm.</p><p>\"We're particularly interested in that event as to whether it has any resonance to the disappearance of Madeleine. The man was described as being a white man with dark hair.\"</p><p>Police are also looking into bogus charity collectors who were operating in the area at the time. On the day that Madeleine disappeared, properties were targeted four times, say detectives.</p><p>Police have released two efits of Portuguese men. One, aged 40-45, knocked on the door of the apartment where the McCanns were to stay on 25 or 26 April between 2.30pm and 3pm, saying he was a charity collector. The other, aged 25-30, approached a property on the Rua do Ramalhete, near the Ocean Club, at around 4pm on 3 May.</p><p>There is a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for Madeleine's disappearance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419989051|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|a891693db733d7eaf52c4363a519226cc58d7106 -->",

        "body":"<p>A social worker once told me that when faced with a highly emotive child protection situation, the most important thing is having the presence of mind to pause. As Kipling put it, to \"keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs.\" Pausing to plan a response in a crisis is critical.</p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/madeleine-mccann-suspect-carrying-child\" title=\"\">Madeleine McCann</a> went missing in 2007, police in Portugal were faced with a difficult and highly charged scenario, no doubt made more complex by parental anxiety, along with language and cultural differences. As those first few hours disappeared in confusion and miscommunication, valuable minutes will have been lost. As hours turned to days there was little sense of pause, planning or direction, but no shortage of offers to help. There wasn't a policing agency in the UK that did not want to do all that it could to assist in the search for the little girl, whose picture was embedded in the public's conscience.</p><p>As the months rolled by with no sign of Madeleine, for a period of time her parents became <em>aguidos</em>, suspects, in the investigation. The only unusual thing about that was that it did not happen earlier; investigators always clear the ground beneath their feet and in doing this you look at the parents.</p><p>Many people have opinions about Kate and Gerry McCann. The rights and wrongs of their meal at the tapas bar and their approach to checking on the children. I am of the view that there but for the grace of God go I. For those perfect parents who have never left their children for a moment, think on this: if that was a lapse, they have paid a terrible price for it and they are still living the nightmare. No one but the person who took Madeleine is to blame for what has happened to her.</p><p>Others ask why all the attention for one child when so many go missing? They confuse children pushed or pulled from their homes in the UK by unhappy circumstances, sexual predators and so-called friends, with cases like Madeleine and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/28/ben-needham-kerry-needham-interview\" title=\"\">Ben Needham</a>. In the first instance the majority of those who go missing in the UK return home within 72 hours. They need greater attention, more resources and focus but their circumstances are different. Cases like Ben Needham and Madeleine, missing and suspected abducted abroad, are thankfully rare.</p><p>As the Metropolitan police investigation begins to gather pace, we have heard of new persons of interest, thousands of lines of inquiry, including highly valuable telecoms data and, critically, a much-improved working relationship with their Portuguese colleagues. All of that must be welcomed and while there will come a point to reflect on why some of this has taken so long, this is not that time.</p><p>Whether you were in Praia De Luz in May 2007 or not, you might hold the key, that piece of information which identifies a person or event, possibly even a phone number. Pause for a moment and consider the significant developments the police are sharing. Listen to the new timeline and look at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect\" title=\"\">efit images</a>. Someone out there knows, or has harboured suspicions, in either case now is the time to come forward.</p><p>The person or people responsible have an  uncomfortable week ahead. They probably thought they had weathered the storm but it's time for them to start looking over their shoulder again. Thanks to her parents' persistent campaigning, the search for Madeleine goes on.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419933389|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|1dbace5e8b549e272b3d4dc2b4dc6dfee76724eb -->",

        "body":"<h2>2007</h2><p></p><p><strong>3 May </strong>Madeleine disappears from a holiday apartment at the Ocean Club resort in the Algarve village of Praia da Luz, while her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, dine with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant.</p><p></p><p><strong>4 May </strong>The McCanns make an emotional plea for Madeleine's safe return, directly appealing to their daughter's abductors and speaking of their \"anguish and despair\".</p><p></p><p><strong>25 May</strong> In their first interviews, the McCanns say the guilt of not being with Madeleine will never leave them. Police release a description of the man seen carrying a child on the night of Madeleine's disappearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>6 June</strong> Madeleine's parents deny any involvement in her abduction when questioned by a German journalist at a press conference in Berlin.</p><p></p><p><strong>16 June</strong> A British couple report seeing a small blonde girl in the Maltese capital, Valletta. A full-scale investigation is launched in the wake of a number of other possible sightings.</p><p></p><p><strong>17 June</strong> Portuguese police say Madeleine's friends and family may have unwittingly destroyed vital evidence in the first few hours after her presumed abduction, during their search for her.</p><p></p><p><strong>28 June</strong> Spanish police arrest an Italian man and a Portuguese woman suspected of trying to extort money from Madeleine's parents by offering them information about the missing girl.</p><p></p><p><strong>6 July</strong> Dutch police reveal they have arrested a man in Eindhoven suspected of attempting to defraud Gerry and Kate McCann by demanding €2m (£1.35m) for information on Madeleine's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p><strong>6 August</strong> A Portuguese newspaper reports that British sniffer dogs have found traces of blood on a wall in the apartment where Madeleine went missing. A Portuguese paper, the Jornal de Noticias, claims detectives now believe it is most likely that Madeleine is dead, having been killed accidentally.</p><p></p><p><strong>15 August</strong> Blood traces found in the bedroom where Madeleine was sleeping the night she was snatched were not hers, the Times reports. Forensic results show the blood came from a man, it adds.</p><p></p><p><strong>31 August</strong> It emerges that the McCanns are to launch a libel action against a Portuguese newspaper that claimed police believed they killed their daughter. The action will be against the Tal &amp; Qual paper, based in Oporto.</p><p></p><p><strong>6-8 September</strong> Kate McCann arrives at a Portuguese police station to face further questioning by detectives. Both McCanns are declared official suspects (<em>arguido</em>)  after police questioning.</p><p></p><p><strong>9 September</strong> The McCanns return to their home in Rothley, Leicestershire, with their twins, Sean and Amelie.</p><p></p><p><strong>10 September</strong> Portuguese police sources suggest DNA tests prove Madeleine's body was in the boot of a car hired by her parents 25 days after she disappeared. Some DNA experts doubt the claims.</p><p></p><p><strong>11 September</strong> A dossier outlining the police case against the McCanns is passed to the local prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, who then asks a judge to assess the information.</p><p></p><p><strong>18 September</strong> Clarence Mitchell, a former BBC reporter, confirms he has resigned as the head of the government's media monitoring unit to become the spokesman for the McCann family. His salary is paid by a Cheshire businessman, Brian Kennedy.</p><p></p><p><strong>19 September</strong> The Evora district attorney general, Luís Bilro Verão, rules there is not enough evidence to justify further questioning of the McCanns about the disappearance of their daughter.</p><p></p><p><strong>2 October</strong> The police officer in charge of the inquiry, Gonçalo Amaral, is removed from the case and demoted for criticising British police involvement in the investigation.</p><p></p><p><strong>16 November</strong> Jane Tanner, one of the McCann family's closest friends and part of the so-called Tapas Seven, says she saw a man carrying a sleeping child away from the holiday apartments 45 minutes before Kate McCann discovered her daughter was missing.</p><p></p><h2>2008</h2><p></p><p><strong>13 February</strong> Portuguese authorities say the search for Madeleine is winding down, more than nine months after she vanished.</p><p></p><p><strong>19 March</strong> The Daily Express and the Daily Star carry unprecedented front-page apologies for publishing more than 100 articles on the disappearance of Madeleine, some of which suggested her parents were involved in her death. The papers pay £550,000 in damages.</p><p></p><p><strong>7 April</strong> Portuguese police arrive in the UK to be present as Leicestershire constabulary officers begin interviewing the Tapas Seven.</p><p></p><p><strong>3 May</strong> The first anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance is marked with a renewed appeal for information and church services in Portugal and the UK.</p><p></p><p><strong>7 July</strong> Leicestershire police agree to share with the McCanns 81 pieces of information from their investigation. The McCanns ask to have access to Portuguese police files, too.</p><p></p><p><strong>15 July</strong> Robert Murat, a British expat living in Praia da Luz, wins about £600,000 in damages from 11 British newspapers and Sky News for defamatory reports of his involvement in the disappearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>24 July</strong> A book by the former head of the investigation, Amaral, is published claiming that Madeleine died in her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz.</p><p></p><p><strong>4 August</strong> The Portuguese police file on the disappearance is made public. It shows that days before the McCanns were formally named as suspects, a British scientist had warned that tests on DNA recovered from the family's hire car were inconclusive. It also shows that during a subsequent interview with Portuguese police, Kate McCann refused to answer 48 questions about her daughter, apparently fearing they were intended to implicate her in the girl's disappearance.</p><p></p><p><strong>15 October</strong> The Tapas Seven receive a reported £375,000 in damages from Express Newspapers.</p><p></p><h2>2009</h2><p></p><p><strong>10 March</strong> Gerry McCann, appearing before MPs, calls for more stringent regulation of the press and labels coverage of his daughter's disappearance as some of the most \"irresponsible and damaging\" in press history.</p><p></p><p><strong>1 May</strong> A digitally enhanced image of how Madeleine might look now is revealed as the second anniversary of her disappearance approaches.</p><p></p><p><strong>17 May</strong> The McCanns announce they are to sue Amaral over claims made in his book that Madeleine died in her family's apartment and the parents were involved in hiding the body.</p><p></p><p><strong>3 November</strong> A one-minute video message – produced in seven languages – is launched by Britain's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, showing new images of how the girl might look more than two years after her abduction.</p><p></p><h2>2010</h2><p></p><p><strong>28 April</strong> Near the third anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, Gerry McCann says it is \"incredibly frustrating\" that police in Portugal and the UK have not been actively looking for Madeleine \"for a very long time\".</p><p></p><h2>2011</h2><p></p><p><strong>12 May</strong> In an open letter in the Sun newspaper, the McCanns ask the prime minister to launch an \"independent, transparent and comprehensive\" review of all information relating to the disappearance of their daughter.</p><p></p><p><strong>13 May</strong> David Cameron writes to the McCanns telling them the home secretary will set out \"new action\". The Metropolitan police begin a review.</p><p></p><p><strong>23 November</strong> The McCanns appear as witnesses at the Leveson inquiry into press standards. Kate McCann says she felt \"totally violated\" after the publication by the News of the World of her personal diaries and Gerry McCann says he believes British newspapers declared \"open season\" on them a few months after Madeleine's disappearance.</p><p></p><h2>2013</h2><p></p><p><strong>4 July</strong> The Metropolitan police say they have new evidence. They say they are investigating 38 \"persons of interest\" after launching a formal investigation.</p><p></p><p><strong>14 October</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect\" title=\"\">Detectives release an efit of a man they want to identify</a>.

Despite numerous appeals for information over the years, the man has not come forward to talk to investigators in Portugal or Britain.</p><p>Descriptions of the suspect were given to the Portuguese inquiry by two witnesses after Madeleine disappeared.</p><p>It is only now, after Metropolitan police detectives cross-referenced all the information gathered by Portuguese detectives, private investigators and the mobile phone data from the resort, that the significance of the witness statements has been fully understood. In an appeal to be broadcast on Monday night on BBC1's Crimewatch, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood of the Metropolitan police will call for anyone who recognises the man to contact him&nbsp;immediately.</p><p>A 25-minute reconstruction of the events of 3 May 2007, with a child actor playing Madeleine, will also demonstrate that the accepted account and timeline of events on the night she went missing six years ago is wrong, police say.</p><p>\"The efits are clear and I would ask the public to look very carefully at them,\" Redwood said. \"If you know who this person is, please come forward.</p><p>\"Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance.\"</p><p>The significance of the man has come to light as detectives have analysed tens of thousands of documents from the original investigation and mobile phone footprints in the resort on the night the child went missing.</p><p>Redwood said: \"Our work to date has significantly changed the timeline and the accepted version of events that has been in the public domain to date.\"</p><p>Redwood is leading the £5m British investigation into the suspected abduction of Madeleine in May 2007 while her family were on holiday in Praia da Luz.</p><p>The inquiry is focusing on 41 suspects and requests for assistance have been issued to 30 countries in a bid to identify and eliminate these people, 15 of whom are British. Crimewatch will feature other efits of individuals that the police would also like to trace.</p><p>But it is this man in particular whom detectives are very keen on finding. The man was described by the two witnesses as being inside the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz area on the evening that Madeleine went missing from the apartment. Redwood will travel to Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland to repeat his appeal as detectives from the British investigation attempt to close in on the man. He was described by the witnesses as white, aged between 20 and 40, with short brown hair, of medium build, medium height and clean shaven.</p><p>Redwood will outline the new theory of what happened on Crimewatch on Monday, in a 25-minute reconstruction which he said amounted to the most detailed narrative yet of what happened.</p><p>It dramatises the hours before Madeleine's disappearance, with the child actor dressed in a floppy hat, T-shirt and shorts, filmed running around picking up tennis balls on the court where her parents played that afternoon.</p><p>Later, the film shows the couple leaving apartment 5a, where their three children – Madeleine, then three, and twins Sean and Amelie, 18 months – slept inside, and sitting down with their friends at a pool-side table in a tapas bar a few hundred yards away.</p><p>At 8.30pm Kate and Gerry McCann went for dinner with seven friends, leaving the children, who were checked on at least twice, according to Kate McCann's&nbsp;autobiography.</p><p>The McCanns' friend, Jane Tanner has said that at about 9.15pm she saw a man carrying a small child, walking away from apartment 5a. That man has never been&nbsp;traced. At 10pm Redwood said Madeleine's mother found the child gone when she checked the apartment.</p><p>By putting these 90 minutes under intense scrutiny, Redwood's team have established new theories about the events and exactly when Madeleine was&nbsp;abducted.</p><p>In an interview with Crimewatch, Kate McCann said: \"We are not the ones that have done something wrong here. It's the person who has gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family.\"</p><p>Redwood said: \"Through meticulously drawing together specific information, the team has been able to refocus the timeline and now places more significance on events that night.</p><p>\"The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance.</p><p>\"I hope that when the public sees our investigative strands drawn together within the overall context of that appeal, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.\"</p><p>Crimewatch will be broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on Monday.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><p><strong>3 May 2007</strong> Kate and GerryMcCann leave their three children asleep in their holiday apartment in Praia da Luz while they dine with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant. Madeleine is missing when her mother checks at 10pm.</p><p><strong>17 June</strong> Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa admits vital forensic clues may have been destroyed in the hours after Madeleine's disappearance as the scene was not protected properly.</p><p><strong>11 August</strong> Exactly 100 days after Madeleine disappeared, investigating officers publicly acknowledge for the first time that she could be dead.</p><p><strong>28 April 2010</strong> Near the third anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, Gerry McCann says it is \"incredibly frustrating\" that police in Portugal and the UK had not been actively looking for Madeleine \"for a very long time\".</p><p><strong>12 May 2011</strong> In an open letter in the Sun newspaper, the McCanns ask the prime minister to launch an \"independent, transparent and comprehensive\" review of all information relating to the disappearance of their daughter.</p><p><strong>13 May 2011</strong> David Cameron writes to the McCanns telling them the home secretary will set out \"new action\". Metropolitan police begin a review.</p><p><strong>4 July 2013</strong> The Met says it has new evidence.

The child he was carrying was aged three to four, blonde, and may have been wearing pyjamas.</p><p>Redwood said: \"A new understanding of events on the evening Madeleine disappeared has resulted in a renewed focus of the investigation. There may be an entirely innocent explanation of this man but we need to establish who he is to assist with our inquiries.\"</p><p>The efit images and new line of inquiry will feature in a BBC Crimewatch programme to be broadcast on Monday evening, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2013/oct/13/madeline-mccann-new-appeal-reconstruction-video\" title=\"\">which will feature a long reconstruction of events leading up to Madeleine's disappearance</a>.</p><p>The efits and description are among a wealth of evidence from Portuguese detectives and private investigators, as well as mobile phone data from the resort, re-examined by the Met.</p><p>Redwood is leading the £5m British investigation into the suspected abduction of Madeleine. The inquiry is focusing on 41 suspects, and requests for assistance have been issued to 30 countries in an attempt to identify and eliminate these people, 15 of whom are British. Crimewatch will feature efits of other individuals that the police would also like to trace.</p><p>But it is this man in particular whom detectives are very keen on finding. Redwood will travel to Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland to repeat his appeal as detectives from the British investigation attempt to close in on the man.</p><p>Monday night's 25-minute BBC reconstruction dramatises the hours before Madeleine's disappearance, with a child actor dressed in a floppy hat, T-shirt and shorts filmed running around picking up tennis balls on the court where her parents played that afternoon. Later, the film shows the couple leaving apartment 5a, where their three children – Madeleine, and twins Sean and Amelie, then 18 months – slept inside, and sitting down with their friends at a poolside table in a tapas bar a few hundred yards away.</p><p>At 8.30pm Kate and Gerry McCann went for dinner with seven friends, leaving the children, who were checked on at least twice, according to Kate McCann's autobiography.</p><p>The McCanns' friend Jane Tanner has said that at about 9.15pm she saw a man carrying a small child walking away from apartment 5a. At 10pm Madeleine's mother found the child gone when she checked the apartment.</p><p>In an interview with Crimewatch, Kate McCann said: \"We are not the ones that have done something wrong here. It's the person who has gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family.\"</p><p>Crimewatch will be broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on Monday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419921409|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|f1900b9482698d98edef0d5d9239e991e82885fc -->",

        "body":"<p>Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann from a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 have received almost 1,000 phone calls and emails from the public after their fresh appeal on Crimewatch for information.</p><p>A number of people have provided police with the same name of an individual who they believe matches the description of a man seen carrying a young child away from the resort in Praia da Luz towards the beach area at what detectives now believe is a crucial time the night Madeleine vanished.</p><p>More than 700 people called the appeal numbers and more than 20 people emailed information after police released new efit images of possible suspects, Scotland Yard said, in what the senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said was an \"overwhelming response\".</p><p>Detectives on the Metropolitan police inquiry believe the disappearance of Madeleine bears all the hallmarks of a \"pre-planned abduction\". In a significant development the Met police team has ruled out a sighting of a man carrying a child who was treated for six years as the prime suspect in the case. They now believe that individual was an innocent British tourist, carrying his child from the night creche on the resort back to his apartment.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419997370'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/25/1335348828936/Madeleine-McCann-007.jpg' alt='Madeleine McCann' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Madeine McCann aged three, left, and how police think she may have looked 18 months ago. Photograph: Teri Blythe/Metropolitan police/PA</figcaption></figure><p>The elimination of that suspect has focused attention on to another sighting later in the evening of a dark-haired man carrying a child with blond hair, possibly wearing pyjamas, towards the beach in the town. The shift in emphasis has raised the possibility that Madeleine's mother, Kate McCann, could have missed her abductor by minutes when she went to check on the child and her siblings in the family's apartment in a holiday resort in Praia da Luz at 10pm on the night she was taken.</p><p>At around the same time an Irish family saw a man aged between 20 and 40 with brown hair carrying a young child with blond hair dressed in pyjamas towards the beach in the town. They produced an efit of the individual in 2008 for private detectives hired by the McCanns but the image was only made public this week by the Met police who are leading the new investigation into the child's abduction in a £5m inquiry being paid for by the Home Office.</p><p>The publication of efits of the man has led to a huge response from the public, with a number of people providing the same name for the individual, it is understood. Police say among those who have contacted them are tourists who were at the resort at the time of Madeleine's disappearance, but have never spoken to investigators before.</p><p>Redwood said he was \"extremely pleased\" with the response to the programme.  \"We will now take the time to follow up these lines of inquiry.\"</p><p>Madeleine was nearly four when she went missing on 3 May 2007 from the ground-floor holiday apartment in the Ocean Complex while her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant. Redwood believes the child may have been abducted in an organised, planned operation by a group of individuals who might have checked out the layout of the resort in the days before. Redwood said one reading of the evidence was that it was a kidnapping which had \"all the hallmarks of a pre-planned abduction that would have undoubtedly involved reconnaissance\".</p><p>Police are also pursuing links to a sharp rise in burglaries in the area, and bogus charity workers approaching individuals on the resort. Efits of a fair-haired man said to have been seen \"lurking around\" the apartment have also been issued. The man could be Dutch or German.</p><p>Appeals are to be made in the coming days in Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland.</p><p>The Crimewatch editor, Joe Mather, said those calling the programme included many British people who were in Praia da Luz at the time of the child's disappearance. Some had given police new names, and the same name had been mentioned several times. \"It's been a truly unprecedented response,\" he said. \"We were genuinely pleased with the response and the police were too.\"</p><p>Mather said he could not reveal new lines of inquiry but it was \"always significant\" if people called in with the same name of an individual.</p><p>New leads could be hampered by the fact that there are no plans to show the fresh appeal for information in Portugal, according to the criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas, a former police officer and child protection expert.</p><p>British officers needed to resolve their differences with Portuguese police in order for the investigation to make a breakthrough, Williams-Thomas told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. \"We need to get [the Portuguese police] to show the appeal, set aside their political differences, set aside their pride and get to the position where [the forces] are both focused, working together.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419997368'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381830430978/Madeleine-McCanns-parents-009.jpg' alt='Madeleine McCann's parents, Gerry and Kate, speak on Crimewatch' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gerry and Kate McCann speak on Crimewatch. Photograph: Enterprise News and Pictures</figcaption></figure><p>Redwood said: \"Our appeal continues and later today I will be travelling to Holland, and tomorrow Germany, to continue the appeal for information.</p><p>\"Madeleine remains at the heart of everything we do and I will continue to update the McCann family as more information is received by the incident room.\"</p><p>During the programme Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, urged people to rack their brains and come forward with information. Her father said he was hopeful and optimistic at the progress of the new investigation: \"These cases can get solved. That is what the public need to think about tonight.\"</p><p>Kate McCann said: \"It doesn't matter how much heartache we put ourselves through so long as we get the result that we need.\"</p><p>On Crimewatch, viewers were shown two images of a man with dark hair, based on descriptions from two witnesses who were staying in Praia da Luz at the time. Witnesses described the man as white, aged 20-40, with short brown hair, of medium build, medium height and clean-shaven.</p><p>Investigators have also released efits of two fair-haired men seen near the McCanns's apartment at the time. One was seen twice by the same witness nearby. He was 30-35, thin, with short hair, shaving spots on his face and was wearing a black leather jacket. Another witness saw a similar-looking man in the resort.</p><p>Police are also investigating a spate of break-ins in the area, one of which happened in the same week a year before Madeleine went missing involving a man who entered a flat where young children were sleeping.</p><p>Redwood said: \"[H]e appears to have come through the patio door, had a look around inside and definitely had a look into one of the cots and then left without taking anything. Then one of the children raised the alarm.</p><p>\"We're particularly interested in that event as to whether it has any resonance to the disappearance of Madeleine. The man was described as being a white man with dark hair.\"</p><p>Police are also looking into bogus charity collectors who were operating in the area at the time. On the day that Madeleine disappeared, properties were targeted four times, say detectives.</p><p>Police have released two efits of Portuguese men. One, aged 40-45, knocked on the door of the apartment where the McCanns were to stay on 25 or 26 April between 2.30pm and 3pm, saying he was a charity collector. The other, aged 25-30, approached a property on the Rua do Ramalhete, near the Ocean Club, at around 4pm on 3 May.</p><p>There is a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for Madeleine's disappearance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419989051|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|a891693db733d7eaf52c4363a519226cc58d7106 -->",
