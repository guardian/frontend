He kindly emailed me this response:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fall in global CO2 emissions from 2008-2009 with the economic downturn and a 10% reduction in US emissions since 2005 (1), global emissions are roughly following the worst-case emission scenarios that will be used in the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Report (2).</p> <p>Commentators are at odds about exactly what cuts the new policy will achieve, but if we optimistically assume that US emissions will follow the Copenhagen agreement and reduce by 17% from 2005-2020 (3), this could save up to 1000 million metric tonnes of global CO2 emissions (around 3% of current world values). If we further assume that this is a real global cut from the worse-case scenario and emissions growth elsewhere doesn’t compensate (as previously happened with huge growth in China over 2005-2011), we can go on to calculate the effect on atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature.</p> <p>To do this we estimated CO2 changes with the Bern pulse carbon cycle model (4) and temperature changes by using a simple model of climate (5) that is tuned to the latest climate model projections from our recent paper (6). These cuts acting alone would have a small but significant effect, reducing projected CO2 levels by 3 ppm in 2050 and 5 ppm in 2100, giving us between 0.02 and 0.04 C less warming in 2050 and staving off passing the 2C warming mark by 2-5 years. This may seem small as current levels of 400 ppm could easily pass 500 ppm by 2050, but every little helps.</p> <ol> <li>US emissions were 5940 million metric tonnes in 2005 and 5420 million metric tonnes in 2011.

Any ambition for big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the US is somewhat hobbled by the Republican control of Congress but, with a ramped-up commitment to financing of the UN&apos;s Green Climate Fund, Obama can still walk the talk on tackling global climate change.</p> </blockquote>","attributes":{},"id":"51cab9aae4b023faee6c7c00","firstPublishedDate":"2013-06-26T09:51:38Z","publishedDate":"2013-06-26T09:51:38Z","contributors":[]},{"lastModifiedDate":"2013-06-26T09:37:22Z","lastModifiedBy":{"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Hickman","email":"leo.hickman@guardian.co.uk"},"published":true,"title":"US newspaper reaction","createdDate":"2013-06-26T09:37:22Z","createdBy":{"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Hickman","email":"leo.hickman@guardian.co.uk"},"elements":[{"assets":[],"textTypeData":{"html":"<p>Here&apos;s how the speech went down in some US newspapers...</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-climate-20130625,0,1016446.story\">Baltimore Sun</a>: It falls far short of the truly significant reforms that are needed, but it at least moves America in the right direction, away from burning fossil fuels and toward renewable energy and greater fuel efficiency...A far better approach would involve some form of carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy that gave greater flexibility to energy providers.

For some, this was the most important aspect of his speech, given how little to date his presidency has offered the so-called &quot;climate concerned&quot;. He gave the strong impression that climate change was back, square and centre, on the Oval Office desk, something he had promised on the election trail, both in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>But details matter when it comes to climate and energy policies. And details were lacking in his speech. We still don&apos;t know, for example, what he intends to do with the Keystone pipeline. What does he mean by &quot;significantly&quot; when he says he will authorise it, but only if it &quot;does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem&quot;? And without instruments such as carbon taxes and &quot;cap and trade&quot;, how can we be sure that his beloved shale gas only ever replaces coal and not, as some fear, also curtails growth in renewables?</p> <p>And what of the wider question of whether the US&apos;s current emissions targets are enough to help prevent global temperatures rising above 2C over the course of this century?

But, if we&apos;re being honest, we already knew that.</p> <p>Therefore, Obama&apos;s speech can certainly be spun positively as &quot;better late than never&quot;, but a pragmatic assessment must conclude that the US is still making baby steps when huge strides forward are required.

But Piers’s calculation used just a single value for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3C.</p> <p>The PAGE09 model (<a href=\"http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/working_papers/2011/wp1104.pdf\">pdf</a>) uses a range of climate sensitivities consistent with the latest IPCC reports. Running Obama’s plan to reduce US emissions by 17% by 2020 through 10,000 runs of the PAGE09 model confirms that, with a range of ECS values, the plan will reduce global mean temperatures by between 0.012C and 0.032C by 2100 (5-95% values), with a most likely reduction of 0.02C, compared to business as usual. The PAGE09 model can also do what Piers could not, and make an estimate of how much this drop in temperatures would reduce global damages from climate change. The answer is it will reduce them by between 0.5 and 10.5 trillion dollars (5-95% values), with a mean reduction in damage of 4.5 trillion dollars.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/25/obama-climate-speech-expert-verdict\">other commentators have said</a>, it’s a start.</p> <p>(Details: US CO2 emissions assumed to be 17% below base year (2008) emissions from 2020 until 2075.

He kindly emailed me this response:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fall in global CO2 emissions from 2008-2009 with the economic downturn and a 10% reduction in US emissions since 2005 (1), global emissions are roughly following the worst-case emission scenarios that will be used in the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Report (2).</p> <p>Commentators are at odds about exactly what cuts the new policy will achieve, but if we optimistically assume that US emissions will follow the Copenhagen agreement and reduce by 17% from 2005-2020 (3), this could save up to 1000 million metric tonnes of global CO2 emissions (around 3% of current world values). If we further assume that this is a real global cut from the worse-case scenario and emissions growth elsewhere doesn’t compensate (as previously happened with huge growth in China over 2005-2011), we can go on to calculate the effect on atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature.</p> <p>To do this we estimated CO2 changes with the Bern pulse carbon cycle model (4) and temperature changes by using a simple model of climate (5) that is tuned to the latest climate model projections from our recent paper (6). These cuts acting alone would have a small but significant effect, reducing projected CO2 levels by 3 ppm in 2050 and 5 ppm in 2100, giving us between 0.02 and 0.04 C less warming in 2050 and staving off passing the 2C warming mark by 2-5 years. This may seem small as current levels of 400 ppm could easily pass 500 ppm by 2050, but every little helps.</p> <ol> <li>US emissions were 5940 million metric tonnes in 2005 and 5420 million metric tonnes in 2011.

Just as important as the timeframe for finalizing these standards is their stringency. Without sufficient ambition, the United States will not be able to achieve the reductions it needs by 2020 and in the years beyond.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2013/climate-plan-06-25-2013.html\"> Center for Biological Diversity</a></strong>: President Obama’s new climate plan takes modest steps toward reducing carbon pollution, but the strategy announced today will not cut emissions enough to prevent catastrophic warming and extreme weather dangers predicted by federal scientists. A key point in the president’s plan is a vague directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to establish carbon pollution standards for new and existing power plants — standards already required by law. The plan fails to address the Keystone XML pipeline, fracking on public lands and other dirty extreme-energy projects that could fatally undermine the climate change fight...The pollution control measures announced by the president today are aimed at fulfilling his administration’s pledge to put the United States on the path to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 4 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. But such a reduction falls far short of what the U.S. pledged in the Kyoto Protocol and would not be enough to avert catastrophic temperature rises, according to climate scientists.</p> <p><strong>Bjorn Lomborg in </strong><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/25/obama-climate-change-georgetown-column/2455723/\">USA Today</a>: Fracking is this decade&apos;s green solution. Obama recognizes gas as a &quot;bridge fuel.&quot; Replacing dirtier coal, cheaper gas from fracking has cut up to 500 MT of the U.S. CO2 emissions. This is 10 times more than what renewables do, and while renewables cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars, fracking has saved the U.S. consumer $125 billion annually in cheaper energy prices. Fracking has local environmental issues, but these can all be addressed with good regulation. Moving the US fracking miracle to the rest of the world will be the biggest source of CO2 reductions this decade, and simultaneously increase global welfare by allowing energy access to billions yet unserved.</p> <p><strong>Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK</strong>: The president&apos;s plan wouldn’t reduce carbon pollution as much as scientists say is needed, but he rightly zeros in on executive branch actions, rather than waiting any longer for Congress. President Obama correctly sees this as an all-hands-on-deck moment requiring a government-wide plan, including action on pollution from the largest source of US emissions -- existing dirty power plants. Recognizing that the US needs to meet its international commitments and strongly support robust international action is also crucial as the world works to forge a new global climate pact by 2015.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/obama-challenge-climate-energy-projects/blog/45723/\">Phil Radford</a>, executive director of Greenpeace USA</strong>: We proudly stand with Obama in the fight against carbon pollution, but we know that this fight won&apos;t be won with words alone...It&apos;s clear there&apos;s no room in our future for the Keystone pipeline, fracking, Arctic drilling, or giving away our public lands to the coal industry. Each of these projects will have a significant negative climate impact and not be in our national interest.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2013/06/sierra-club-statement-president-obama%E2%80%99s-climate-plan\">Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club</a></strong>: The Sierra Club’s 2.1 million members and supporters issued a collective cheer as they heard the President declare that the most effective defense against climate disruption will be by tackling the biggest single source of carbon pollution: coal plants...While we must reduce pollution further to truly address dangerous climate disruption, we applaud the Administration’s continued commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020. This plan includes key steps to reaching that goal, and we look forward to working with the Obama Administration to build on the progress laid out in today’s announcement.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here&apos;s a Google+ Hangout hosted by <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2013/06/live-blog-obama-rolls-out-climate-plan-2/\">ClimateDesk</a>&apos;s James West, featuring Grist&apos;s <a href=\"http://grist.org/author/david-roberts/\">David Roberts</a> and Mother Jones&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/authors/kate-sheppard\">Kate Sheppar</a>d...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0nkzDJYyZg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/s0nkzDJYyZg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab9aae4b023faee6c7c00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T09:51:38.805Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comment-on-obamas-climate-change-speech/\">Science Media Centre</a> has gathered together some reaction from academia...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Myles Allen, head of the climate dynamics group, University of Oxford</strong><strong>: </strong>Focussing on the basics — long-term solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions — is exactly what is needed. In a nutshell, we started out with four trillion tonnes of fossil carbon underground. It has taken us 250 years to dump half a trillion tonnes into the atmosphere; if we carry on as we are, we&apos;ll dump the next half-trillion in about 35 years; and the half-trillion after that will take us over two degrees. It really is that simple — but European and global climate policy is a well-intentioned mess, much of it irrelevant to real challenge of limiting total carbon emissions. Let&apos;s hope America can get us back on course to a simple, effective long-term solution.</p> <p><strong>Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Imperial College London:</strong> There has been important action on climate change in many US states, but I am very pleased to see this plan for federal action. Reduction in US greenhouse gas emissions is crucial. Equally important is the proposed US leadership role in international negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Dr David Reay, senior lecturer in carbon management, University of Edinburgh: </strong>As President Obama packs his bags for a week-long trip to Africa, the international ramifications of his new climate change plan must be on his mind. Any ambition for big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the US is somewhat hobbled by the Republican control of Congress but, with a ramped-up commitment to financing of the UN&apos;s Green Climate Fund, Obama can still walk the talk on tackling global climate change.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab652e4b05e0c044bbaf6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T09:37:42.776Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US newspaper reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here&apos;s how the speech went down in some US newspapers...</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-climate-20130625,0,1016446.story\">Baltimore Sun</a>: It falls far short of the truly significant reforms that are needed, but it at least moves America in the right direction, away from burning fossil fuels and toward renewable energy and greater fuel efficiency...A far better approach would involve some form of carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy that gave greater flexibility to energy providers. It would let the marketplace determine the solution. And fossil fuel-based forms of energy would be forced to pay for the harm they cause. In return, the federal government might reduce other taxes so that average consumers would suffer little-to-no net loss while the invisible hand of the free market works its magic. But that kind of proposal would require action by Congress and, unfortunately, it&apos;s far easier for opponents to attack climate change policy as a &quot;jobs killer,&quot; a term filled with irony given that global warming is the real killer.</p> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/opinion/at-last-an-action-plan-on-climate.html?ref=opinion\">New York Times</a>: It is an impressive lineup that aims not only to reduce carbon emissions but to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/climate-action-plan\">strengthen the nation’s defenses</a> against rising seas, more intense storms, drought and other consequences of global warming. But, so far, it is only a list, involving many moving parts and government agencies, and seeing it through will require coordination and, above all, a continuing commitment from him.</p> <p><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/plan-b-for-climate-change/2013/06/25/9a9bb060-ddc9-11e2-b197-f248b21f94c4_story.html\">Washington Post</a>: <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/highlights-of-obamas-plan-to-cut-carbon/263/\" data-xslt=\"_http\">Mr. Obama’s plan</a> is far from perfect. For one thing, it excludes the best anti-emissions policies, such as carbon taxes, that all require Congress’s approval. For another, it appears the EPA’s new rules on existing power plants could take a very long time to write and implement. The president has also larded up his plan with some of the usual nonsense that poses as energy policy in Washington, such as $8 billion in loan guarantees for fossil fuel technologies like <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ccs/index.html\" data-xslt=\"_http\">carbon capture and sequestration</a>, which hasn’t proven to be anything but excessively expensive. And the country still requires a long-term strategy to green the economy. But the major elements of the White House’s plan are still far better than settling for congressional inaction. Republicans in Congress, who were swift to criticize Mr. Obama on Tuesday, should offer him a better way to reduce emissions meaningfully while minimizing the economic effects. Otherwise, it’s time for the president to follow through.</p> <p><strong>The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323683504578567533647032380.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_carousel_1\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong>: Mr. Obama&apos;s ambitions will have no effect on global atmospheric carbon concentrations. Emissions are already falling in the U.S., thanks primarily to the shale gas boom, but emissions are rising in the developing world. Mr. Obama pandered to the climate-change absolutists by saying &quot;We don&apos;t have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society.&quot; But he never explained how his plan will reduce warming, or why climate models have failed to predict the warming slowdown of the last dozen or so years even as more CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51cab1a9e4b05e0c044bbaf1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T09:17:29.290Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I will be adding to these voices throughout the day, but the Guardian has already rounded up a snapshot of reaction to the speech <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jun/25/obama-climate-speech-expert-verdict\">here</a>.

He also said he would continue to press the issue as a priority of his second term even in the face of implacable opposition from Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>&quot;I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that&apos;s beyond fixing,&quot; Obama said to a gathering of students.</p> <p>Obama outlined a broad range of measures to cut greenhouse <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gas\">gas</a> emissions and promote the development of renewable <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy\">energy</a>, protect coastlines and cities from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/flooding\">flooding</a> and sea-level rise, and encourage efforts to reach a global climate deal.</p> <p>The over-arching goal was to put the US on track to meet its commitment to cut <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-emissions\">carbon emissions</a> 17% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.</p> </blockquote> <p>But can his plans achieve that goal? Is it enough? He signalled in the speech, for example, that he would only allow the expansion of the controversial <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/keystone-xl-pipeline\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> carrying tarsands oil from Canada to ports in the Gulf of Mexico if it &quot;does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem&quot;. He also said he was supportive of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/shale-gas\">fracking for shale gas</a>.</p> <p>Are his plans compatible with the widely shared aspiration of preventing average global temperatures rising 2C above pre-industrial era levels?</p> <p>Please leave your own thoughts below.
