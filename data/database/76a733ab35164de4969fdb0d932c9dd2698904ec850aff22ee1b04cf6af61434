I told them I had 10 and they said: &apos;We are going to kill you, do you think your grandchildren will miss you?&apos;</p> <p>&quot;I was consumed by fear. It was sheer hell and all I can remember is praying.&quot;</p> <p>She was ordered to open a second safe but was unable to perform the combination.</p> <p>As a result, the burglars tied her hands behind her back and made her lie in her bath where a water-drenched towel was wrapped around her face a number of times to simulate drowning.</p> <p>Jansen continued: &quot;Then they tied me to the towel rail with cable they had ripped from a nearby radio. They cut off my trousers and T-shirt with scissors.</p> <p>&quot;I was trembling because I thought they were going to rape me and I just kept praying.</p> <p>&quot;I was semi-conscious but eventually I realised they were gone and I had to bite myself out of the wires to get free.&quot;</p> <p>She managed to raise the alarm but police were unable to locate the men – who are believed to have escaped on foot – following a search of the area.</p> <p>Surrey police have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward.</p> <p>Detective Inspector Jake Nuttall, who is leading the investigation, said: &quot;This was an appalling, unprovoked attack on a defenceless, elderly woman in her own home and Surrey police is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice.</p> <p>&quot;The victim sustained injuries to her wrists, arms and shoulders during the attack but fortunately she is expected to make a full recovery. She has understandably been left deeply upset by this horrendous ordeal.</p> <p>&quot;This type of senseless violence will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in St George&apos;s Hill late on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday morning to call police as a matter of urgency.&quot;</p> <p>Anyone who witnessed the burglary or has any information should call Surrey police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.</p>","wordcount":"534","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2012-08-07T08:44:46Z","internalComposerCode":"56ab72aae4b0b3bb72abc897","internalOctopusCode":"6513132","internalPageCode":"1784257","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-08-07T17:28:35Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/39heg","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/39heg"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/aug/07/woman-torture-burglary-waterboard-surrey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/07/woman-torture-burglary-waterboard-surrey","webTitle":"Woman tortured during burglary tells of waterboarding ordeal","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-07T08:56:39Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk/2012/aug/07/woman-torture-burglary-waterboard-surrey","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
