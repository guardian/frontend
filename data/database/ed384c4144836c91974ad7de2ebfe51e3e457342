        "body":"<p>The prime minister has repaid more than $1,700 in travel entitlements after controversy erupted over MPs using taxpayer-funded benefits to attend private functions, such as weddings.</p> <p>Tony Abbott acknowledged in Bali on Monday that he had repaid expenses relating to the wedding of his friend and former Liberal frontbencher Sophie Mirabella in 2006.</p> <p>He justified claiming the $1094.64 travel entitlement on the basis he was then leader of the House of Representatives, and that position required &ldquo;certain representational roles&rdquo;.</p> <p>After the Bali press conference, Abbott&rsquo;s office confirmed that the prime minister had also paid back $609.10 worth of expenses he claimed to attend the 2006 nuptials of Peter Slipper, the former Liberal turned independent.</p> <p>Slipper, a former House of Representatives Speaker recruited by Labor in the 43rd parliament, is facing court proceedings over his use of travel entitlements. The Coalition was publicly critical of Slipper&rsquo;s alleged activities after his defection to the crossbench.</p> <p>Abbott on Monday said he believed the claims he made in 2006 were within the rules of the entitlements scheme, but advice from the Department of Finance was &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; &ndash; so he reimbursed the taxpayer. He said he had been prompted to check the record after reports emerged about Liberal frontbenchers attending the wedding of a Sydney radio host, and subsequently claiming travel expenses.</p> <p>The prime minister urged his parliamentary colleagues to remain within the rules of the entitlements scheme. If there were mistakes or grey areas, Abbott said, then &ldquo;clear it up as soon as possible&rdquo;.</p> <p>National Barnaby Joyce, the Liberal deputy leader, Julie Bishop, and backbencher Teresa Gambaro also claimed taxpayer-funded travel entitlements after mining billionaire Gina Rinehart flew them to a lavish Indian wedding in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/big-bucks-for-mps-bollywood-adventure-20131005-2v0wf.html\">according to Fairfax reports</a>.</p> <p>Joyce reasoned during a radio interview on Monday that he was within the rules concerning overseas study tours for MPs, and Rinehart had actually saved the taxpayer money. &ldquo;If someone else wants to pay half a trip, pay for it privately, which is basically what Gina Rinehart did, then it&rsquo;s actually made it cheaper for the taxpayer,&rdquo; Joyce said.</p> <p>The Greens are pledging to use the resumption of parliament to introduce a bill for a national integrity commissioner and independent parliamentary adviser to clear up ambiguities around travel entitlements.</p> <p>&ldquo;The next wedding charged to the taxpayer should be an iron-clad marriage between elected public office and accountability with a national integrity commissioner,&rdquo; the Greens leader, Christine Milne, said in a statement on Monday.</p> <p>&ldquo;The Greens have had legislation before the last parliament to clean up MPs&rsquo; entitlements with a national integrity commissioner but Labor and the Coalition refused to act. This scandal has reached the highest political office in the country and must end now,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;The Greens will move our integrity legislation again as soon as parliament returns.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419215596|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|a34ca425d1779bda4251fd3fb137b6dc4d1db955 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) has denied that the Australian consul general in Bali threatened to call in the Indonesian military and police to expel three West Papuan students who occupied his consulate early on Sunday morning.</p> <p>Markus Jerewon, 29, Yuvensius Goo, 22 and Rofinus Yanggam, 30, scaled the two-metre fence of the Australian compound in Bali’s Renon district at 3.20am local time (6.20am AEST) on Sunday morning. They left the compound three hours later and are now in hiding.</p> <p>Two men involved with organising the action told Guardian Australia that the trio of West Papuans left the consulate because they were afraid for their lives after being warned by consulate staff that the police and military would be called in.</p> <p>But a Dfat spokesperson said: &quot;The consul general did not make threats. He explained to the individuals that they were free to leave voluntarily.&quot;</p> <p>Tony Abbott, when asked about the incident at a press conference in Bali, did not confirm or deny that the threat of calling the Indonesian military or police was made.</p> <p>He repeated comments he made in Jakarta recently that Australia &quot;would not give people a platform to grandstand against Indonesia&quot;.</p> <p>The two co-organisers of the protest, who asked to be called John Stefanus and Rafael Willem to protect their real identities, spoke to Guardian Australia on Sunday night.</p> <p>Stefanus explained that he got a call from one of the trio, Rofinus Yanggam, from inside the consulate early on Sunday morning. “Before 7am I got a phone call from Rofinus. His voice was different from usual. He’s usually confident, this time he was scared,” Stefanus said.</p> <p>“Rofinus told me, ‘We are being asked by the consulate to leave the compound this morning. If we don’t, the consulate will call the Indonesian police and military to kick us out.’ There was an element of violence in the language, and there was a sense that there was going to be force used against them,” he said.</p> <p>Stefanus said he told Yanggam that the consulate staff member was probably bluffing and that they should stand their ground and wait for an order from Canberra. But soon after this phone call, the three protesters fled.</p> <p>Stefanus believes that it was specifically the mention of the Indonesian military that made the trio abandon their action and go into hiding.</p> <p>“If you mention the words ‘Indonesian military’ in Papua, the two words are traumatising for us Papuans. We have long learned what those two words mean. They were under pressure, they were traumatised,” he said.</p> <p>“They decided to leave without showing any resistance because the consulate was saying they would ask the Indonesian police and military to take them out.”</p> <p>Yanggam spoke to Guardian Australia shortly after leaving the consulate and said the consul general, Brett Farmer, told the group the Indonesian police and army would be called.</p> <p>“They told us, 'We don’t accept you to stay here. If you stay here for five minutes, I will call the Indonesian army to come and take you out,'” Yanggam said.</p> <p>“I know that if I am arrested then my life will be over. I will have no control over my life any more. So better to get out now.”</p> <p>Stefanus said the group had planned to stage a sit-in if consulate security attempted to force them out, but they were not expecting the Australians to call in Indonesian security forces, the very forces they were seeking safety from.</p> <p>According to Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, Indonesian authorities cannot enter embassy and consulate grounds without Australian permission. “The Australians could invite Indonesian police to enter and to expel the Papuan protesters, but the Indonesian police cannot enter without an invitation,” he said.</p> <p>Greens senator Richard Di Natale accused the consulate of effectively putting a gun to the protesters’ heads. He said: &quot;After hearing directly from the West Papuans involved, we now know the truth is that they only [left] after being threatened with being handed over to the Indonesian police.</p> <p>&quot;They effectively had a gun to their head.&quot;</p> <p>The trio and their spokesman, Rinto Kogoya, from the Alliance of Papuan Students, have now gone into hiding.</p> <p>Neither Stefanus nor Willem has heard from them since Sunday, and remain deeply concerned for their safety.</p> <p>Willem told Guardian Australia: “Yesterday when I went to the dorm [where the trio was supposed to be staying], as I was leaving in a taxi, I saw a soldier standing outside. He was looking into the dorm, staring in. I was thinking maybe he lived there, but when I made a U-turn, he was gone. I’m afraid he was a military intelligence officer.”</p> <p>Stefanus believes the group is trying to organise to leave Bali. “I don’t think they have been arrested but I think they are under a lot of pressure,” he said.</p> <p>“I’m waiting to be able to communicate with them. I’m worried because without knowing where they are and what they are doing, I can’t be certain what happened to them.”</p> <p>Willem said he wished the group had never left the Australian consulate. “The safest place for them to be would be inside the consulate now. I really do hope that the four of them are safe. I hope that they are in a safe place.</p> <p>“My concern is with other Papuan students in Bali. I think the movement of Papuan students in Bali will now be closely monitored by the military intelligence and the police,” he said.</p> <p>“We also think the trio’s demands are important, and that the media should put more attention on what they are demanding.”</p> <p>The group called on the Australian government to request that Indonesia release at least 55 political prisoners from Indonesian jails, including Filep Karma, who has been jailed for 15 years in Abepura prison, and open the province to foreign journalists.</p> <p>They told Guardian Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/west-papuans-australian-consulate-bali\">in an exclusive interview on Saturday</a> that they just wanted a chance to lead a normal life, free from fear and intimidation by the Indonesian security forces.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419208689|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|3ee53d6e5a2b424ea95231622375d522989082b0 -->",

People who break these laws could face a $2,200 fine or two years in prison.</p> <p>Currently, NSW drugs laws ban the making of banned substances but new legislation broadens this to items of a psychoactive nature that are yet to be developed.</p> <p>An interim ban on synthetic drugs has been in place since 9 June, with NSW Fair Trading inspecting more than 1,000 retailers to ensure they were removed from sale. Six websites have been prevented from selling various banned substances.</p> <p>The legislation exempts alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, foods and herbal items, as well as complementary medicines.</p> <p>However, concerns have been raised that the broad nature of the new laws will theoretically criminalise a number of plants, such as cacti and acacias, which contain properties that could be made into mind-altering drugs. This includes the golden wattle (<em>Acacia pycnantha</em>), Australia’s floral emblem.</p> <p>State Labor MP Amanda Fazio said in September that the “crazy” legislation could “criminalise the Botanic Gardens Trust” and added: “A (cactus) society would be equated with a cartel of drug dealers because of the stupid way in which this legislation have been drafted.”</p> <p>Dan Malone, lecturer of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash University, told Guardian Australia that items with psychoactive properties can be hard to define.</p> <p>“It is difficult to define because a lot of prescription drugs do the same thing,” he said. “If you increase the dose of a certain medicine, it can have psychoactive effects.</p> <p>“The textbook definition is that it has a mind altering effect, something that affects the central nervous system. That could be a bit of a problem if you have ornamental cacti that have properties that could be used to make Mescaline.”</p> <p>However, Malone added that the new laws would tackle the issue of drugs manufacturers subtly changing the compound of substances to get around the law.</p> <p>“There is an ongoing problem faced by governments on how to keep up with the manufacturing of drugs,” he said.</p> <p>Critics claim the legislation is ambiguous over the status of plants, although the state government insists that “sensible” exemptions have been made to ensure the legality of most items is unchanged.</p> <p>Greg Smith, NSW attorney general, said that the list of prohibited items will be added to as new banned substances are identified.</p> <p>“Manufacturers may try to alter drugs to avoid detection but these new laws mean police have greater certainty in seizing substances where they have formed a reasonable suspicion that it is a drug or psychoactive substance,” he said.</p> <p>“The NSW Government will also ban the advertising and promotion of a substance to be consumed for its psychoactive effects, or information that provides how or where to acquire the substance.</p> <p>“This will stop retailers from being able to sell these products, and if they do they risk going to prison.”</p> <p>Anthony Roberts, NSW fair trading minister, added: &quot;There is no silver bullet to protect people from the scourge of these psychoactive substances, but the NSW government now has groundbreaking laws in place which will continue to make a significant impact.”</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213559|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|4da73b48a2648b04132c943ad9cb3bb8786d97fa -->",

        "body":"<p>Australia will seek to conclude a free trade pact with China in 12 months, but the prime minister is signalling the deal will likely not be comprehensive.</p> <p>Tony Abbott told reporters in Bali he would be &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; if Australia couldn&rsquo;t conclude a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; free trade agreement with China during the next 12 months.</p> <p>Abbott also used the opportunity to send an unequivocally positive message on Chinese investment in Australia, including from state owned enterprises - an issue that has been a vexed one internally within the Coalition because of philosophical resistance by the Nationals to foreign purchases of farmland and agri-businesses, particularly by foreign government interests.</p> <p>The prime minister said Australia wanted Chinese state owned enterprises to invest in Australia if it was in the national interest; and he said Australia needed to be part of the next wave of international investment by China to safeguard Australian economic interests.</p> <p>&ldquo;The (Chinese) president made it clear to me how much foreign investment China hopes to make in coming years and I want Australia to get a fair share of that foreign investment because that foreign investment will be good for jobs, it will be good for economic activity,&rdquo; Abbott said on Monday. &ldquo;It should be good for government revenues and it will certainly be good for prosperity back home in Australia.&rdquo;</p> <p>The China FTA was first launched by John Howard in 2005. Both the Coalition under Howard, and Labor under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, wanted the China FTA to be a comprehensive agreement, including politically sensitive sectors of the economy, which explains in part why the negotiations have dragged out over several years.</p> <p>But Abbott sent a clear signal on Monday that the Coalition was now prepared to emerge with a less comprehensive deal. &ldquo;We want the agreement to be as comprehensive as possible, but I&rsquo;ve always taken the view that you should take what you can get today and pitch for the rest tomorrow when you've got a strong foundation to build upon.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;We will get the best deal we can. I can't at this stage say it is going to include everything. If it doesn't include everything, that will be a disappointment but, still, whatever we can get, which is a substantial advance on where we are, is worth having,&rdquo; Abbott told reporters in Bali on Monday.</p> <p>Abbott confirmed he would visit China in 2014 with a large delegation of business leaders, academics and cultural leaders - and some state premiers.</p> <p>The prime minister&rsquo;s ambition to wrap up an FTA with China within the year completes a gradual positive transformation he has made on the subject of economic engagement with China.</p> <p>In an interview in 2011 Abbott was cool on the China FTA because there was debate &ldquo;to what extent China is a market economy.&rdquo; Abbott professed more comfort in completing a deal with Japan, because Japan was a market economy and a democracy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419227895|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|dcbfcec28e6aea8c9f4791717e072a611431df75 -->",

        "body":"<p>Libya has demanded an explanation for the \"kidnapping\" of one of its citizens by American special forces, hours after a separate US military raid on a terrorist target in Somalia ended in apparent failure and retreat.</p><p>In Tripoli the US army's Delta force seized alleged al-Qaida leader Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known by his alias Abu Anas al-Liby and wanted for the 1998 bombings of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/aug/08/kenya.garyyounge\" title=\"\">US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> that killed more than 220 people.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/world/africa/a-terrorism-suspect-long-known-to-prosecutors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=1&amp;\">New York Times reported</a> that Liby was being held in military custody and interrogated on board a navy ship, the USS Antonio, in the Mediterranean.</p><p>But US navy Seals suffered a major setback when they launched an amphibious assault to capture an Islamist militant leader said to be Ahmed Godane, described as Africa's most wanted man and the architect of last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya-terror\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate shopping</a> mall in Kenya. The elite Seals were beaten back by heavy fire and apparently abandoned equipment that the Somali militants photographed and posted on the internet.</p><p>As dramatic details of Saturday's twin operations emerged, US secretary of state John Kerry insisted that terrorists \"can run but they can't hide\" <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/us-military-bases-africa\" title=\"\">, but faced growing questions about America's military reach in Africa</a> and the consequences of unilateral aggression.</p><p>Speaking in Indonesia on Monday, Kerry said the seizure of Liby complied with US law, the Associated Press reported. He said the suspect was a \"legal and appropriate target\" for the US military and would face justice in court. It was important not to \"sympathise\" with wanted terrorists, Kerry said.</p><p>Liby was captured outside his family home at 6.15am in Noufle'een, a quiet suburb in eastern Tripoli, according to witnesses, but there were conflicting reports over who took him. His brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press that Liby was parking when a convoy of three vehicles encircled his car. Armed gunmen smashed the car's window and seized Liby's gun before grabbing him and taking him away, the report said. The brother said Liby's wife saw the kidnapping from her window and described the abductors as foreign-looking armed \"commandos\".</p><p>But Liby's son Abdullah insisted Libyan forces were involved. Appearing on Tripoli's Nabir TV station, he said: \"The people who took my father were Libyan, not Americans – they spoke with Tripoli accents.</p><p>\"My mother was listening to the voices in the street and could see it all through the window. There were two cars and a bus with blacked-out windows and no number plates.\"</p><p>He said his father was dragged from his car and arrested while it was still moving, and the vehicle, driverless, continued driving empty down the road.</p><p>Liby, who was thought to be a computer specialist for al-Qaida and lived in Manchester in the UK during the 1990s, is believed to be 49 and on the FBI's most-wanted list with a $5m (£3m) bounty on his head. Pentagon spokesman George Little said he is \"currently lawfully detained by the US military in a secure location outside of Libya\".</p><p>Liby was expected eventually to be sent to New York for criminal prosecution, the New York Times reported.</p><p>Libya's government refused to say whether its forces were involved in the arrest and claimed it had not been informed in advance. A statement from the prime minister, Ali Zaidan, said: \"The Libyan government is following the news of the kidnapping of a Libyan citizen who is wanted by US authorities. The Libyan government has contacted US authorities to ask them to provide an explanation.\"</p><p>Thousands of miles away in Somalia, US special forces carried out a raid that was no less audacious but had a very different outcome. It was reportedly planned a week and a half ago in response to the Nairobi attack and came 20 years to the week after an American mission that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/01/black-hawk-down-reel-history\" title=\"\">infamously went awry</a> when Somali fighters shot down two Black Hawk helicopters.</p><p>Members of Seal Team Six – the unit that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan hideout in 2011 – swam ashore from speedboats before members of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab rose for dawn prayers, officials and witnesses said. They stormed a two-storey beachside house in Barawe said to be occupied by foreign members of al-Shabaab and battled their way inside, a fighter who gave his name as Abu Mohamed told AP. There was a heavy gunbattle at about 2.30am on Saturday, according to locals in Barawe, about 60 miles south of the capital Mogadishu. Mohamed Hassan, a schoolteacher, said: \"Nearly an hour before the morning prayer I heard dogs bark and I got up, but within minutes I heard small gun fire towards the direction of the beach. I raised my ears up as the shooting continued and continued. Soon it became like an exchange of fire. Then I heard one big explosion and two other explosions occurred. I could not go outside so I remained in my room to wait what was happening.\"</p><p>Hassan said the shooting he could hear was that of al-Shaabab's fighters because he understood the US forces were using silencer guns so no one could hear their shooting. \"In the morning, we saw people gathering near the house the US forces targeted and there was a lot of blood everywhere. The al-Shabaab fighters told us not to go to the direction of the house. I saw one dead and two others injured but they were not very critical.\"</p><p>No one in Barawe town could have imagined such an attack, he added, and they kept saying only \"white soldiers attacking Barawe town\". Local residents said late on Saturday that al-Shabaab deployed additional fighters in Barawe to keep guard at the beach where the navy Seals landed.</p><p>US officials told AP that the Seals encountered fiercer resistance than expected, so after a 15- to 20-minute firefight, the unit leader decided to abort the mission and they swam away.</p><p>A local resident, Haji Nur, said he saw military equipment which al-Shabaab claimed to have confiscated from the soldiers. \"I saw in the centre of the town a crowd of people gathering and looked at three rounds of M16 ammunition, one US-made hand grenade and one also a bulletproof jacket.\"</p><p>Al-Shabaab, which has a formal alliance with al-Qaida and claimed responsibility for the Nairobi mall killings that killed at least 67 people, posted what it claimed were pictures of the equipment on the web.</p><p>Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Mus'ab, a spokesman for al-Shabaab, said: \"Early on Saturday morning, around 2am, white soldiers attacked a house resided in by some members of the Mujahideen leaders in Somalia. They came from a waiting speedboat from warship and as they were approaching the house, our Mujahideen fighters repulsed them. They ran away. We chased them until they have reached the seaside where they urgently boarded their speedboats.\"</p><p>Mus'ab said one al-Shabaab member had died and claimed that the Seals lost a \"senior officer\". US officials said there were no US casualties in either the Somali or Libyan operation.</p><p>A resident of Barawe who gave his name as Mohamed Bile told the AP that militants closed down the town in the hours after the assault, and that all traffic and movements have been restricted. Militants were carrying out house-to-house searches, likely to find evidence that a spy had given intelligence to a foreign power used to launch the attack, he said.</p><p>A Somali intelligence official was quoted as saying that Godane, the al-Shabaab leader also known Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the target of Saturday's raid. Mohamed Ansari, a former al-Shabaab member now working with Somalia's counter-terrorism unit in Mogadishu, said: \"Godane is the only big fish in Barawe to hunt. Godane as the top leader of al-Shabaab and the only planner of the group's operations is seen as the mastermind of Westgate mall siege in Nairobi.\"</p><p>Unlike his Libyan counterpart, Somali prime minister Abdi Farah Shirdon welcomed the US intervention. \"We have close cooperation with the world, especially the western countries in the fight against al-Shabaab,\" he said in Mogadishu on Sunday. \"We welcome any operation to hunt the terrorist leaders and we are at the forefront. Al-Shabaab is a Somali problem, a regional problem and world problem.\"</p><p>The dual raids were a vivid of expression of how the <a href=\"http://www.africom.mil\" title=\"\">US has quietly been building its military capacity in Africa</a>. Kerry, who is in Indonesia for an economic summit, said: \"We hope that this makes clear that the United States of America will never stop in the effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror. Members of al-Qaida and other terrorist organisations literally can run but they can't hide.\"</p><p>But a diplomatic source focused on Somalia said: \"This is knee-jerk stuff and smacks of a massive failure of intelligence. Are extrajudicial killings and covert kidnapping raids the best way of dealing with the problem? Why is the international response so feeble?\"</p><p>But Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in South Africa, said that while it was in the interest of African governments to fight terrorism, he does not \"think the heavy-handed and unilateral way the US acts is helpful and it risks causing further instability, especially where there are weak governments like in Libya and Somalia\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191176|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|feb163affb6f1473b8985a69a5d0562e11f265cb -->",

        "headline":"Egypt: dozens of protesters killed as rival factions tear Cairo apart",
        "body":"<p>At least 51 people died in clashes across Egypt  as the country's two largest political factions gathered in rival commemorations of Egypt's participation in the 1973 war with Israel, a day of deep significance for many Egyptians.</p><p>Both opponents and supporters of the country's ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, rallied in their thousands – ostensibly to mark the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war which is viewed in Cairo as an Egyptian victory, despite ending in a stalemate that favoured Israel.</p><p>But rather than emphasising Egypt's unity, the different messages conveyed by each faction's demonstrations underscored divides. Morsi's supporters, whose marches filled highways in west Cairo, used the day to protest against his ousting, while his opponents took to Tahrir Square to praise General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's role in his overthrow. Deadly violence flared when tens of thousands of Morsi supporters tried to reach Tahrir Square. Soldiers, police and armed vigilantes blocked their path and started firing.</p><p>Arriving in west Cairo's Dokki suburb around 3pm, the marchers were met first by teargas, then rubber bullets and then live rounds, according to one witness who was at the front of the march.</p><p>\"It was three groups of armed people – police, army, and residents – attacking helpless protesters, who didn't even do much to fight back,\" said Mosa'ab Elshamy, a photographer known for <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosaaberising/sets/72157636261057216/\" title=\"\">his pictures at Cairo clashes</a>. \"Today's march was made up largely of families, lots of women, lots of children. Sometimes marches take things into their own hands, start trouble, break something. But today's march was really remarkably peaceful until the police just shot at them without any kind of trigger.\"</p><p>Some reports suggested that a number of marchers carried firearms, but Elshamy said the protesters, who included hardcore football fans unaffiliated with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, simply held their ground for three hours – throwing stones and burning tires – before retreating.</p><p>He added: \"As a couple of people were running away, they were gunned down, and they left quite a trail of blood.\"</p><p>Opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood argued the Islamists and others had sought a violent response in order to garner sympathy internationally, or to gain concessions during negotiations.</p><p>\"They are trying to make trouble everywhere so that at some point, the deal will be: fine, stop the trouble, what do you want?\" Alaa al-Aswany, one of Egypt's best-known authors and a fierce critic of the Brotherhood, argued in the buildup to the celebrations.</p><p>As the day wore on, Cairo became a tale of two Tahrirs – Tahrir Square in the east, where army helicopters flew over pro-military bands, and Tahrir Street in the west, where police and secular locals fired bullets and teargas on the pro-Morsi marches.</p><p>The juxtaposition highlighted Egypt's ideological divisions. \"Today feels like a second victory,\" said Mohamed Abdel Aziz, a cleaner wearing a picture of Sisi around his neck. \"We feel like we have won our country back from a gang that doesn't belong to Egypt.\"</p><p>Across town, protesters carrying yellow placards – in memory of those who died at several <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">summer massacres</a>  of Morsi supporters – had a different idea about what the day meant. \"Today is about saying no to the military coup, and bringing back liberty,\" said Saber Nafi, a pro-Morsi journalist.</p><p>What had been a festive afternoon quickly soured, with gangs of vigilantes and plain-clothed policemen in some streets attacking people suspected of being a foreigner, a journalist or a Muslim Brother.</p><p>Two liberal politicians – including <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/stabbed-egyptian-politician-decries-violence-215810533.html\" title=\"\">Khaled Dawoud</a>, a one-time spokesman for Egypt's main secular coalition – were attacked by Brotherhood supporters this weekend. Dawoud was spotted while driving through central Cairo, hauled from his car, and stabbed in his hand and twice in his chest. He is now recovering in hospital.</p><p>Clashes were reported in several other neighbourhoods in Cairo and across Egypt, though much of the country remained calm. Some Egyptians expressed frustration at their fellow citizens' overbearing nationalism, and at being pulled between what they feel to be two sides of the same authoritarian coin: the army and the Brotherhood.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194423|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|93ebe415f96a3b41544487ec79d85fa9c1d23309 -->",

We couldn't have asked for a better welcome. One Perth operator who purchased a fleet of the 50 bright white used TX4s has already had a stampede of drivers who want to be the first ones to buy a cab and partake in the trial.</p> <p>\"We've had a lot of positive interest from expats, both prospective customers and drivers. What has been especially gratifying are the offers from expat London taxi drivers who not only want to buy one, but have also offered their services to train our Australian drivers on everything from the service to vehicle operation.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419200993|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|171dc330a282241193b516ff47daca9b9f3d1dc1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The chief executive of Qantas, Alan Joyce, says he is comfortable that new Boeing 787 Dreamliners being delivered to budget carrier Jetstar are extremely safe despite some reliability issues.</p> <p>The first of the high-tech jets for Jetstar's international routes are due to be delivered to Melbourne on Wednesday, only weeks after budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle demanded Boeing take back a plane and fix a faulty hydraulic pump after only 30 days in service.</p> <p>Visiting Boeing's factory in Seattle, Joyce said: \"It's important to distinguish reliability from safety. Sometimes in people's minds they can be really concerned.</p> <p>\"Reliability in new aircraft takes a while to get up there. It's not a safety issue.</p> <p>\"We're very comfortable this is an extremely safe aircraft.\"</p> <p>The Boeing 787 vice-president and general manager, Larry Loftis, said the ambition to build the most technologically advanced aircraft in five decades had been a logistical challenge since production began in 2007.</p> <p>\"From a reliability standpoint ... we're working to make sure the airplane continually improves and becomes more and more reliable,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We put a lot of new technology in this aircraft and over-estimated the ability to bring this new technology to market in the timeframe to which we committed.\"</p> <p>The Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than comparable wide-bodied aircraft with about 300 seats. It uses carbon fibre composite graphite instead of traditional aluminium.</p> <p>But 50 Dreamliner jets were grounded in January when lithium ion batteries caught fire on two Japanese airlines.</p> <p>They returned to the skies in April but an emergency transmitter on a Boeing 787 caught fire at London's Heathrow airport in July on an Ethiopian Airlines plane.</p> <p>Qantas has ordered 14 Boeing 787s for Jetstar, which are being delivered until late 2015.</p> <p>The Dreamliner deliveries will enable Qantas to take 11 Airbus A330s from Jetstar as part of a plan to retire older, fuel-burning Boeing 767s.</p> <p>Joyce said the lighter Dreamliners would reduce fuel costs in the Qantas group, and help enable the airline to have an even younger fleet than Singapore Airlines \"in the next couple of years, which we haven't seen in a long time\".</p> <p>Jetstar expects to begin commercial flights abroad in November, with limited domestic flights for test purposes, following testing by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419204928|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|4f4b894b9af53f7df5207f31d7e8e7f834a83039 -->",

        "body":"<p>International inspectors have begun destroying Syria's chemical weapons and the machinery used to create them, the United Nations has said.</p><p>A UN official said he could not confirm specifically what was being destroyed, but the hardware that would be put out of order by the end of the weekend included weapons and other equipment.</p><p>The team has a tight deadline of nine months to destroy the weapons arsenal, believed to include about 1,000 tonnes of toxic agents.</p><p>\"Today is the first day of the phase of destruction and disabling. Verification will also continue,\" said the UN official, who works alongside the inspectors.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, he added: \"The plan was that two types … of materials would be destroyed: one is equipment for making [weapons], filling and mixing equipment, some of it mobile and some of it static. The other is actual munitions.\"</p><p>The destruction programme was prompted by a chemical weapons attack in August that killed hundreds of civilians on the outskirts of Damascus and brought a rare consensus at the UN.</p><p>Under a security council resolution in September, the first stage is to destroy Syria's capability to produce chemical weapons by 1 November.</p><p>A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was allowed into the country this month. They followed weapons inspectors who arrived in Syria after a deal was struck following the killing of hundreds of civilians near Damascus.</p><p>There were threats of military action to force the Assad regime to give up its stockpile, with the United States and France in the lead. But there was heavy opposition from Russia, and a Commons defeat forced David Cameron to concede that Britain would not be involved in any military strike.</p><p>Barack Obama avoided the possible ignominy of losing a vote himself when he put his plan for a military strike on hold after Syria's admission that it had chemical weapons.</p><p>UN inspectors are now expected to dismantle and ultimately destroy Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.</p><p>Videos of the dead and dying emerged online soon after sarin weapons were fired into civilian areas near the Syrian capital, prompting global condemnation. The Assad regime and the rebels blame each other.</p><p>Last month Obama said: \"It is too early to tell whether [the Russian plan] will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments. But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad's strongest allies.\"</p><p>In an interview in a state-run newspaper on Sunday, Assad said the Syrian regime had begun producing chemical weapons in the 1980s to \"fill the technical gap in the traditional weapons between Syria and Israel\". He said production of chemical weapons was halted in the late 1990s, but provided no further information.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419177949|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|6852e6abeb3ad34c29d93388d6c94a522136c9c8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Arthur Phillip put his finger on it when he rounded South Head a couple of hundred years ago: the harbour is immense.</p> <p>&ldquo;Here a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most&nbsp;perfect security,&rdquo; he reported back to London.</p> <p>Fitting most of the Australian navy and a dozen visiting warships proved no trouble at all. On television it looked packed. Out on the water the harbour was curiously uncrowded even though every gin palace in Sydney had slipped its moorings to be there for the show.</p> <p>People spilled over the side of the Opera House. Every headland was jammed with celebrating Australians. But the gardens of Admiralty House and Kirribilli House, the residences of the governor-general and prime minister, were entirely deserted.</p> <p>At the very least, this was a loss to revenue.</p> <p>Our German crew took rather seriously orders to drop anchor well clear of the proceedings. All over the harbour people were discovering what we discovered: things happened a long way off. The 100-gun salute at Garden Island was one silent puff of smoke.</p> <p>The nearby warships of India, Thailand, China and Japan, each its own shade of grey, were orderly. No sailors scrambled up masts. Their helicopters stayed firmly on deck. Once or twice we heard orders barked in Mandarin.</p> <p>On the pleasure craft around us the formalities were not being observed. Champagne began to take its toll. Young people stripped off and went over the side. One reveller who declined to give his name told Guardian Australia the experience was &ldquo;refreshing&rdquo;.</p> <p>For a long time, more was happening in the air than the water. Twenty-five helicopters in close formation flying at a crawl up the harbour made a magnificent and sinister sight, Apocalypse Now without the slaughter.</p> <p>At last a line of Australian ships came around Bradleys Head. The review was under way. Ship followed ship until it seemed every vessel the navy had was on the water. What was left to keep open the Straits of Hormuz, to scoop up refugees, to rescue British sailors?</p> <p>Enthusiasts with iPhones on our boat identified each vessel as it passed. But where was HMAS Leeuwin with the governor-general, Quentin Bryce, and Prince Harry on board? At last it hove into view, a party boat with a white marquee pitched on its deck.</p> <p>And there she was: a dot of aqua that could be seen from one end of the harbour to the other. Beside her was a kid from London in a white suit. Above them flew a royal standard. It made you proud to be Australian.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419162543|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|a0915746ce2dcb17d8603d13fbca1696ba4c917f -->",

        "body":"<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyhau, has said there will never be peace with the Palestinians until they recognise Israel as a Jewish state, and has dismissed Israel's military occupation of Palestinian land and the growth of Israeli settlements as the root cause of the conflict.</p><p>In an uncompromising speech, Netanyahu insisted  the Palestinians must abandon their core demand of the right of refugees to return to their places of origin. \"Unless the Palestinians recognise the Jewish state and give up on the right of return there will not be peace,\" the prime minister said in an address at Bar-Ilan University on Sunday.</p><p>But, he added, even such recognition by the Palestinian leadership would be insufficient. \"After generations of incitement we have no confidence that such recognition will percolate down to the Palestinian people. That is why we need extremely strong security arrangements and to go forward, but not blindly,\" he said.</p><p>The tone of Netanyahu's speech will dismay those on both sides and in the international community who believe that renewed peace talks, brokered by the US, represent possibly the last chance for a deal to create a Palestinian state and  end  the decades-old conflict.</p><p>It will fuel suspicion that, despite his professed readiness to engage in peace talks, Netanyahu is unwilling to make an historic agreement involving Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, dismantling settlements and sharing Jerusalem as the capital of both states.</p><p>The prime minister's speech was delivered at the same venue where Netanyahu first acknowledged the need for a two-state solution to the conflict in 2009. That address was hailed by many commentators as a significant breakthrough by the Israeli leader, and was vehemently attacked by rightwingers as a dangerous concession.</p><p>In Sunday's speech, Netanyahu dismissed Israel's 46-year-long occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza as the root cause of the conflict, saying it was based in Arab rejection of Jewish immigration to what was Palestine.</p><p>\"When anyone is asked what is the source of the conflict, the standard answer is the occupation, the territories, the settlements. They say that the Israeli takeover of Judea and Samaria [the biblical term for the West Bank] following the [1967] Six-Day war to a large extent created the conflict, and I ask whether that is true,\" he said.</p><p>\"The conflict, if I have to choose a date when it began in earnest, began in the year 1921, on the day Palestinian Arabs attacked the immigrants' house in Jaffa. This attack, of course, had nothing to do with the territories or settlements. It was against the immigration of Jews to the Land of Israel.</p><p>\"Then came the partition plan in 1947, with the suggestion of an Arab state alongside a Jewish state. The Jews agreed, the Arabs refused. Because the issue was not then the question of a Palestinian state – the issue was and remains the Jewish state. Then 19 years later came the stranglehold around us aimed at uprooting us. And why? After all, then there was no occupation.\"</p><p>The Palestinians say that their goal in peace talks is an end to the Israeli military occupation and the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. They say they have long recognised the state of Israel, but formal recognition of it as a Jewish state would be to deny the existence and rights of the 20% of Israel's population that is Palestinian and to effectively abandon the right of return.</p><p>Peace talks resumed in July and are scheduled to last until next spring but are said to be progressing slowly. The US secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.549061\" title=\"\">John Kerry, said last month</a> that  talks would intensify and \"American participation should be increased somewhat in order to try to help facilitate [progress]\".  His comments strongly suggested that the two sides were making little headway.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419222374|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|41f27e0443faec1959be25a1b96ec268eda59f0f -->",

The average donation was $50.</p> <p>\"Australians have demanded to know what is happening to the planet,\" she said.</p> <p>The money would go to employing researchers, developing reports and increasing public awareness about climate change science, she said.</p> <p>Former commissioners including the climate scientists Will Steffen and Lesley Hughes and the former BP Australasia president Gerry Hueston have agreed to volunteer their time to the revamped body.</p> <p>The council has been hard at work releasing a \"lay-person's guide&rdquo; to the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419125882|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|64e1e1b8e3f02838fc356d6397a56e1d25da8acd -->",

        "headline":"NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users",
        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency has made repeated attempts to develop attacks against people using Tor, a popular tool designed to protect online anonymity, despite the fact the software is primarily funded and promoted by the US government itself.</p><p>Top-secret NSA documents, disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, reveal that the agency's current successes against Tor rely on identifying users and then attacking vulnerable software on their computers. One technique developed by the agency targeted the Firefox web browser used with Tor, giving the agency full control over targets' computers, including access to files, all keystrokes and all online activity.</p><p>But the documents suggest that the fundamental security of the Tor service remains intact. One top-secret presentation, titled 'Tor Stinks', states: \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time.\" It continues: \"With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users,\" and says the agency has had \"no success de-anonymizing a user in response\" to a specific request.</p><p>Another top-secret presentation calls Tor \"the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity\".</p><p>Tor – which stands for The Onion Router – is an open-source public project that bounces its users' internet traffic through several other computers, which it calls \"relays\" or \"nodes\", to keep it anonymous and avoid online censorship tools.</p><p>It is relied upon by journalists, activists and campaigners in the US and Europe as well as in China, Iran and Syria, to maintain the privacy of their communications and avoid reprisals from government. To this end, it receives around 60% of its funding from the US government, primarily the State Department and the Department of Defense – which houses the NSA.</p><p>Despite Tor's importance to dissidents and human rights organizations, however, the NSA and its UK counterpart GCHQ have devoted considerable efforts to attacking the service, which law enforcement agencies say is also used by people engaged in terrorism, the trade of child abuse images, and online drug dealing.</p><p>Privacy and human rights groups have been concerned about the security of Tor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security\">following revelations in the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica</a> about widespread NSA efforts to undermine privacy and security software. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/09/shifting_shadow_stormbrew_flying_pig_new_snowden_documents_show_nsa_deemed.html\">A report by Brazilian newspaper Globo</a> also contained hints that the agencies had capabilities against the network.</p><p>While it seems that the NSA has not compromised the core security of the Tor software or network, the documents detail proof-of-concept attacks, including several relying on the large-scale online surveillance systems maintained by the NSA and GCHQ through internet cable taps.</p><p>One such technique is based on trying to spot patterns in the signals entering and leaving the Tor network, to try to de-anonymise its users. The effort was based on a long-discussed theoretical weakness of the network: that if one agency controlled a large number of the \"exits\" from the Tor network, they could identify a large amount of the traffic passing through it.</p><p>The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated in the documents would rely on the NSA's cable-tapping operation, and the agency secretly operating computers, or 'nodes', in the Tor system. However, one presentation stated that the success of this technique was \"negligible\" because the NSA has \"access to very few nodes\" and that it is \"difficult to combine meaningfully with passive Sigint\".</p><p>While the documents confirm the NSA does indeed operate and collect traffic from some nodes in the Tor network, they contain no detail as to how many, and there are no indications that the proposed de-anonymization technique was ever implemented.  </p><p>Other efforts mounted by the agencies include attempting to direct traffic toward NSA-operated servers, or attacking other software used by Tor users. One presentation, titled 'Tor: Overview of Existing Techniques', also refers to making efforts to \"shape\", or influence, the future development of Tor, in conjunction with GCHQ.</p><p>Another effort involves measuring the timings of messages going in and out of the network to try to identify users. A third attempts to degrade or disrupt the Tor service, forcing users to abandon the anonymity protection.</p><p>Such efforts to target or undermine Tor are likely to raise legal and policy concerns for the intelligence agencies.</p><p>Foremost among those concerns is whether the NSA has acted, deliberately or inadvertently, against internet users in the US when attacking Tor. One of the functions of the anonymity service is to hide the country of all of its users, meaning any attack could be hitting members of Tor's substantial US user base.</p><p>Several attacks result in implanting malicious code on the computer of Tor users who visit particular websites. The agencies say they are targeting terrorists or organized criminals visiting particular discussion boards, but these attacks could also hit journalists, researchers, or those who accidentally stumble upon a targeted site.</p><p>The efforts could also raise concerns in the State Department and other US government agencies that provide funding to increase Tor's security – as part of the Obama administration's internet freedom agenda to help citizens of repressive regimes – circumvent online restrictions.</p><p><a href=\"http://tech.state.gov/m/blogpost?id=6282015%3ABlogPost%3A40819\">Material published online</a> for a discussion event held by the State Department, for example, described the importance of tools such as Tor.</p><p>\"[T]he technologies of internet repression, monitoring and control continue to advance and spread as the tools that oppressive governments use to restrict internet access and to track citizen online activities grow more sophisticated. Sophisticated, secure, and scalable technologies are needed to continue to advance internet freedom.\"</p><p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors, a federal agency whose mission is to \"inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy\" through networks such as Voice of America, also supported Tor's development until October 2012 to ensure that people in countries such as Iran and China could access BBG content. Tor continues to receive federal funds through Radio Free Asia, which is funded by a federal grant from BBG.</p><p>The governments of both these countries have attempted to curtail Tor's use: China has tried on multiple occasions to block Tor entirely, while one of the motives behind Iranian efforts to create a \"national internet\" entirely under government control was to prevent circumvention of those controls.</p><p>The NSA's own documents acknowledge the service's wide use in countries where the internet is routinely surveilled or censored. One presentation notes that among uses of Tor for \"general privacy\" and \"non-attribution\", it can be used for \"circumvention of nation state internet policies\" – and is used by \"dissidents\" in \"Iran, China, etc\".</p><p>Yet GCHQ documents show a disparaging attitude towards Tor users. One presentation acknowledges Tor was \"created by the US government\" and is \"now maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)\", a US freedom of expression group. In reality, Tor is maintained by an independent foundation, though has in the past received funding from the EFF.</p><p>The presentation continues by noting that \"EFF will tell you there are many pseudo-legitimate uses for Tor\", but says \"we're interested as bad people use Tor\". Another presentation remarks: \"Very naughty people use Tor\".</p><p>The technique developed by the NSA to attack Tor users through vulnerable software on their computers has the codename EgotisticalGiraffe, the documents show. It involves exploiting the Tor browser bundle, a collection of programs, designed to make it easy for people to install and use the software. Among these is a version of the Firefox web browser.</p><p>The trick, detailed in a top-secret presentation titled 'Peeling back the layers of Tor with EgotisticalGiraffe', identified website visitors who were using the protective software and only executed its attack – which took advantage of vulnerabilities in an older version of Firefox – against those people. Under this approach, the NSA does not attack the Tor system directly. Rather, targets are identified as Tor users and then the NSA attacks their browsers.</p><p>According to the documents provided by Snowden, the particular vulnerabilities used in this type of attack were inadvertently fixed by Mozilla Corporation in Firefox 17, released in November 2012 – a fix the NSA had not circumvented by January 2013 when the documents were written.</p><p>The older exploits would, however, still be usable against many Tor users who had not kept their software up to date.</p><p>A similar but less complex exploit against the Tor network was <a href=\"http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/08/firefox-zero-day-used-to-reveal-identities-does-the-end-justify-the-means/\">revealed by security researchers in July this year</a>. Details of the exploit, including its purpose and which servers it passed on victims' details to, led to speculation it had been built by the FBI or another US agency.</p><p>At the time, the FBI refused to comment on whether it was behind the attack, but subsequently <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/\">admitted in a hearing in an Irish court</a> that it had operated the malware to target an alleged host of images of child abuse – though the attack did also hit numerous unconnected services on the Tor network.</p><p>Roger Dingledine, the president of the Tor project, said the NSA's efforts serve as a reminder that using Tor on its own is not sufficient to guarantee anonymity against intelligence agencies – but showed it was also a great aid in combating mass surveillance.</p><p>\"The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there's no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network,\" Dingledine said. \"Infecting the laptop, phone, or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard.</p><p>\"Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody's going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on.\"</p><p>But he added: \"Just using Tor isn't enough to keep you safe in all cases. Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.\"</p><p>The Guardian asked the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the US government, how it ensured that its attacks did not interfere with the secure browsing of law-abiding US users such as activists and journalists, and whether the agency was involved in the decision to fund Tor or efforts to \"shape\" its development. </p><p>The agency did not directly address those questions, instead providing a statement.</p><p>It read: \"In carrying out its signals intelligence mission, NSA collects only those communications that it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes, regardless of the technical means used by those targets or the means by which they may attempt to conceal their communications. NSA has unmatched technical capabilities to accomplish its lawful mission.<br /> <br />\"As such, it should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract targets' use of technologies to hide their communications. Throughout history, nations have used various methods to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others use technology to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 4 October after the Broadcasting Board of Governors pointed out that its support of Tor ended in October 2012.</p><p>• <em>Bruce Schneier is an unpaid member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's board of directors.

Rescuers have pulled out 155 people alive and about 200 are still reported to be missing.</p><p>The 20-metre fishing boat sank after capsizing when a fire was started on board to attract attention.</p><p>The authorities said bad weather had hampered the rescue effort, with choppy seas preventing divers from reaching the wreck, which is now resting on the sea bed.</p><p>Earlier in the day, people on a fishing boat threw a bouquet of yellow flowers into the sea at the site of the sinking.</p><p>Planes and helicopters were used by the coast guard to try spot bodies in the water.

        "headline":"Republicans defiant over US shutdown compromise amid Treasury warning",
        "body":"<p>The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, on Sunday accused Congress of \"playing with fire\" as the White House and Republicans remained entrenched over the government shutdown and the extension of the debt ceiling.</p><p>Appearing on CNN's State of the Union during a tour of the Sunday talk shows, Lew said there was no option that would prevent the government from defaulting on its bills <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/republicans-debt-limit-treasury-economy\">should lawmakers refuse to vote to raise the debt ceiling before the 17 October deadline</a>. Senior Republicans, however, lined up to insist in response that they would not compromise in their attempt to dismantle or defund Obamacare, the president's signature healthcare reform.</p><p>\"There is no option that prevents us from being in default if we don't have enough cash to pay our bills,\" Lew said. Asked if President Barack Obama could bypass Congress and use other measures to raise the debt ceiling and avoid defaulting, Lew said the only available solution was through Congress.</p><p>\"The White House has spoken quite clearly to this,\" Lew said. \"The president does not have the authority to take action in that kind of a way. The president consulted with his lawyers, and that's the conclusion that he's reached.\"</p><p>The government will reach its borrowing limit on 17 October, Lew said. \"I'm telling you that on the 17th, we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire.\"</p><p>Lew repeatedly said that \"50 to 100\" members of Congress\" stood in the way of a resolution to the crisis which has now shut down the federal government for five days. Such politicians, he said, referring to right-wing Republicans, had \"changed the rules of the game\".</p><p>Lew was scheduled to appear on five Sunday news shows as the Obama administration sought to force Congress to take action. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/ted-cruz-texas-maverick\">Texas senator Ted Cruz</a>, one of the most outspoken voices against Obamacare, was among the Republicans who appeared to answer him. Cruz told CNN that Republicans should seek three things in exchange for passing a debt ceiling deal.</p><p>\"We should look for some significant structural plan to reduce government spending,\" he said. \"Number two, we should avoid new taxes. And number three we should look for ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/americans-blame-republicans-government-shutdown\">Recent polls have shown that more people blame Republicans than blame Obama for the shutdown</a>. In a signal of the toxicity of the shutdown as a political issue, the Republican candidate for the governorship of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/cuccinelli-shuns-cruz-limelight-97888.html?hp=t1\"> reportedly went to great lengths to avoid being seen with Cruz</a> when they both spoke at a gala in Richmond, Virginia, on Saturday night. </p><p>Cruz praised Cuccinelli as \"principled and fearless\" during his speech at Richmond convention centre. Cuccinelli did not mention Cruz during his remarks and avoided being photographed with the Tea Party favourite.</p><p>Asked by CNN's Candy Crowley if he thought he had \"damaged the Republican party brand\" – in light of reports of division over Cruz's actions, which have included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-speech-fault-lines-republicans\">a 21-hour Senate speech in a fruitless attempt to stop the passage of a budget bill without any provisions to defund Obamacare</a>, Cruz said: \"Not remotely.\"</p><p>The House speaker, John Boehner, has been criticised by some as being held hostage by a relatively small group of Tea Party-backed Republican members of Congress. Some have speculated that there are enough votes in Congress between Democrats and moderate Republicans to pass a \"clean bill\" – one without stipulations on dismantling Obamacare – <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/john-boehner-continuing-resolution_n_4053175.html\">if Boehner would bring it to the floor</a>. Lew repeated this idea on CNN and on NBC's Meet the Press.</p><p>On Sunday, however, Boehner attempted to shift the blame, insisting there were not enough votes in the House. Speaking on ABC's This Week, he said: \"There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR.\" Boehner added that the House would not pass a bill raising the debt ceiling without a provision related to Obamacare.</p><p>\"We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],\" Boehner said. \"The votes are not in the House … We are not going down that path.\"</p><p>The Kentucky senator Rand Paul, appearing on Meet the Press, completed the Republicans' united front. \"We've been putting out clean CRs all week,\" he said, referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/republicans-piecemeal-budget-votes-democrats\">the piecemeal legislation House Republicans have put forward to fund individual strands of government</a>, which on Saturday included a bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/05/house-representatives-pass-bill-reimburse-furlough-workers\">to assure furloughed federal employees of the reimbursement of lost pay</a>.</p><p>Paul said no one was \"winning\" from the shutdown and said House members had been \"wanting to fund government\" – apart from Obamacare. Asked why Republicans in the Congress had shut down the government over a bill that had passed both Houses, been signed into law by the president and then been upheld by the supreme court, Paul said it was \"Congress's job to oversee spending\".</p><p>\"It's not their obligation once something is law to never change it,\" he said. \"It's a silly argument for Democrats to say: 'Oh the law's been passed, we can never change it.'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187550|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|ab7b11f5171eef6508d4fca4792528cb121304aa -->",

        "body":"<p>Anti-coal seam gas campaigners are gearing up to launch legal action over the decision by the federal government to approve an exploration project in the Pilliga forest in New South Wales.<br /> <br />The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has decided that the Santos-led development does not require full assessment under the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.<br /> <br />Hunt has, however, added several conditions for the coal seam gas pilot project, requiring that construction cease during breeding season if the threatened Pilliga mouse, regent honeyeater or koala are found in pre-clearance surveys.<br /> <br /><a href=\"http://www.santos.com \">Santos</a> will have to monitor groundwater, but it will be allowed to fell 400 hollow-bearing trees and remove up to 235 orchids.<br /> <br />The project, which will involve the drilling of 36 pilot production wells in the state forest, has enraged environmentalists and community groups.<br /> <br />More than 3,800 submissions over the development were sent to the government, most in opposition to Santos's plans. Opponents claim Hunt should assess the project under the \"water trigger\" legislation that requires all development that may impact the water table be scrutinised by the federal government.<br /> <br />There are also concerns the project will harm threatened species, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/12/coal-seam-gas-project-environment \">recently discovered stygofauna</a> – ancient water-cleansing micro-organisms that dwell beneath the ground. <br /> <br />Carmel Flint, co-ordinator of anti-CSG group <a href=\"http://www.lockthegate.org.au\">Lock the Gate Alliance</a>, told Guardian Australia that community activists would ramp up protests in the wake of Hunt's decision.<br /> <br />\"This decision will raise alarm bells throughout the country among communities who want to have a say over coal and unconventional gas mining,\" she said. \"This was a big test for the new federal environment minister and it's a huge worry that he's decided to go ahead with it without further assessment.<br /> <br />\"I think you'll see much greater community activism and response to this. A lot of people will be looking at this closely and getting legal advice. A number of community groups will be looking at legal action over it.<br /> <br />\"There are genuine legal questions as to how [Hunt] reached this conclusion. He's approved the destruction of threatened species without any assessment, which is contrary to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.<br /> <br />\"Given the rhetoric from the likes of [energy minister] Ian Macfarlane recently, it isn't hugely surprising. But I think the government will find there is a deep and broad opposition to the free-for-all mining they are proposing.\"<br /> <br />One of the submissions to the government, from a hydrologist, Andrea Broughton, questioned the groundwater modelling done by Santos before the project starting.<br /> <br />\"I would've liked to have seen a proper environmental assessment done,\" she told Guardian Australia. \"The model is based on a serious lack of data. The groundwater monitoring isn't in place to know whether the water table will be impacted.<br /> <br />\"Santos says there will be a 0.5m drawdown in the water level over the next 500 years. I find that very hard to believe.\"<br /> <br />Santos said it welcomed the government's decision and insisted that its decision to refer the project for approval shows its commitment to transparency.<br /> <br />\"Although our own independent assessment indicated the exploration program would not activate the 'water trigger', we wanted to be completely transparent with regard to our initial exploration and appraisal program,\" said Sam Crafter, a company spokesman.</p><p>\"We believed the referral was the sensible way to ensure the predicted impacts on water resources had been thoroughly assessed by all the relevant bodies.\"</p><p>Crafter added that all of the assessment work done so far, along with the government's decision, demonstrates the project won't have a major environmental impact.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419025569|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|2ebd74a6c2a1d2b2e3e08bee1928705a8f1b781e -->",

        "body":"<p>Nearly eight in ten teenagers in Britain think the government should introduce standardised cigarette packaging such as that used in Australia according to a survey published as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/29/peers-revive-law-plain-cigarette-packs\" title=\"\">peers prepare cross-party moves to revive proposals shelved by David Cameron.</a></p><p>Most teenagers in Australia, where packs are already almost covered in graphic warnings, believe this makes people less likely to smoke and want to see such measures taken in the rest of the world, said the <a href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/#&amp;panel1-1\" title=\"\">British Heart Foundation (BHF)</a>.</p><p>The charity claimed health warnings on UK packs were \"not up to the job\" as it published results from its poll of 2000 13-18-year-olds in the UK and 500 in Australia, which last year became the first country to introduce tobacco packaging in a uniform brown colour along with the brand name and health warnings.</p><p>The coalition decided to put such measures on ice in Britain in July, saying ministers needed time to assess the impact such measures had had in Australia.</p><p>The BHF survey said just 36% of UK teenagers were deterred by current packs compared to 48% in Australia and that 77% of those quizzed in Britain thought the UK should have standardised packs. Australian teenagers supported the new packaging in their country (59%) and 66% wanted other countries to follow suit.</p><p>The charity said that \"worryingly\", 10% of British teenagers thought some cigarette brands were healthier than others - double the percentage of their Australian counterparts.</p><p>Simon Gillespie, its chief executive, said: \"The message from our young people is loud and clear: current health warnings aren't up to the job and the UK government must step up to the mark and introduce standardised packs.</p><p>\"Smoking kills 100,000 people in the UK every year and we simply can't wait any longer for legislation. Australia has led the way on standardised packs, the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/Services/Smoking\" title=\"\">Scottish government has committed</a>, and now the rest of the UK must act to protect future generations from a deadly habit.\"</p><p>Lib Dem Baroness Tyler, Conservative Lord McColl, crossbencher Baroness Finlay and Labour's Lord Faulkner will try to <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2013-2014/0032/amend/am032-d.htm\" title=\"\">amend the Children and Families Bill</a> at its Lords committee stage, which begins on Wednesday, so as to force the coalition into action. Finlay and Faulkner will also try to make it illegal for drivers to allow smoking in a private car when children are present.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419190794|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|3a63a3449bab8cbcdb7297c0c180245d5ae15c19 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nasa is facing an extraordinary backlash from US researchers after it emerged that the space agency has banned Chinese scientists, including those working at US institutions, from a conference on grounds of national security.</p><p>Nasa officials rejected applications from Chinese nationals who hoped to attend the meeting at the agency's Ames research centre in California next month citing a law, passed in March, which prohibits anyone from China setting foot in a Nasa building.</p><p>The law is part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by congressman Frank Wolf, chair of the House appropriations committee, which has jurisdiction over Nasa. It aims to restrict the foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, ostensibly to counter espionage.</p><p>But the ban has angered many US scientists who say Chinese students and researchers in their labs are being discriminated against. A growing number of US scientists have now decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior academics withdrawing individually, or pulling out their entire research groups.</p><p>The conference is being held for US and international teams who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme, which has been searching the cosmos for signs of planets beyond our solar system. The meeting is the most important event in the academic calendar for scientists who specialise in the field.</p><p>Alan Boss, co-organiser of the Kepler conference, refused to discuss the issue, but said: \"This is not science, it's politics unfortunately.\"</p><p>Geoff Marcy, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been tipped to win a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on exoplanets, or planets outside the solar system, called the ban \"completely shameful and unethical\".</p><p>In an email sent to the conference organisers, Marcy said: \"In good conscience, I cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away, with no national security implications,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"It is completely unethical for the United States of America to exclude certain countries from pure science research,\" Marcy told the Guardian. \"It's an ethical breach that is unacceptable. You have to draw the line.\"</p><p>Debra Fischer, professor of astronomy at Yale University, said she became aware of the ban only when a Chinese post-doctoral student in her lab, Ji Wang, was rejected from the conference. When Nasa confirmed that Ji was banned because of his nationality, Fischer decided to pull out of the meeting. She told her students: \"I cannot say don't go, but I'm boycotting the meeting.\" Her team followed suit and has withdrawn from the meeting.</p><p>The law allows Nasa to apply for a waiver against the ban in special circumstances, but any appeal would have been rejected under a moratorium that has been introduced by the agency's administrator, Charles Bolden.</p><p>Chinese applicants were told they could not attend the conference in an email sent by Mark Messersmith, a Kepler project specialist at Nasa Ames. \"Unfortunately  … federal legislation passed last March forbids us from hosting any citizens of the People's Republic of China at a conference held at facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Regarding those who are already working at other institutions in the US, due to security issues resulting from recent Congressional actions, they are under the same constraints,\" according to the email, seen by the Guardian.</p><p>The recent Congressional action refers to a broader law passed in July which prohibits Nasa funds from being used to participate or collaborate with China in any way. The law has raised fears among some Nasa-funded scientists that they will have to sever ties with their Chinese collaborators, and no longer take on Chinese students.</p><p>Marcy said the law would damage relationships built up between US and Chinese researchers that could be valuable lines of communication if conflicts arose between the two nations in the future.</p><p>Sir Martin Rees, Britain's astronomer royal, said he \"fully supported\" Marcy's position and called the ban \"a deplorable 'own goal' by the US\".</p><p>Chris Lintott, an astronomer at Oxford University, called for a total boycott of the conference until the situation had been resolved. \"I'm shocked and upset by the way this policy has been applied. Science is supposed to be open to all and restricting those who can attend by nationality goes against years of practice, going right back to cold war conferences of Russian and western physicists,\" he said.  \"The Kepler team should move their conference somewhere else – and I hope everyone boycotts until they do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419121755|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|2b14c557007126670be7f0d8285a9f58e4ce84ab -->",

        "body":"<p>Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, has been told by doctors to take a month off because of a subdural haematoma on her brain, her spokesman said on Saturday, forcing her to abandon campaigning for congressional elections this month.</p> <p>Fernandez, 60, was admitted on Saturday to a Buenos Aires hospital. The president suffered trauma to the brain in August, her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, said. He did not elaborate.</p> <p>Vice-president Amado Boudou cut short a journey to France to return to Argentina and take over the president's duties.</p> <p>Fernandez is in an electoral campaign for elections at the end of October that will determine control of Congress.</p> <p>A subdural haematoma is an accumulation of blood under a membrane that covers the brain and usually occurs after a blow to the head.</p> <p>The decision to discharge the president when the damage occurred suggests the haematoma is too small to be drained via surgery, said a doctor not involved in the treatment.</p> <p>Fernandez, who has been president since 2007, had her thyroid glands removed last year after she was diagnosed with cancer, although later tests indicated no cancer was present.</p> <p>Her husband, former president Nestor Kirchner, died after a heart attack in 2010. The next presidential election is due in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419165828|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|f854dae9273d42b1effd77570d8469657ab30c8a -->",

        "body":"<p>If you're travelling any part of the 3000km stretch between Darwin and Adelaide in the next few days, don't be alarmed if you see what appears to be alien reconnaissance craft cruising the roads.</p><p>An array of futuristic vehicles with the sunlight dancing upon their saucer-like tops are taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org\">Bridgestone World Solar Challenge</a>, a marathon north-south trek across the red heart of Australia undertaken by 40 teams.</p><p>As the name suggests, all of the cars involved in the race must be powered by electricity generated from the sun. Organisers say they welcome \"lateral thinking\" in designs, hence the car that has a coating so aerodynamic that dirt doesn't stick to it, thereby avoiding that perilous moment when you have to guide what looks like a shiny door wedge on wheels through the car wash.</p><p>\"One of the unique aspects of the event is that we don't prejudge people's ability, we have a class of cars where the only expectation is that you bring your enthusiasm,\" Chris Selwood, the event director, told Guardian Australia.</p><p>The enthusiasm will be provided by competitors from 23 countries, including a team of native Americans from a tribal reservation in Mississippi, which excelled in a similar race in the US before heading to Australia.</p><p>\"The on-road component is a big adventure and it's exciting,\" Selwood said. \"But essentially this is a design competition to find the world's most efficient electric car.\"</p><p>The race component, which lasts for four days, has strict rules. The harsh Australian sun could, theoretically, keep the cars running 24 hours a day so a timeframe of 8am to 5pm is set for driving hours.</p><p>To ensure that the vehicles run on energy derived from the sun throughout the journey, solar cars are allowed a nominal 5kW of stored energy to run off, around 10% of normal total capacity. They then get as far as they can in the available time, often 600km to 700km, before setting up camp in the outback for the night.</p><p>\"Early in the morning they'll run off stored energy, mid-morning there will be a balance point of stored energy and energy from the sun and then the middle of the day they will be storing energy as well as using it,\" Selwood said.</p><p>\"It's a unique position to go down the Stuart highway in these cars. There are 140-tonne road trains but it's a lightly populated road with straight lines of 40km at a time. Australia's the best place to come out and play with solar car.\"</p><p>Selwood admits the cars aren't built with \"the comfort of the driver in mind\" but adds the \"real heroes\" are the people who devise the energy capture and storage.</p><p>Long term, this unusual vehicular challenge aims to demonstrate the viability of solar energy as an option for transport. While <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/why-australian-rooftop-solar-pv-prices-are-cheaper-98991\">the popularity of rooftop solar panels has soared</a> among Australian households in recent years, cars, buses and trains are yet to make the switch to solar-powered electricity in large numbers.</p><p>\"Of course, if you are travelling from Brunswick to the CBD of Melbourne, you probably wouldn't want a huge solar panel on your roof – you'd generally have them on your garage,\" Selwood said. \"If there was the political will, we'd be driving solar cars around our cities now because of the benefits in maintenance. But politicians are too wedded to the status quo.</p><p>\"At some point, society will have to make the choice between being powered by brown coal or being powered by solar.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419126173|2013-10-07T10:21:34Z|5fccfa4f8b3ef51c0097373a88d1941c152baf0a -->",
