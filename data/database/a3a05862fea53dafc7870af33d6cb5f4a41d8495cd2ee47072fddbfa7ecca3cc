Among the delights on offer are Vaughan Williams&apos;s classic Fantasia On A Theme by Thomas Tallis, followed by the neglected These Things Shall Be by John Nicholson Ireland, featuring Radio 3&apos;s New Generation Artist bass-baritone Jonathan Lemalu. Also on the bill is Walton&apos;s old testament tale Belshazzar&apos;s Feast, again featuring the dulcet rumblings of Lemalu. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Urban Secrets<br />8pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></h2> <p>Alan Cumming&apos;s series exploring the corners of British cities reaches London, where the actor strolls from St Paul&apos;s to Soho. It all feels somewhat phoned-in: some of the locations could have been dredged up with a quick Google, the script is lazy - a drinking game triggered by the word &quot;amazing&quot; could incapacitate before the first ad break - and, aside from a visit to the Sex Pistols&apos; former flat in Denmark Street, Cumming never conveys the impression that his heart&apos;s in it. Danny Baker&apos;s enlivening cameo prompts bemusement that he wasn&apos;t asked to host the whole thing. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>The Churchills</strong><br />8pm, Channel 4<br /></h2> <p>David Starkey concludes his Winston Churchill love-fest with a final look at how the Duke of Marlborough, Churchill&apos;s ancestor, influenced the wartime prime minister. Starkey is from the &quot;great men do great things&quot; school of history and he relentlessly has Winston controlling events with the ghost of Marlborough by his side, while brushing aside the interplay of other characters. He puts his cards on the table: apparently we need a new Churchill, as we&apos;ve been groping in the dark ever since Winnie&apos;s era ended at the start of the cold war. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2><strong>Wonderland: Young, Bright And On the Right</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2> <p>The last election led to a coalition where nearly 70% of cabinet ministers are Oxbridge-educated. If this latest episode of Wonderland is anything to go by, that production line isn&apos;t grinding to a halt any time soon. We follow Chris Monk and Joe Cooke of their respective university conservative associations as they enter an academic term that may well define their political careers. Despite indications early on, there&apos;s more beneath the surface of each than plummy vowels and framed Maggie photos, meaning neither Chris nor Joe can be dismissed as little B&apos;stards. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>America&apos;s Animal Hoarder: Horror At The Zoo – True Stories</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2> <p>As this True Stories documentary opens and a Chief Wiggum-esque officer tells you that events took place in Zanesville, Ohio, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking you were embarking on a spoof. In fact, this is the real-life story of a Vietnam war vet who kept a total of 56 dangerous exotic animals in his backyard (a practice perfectly legal in this particular state of America) and then promptly set them free, before killing himself. Disaster, unsurprisingly, ensued. <em>Clare Considine</em></p> <h2>The Midnight Beast<br />10pm, E4</h2> <p>The Beast&apos;s series finale is basically a clips show – one that focuses on The Midnight Beast&apos;s famed music videos. Not a bad idea, as the fake promos are probably the most successful aspect of this show. It&apos;s never easy for meagre TV budgets to compete with the megabucks music video directors have to chuck around, but these cheap and very cheerful ones manage far better than most. So sit back and enjoy the complete versions of Medium Pimpin&apos;, Strategy Wanking and other &quot;hits&quot;. <em>Phelim O&apos;Neill</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","wordcount":"581","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2012-08-08T13:51:35Z","internalComposerCode":"569a497ce4b0d16f7ae72054","internalOctopusCode":"6511247","internalPageCode":"1785053","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-08-08T13:55:08Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/39th2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/39th2"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/08/americas-animal-hoarder-the-churchills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/08/americas-animal-hoarder-the-churchills","webTitle":"TV highlights 09/08/2012","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-08T18:59:01Z","sectionName":"Television & radio","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","type":"article","id":"tv-and-radio/2012/aug/08/americas-animal-hoarder-the-churchills","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio","editions":[{"id":"tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
