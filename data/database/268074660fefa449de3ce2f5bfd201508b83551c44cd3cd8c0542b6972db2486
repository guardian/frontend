I was among them. We were a burgeoning demographic bent on discovering ourselves and the world. We stuck out our thumbs, a few of us hopped freight trains. It was an exhilarating, and occasionally dangerous endeavour.  \r\n\r\nMy summer&#39;s jaunt from Toronto brought me to Jasper, Alberta. From there I wanted to head west, into the mountains.  Late one afternoon three of us sauntered into the train station, asking about the next westward bound train. Eyeing our backpacks and dusty appearance, the station master quickly asked, “Passenger or freight?” “Freight!” my friend blurted. With a twinkle in his eye he leaned over the counter and told us,“Third track over, about two thirds of the way down, you&#39;ll find an empty boxcar.”  With no further ado, off we scampered, looking for our ride.\r\n\r\nClambering aboard and with no idea when we might be moving, we dug into our packs to see what snacks we had amongst us. Although we had only recently met, it seemed like we had been best buddies since childhood.  “Be ready to brace yourself,” my new friend warned. “Freight train couplings are quite loose, and will throw you around when the train starts to move.” He spoke like a seasoned veteran of the rails, yet I doubt he was out of his teens. \r\n\r\nWithin an hour we were rolling, and climbing.  There really is nothing quite like the view from an open boxcar.  Forget those “panoramic” train cars. Nothing compares to the feel of the wind, the pine scented aroma, and the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels over the rails as you watch the snow capped Canadian Rockies roll past like never ending eye candy. It was over forty years ago, yet the memory is with me like it was yesterday.  Just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get any better, we heard the distant sound of the head of the train coming to a stop.  “Brace yourself!” my friend shouted. We heard each car bang against the next one, front to back, until we were tossed forward. For several minutes we sat, in total silence, with a living room sized view of Mt Robson.  The silence was broken with  the sound of the giant diesel engines starting up again and once again the freight car couplings banged against each other.  We knew what to expect as we held on as best we could.  Continuing our westward journey our train rounded a long curve toward the north. It afforded us the perfect view to witness a full moon rising over a distant snow capped peak.\r\n\r\nWe had no idea where we were headed.  My hope was to go to Prince Rupert, a seaport in northern British Columbia, for no reason other than I had never been there before.  Instead, as dawn came our train rolled into a freight yard.  It was the end of the line for this adventure.  We were in Kamloops and another day of exploration awaited.

Late one afternoon three of us sauntered into the train station, asking about the next westward bound train. Eyeing our backpacks and dusty appearance, the station master quickly asked, “Passenger or freight?” “Freight!” my friend blurted. With a twinkle in his eye he leaned over the counter and told us,“Third track over, about two thirds of the way down, you&#39;ll find an empty boxcar.”  With no further ado, off we scampered, looking for our ride.\r\n\r\nClambering aboard and with no idea when we might be moving, we dug into our packs to see what snacks we had amongst us. Although we had only recently met, it seemed like we had been best buddies since childhood.  “Be ready to brace yourself,” my new friend warned. “Freight train couplings are quite loose, and will throw you around when the train starts to move.” He spoke like a seasoned veteran of the rails, yet I doubt he was out of his teens. \r\n\r\nWithin an hour we were rolling, and climbing.  There really is nothing quite like the view from an open boxcar.  Forget those “panoramic” train cars. Nothing compares to the feel of the wind, the pine scented aroma, and the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels over the rails as you watch the snow capped Canadian Rockies roll past like never ending eye candy. It was over forty years ago, yet the memory is with me like it was yesterday.  Just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get any better, we heard the distant sound of the head of the train coming to a stop.  “Brace yourself!” my friend shouted. We heard each car bang against the next one, front to back, until we were tossed forward. For several minutes we sat, in total silence, with a living room sized view of Mt Robson.  The silence was broken with  the sound of the giant diesel engines starting up again and once again the freight car couplings banged against each other.  We knew what to expect as we held on as best we could.  Continuing our westward journey our train rounded a long curve toward the north. It afforded us the perfect view to witness a full moon rising over a distant snow capped peak.\r\n\r\nWe had no idea where we were headed.  My hope was to go to Prince Rupert, a seaport in northern British Columbia, for no reason other than I had never been there before.  Instead, as dawn came our train rolled into a freight yard.  It was the end of the line for this adventure.  We were in Kamloops and another day of exploration awaited.
