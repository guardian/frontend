        "body":"<p>Dario Franchitti has been hospitalised after a huge accident at the IndyCar Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. The accident, which also injured 14 spectators, comes nearly two years after fellow British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In both accidents the cars went airborne and into the catch fencing.</p><p>Franchitti's Ganassi car caught the back end of Takuma Sato at turn five on the final lap of the race and was sent upwards and slid along the fence before returning to the ground. Both cars scattered debris across the track, and the remaining competitors were forced to weave through the broken equipment under caution, as had been the case two years ago.</p><p>The driver, a three times winner of the Indianapolis 500, was removed from the car and taken to hospital where he has been examined and diagnosed as suffering from concussion, a fractured right ankle and a fractured vertebra. Franchitti will not require surgery, although he will be kept in hospital overnight.</p><p>With positions fixed at the moment of the accident, the race was won by Will Power, who had suffered a broken back in the crash at Las Vegas and admitted it was similar to that incident. \"I just saw Dario's car and him sitting in it with a lot of damage, and yes, that's what it reminded me of,\" Power said. \"I hate seeing that. We try to keep these cars on the ground.\"</p><p>Fellow driver Scott Dixon agreed. \"The smells and the visuals, for me, and even talking to Will, you have the remnants of Vegas popping into your head with you coming around the corner and you can't drive through it because there's a field of debris,\" he said.</p><p>IndyCar is likely to investigate the crash thoroughly since, in the wake of Wheldon's death, extensive efforts were made to reduce the chances of the cars leaving the track and hitting the catch fencing. Wheldon, a two-times Indianapolis 500 winner, had been testing safety features on the designs for the 2012 season before he was killed and when the new chassis was launched it was given the prefix DW in his honour.</p><p>The spectators were believed to have been injured by a piece of the catch fencing that was knocked loose into the nearby grandstand, rather than parts of the car itself.</p><p>A statement from the race promoters read: \"An IndyCar official and IndyCar driver, Dario Franchitti, along with two fans were transferred to an area hospital for evaluation. Eleven fans were additionally evaluated on site.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213562|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|353b02fd4f75a5baaf1a81df5d242d17fd5d94f9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Peyton Manning spent all afternoon putting the Broncos in the end zone during a wild shootout with Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>The last time he got the ball, though, Manning kept Denver out of the end zone and that was the best way to win the game.</p><p>The four-time MVP kept up his record pace for touchdown passes, Matt Prater kicked a 28-yard field goal as time expired after an interception by Romo spoiled the first 500-yard game in Dallas history, and the Broncos remained unbeaten with a 51-48 victory Sunday.</p><p>\"It was pretty amazing that it came down to the defense making a big play at the end,\" Denver coach John Fox said. \"Thank God our offense kept us in the game all day long.\"</p><p>In the waning seconds of one of the highest-scoring thrillers in NFL history, Manning ensured that his kicker not Romo had the last chance to score.</p><p>And with that, the Broncos ran their total to 230 points this season the most by an NFL team through the first five games.</p><p>The Broncos (5-0) had moved the ball to the Dallas 2 after Danny Trevathan's diving interception at the 24 in the final 2 minutes. Needing a first down but not a touchdown so they could run out the clock, Manning and Knowshon Moreno shouted at each other in the backfield just before the snap.</p><p>\"He basically was asking me, 'How am I supposed to do that? How can I get a half a yard but not get a yard and a half?'\" said Manning, who threw for 414 yards and four touchdowns to give him a record-setting 20 in the first five games. \"I just said, 'You can't! You can't score! You can't do it!'\"</p><p>Moreno managed to pull off the first down without scoring, and Manning took three snaps to drain the clock to 2 seconds for Prater, who also had a 50-yarder among his three field goals.</p><p>It was quite a debate over a measly yard in a game with 1,039 yards of total offense combined in the fourth-highest scoring game in NFL history and tied for the second-highest in regulation since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.</p><p>Romo was 25 of 36 for 506 yards and five touchdowns, breaking Don Meredith's club record of 460 yards. He is the fifth quarterback in NFL history to pass for at least 500 yards and five touchdowns in a game.</p><p>Manning, who threw for 414 yards and moved past Dan Marino for second on the career passing list with 61,371 yards, answered by leading a nine-play, 73-yard drive to Moreno's tying 1-yard score with 2:44 remaining.</p><p>Romo's interception came two plays later, when Trevathan dived in front of tight end Gavin Escobar.</p><p>The Cowboys (2-3) were on the verge of getting blown out early in the second half when they finally stopped Manning and forced a field goal. They later ended his streak of 227 passes without an interception when Morris Claiborne picked him off late in the third quarter.</p><p>In other games, Andrew Luck threw two touchdown passes and Donald Brown scored the go-ahead TD with 8:55 to go in the Colts 34-28 win over the Seahawks, and the New Orleans Saints remained unbeaten with a 26-18 victory at Chicago with Drew Brees throwing two touchdown passes to Pierre Thomas and Jimmy Graham equaling an NFL record with another 100-yard game.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Bengals beat the Patriots 13-6 with BenJarvus Green-Ellis running 1 yard in the fourth quarter for the game's only touchdown, the Chiefs had a 26-17 win over the Titans to maintain their best start to a season since 2003, the Ravens edged the Dolphins 26-23, the Packers had a 22-9 win over the Lions and Philadelphia kept the Giants winless with a 36-21 result at East Rutherford.</p><p>At Glendale, Arizona the Cardinals had a 22-6 win over the Panthers and, at St. Louis, the Rams beat the winless Jaguars 34-20 with Sam Bradford throwing three touchdown passes.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/nfl-clockwatch-week-five-live\">NFL Clockwatch: Week Five - as it happened</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211854|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|c3152dd3d245a505932eb76859cadbd89be97e93 -->",

It started out tense and ended as a laugher. On a night where neither starter was effective, the Dodgers bats crushed the Braves bullpen and now Atlanta might have to turn to Freddy Garcia, on the the road, tomorrow night to keep their season alive just one more day. Plus, with Miguel Cabrera clearly limited by injuries, L.A. might have the best hitter in the playoffs with Hanley Ramirez and they still have the best starting pitcher in the league in their back pocket. So yeah, this could be a scary team this October.<br />That will wrap up tonight's coverage of the MLB playoffs, but we'll be back tomorrow as the Divisonal Series continue. Thanks to everyone who followed along with us tonight, especially those who contributed emails and tweets (sorry I couldn't fit them all in).

While the Atlanta Braves have been busy trying to enforce violations of unwritten rules. The Dodgers have taken on the personality of their two best hitters, controversial Cuban phenom Yasiel Puig and rejuvenated former Marlins infielder Hanley Ramirez. When the Dodgers celebrated clinching their playoff spot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/dodgers-diamondbacks-pool-texas-rangers-slide\">by sneaking into the Arizona Diamondbacks' pool</a> it was as if a season that started off like the &quot;Bad News Bears&quot; in a bad way, when the Dodgers had an atrocious beginning of the season that almost got manager Don Mattingly fired, entered into the zany winning montage portion of the movie.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Atlanta Braves have been acting like their duty is is to police the many, many unwritten rules around baseball, possibly ones that only exist in their heads. The absolute nadir of this tendency happened during a few weeks span late last month when Braves catcher Brian McCann helped incite two separate fights: first after getting upset at <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-jose-fernandez-hits-first-career-home-022103628--mlb.html\">Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez after he was a bit too excited for hitting his first career home run</a>, when <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/benches-clear-atlanta-carlos-gomez-homers-argues-braves-235815900--mlb.html\">he attempted to block the Milwaukee Brewers' Carlos Gomez from reaching home plate on a home run. </a>Some are starting to suspect that in his version of baseball, hitting home runs against his team is a violation of the unwritten rules of the MLB.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/mlb-playoffs-divisional-series-previews\">So these two teams are designed to be perfect contrasts to one another,</a> so it's no big shock that the NLDS is coming to Dodgers Stadium tied up at 1-1 after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/05/pirates-braves-cardinals-angels-playoffs\"> dramatic game two on Friday</a>. Tonight it's a battle of rookie pitchers with similar regular season records as the Braves put 22 year old Julio Teheran (14-8, 3.20) on the mound against 26 year old South Korean import Hyun-Jin Ryu (14-8, 3.00). Okay, it's a bit of a cheat to call Ryu a rookie since he's been playing professional baseball for a while but, hey, Ichiro Suzuki won a Rookie of the Year when he arrived in the MLB.</p> <p>So today's the tiebreaker game, it should be good.

But in what was a gripping grand final (a shade off a classic, I'd argue, given the number of errors) they found a way to win. That's premiership quality. Their resolve – which netted coach Trent Robinson a premiership in his rookie year, won nice-guy captain Anthony Minichiello a long-awaited second title, and showed Sonny Bill Williams is either a common denominator in success (All Blacks, Chiefs, now Roosters) or has a knack for knowing which ride to hitch his wagon to – looked even more impressive when the final stats came out. The Roosters made more errors (12-6), missed more tackles (27-22), completed fewer sets from more possessions (22/35 or 63% to Manly's 23/28 or 82%), made fewer line breaks (3-5), fewer tackle breaks (22-27), and they lost the penalty count 2-5.</p><p>So how did they win? David Williams's horror night helped (see below) but it was in the back end of the game that they scored the bulk of their points suggesting Manly's grueling final series, and the extra 37 tackles they had to make on Sunday night, became a factor. But still the Roosters had to find holes and capitalise. And that's what they were able to do, with the three players who made the difference late on being their three new signings: Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings. Nice bit of business, that.</p><h2>James Maloney had a great claim for man of the match</h2><p>Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans had a wonderful grand final but it's surprising to say the least that he won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground ahead of Maloney. The Roosters' five-eighth was instrumental in his team winning the premiership, which you'd have to think is the main criteria in selecting the Clive Churchill medallist. His pinpoint cross-field bomb set up the Roosters' opening try to Daniel Tupou, his midfield burst following a Williams offload helped create the Roosters' third, and it was his grubber kick into the Manly in-goal that Jennings swooped on in the 73rd minute to score the match-sealer. Throw in his four out of four conversions and a penalty goal and his being overlooked becomes baffling. Still, if he's actually bothered, he should be consoled by his premiership ring. </p><h2>Manly were unlucky</h2><p>Plenty will argue that Manly used up their allocation of luck when awarded a penalty try just after half-time. Perhaps they're right. Jamie Lyon was certainly tackled without the ball but could you say without any doubt that he would have scored after collecting the bouncing ball (which at this time was grubbering surreptitiously away to his left, like someone trying to sneak out of a party before his mates see him)? I couldn't. <br /> <br />Nevertheless many other decisions went against Manly, some critical. An early knock-on from Mitchell Pearce on his own 20m was let go; Kieran Foran was called for a knock-on with the refs missing Pearce's strip; Jared Waerea-Hargreaves's head-butt (though gentle, like a horse nuzzling for affection) was not deemed worthy of penalising (meaning Maloney kicked a penalty goal from in-front for Manly holding the player down too long); Jennings's touch on a Lyon grubber kick should have resulted in a Manly ball 10m out from the Roosters' line a minute from half-time; and Maloney's pass to Minichiello prior to the Shaun-Kenny Dowall match-leveller was clearly forward. It would have for made compelling TV but Geoff Toovey did well to stop his head from exploding in a rain of goop against the Perspex walls of his viewing box.</p><h2>Williams and Jennings made timely interventions</h2><p>Given he makes hairy-eared commentators swoon like girls at a One Direction concert it feels almost blasphemous to say that for the first 60 minutes of the grand final Sonny Bill Williams was close to the worst player on the field. Up until that point his contributions included a collection of passes that hit the turf, a knock-on 15m out from his own line (which gifted Manly possession which they used to score their opening try), and a bad read in defence that created space for Manly's third try. It seemed that all his earnest conversations with the heavens were being ignored. Perhaps God was watching Big Momma's House on Nine's digital dumping ground, Go! </p><p>Or perhaps not. Because on the hour mark Sonny Bill's fortunes changed. First he angled a hit-up back inside at Cherry-Evans and his half-bust made room for his big right paw to finesse the ball into Maloney's midriff. It put Maloney on the long run that set up the Kenny-Dowall try and regain the lead for the Roosters. Later, Williams burst through the guts of the Manly line like a bird's eye chilli and it was soon after that Jennings – who'd been anonymous in attack – scorched through the in-goal before diving full-length to brilliantly touch down Maloney's kick. Cometh the hour etc etc.</p><h2>Tupou and Williams: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times</h2><p>If the AFL aren't scared off after the Israel Folau debacle they could do worse than look at Roosters winger Daniel Tupou. Unlike Folau, whose enormous frame was put on breeze blocks by Greater Western Sydney's trainers and stripped back to bare bones, Tupou already has the feline lines of an Aussie Rules footballer. And he can leap and mark  (with grace) as he showed with his try over his opposite winger David Williams on Sunday, which was a carbon copy of his try last week over Akuila Uate. Oddly, however, Williams didn't even attempt to jump. Instead he looked up at Tupou like he was an eclipse of the sun. And as we all know you're not supposed to look at an eclipse.<br /> <br />The scenario almost repeated itself 13 minutes into the second half when a high ball plummeted Williams's way with Tupuo preparing his leap. Utterly rattled, Williams only had eyes for Tupou and the ball hit the Sea Eagle without him even attempting to catch it. This led to a drop out and in the next set Mitchell Pearce put Aidan Guerra into a hole and the Roosters clawed the score back to 18-14. Finally, with the game on the line, when Maloney's grubber was bobbling through the Manly in-goal, Jennings ran an opponent who seemed to pull up, as if believing the ball was going to run dead. What player? David Williams. Sport can be cruel.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419203200|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|48725d877df984d581bf8f8c3653452ab2268aa0 -->",

        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel cruises to another victory at Korean Grand Prix",
        "body":"<p>At least there was no booing from the fans for Sebastian Vettel on Sunday after he had completed another unruffled trip to the chequered flag. It will certainly not concern him that, well, there were not that many spectators to witness him move to within touching distance of a fourth consecutive world championship. He will be aware that the title will put him among the greats – only Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher have also won four in a row, but the sport might yet be troubled by his dominance, especially if he wraps up the title at the next race in Japan.</p><p>After taking the flag in Yeongam, that he will take the title seems inevitable. He can do it at Suzuka with a victory allied to Fernando Alonso finishing outside the top eight. But if not there, then surely soon. This was his fourth consecutive win and he made a similar charge at a similar time last year, taking four in a row with Singapore, Japan, Korea and India. At the end of that sequence his lead over Alonso was only 13 points – it is now 77.</p><p>When, not if, then and while the team principal, Christian Horner, is not expecting Red Bull to do it in Japan, he is unequivocal in his praise for the champion-in-waiting. Asked whether people might put Vettel in the same bracket as Fangio and Schumacher, he responded: \"Should he win four titles in a row, they will have to.\"</p><p>The \"should\" was politic more than anything as he added that Vettel would, indeed, be alongside the greats. \"He has got to be right up there, he has got to be,\" he said. \"The level that he is performing at is unbelievable in many respects. What has been really impressive is that he has continued to grow and get better as he has gained more experience. To have won the ratio of races he has is remarkable.\"</p><p>That ratio is 34 wins from 115 starts, and character has been crucial, argues Horner. \"He is hugely self-critical,\" he said. \"He is always looking at areas where he can improve. He'll look at this race and look at areas where he could have been stronger. It is that inward-looking [approach] that keeps propelling him forward.\"</p><p>That inexorable motion has put him in an extraordinary position, but while fans may like to see a closer fight it would be churlish to deny his skill. Certainly he has the best car but Mark Webber, who has been pedalling the same Red Bull alongside Vettel for the three championships he has won already, only really came close in 2010.</p><p>Perhaps of more concern is that such dominance can be off-putting. Vettel is not only being mentioned alongside Schumacher in reference to his titles but now also to the period of the latter's pre-eminince when, of his seven world championships, five were won consecutively for Ferrari between 2000 and 2004.</p><p>Indeed Lewis Hamilton, who made another feisty push to only yield a fifth place, noted a comparison between the two German drivers. \"Personally I feel for the fan because I remember the period when Michael Schumacher was winning,\" he said. \"I remember waking up in the morning to watch the start of the race, going back to sleep, and then waking up when it ended, because I already knew what would happen. I am pretty sure a lot of people were doing that today.\"</p><p>Which is a fair comment. There are few fans of any sport who would not prefer to see a nail-biting fight, but part of that equation is the opposition providing the challenge and at the moment they simply cannot match Red Bull.</p><p>Instead tyres have again become a talking point in the dirty air behind Vettel's acceleration to the title, particularly after Sergio Pérez's right-front delaminated mid-race here. Earlier in the weekend Alonso's criticism of the rubber was met cuttingly by Pirelli's Paul Hembery saying: \"I can only suggest he goes to ask the soon-to-be four-times champion how to get the best from the same tyres.\" A remark for which he subsequently apologised.</p><p>But Alonso continued on Sunday,  stating: \"We know the tyres are on the limit in terms of quality.\" To which Webber added: \"Pirelli will put the puncture of Pérez down to a lock-up but the reason the drivers are locking up is because there's no tread left.\"</p><p>Yet Pirelli, which has come in for so much criticism this season, is merely doing what was asked of it, providing rubber offering more stops and more strategy decisions. Indeed, Alonso acknowledged this amid his critique. \"These are tyres that won't last a lap, but as we said on Saturday, we have zero problems with the performance,\" he noted. \"It's us who haven't adapted to these 2012 tyres. It's up to us Ferrari, or the drivers, to improve.\"</p><p>Which is another fair point, certainly to Pirelli. The tyres are, after all, the same for everybody and it is up to the teams to maximise performance.

        "headline":"Sean O'Loughlin's return for Wigan decisive in win over Warrington",
        "body":"<p>Sam Tomkins was selected some years ago as the face of England's challenge for the 2013 World Cup, but even Wigan's full-back believes that Sean O'Loughlin will be a more significant figure in a successful home challenge. This stirring, occasionally torrid, Wigan triumph – their first Super League and Challenge Cup double, and the greatest comeback in 16 Grand Finals – confirmed the place of the low-profile loose forward among the cream of British rugby league's most famous club.</p><p>He has now lifted four trophies in eight seasons as the Wigan captain – two more than Andy Farrell, his illustrious brother-in-law who also graced the cherry-and-white No13 shirt, hoisted during a slightly longer spell leading a less authentic Wigan team. But O'Loughlin's contribution to this latest victory invited comparisons with another recent Wigan wonder and former team-mate, Kris Radlinski, who enjoyed his finest hour when winning the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match in the Challenge Cup final at Murrayfield in 2002 after spending much of the previous week in hospital on a drip because of an infected foot.</p><p>O'Loughlin's appearance at Old Trafford was not quite as unexpected – he did not attend the pre-match walkabout in carpet slippers, as Radlinski, now the club's football manager, did in Edinburgh 11 years ago. But only eight days earlier, before Wigan's semi-final win against Leeds, he posed in the tunnel for a photograph with a young supporter with his right foot still in a protective boot.</p><p>The 30-year-old had not played for five weeks since lifting the Challenge Cup, and that was his only appearance since 2 August. Shaun Edwards, another Wigan great, had marvelled on Grand Final eve about the fitness and athleticism that O'Loughlin showed to give his usual complete performance at Wembley, but if anything his contribution at Old Trafford was more significant. He handled slickly, tackled strongly, even carried the ball up like a prop when required, before floating a long pass to allow Pat Richards to mark his farewell appearance with a stroll to the corner.</p><p>As the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane, reflected over a pint of lager an hour or so after the final hooter: \"That's what the players say about Lockers – he's like a front-rower, a back-rower, a half, he can do everything. He does things people don't notice, carries the ball strong, always the right thing at the right time.</p><p>\"He's been immobile for five weeks, he's only run with us for a couple of days, so to go out and perform on a stage as intense as that is an absolute one-off. As a man and a character he'll never surprise me. I hold him in really high regard.\"</p><p>O'Loughlin confirmed that he had been in a dilemma for much of the week, worrying that taking a risk with his achilles at Old Trafford might rule him out of a second consecutive World Cup. \"But you don't get many chances to play in finals, and with a lot of boys leaving, things like that, you want to be part of it. Luckily I think I've come through all right and I can get involved with the World Cup now. Missing the last one was tough to take.\" Assuming he passes a final fitness test with the England medical staff, O'Loughlin will fly out to the training camp in South Africa  with Tomkins, Lee Mossop, Liam Farrell, Josh Charnley and Michael McIlorum, the latter two having claimed opportunist tries in Wigan's second-half onslaught.</p><p>It could be an interesting meeting at the airport with Ben Westwood, the Warrington second-row who is also in the squad and set the tone for a memorably bloody Grand Final by whacking Blake Green with a short right in the second minute of the match.</p><p>Green, a chunky Australian stand-off who has proved an inspired signing from Hull KR, recovered to win the Harry Sunderland award for man of the match despite blurred vision from a spectacular shiner. But Wane was not exactly waxing lyrical about what he would regard as routine rugby league courage.</p><p>\"Stopping down after a whack in his eye … he needs to get up and carry on,\" growled the Wiganer's Wiganer. \"He said he couldn't see anything out of his eye. But in big games like that I expect him to carry on, and he did, got the man of the match, did some good things. But I do expect it as well, if I'm honest with you. You wouldn't want me to tell you lies.\"</p><p>He was equally blunt about the Westwood punch, which will be studied by the disciplinary authorities  with the possibility of a suspension that could affect his World Cup prospects. \"It happens,\" said Wane. \"People get injured, you get borderline tackles because people are throwing their bodies in – there's that much at stake. That's what makes finals something a bit different, a bit special.\"</p><p>Sport does not come any less sanitised than that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419180941|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|78e57e231f68c31f59b08eb41a61a05c91188ef7 -->",

        "headline":"Courtney Lawes is a resurgent force in Northampton's draw at Leicester",
        "body":"<p>The majority of draws satisfy no one but this brutal contest suggested England's leading players will take some knocking over in their looming Heineken Cup and November international campaigns. Northampton, in particular, currently fear no one and their thunderous road trip this weekend to the French champions Castres should be some collision.</p><p>Even the powerful All Blacks and Springboks might be advised to brace themselves for the impact of Courtney Lawes, the resurgent England lock who is not only threatening to shake the autumn leaves from every tree in the East Midlands but is also applying his prodigious power more thoughtfully. On this evidence the 24-year-old Lawes, who has just become a father following the birth of a daughter last week, is finally maturing into the world-class force he aspires to be.</p><p>Had he, and the similarly hard-running Luther Burrell, stayed on the field for the full game it is unlikely Leicester would have been in a position to stage the brave fightback which earned them an unlikely draw from 19-9 down. Lawes, despite his yellow card for slowing the ball down at a ruck, is playing with more discipline and is contributing on a more consistent basis as a result.</p><p>\"I am maturing a little bit and realising you don't have to make a massive hit every tackle,\" he said while deservedly clutching the man-of-the-match award. \"I have certainly done that in the past and it affects your game when you are starting matches with bad shoulders. I feel great and feel I can now really push on and find my potential.\"</p><p>If Burrell's own injured right shoulder had not forced him off prematurely, the Saints would surely have secured their first win over the Tigers in nine attempts. Burrell was also unfortunate to be sent to the sin-bin in the first half for a supposedly dangerous tackle on Anthony Allen which, to most onlookers, was nothing of the sort. \"I hate that law … it doesn't make any sense to me,\" sighed Tom Wood, the visitors' frustrated flanker, making the point that ball carriers instinctively seek to go to ground as quickly as possible regardless of the tackler's actions.</p><p>\"As a player I know that, when I am the ball carrier, the second my feet come off the ground I'm diving head-first for the ground deliberately to make sure the ball comes back our way.\"</p><p>Wood, at the head of the queue of contenders to captain England next month, also believes rugby will suffer if too many big hits are legislated out of the sport. \"It would be a real shame not to have that in the game. You've put a big hit in, one of your players has driven one of their players back and it feels like a real positive in the game. Then all of a sudden you're down to 14 men and defending for your lives. I felt like it was a fair tackle in real time.\"</p><p>The crooked lineout throw which prefaced the Tigers' dramatic late relieving try by the wholehearted Ed Slater was another bone of contention for the Northampton hierarchy but, as their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, conceded afterwards, refereeing derby matches of this intensity is horribly fraught. Saturday's official, JP Doyle, must have felt at times as if he was in charge of the mosh pit at a heavy-metal gig; the decibel count as Leicester, driven on by their persevering forwards and the influential Toby Flood, cranked up the pressure was remarkable even by Welford Road standards.</p><p>Despite Louis Deacon's 70th-minute sin-binning for backchat, the champions could have sneaked it at the end had the ball not popped out of an advancing scrum near the visiting line. The Saints, though, deserved at least a share of the spoils.</p><p>In the shape of their outstanding No8 Stuart Dickinson, try-scoring prop Alex Corbisiero, scrum-half Lee Dickson and George Pisi they have players in form at a timely stage of the season who could spell trouble for Castres, Leinster and Ospreys in a heavy-duty Heineken Cup pool. If there is a caveat, it is that Dylan Hartley's men are still not quite finishing opponents off in the final quarter. Had they not been pipped late on by Gloucester at Kingsholm and won here, they would be level with Saracens at the top of the table rather than six points behind.</p><p>Leicester, for their part, are still without Manu Tuilagi, Steve Mafi and Mathew Tait, while Geoff Parling was a late withdrawal with a sore hip. The Lions lock is expected to be fit, however, for Friday's opening European encounter with Ulster at Ravenhill, not one of their favourite venues. This time, at least, they will travel forewarned and battle-hardened.</p><p><strong>Leicester</strong> Morris; Scully (Bowden, 7), Goneva, Allen, Thompstone; Flood (capt), B Youngs (Mele, 69); Mulipola,  T Youngs, Cole, Deacon, Kitchener, Slater, Salvi, Crane.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Slater <strong>Con</strong> Flood <strong>Pens</strong> Flood 4.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Deacon 70.</p><p><strong>Northampton</strong> Foden; Elliott, Pisi, Burrell (Wilson, 69), North; Myler, Dickson; Corbisiero (Denman, 63), Hartley (capt), Mercey (Waller, 63), Manoa, Lawes, Wood, Dowson (Clark, 55), Dickinson.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Corbisiero <strong>Con</strong> Myler <strong>Pens</strong> Myler 4.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Burrell 19, Lawes 70.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> JP Doyle. <strong>Attendance</strong> 23,891.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194765|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|dba33ca1ae7c2f471f622e9edf74b7ce584a17a5 -->",

        "headline":"Dean Ryan says Worcester's problem is a question of confidence",
        "body":"<p>Worcester fly to the Alps this week for a European meeting with Oyonnax, the surprise package of the French league, totally lacking in confidence, according to their new director of rugby, Dean Ryan.</p><p>After a fifth defeat in the Premiership  his side are rooted at the bottom of the league, already seven points adrift with possible relegation on their minds and a chairman begging fans for patience.</p><p>Ryan has a squad largely bequeathed by Richard Hill, his predecessor who was sacked in the spring, and little wriggle room in the transfer market before the end of the season. The only bright spot is the arrival of a quartet of Argentinian internationals, three of whom were signed by Hill but whose involvement will be limited before Christmas by the demands of Argentina in the Rugby Championship which ended on Saturday with defeat by Australia and in an autumn Test season which starts at Twickenham, moves to Cardiff and ends in Naples.</p><p>With Worcester due to play league games against Exeter, Bath, Sale and Northampton during that Test window, it is understandable that Cecil Duckworth, chairman and long-time benefactor, asked for patience while throwing his weight 100% behind Ryan. \"I and the board always wanted to attract a top coaching team and now we have one of the very best and we are confident they will deliver.\"</p><p>However, it is confidence which Ryan says is most lacking when refereeing decisions go against them, as they did against Newcastle. Ryan said he will not start using an \"excuse culture\" but conceded: \"It's pretty obvious that losing games, and in the manner we lost today and against London Irish, saps confidence but we can only control ourselves. I am not going to get into the excuse culture.</p><p>\"We can't buy a win at the moment. The challenge here is to be competitive regularly. There have been times when we haven't been and at times we were today. We've got to get better at managing things. We haven't got a group that is confident week in, week out of getting all those pieces of the jigsaw right.\"</p><p>And that summed up Saturday when Worcester were 10 points down after eight minutes, still 13–3 down at the interval and struggling to reap the rewards of their pressure at the end. The Samoan wing, David Lemi, did squeeze home in the 69th minute and his partners in the back three, Josh Drauniniu and Chris Pennell, might have done better with more ball and better decision-making, but that was it.</p><p>Newcastle, who have developed into a team under Dean Richards, survived by waiting for Worcester to make mistakes, and headed home with a second away win and a bit of a cushion for when Ryan's fortunes change, as Richards thinks they will.</p><p>\"When I came up with Harlequins we lost the first six and everyone was writing that we would be relegated,\" said Richards. \"You only have to look at the quality of Worcester's squad to see they are not going to be at the bottom at the end of the season. They just need a bit of a break, which will happen at some stage, and they will start climbing the ladder.\"</p><p><strong>Worcester</strong> Pennell; Drauniniu, Fatiaki (Grove, 19), Matavese, Lemi; Mieres (Warwick, 53), Hodgson (Su'a,47); Becasseau (Porter, 53), Shervinton (Brooker, 53), Murray (Andress, 66), Williams, Jones, Thomas (capt), Abbott, Taulava (Goodhue, 48).</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Lemi <strong>Pens</strong> Mieres 2.</p><p><strong>Newcastle</strong> Tait; Cato, Powell, Fitzpatrick, Catterick; Clegg (Godman, 70), Blair (Fury, 70); Vickers (Montanella, 45; Vickers, 66), Thompson (McGuigan, 48), Tomaszczyk (Wilson, 66), Del Fava (Tomes, 75), Barrow, Wilson, Welch (capt; York, 45), Hogg.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Blair. <strong>Con</strong> Clegg. <strong>Pens</strong> Clegg 2, Godman.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Tomaszczyk 36.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> M Fox. <strong>Attendance</strong> 6,415.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419183657|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|7955dedf3b05e8b573056d1feb73ad6e3b7864ca -->",

        "body":"<p>Harry Redknapp does not believe the Football Association's senior officials are equipped to make high-level sporting decisions and said he \"would not trust them to show him a good manager if their lives depended on it\".</p><p>Redknapp was considered to be the clear favourite to take the England job when Fabio Capello resigned last year, but the FA opted to approach Roy Hodgson, then in charge at West Bromwich Albion.</p><p>It had been considered a near-certainty that Redknapp would leave Tottenham to take the job, and he has admitted he believed as much himself, going as far as asking Brendan Rodgers, then at Swansea and now at Liverpool, to be his assistant at Euro 2012.</p><p>Although Redknapp maintains he holds no grudge against Hodgson, Redknapp is still unhappy and claims he was the leading choice with the fans and the players, suggesting senior members of the national squad like Steven Gerrard texted him to offer their support for him to succeed Capello.</p><p>\"I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it. How would they know? What clubs have they ever run? Who do they speak to who really knows the game?\" the QPR manager said in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail.</p><p>\"This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue. And they get to pick the England manager.</p><p>\"Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job. I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry. But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager – a man who is more their cup of tea.\"</p><p>While Redknapp was expected to leave Tottenham for England, he ended up leaving them without a job at all as the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy parted company with him that summer.</p><p>A number of Spurs fans had held the belief Redknapp had allowed the England job to become the focus of his attention and, despite denying that, he has confessed to making plans for the national team while in the Tottenham dugout.</p><p>\"If I had become the England manager I would have taken Brendan Rodgers as my number two,\" he added. \"My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?</p><p>\"So when Tottenham played Swansea on April 1, 2012, I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championship in the summer as my part-time coach?</p><p>\"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it.</p><p>\"Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day, by the way.</p><p>\"It didn't work out. On April 1, I was contemplating the way forward for England with Brendan Rodgers – and on April 29 the FA offered the job to Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"I'll admit, I thought it was mine. Everyone seemed so certain, everyone I had met from all parts of the game seemed utterly convinced it was my job.\"</p><p>Redknapp believes that the issue of compensation to Tottenham remains one of the reasons why he was never asked.</p><p>\"I'm sure the FA would deny they were interested in me anyway, they always like to say they got their No1 choice, but maybe what helped make their minds up was the thought of writing a cheque in the region of £16million to Levy.</p><p>\"He is known for driving a hard bargain at the best of times; get Daniel on a bad day and I would have ended up more expensive than Capello – and the FA were already getting a lot of criticism over his £6m-a-year salary.</p><p>\"Of all the reasons doing the rounds for me not becoming England manager, the compensation issue makes most sense.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419236317|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e6f86795b1b01ba602b95fd6f69ebaeb30a8b36d -->",

        "body":"<p>Arsène Wenger praised Arsenal's \"special resilience\" after they came from behind to pick up a point against West Bromwich Albion and go into the international break top of the table, above Liverpool on goals scored. The Arsenal manager said that his players would take \"mental comfort\" from their place at the Premier League summit but said it was far too early to say whether they had the mentality of champions.</p><p>Claudio Yacob put a resurgent Albion side ahead and Nicolas Anelka had two decent chances early in the second half to double their lead against his former club before Jack Wilshere equalised. It was his first league goal for Arsenal since November 2010 and came at the end of a testing week for the England midfielder, who had been pictured holding a cigarette after Tuesday night's win over Napoli. \"I think he learns very quickly and what is more important for England and Arsenal is that he shows the right response on the pitch,\" Wenger said.</p><p>The Frenchman admitted that Albion posed plenty of problems on an afternoon when Arsenal fell behind for the first time since their first-day defeat. \"It required special resilience today because they didn't give us any space and they were well organised and we needed to find something special to score,\" Wenger said.</p><p>\"I'm not pleased, because I want to win, but if you ask me if it's a fair point over the 90 minutes, I would say yes. Why? Because we were 1-0 down just before half-time and straight after half-time Anelka has the two near [chances] and that would have made it difficult.\"</p><p>Asked about the significance of leading the Premier League ahead of a two-week break, Wenger replied: \"I feel it was important not to lose once we were down today. That is the most important thing. But for the mental comfort it's good [to be top] as well.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419197564|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|96572d7ae0252c48f77c699a23fc7ac06a05873a -->",

        "headline":"West Ham's Ravel Morrison finds his feet to floor Tottenham Hotspur",
        "body":"<p>Sam Allardyce described Ravel Morrison as a \"genius\" after his jaw-dropping solo goal set the seal on West Ham United's 3-0 win at Tottenham. The midfielder burst through from the halfway line, with his team already 2-0 up, to beat two defenders, draw the goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and dink the ball beyond him. Spurs had previously conceded only two goals in 11 matches this season.</p><p>It was a derby day that had been framed by the determination of both clubs and the authorities to avoid any repeat of the antisemitic abuse from the visiting fans that had marred the fixture last season. There had been the pre-match warning from the Metropolitan police that any use of the term \"Yid\" could see its officers make arrests.</p><p>The Tottenham support, who regularly refer to themselves and their players as such, ignored the warning and used the term on several occasions. West Ham fans, tongues in their cheeks, called them \"racists\". The visiting support trod a fine line when a small number of them chanted, \"We won't say his name, he's coming for you.\" Some of them had caused outrage last season by chanting that Adolf Hilter was coming for the Spurs fans. They then sang, \"Same old West Ham, taking the piss.\"</p><p>The Met made one arrest, that of a Spurs fan for allegedly using \"Yid\" in a chant. He was held on suspicion of committing a section 5 public order offence at half-time in the East stand. But it was Morrison, a former Manchester United player, who demanded the headlines.</p><p>\"It's the genius of Ravel Morrison, that is a genius goal for me and you will struggle to see a better goal this season,\" said Allardyce, the West Ham manager. \"He picks the ball up in his own half and heads directly to [Jan] Vertonghen and [Michael] Dawson and slips them two like they weren't there and waits for the goalkeeper to go down. It's a great day for us because in the second half we played extremely well.\"</p><p>Allardyce described how Sir Alex Ferguson, the former United manager, had told him that he would have a superstar player if he could iron out Morrison's indiscipline. The 20-year-old, who joined West Ham from United in January 2012, spent last season on loan at Birmingham. Allardyce said that Ferguson had felt Morrison had \"to get away from Manchester\", although he did not enlarge on the reasons for that.</p><p>Allardyce added: \"Ferguson said, 'I hope you can sort him out because, if you can, he'll be a genius. He's a brilliant footballer, he has top-class ability. He needs to get away from Manchester and start a new life.'</p><p>\"It looks like it's paid off for us. He [Ferguson] has let Ravel go for Ravel's benefit because he couldn't see it happening at Man United. It was: 'Get him down there and see if you can get the best out of himbecause you'll have a great player on your hands.'\"</p><p>\"As we say in the football fraternity, the penny has dropped with him. It has dropped in lifestyle and attitude and his time-keeping, and all of a sudden, there is a belief that he doesn't want to do anything other than break into our first-team. I think that 12-month spell at Birmingham gave him time to reflect on what it takes to be a player on a week-in-and-out basis.\"</p><p>The West Ham captain Kevin Nolan said: \"Ravel Morrison has been fantastic. Last year we had a lot of problems with him ... his lifestyle off the pitch, but he went to Birmingham and worked hard. You are now starting to see the player that Manchester United saw when he was younger.\"</p><p>Allardyce used a novel formation without strikers. \"The first thing you do is listen to the complaints [from the players] ... 'What's he trying to do again? Who has dreamed this one up?' It was a big risk but we practised it for three good days. I said to them it would give us the licence to play counter-attacking football. The fans at Tottenham thought it was going to be a nice, easy-breeze today but the Premier League will tell you that if you think like that, you are going to get your backside kicked. They got their backside kicked today.\"</p><p>André Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager, said: \"It's a wake-up call. We have to react but we can't let it undermine what we have been doing up to now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419197874|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e2a84c068fdd09ab1ede06d9fc707dca6a7c3543 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dario Franchitti has been hospitalised after a huge accident at the IndyCar Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. The accident, which also injured 14 spectators, comes nearly two years after fellow British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon was killed at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In both accidents the cars went airborne and into the catch fencing.</p><p>Franchitti's Ganassi car caught the back end of Takuma Sato at turn five on the final lap of the race and was sent upwards and slid along the fence before returning to the ground. Both cars scattered debris across the track, and the remaining competitors were forced to weave through the broken equipment under caution, as had been the case two years ago.</p><p>The driver, a three times winner of the Indianapolis 500, was removed from the car and taken to hospital where he has been examined and diagnosed as suffering from concussion, a fractured right ankle and a fractured vertebra. Franchitti will not require surgery, although he will be kept in hospital overnight.</p><p>With positions fixed at the moment of the accident, the race was won by Will Power, who had suffered a broken back in the crash at Las Vegas and admitted it was similar to that incident. \"I just saw Dario's car and him sitting in it with a lot of damage, and yes, that's what it reminded me of,\" Power said. \"I hate seeing that. We try to keep these cars on the ground.\"</p><p>Fellow driver Scott Dixon agreed. \"The smells and the visuals, for me, and even talking to Will, you have the remnants of Vegas popping into your head with you coming around the corner and you can't drive through it because there's a field of debris,\" he said.</p><p>IndyCar is likely to investigate the crash thoroughly since, in the wake of Wheldon's death, extensive efforts were made to reduce the chances of the cars leaving the track and hitting the catch fencing. Wheldon, a two-times Indianapolis 500 winner, had been testing safety features on the designs for the 2012 season before he was killed and when the new chassis was launched it was given the prefix DW in his honour.</p><p>The spectators were believed to have been injured by a piece of the catch fencing that was knocked loose into the nearby grandstand, rather than parts of the car itself.</p><p>A statement from the race promoters read: \"An IndyCar official and IndyCar driver, Dario Franchitti, along with two fans were transferred to an area hospital for evaluation. Eleven fans were additionally evaluated on site.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213562|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|353b02fd4f75a5baaf1a81df5d242d17fd5d94f9 -->",
