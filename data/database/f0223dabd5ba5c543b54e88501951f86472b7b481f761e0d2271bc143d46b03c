He and his sister Linda were brought up by their mother, Lily, in a building with no electricity and a single \"decrepit\" toilet for all inhabitants.

He added on Monday: \"People lived 16 in a house, but you were forced into a community, and [were] looking after people who couldn't look after themselves.\"</p><p>Johnson joins former Orwell
