        "body":"<p>The federal government&rsquo;s contentious plan to devolve power for environmental assessments has won enthusiastic backing from the Liberal-run states.</p> <p>Greg Hunt, the environment minister, wants to create &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; to assess the ecological impact of major projects such as coal mines and ports.</p> <p>Hunt said: &ldquo;I have spoken to ministers from all six states and have been heartened by their response but will leave each minister to speak for themselves.</p> <p>&ldquo;The government will work with each state across the country progressively to strike agreements to reach a national one-stop shop scheme.&rdquo;</p> <p>This system, which the government claims will &ldquo;slash red tape and increase jobs and investment&rdquo;, will be run by the states. Currently, major projects have to be approved by the states and the federal government, under its <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/%20\">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act </a>obligations.</p> <p>The Coalition said there should be one process for environmental assessments, with a single lodgment and documentation portal. Local government will also be encouraged to be involved in the process.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the government said it had approved the framework for the new regime, which will require agreement with the states. Federal staff will be sent to help states with the implementation of the new set-up.</p> <p>Memorandums of understanding will be signed with &ldquo;willing&rdquo; states. The government aims to then strike agreements on assessments within 12 months.</p> <p>Queensland has already signed a draft memorandum of understanding, while New South Wales is set to be the next to commit.</p> <p>Robyn Parker, the NSW environment minister, said: &ldquo;The NSW premier recently met with the prime minister to advance the development of the MOU to establish a one-stop-shop for environmental approvals.</p> <p>&ldquo;NSW is committed to addressing the issues of duplication and welcomes minister Hunt&rsquo;s release of the framework to streamline this process.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Victorian government said it was &ldquo;looking forward&rdquo; to discussing the new system with Hunt, while Western Australia is also enthusiastic. Albert Jacob, the state&rsquo;s environment minister, told Guardian Australia that he &ldquo;welcomed&rdquo; a plan that would &ldquo;streamline the current system which unnecessarily duplicates the rigorous approvals processes undertaken by the state.&rdquo;</p> <p>He added: &ldquo;We are committed to working with the commonwealth on cooperative efforts to strengthen intergovernmental cooperation on the environment and to minimise costs to business while maintaining high environmental standards.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Labor-run Tasmanian government said it supports streamlining &ldquo;cumbersome environment regulation&rdquo;, although South Australia, where Labor is also in power, is less enamored by the idea. A spokesman for the South Australian government told Guardian Australia that the state was &ldquo;seeking more information&rdquo; on the plan before committing to it.</p> <p>The Greens and conservation groups are highly critical of the plan to devolve powers, claiming that the states can&rsquo;t be trusted to safeguard the environment.</p> <p>&ldquo;Prime minister Abbott is pushing ahead with his destruction of federal environment protection to leave national icons like the Great Barrier Reef in the hands of his environmentally negligent state cronies,&rdquo; said Senator Larissa Waters, the Greens&rsquo; environment spokeswoman.</p> <p>&ldquo;Prime minister Abbott is set to go down in history as not only a climate criminal but an environmental vandal.</p> <p>&ldquo;The duplication argument that Mr Abbott and his big business buddies are pushing as justification for his environmental vandalism is a complete furphy.</p> <p>&ldquo;In all states and territories, governments have already established streamlined environmental assessment processes where one set of environmental assessment documents counts for both the state and federal levels.&rdquo;</p> <p>Business groups are more favourable towards the plan. Maria Tarrant, deputy chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, said the one-stop shops will provide certainty for projects.</p> <p>&ldquo;The government is to be commended for progressing this reform in a timely manner within a robust framework,&rdquo; she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420094283|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|c9336da05549109c2be77e3bd09442069e683ccd -->",
