        "body":"<p>A powerful group of MPs will investigate the Guardian's publication of stories about mass surveillance based on leaks by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, as part of a wider inquiry into counter-terrorism.</p><p>Keith Vaz, the Labour head of the Commons home affairs committee, said he would look into &quot;elements of the Guardian's involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks&quot; hours after the prime minister suggested a select committee might look at the issue.</p><p>It had emerged the matter would be considered by Vaz's parliamentary committee after former Tory cabinet minister Liam Fox asked him to investigate what damage the Guardian may have caused to national security.</p><p>&quot;I have received a letter from Liam Fox requesting that the home affairs select committee consider elements of the Guardian's involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks,&quot; Vaz said.</p><p>&quot;I will be writing to assure Dr Fox that the committee is currently conducting an inquiry into counter-terrorism and we will be looking at this matter as part of it.&quot;</p><p>A spokesman for Vaz could not confirm whether Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian editor-in-chief, would be called to give evidence, saying this would be a matter for all committee members to decide.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-420173332\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video><p>Earlier in the day, Fox asked David Cameron for a &quot;full and transparent assessment about the Guardian involvement in the Snowden affair&quot; at prime minister's question time in the House of Commons.</p><p>The Conservative former defence secretary had argued that the Guardian had been guilty of double standards for exposing the scandal of phone hacking by newspapers and yet had gone on to publish secrets from the US National Security Agency taken by Snowden.</p><p>In response, Cameron encouraged investigation of the issues through parliamentary select committees. &quot;The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files,&quot; he told MPs.</p><p>&quot;So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.&quot;</p><p>The prime minister's spokesman refused to elaborate on what Cameron meant by the issue of the Guardian disclosures being examined by a select committee.</p><p>There are as many as four committees that might take up David Cameron's suggestion, including the culture select committee, the home affairs select committee, the defence select committee and the intelligence and security select committee.</p><p>The ISC largely meets in private but is due soon to meet the leaders of the spy agencies in public and it is certain that the issues raised by the Guardian, including the impact on national security, will be discussed.</p><p>Cameron did not directly respond to calls for the police to prosecute by the backbench Tory MP Julian Smith, who has secured a debate on the issue in Westminster Hall on Tuesday next week.</p><p>Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat MP and Tom Watson, a Labour MP who campaigned against phone hacking, are also planning to request a debate in the House of Commons on greater regulatory oversight of the security services.</p><p>A Guardian spokesman said: &quot;The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging. We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p>&quot;That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded - along with the Guardian - for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a Presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182545|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5ff4ed20317a7ee35dfc0f80315b09bed88b65c6 -->",

        "body":"<p>In August, the editor of the Guardian rang me up and asked if I would spend a week in New York, reading the GCHQ files whose UK copy the Guardian was forced to destroy. His suggestion was that it might be worthwhile to look at the material not from a perspective of making news but from that of a novelist with an interest in the way we live now.</p><p>I took Alan Rusbridger up on his invitation, after an initial reluctance that was based on two main reasons. The first of them was that I don't share the instinctive sense felt by many on the left that it is always wrong for states to have secrets. I'd put it more strongly than that: democratic states need spies.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099042'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801639/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: reading illustration' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The philosopher Karl Popper, observing the second world war from his academic post in New Zealand, came up with a great title for his major work of political thought: The Open Society and Its Enemies. It is, in its way, a shocking phrase – why would the open society have enemies? (But then, the title of Charles Repington's The First World War, published in 1920, was shocking too, because it implied that there would be another one.)</p><p>We do have enemies, though, enemies who are in deadly earnest; enemies who wish you reading this dead, whoever you are, for no other reason than that you belong to a society like this one. We have enemies who are seeking to break into our governments' computers, with the potential to destroy our infrastructure and, literally, make the lights go out; we have enemies who want to kill as many of us, the more innocent the better, as possible, by any means possible, as a deliberate strategy; we have enemies who want to develop nuclear weapons, and thereby vastly raise the stakes for international diplomacy and the threat of terrorism; and we have common-or-garden serious criminals, who also need watching and catching.</p><p>I get all that. It doesn't thrill me to bits that the state has to use the tools of electronic surveillance to keep us safe, but it seems clear to me that it does, and that our right to privacy needs to be qualified, just as our other rights are qualified, in the interest of general security and the common good.<a name=\"reassuringread\"></a></p><p> &nbsp; </p><h2>Reassuring read</h2><p>My week spent reading things that were never meant to be read by outsiders was, from this point of view, largely reassuring. Most of what GCHQ does is exactly the kind of thing we all want it to do. It takes an interest in places such as the Horn of Africa, Iran, and North Korea; it takes an interest in energy security, nuclear proliferation, and in state-sponsored computer hacking.</p><p>There doesn't seem to be much in the documents about serious crime, for which GCHQ has a surveillance mandate, but it seems that much of this activity is covered by warrants that belong to other branches of the security apparatus. Most of this surveillance is individually targeted: it concerns specific individuals and specific acts (or intentions to act), and as such, it is not the threat.</p><p>Even Julian Assange thinks that, and said as much in his alarming and perceptive book Cypherpunks: \"Individual targeting is not the threat.\" When the state has specific enemies and knows who they are and the kind of harm they intend, it is welcome to target them to make the rest of our polity safe. I say again, on the evidence I've seen, this is mainly what GCHQ does. I would add that the Guardian and its partners have gone to a lot of trouble to prevent any unnecessarily damaging detail about this work being published.<a name=\"problemsandrisks\"></a></p><h2>Problems and risks</h2><p>The problems with GCHQ are to be found in the margins of the material – though they are at the centre of the revelations that have been extracted from the Snowden disclosures, and with good reason. The problem and the risk comes in the area of mass capture of data, or strategic surveillance. This is the kind of intelligence gathering that sucks in data from everyone, everywhere: from phones, internet use from email to website visits, social networking, instant messaging and video calls, and even areas such as video gaming; in short, everything digital.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099043'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802093/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: magnifying glass' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In the US, the Prism programme may have given the NSA access to the servers of companies such as Google and Facebook; in the UK, GCHQ has gained a similar degree of access via its Tempora programme, and the two of them together have a cable- and network-tapping capabilities collectively called Upstream, which have the ability to intercept anything that travels over the internet. This data is fed into a database called XKeyscore, which allows analysts to extract information \"in real time\", ie immediately, from a gigantic amount of hoovered-up data.</p><p>In addition, the NSA has encouraged technology companies to install secret weaknesses or \"backdoors\" into their commercially available, supposedly secure products. They have spent a very great deal of money ($250m a year alone on weakening encryption), on breaking commercially available security products. Other revelations have been published in Der Spiegel, and concern the NSA exploitation of technology such as the iPhone.<a name=\"accessallareas\"></a></p><h2>Access all areas</h2><p>What this adds up to is a new thing in human history: with a couple of clicks of a mouse, an agent of the state can target your home phone, or your mobile, or your email, or your passport number, or any of your credit card numbers, or your address, or any of your log-ins to a web service.</p><p>Using that \"selector\", the state can get access to all the content of your communications, via any of those channels; can gather information about anyone you communicate with, can get a full picture of all your internet use, can track your location online and offline. It can, in essence, know everything about you, including – thanks to the ability to look at your internet searches – what's on your mind.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099044'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820803133/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: people reading' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>To get a rough version of this knowledge, a state once had to bug phones manually, break into houses and intercept letters, and deploy teams of trained watchers to follow your whereabouts. Even then it was a rough and approximate process, vulnerable to all sorts of human error and countermeasures. It can now have something much better than that, a historically unprecedented panoply of surveillance, which it can deploy in a matter of seconds.</p><p>This process is not without supervision, of course. In order to target you via one of these \"selectors\" – that's the technical term – the agent of the state will have to type into a box on his or her computer screen a Miranda number, to show that the process is taking place in response to a specific request for information, and will also need to select a justification under the Human Rights Act. That last isn't too arduous, because the agent can choose the justification from a drop-down menu. This is the way we live now.<a name=\"britishreaction\"></a></p><h2>British reaction</h2><p>And yet nobody, at least in Britain, seems to care. In the UK there has been an extraordinary disconnect between the scale and seriousness of what Snowden has revealed, and the scale and seriousness of the response. One of the main reasons for that, I think, is that while some countries are interested in rights, in Britain we are more focused on wrongs.</p><p>In Europe and the US, the lines between the citizen and the state are based on an abstract conception of the individual's rights, which is then framed in terms of what the state needs to do.</p><p>That's not the case in Britain: although we do have rights, they were arrived at by specific malfeasances and disasters on the part of the state.</p><p>Every right that limits the behaviour of the police, from the need for search warrants to the (now heavily qualified) right to silence to habeas corpus itself, comes from the fact that the authorities abused their powers.</p><p>This helps to explain why Snowden's revelations, perceived as explosive in American and Europe by both the political right and left, have been greeted here with a weirdly echoing non-response. In the rights-based tradition, the flagrant abuse of individual privacy is self-evidently a bad thing, a (literally) warrantless extension of the power of the state.</p><p>Here in the UK, because we've been given no specific instances of specific wrongs having been committed, the story has found it hard to gain traction. Even if there were such instances – just as there were 2,776 rule violations by the NSA last year alone – we wouldn't know anything about them, because the system of judicial inspections at GCHQ is secret.</p><p>So it is a perfectly sealed mechanism: we aren't interested in rights in the abstract, and we are prevented by law from hearing about any of the specific abuses which might start to focus our attention.</p><p>The documents make clear that GCHQ's eavesdropping abilities are on a scale unmatched anywhere in the free world, and they privately boast about the \"more permissive legal environment\" in the UK – and yet, nobody seems to care. It's tragicomic that the surveillance story which most gripped the public imagination concerned Poole borough council's use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa) to spy on a family suspected of cheating in regard to school catchment areas.<a name=\"helpingthebadguys\"></a></p><h2>Helping the bad guys</h2><p>It's worth taking a moment to ask how helpful the publication of information about this is to the bad guys. (Girls too. But mainly guys.)</p><p>The answer is evident, I think, in the under-remarked fact that Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad didn't even have a telephone line running into it. In other words he not only didn't use the net, computers or phones in any way at all, ever, he was suspicious of the actual physical apparatus itself.</p><p>This means that the bad guys know very well that they have to be careful. (It should also be noted that the absence of any electronic footprint at the Abbottabad compound was – as depicted in the movie Zero Dark Thirty – a sign to the spies that something fishy was afoot. Nobody innocent has no electronic footprint.)</p><p>Some of the jihadi materials I read in the GCHQ documents make it clear that the terrorists are very well aware of these issues. There is a stinging jeer in one jihadi text, apropos a Swedish documentary that made clear certain bugging capabilities in Ericsson's mobile phones: \"It is customary in the Scandinavian countries to publish such helpful materials.\"</p><p>While the broad details of general strategic surveillance are shocking and need to be known, the thing that would be helpful to the bad guys is the publication of the specific technical details. These the Guardian and its partners have gone to great lengths to keep secret.<a name=\"theunkeepablesecret\"></a></p><h2>The unkeepable secret</h2><p>Bear in mind also that these documents were widely circulated: out of the 4.9 million Americans with access to classified information, 480,000 private contractors in the US had the \"top-secret\" security clearance issued to Snowden.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099045'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820803417/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: man on roof' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If hundreds of thousands of people had access to these secrets, how secure were they? The NSA and GCHQ had no idea that Snowden had this material, and apparently still don't know exactly what is in it – which is one reason they've been panicking and freaking out.</p><p>But if they didn't know that Snowden had copied it, how could they possibly be sure that someone else hasn't also taken a copy and slipped it to the Chinese or Russians or Iranians or al-Qaida? It was cheeky of Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser in the Cabinet Office, to harrumph about \"very poor information security practices\" on the part of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald who was detained at Heathrow under anti-terror laws.</p><p>Our spooks lost at least 58,000 pages of classified documents to a US civilian sitting at a workstation in Hawaii, and did so without realising it had happened. In effect they're saying, \"your secrets are safe with us, except when we lose them\".</p><p>There's one further conclusion to draw from the fact that so many people had access to this material. It means that this story would at some point have come out. A programme of this scale in a modern democracy, involving hundreds of thousands of people with access to the fact of total internet surveillance, was an unkeepable secret. It may be no comfort to Snowden as he faces his future, but someone somewhere would eventually have done what he did. Some dams are fated to burst.<a name=\"what'snew\"></a></p><h2>What's new</h2><p>This brings me to my second reservation about looking at the material: the question of whether it contained anything that we didn't already know. In the Tony Scott movie Enemy of the State, the paranoid former NSA spook played by Gene Hackman lays it out with complete clarity: \"The government's been in bed with the entire communications business since the 40s,\" he says. \"They have infected everything. They can get into your bank statement, computer files, email, listen to your phone calls.\"</p><p>That movie came out in 1998, and was a hit, seen by many millions, so even then, in some sense, everybody knew about the work of the NSA/GCHQ. People who kept informed on these subjects have for decades been careful about using specific words over the phone, especially over transatlantic phonelines.</p><p>I remember Christopher Hitchens, at the time that concern about Salman Rushdie's welfare was at its peak, wouldn't use his name over the phone but would instead refer to \"our mutual friend\".</p><p>So in some sense, perhaps it's true that everybody knew. This would be analogous to the manner in which we all know surveillance is pervasive in police work, and yet police methods are by law forbidden from being used in evidence, or indeed even mentioned in court. The ban on mentioning police surveillance is there because they don't want us to realise how much of it there is. We all know that, and yet it doesn't seem to matter much. Perhaps the GCHQ stuff was the same?</p><p>I've changed my mind about that. It was changing anyway as I thought more about the meaning of Snowden's exposures, and it has changed more still now that I've looked at them first-hand.<a name=\"broaddefinitions\"></a></p><h2>Broad definitions</h2><p>I've said that the concerns over GCHQ are at the margins of what it does: but those margins are very broad. They especially concern things that are referred to in the documents as \"SD\", which means \"sigint development\". \"Sigint\" is signal intelligence, which is what GCHQ does. \"Development\" means – well, that's the crux of it. It means finding out new things, exploring new technologies, and developing new ways of finding \"targets\".</p><p>When you look at the documents, it appears to be the case that SD provides the legal basis for mass surveillance of the kind revealed in the Tempora and Prism programmes. The mandate of GCHQ – which by the way didn't have a legal basis of any kind until 1994 – is surveillance for reasons of \"national security, economic well being, and serious crime\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099046'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801498/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: socket illustration\nLanchester NSA illustration: imagine spying through electrical sockets' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;\n</figcaption></figure><p>The main law concerning its activities is Ripa. If you read this 2000 act (which, by the way, I don't recommend, since it's tortured and laborious even by the standards of statute-speak), it's clear that the main focus of its provisions is targeted surveillance. It's about what the spies and cops are allowed to do to catch specific bad guys.</p><p>Ripa is pretty broad in its drafting, and it seems apparent that the intention was to let the authorities do anything they wanted with phones and email. And yet, it nowhere explicitly allows the mass interception of communications by people about whom the state has no reason for suspecting anything – which is what programmes such as Tempora and Prism permit.<a name=\"behindthetimes\"></a></p><h2>Behind the times</h2><p>The law always lags behind technology, that's inevitable. If you look at the first version of the modern Official Secrets Act, which was made law in 1911 and is still the main broad statement of government secrecy in effect today, its first provisions concern the making of \"maps and charts\".</p><p>It is evident that the kind of spying on the lawmakers' minds concerns a chap in plus-fours claiming that he's making drawings of seabirds, only why has he accidentally made accurate sketches of that nearby naval base, and why does he have a heavy German accent … ?</p><p>The current spying laws continue to lag behind reality, not only because the spies are less concerned with mysterious birdwatchers, but because life itself has changed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099047'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801773/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.gif' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: CCTV illustration' width='460' height='440' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Formerly, the activities for which the spies were on guard were visible acts of wrongdoing and intelligence-gathering: enemies making maps of naval bases, or breaking into offices, or bribing civil servants, or seducing and blackmailing other spies, or any of the other ways in which they could try to steal secrets.</p><p>In the case of modern signals intelligence, this is no longer true. Life has changed. It has changed because of the centrality of computers and digital activity to every aspect of modern living. Digital life is central to work: many of us, perhaps most of us, spend most of our working day using a computer. Digital life is central to our leisure: a huge portion of our discretionary activity has a digital component, even things which look like they are irreducibly un-digital, from cycling to cooking.</p><p>(I once happened to visit Google's offices in Victoria, where there's a live stream of people's queries on a huge flat screen. Most of them were in Japanese. My host, who speaks Japanese, glanced at them and looked at her watch. \"Recipes,\" she said. \"It's 7pm in Japan, people have just got in from work and are thinking about what to cook.\")</p><p>As for our relationships and family lives, that has, especially for younger people, become a digital-first activity. Take away Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging and Skype and YouTube, and then – it's hard to imagine, but try – take away the mobile phone, and see the yawning gap where all human interaction used to take place. About the only time we don't use computers is when we're asleep – that's unless we have a gadget that tracks our sleep, or monitors our house temperature, or our burglar alarm, or whatever.</p><p>This is the central point about what our spies and security services can now do. They can, for the first time, monitor everything about us, and they can do so with a few clicks of a mouse and – to placate the lawyers – a drop-down menu of justifications.<a name=\"surveillanceambitions\"></a></p><h2>Surveillance ambitions</h2><p>Looking at the GCHQ papers, it is clear that there is an ambition to get access to everything digital. That's what engineers do: they seek new capabilities. When it applies to the people who wish us harm, that's fair enough. Take a hypothetical, but maybe not unthinkable, ability to eavesdrop on any room via an electrical socket. From the GCHQ engineers' point of view, they would do that if they could. And there are a few people out there on whom it would be useful to be able to eavesdrop via an electrical socket. But the price of doing so would be a society that really did have total surveillance. Would it be worth it? Is the risk worth the intrusion?</p><p>That example might sound far-fetched, but trust me, it isn't quite as far fetched as all that, and the basic intention on the part of the GCHQ engineers – to get everything – is there.</p><p>Consider the direction in which we're moving. Britain has more CCTV cameras than anywhere else in the world, by a huge margin. Nobody knows how many CCTV cameras there are in the country, but the most respectable estimate seems to be the one made by Cheshire police in 2011, which came up with a number of 1.85m. Add to this the capacity for facial recognition software, which already exists and is improving sharply.</p><p>Further add the capacity for surveillance brought by the \"internet of things\", involving the inclusion of internet-enabled computer chips in everything from cars (where they already are, in high-end models) to fridges to plants (which will tweet their minders when they need to be watered). This might sound like science fiction, but the current estimate is that there will be 20bn such devices in use worldwide by 2020.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099048'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820801934/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: keyhole' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Add to this the fact that a lot of this electronic potential gives access not just to external real-world data – our locations, our conversations, our contacts books – but to the inside of our heads. I call this the \"knowing you're gay\" test. Most of us know someone who has plucked up the courage to reveal their homosexuality, only to be cheerfully told by friends and family, \"oh, we've known that for years\".</p><p>Now, though, search engines know facts about people's thoughts and fantasies long before anyone else does. To put it crudely, Google doesn't just know you're gay before you tell your mum; it knows you're gay before you do. And now GCHQ does too.<a name=\"newsociety\"></a></p><h2>New society</h2><p>What this means is that we're moving towards a new kind of society. Britain is already the most spied on, monitored and surveilled democratic society there has ever been. This doesn't seem to have been discussed or debated, and I don't remember ever being asked to vote for it. As for how this trend appears in the GCHQ documents, there is something of a gap between how the spies talk in public and how they can occasionally be found to talk in private.</p><p>It is startling to see, for instance, that the justification for the large-scale interception of everybody's internet use seems to be a clause in Ripa allowing interception of \"at least one end foreign\" communications. Whack on to this a general purpose certificate from the secretary of state, and a general warrant, and bingo, this allows full access to traffic via companies such as Google and Facebook – because their servers are located overseas. I can't believe that that was the intention of the people who drafted Ripa, who were surely thinking more of people taking phone calls from moody bits of Waziristan, rather than your nan searching for cheaper tights.</p><p>There is a revealing moment in the most recent piece written for the Guardian by Sir David Omand, former head of GCHQ. He said that \"the real debate we should be having … is about what privacy in a cyber-connected world can realistically mean given the volumes of data we hand over to the private sector in return for our everyday convenience, and the continued need for warranted access for security and law enforcement\".</p><p>That's a total non-sequitur: Omand seems to think that just because we hand data over to Google and Facebook the government automatically has the right to access it. It's as if, thanks to a global shortage of sticky gum, envelopes can no longer be sealed, so as a result the government awards itself a new right to mass-intercept and read everybody's letters.<a name=\"stayingwithinthelaw\"></a></p><h2>Staying within the law</h2><p>All through the GCHQ material there is a tremendous emphasis on the legal basis of its operations, particularly in respect of article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which grants: \"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\"</p><p>It is repeatedly stated that \"GCHQ operates within the law\" and that \"GCHQ does it legally\" and that surveillance always has to be \"justified, necessary and proportionate\". Good – it would be terrifying if that weren't the case. But if GCHQ seldom breaks the law, it's because the law is so broadly drafted and interpreted it's almost impossible to break.</p><p>Also, in the GCHQ papers there are occasional glimpses of a different attitude, usually to be found in slides which are marked as \"hidden\" in PowerPoint presentations, or in the presenters' notes to other slides. (Many of the clearest documents are internal GCHQ briefings laid out in the form of PowerPoint talks. I was reminded of Malcolm Gladwell's great joke, in response to whether he needed audio-visual aids for a lecture: \"All power corrupts, but PowerPoint corrupts absolutely.\")</p><p>For instance, a legal briefing on the Human Rights Act lists the instances in which it is legal for the state to breach article 8: \"In the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"</p><p>The notes make the point that national security, public safety and serious crime are the three current reasons for which GCHQ is allowed to eavesdrop, but there is a chilling addition: \"'Just' 3 at the moment. No reason why GCHQ's remit would not be changed in the future but this is what we are allowed to do at the moment.\"</p><p>It's usually only in books that people's blood runs cold, but mine did when I read that. \"Just\" three at the moment: in other words, there are \"just\" three reasons why GCHQ can violate article 8, the right to privacy. But that could change. It would be legal in human rights terms for GCHQ's mandate to cover \"the prevention of disorder\", not to mention \"the protection of health or morals\".<a name=\"extendingstatepower\"></a></p><h2>Extending state power</h2><p>The totalitarian state in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four would need no broader legal justification than that: it really does allow a government to do anything it likes. It was at this point that I became convinced that Snowden's revelations are not just interesting or important but vital, because the state is about to get powers that no state has ever had, and we need to have a public debate about those powers and what their limits are to be.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099049'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802981/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: ' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>At a moment of austerity and with a general sense that our state's ability to guarantee prosperity for its citizens is in retreat, that same state is about to make the biggest advance ever in its security powers. In public, the state is shrinking; in private, it is shrinking until it gets just small enough to fit into our phones, our computers, our cars, our fridges, our bedrooms, our thoughts and intentions.</p><p>Another secret slide is headed SRA – a mysterious acronym that is not explained. The slide concerns 2P intelligence, 2P meaning second party, ie other countries in the \"five eyes\" alliance of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It says that an SRA, whatever it is, \"authorises receipt of 2P intelligence on UK based targets where GCHQ has no authorisation\".</p><p>Since GCHQ can spy on any foreign national it wants, this can only mean the surveillance of people on whom it isn't legal for GCHQ to spy. That looks to me an awful lot like a means of obtaining permission to spy on people – British citizens? – outside the law.</p><p>We've heard a lot of talk about the distinction between content and metadata – content being the stuff inside communications, metadata the who and when and where and how of the communication, but not the content. The idea is that the spooks focus on the metadata and ignore the content – so they notice your nan logging on to the net, where and when and for how long, but don't read the actual content of the search.</p><p>This distinction is written into the law in both the US and the UK. This would be reassuring, if the notes didn't say this: \"GCHQ policy is to treat it pretty much all the same whether it's content or metadata.\" Put all these together and it is no wonder the documents contain a boast about the UK's \"more permissive legal environment\".<a name=\"A new panopticon\"></a></p><h2>A new panopticon</h2><p>The prospect this presents is something like the \"panopticon\" which Enlightenment philosophers advocated as a design for the ideal prison in the 18th century, and about which the French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote in his book Discipline and Punish. \"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relations in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.\"</p><p>When I first read Foucault's account of the panopticon, where the individual at the centre can simultaneously see and judge a whole multitude of other individuals, I thought it was brilliant but overheated. Now, it actually seems like somebody's plan. That's what we risk becoming: a society which is in crucial respects a giant panopticon, where the people with access to our secrets can see, hear, intercept and monitor everything.</p><p>Members of the security establishment always want more abilities, more tools, more powers for themselves and fewer rights for us. They never say \"thanks a lot, we're good from here, we have everything we need\".<a name=\"publicenemies\"></a></p><h2>Public enemies</h2><p>From their point of view – the point of view of wanting ever more invasive secret powers – al-Qaida and its affiliates are the perfect enemy. Because al-Qaida combines the characteristics of an ideology and a network, it is everywhere, it is invisible, it is never more dangerous than when you can't see it.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099050'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802370/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: person arrested' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The new emphasis on anticipating the actions of \"lone wolf\" terrorists raises this danger even higher: the risk of terrorism from people who have never been caught committing a crime, who have no known terrorist affiliations, who are invisible, who could be anywhere … It is the ultimate version of the scare story that used to be called \"reds under the bed\". How can the state every hope to protect us against people like that, if not by permanent, omnipresent, ever-increasing surveillance?</p><p>If we are going to remake society in the image of the fight against terrorism, and put that secret fight at the heart of our democratic order – which is the way we're heading – we need to discuss it, and in public.<a name=\"exaggeratedrisks\"></a></p><h2>Exaggerated risks</h2><p>When we do so, it might be helpful to consider something called the banana equivalent dose (BED). This is a term used in physics to measure the amount of radiation emitted by a banana. It is a number popular with people who think the dangers of radiation are exaggerated, and who use it to make the point that almost everything is radioactive. A dental x-ray has a BED of 50; serious radiation poisoning takes a BED of 20m; sleeping next to someone for one night has a BED of 0.5 and living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant for a year has a BED of 0.9.</p><p>Since 9/11, 53 people have been killed by terrorists in the UK. Every one of those deaths is tragic. So is every one of the 26,805 deaths to have occurred on Britain's roads between 2002 and 2012 inclusive, an average of 6.67 deaths a day. Let's call that the SDRD, standard daily road deaths. The terrorist toll for 12 years comes to 0.0121 SDRD. This means that 12 years of terrorism has killed as many people in the UK as eight days on our roads.</p><p>The security establishment will immediately reply that this figure leaves out deaths of terrorism victims abroad and the lives saved by its secret actions, none of which can be made known without jeopardising current and future operations.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099051'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380820802227/LanchesterreadsSnowdenfiles.jpg' alt='Lanchester reads Snowden files: person walking' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Is that enough of a justification for the scale and extent of what is happening to our privacy? Is the current supervisory regime – which involves senior judges inspecting GCHQ's actions, \"within the circle of secrecy\", and issuing a secret report – adequate to the scale of the state's powers?</p><p>I'd repeat the point that as digital technology, and the ability to enact surveillance through technology, expands its remit, those powers are increasing almost by the day.</p><p>In the UK we have a strange sleepy indifference to questions of surveillance and privacy. \"The innocent have nothing to fear,\" says William Hague. But who gets to define who is innocent? Who gets to say what is contradictory to the \"economic wellbeing\" of the UK? If the innocent have nothing to fear, why is the state reading so many of our emails, and sucking up so much metadata from our phones and computers, under the umbrella of \"sigint development\"?<a name=\"policestate\"></a></p><h2>Police state</h2><p>People misunderstand what a police state is. It isn't a country where the police strut around in jackboots; it's a country where the police can do anything they like. Similarly, a security state is one in which the security establishment can do anything it likes.</p><p>We are right on the verge of being an entirely new kind of human society, one involving an unprecedented penetration by the state into areas which have always been regarded as private. Do we agree to that? If we don't, this is the last chance to stop it happening. Our rulers will say what all rulers everywhere have always said: that their intentions are good, and we can trust them. They want that to be a sufficient guarantee.<a name=\"myproposals\"></a></p><h2>My proposals</h2><p>There's no need for us to advance any further down this dark road. Here are two specific proposals. The first is that the commissioners who supervise GCHQ include, alongside the senior judges who currently do the work, at least one or two public figures who are publicly known for their advocacy of human rights and government openness. The \"circle of secrecy\" needs to include some people who are known for not being all that keen on the idea of secrecy.</p><p>My second proposal is for a digital bill of rights. The most important proviso on the bill would be that digital surveillance must meet the same degree of explicit targeting as that used in interception of mail and landlines. No more \"one end overseas\" and \"sigint development\" loopholes to allow the mass interception of communications. There can be no default assumption that the state is allowed access to our digital life.</p><p>As the second most senior judge in the country, Lord Hoffmann, said in 2004 about a previous version of our anti-terrorism laws: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws like these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">Follow all the latest developments on the NSA from the Guardian</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418980635|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ccc59e2f396f6caad79c727d730ea66f4915db52 -->",

        "headline":"MI5 chief's criticism of Snowden and the Guardian is hardly unexpected",
        "body":"<p>Sir Andrew Parker made an important speech on Tuesday night. In his first public appearance since he took over as head of MI5, he set out the challenges facing the service, the limitations of what it can do, and the dangers it faces.</p><p>Prominent among them were the potential damage being done by a man he did not name, whose files had provided stories for a media organisation he did not mention.</p><p>You didn't have to be a cryptographer at GCHQ, whose proxy he was on Tuesday night, to know his targets were Edward Snowden and the Guardian.</p><p>As head of the domestic secret service, Parker's opinion is significant. But as a 30-year veteran of MI5, Parker is unlikely to consider himself the high priest of objectivity in any debate about surveillance and privacy.</p><p>He said as much on Tuesday. \"Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret,\" he told his audience. \"And why not doing so causes such harm.\"</p><p>Parker's position – which is understandable given where he works and what he does – is that the public doesn't have a right to know anything that MI5 deems sensitive.</p><p>And it certainly doesn't have a need to know about the scope and scale of the surveillance programmes revealed by Snowden. In this respect, Parker is more old school than the old school.</p><p>But this is not the only opinion circulating among the intelligence community. In recent days, a former head of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, acknowledged her old agency needed to be more transparent.</p><p>A former head of America's National Security Agency, General Michael Hayden, said much the same thing. Last week he told an audience in London: \"It's clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don't get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support. And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable.\"</p><p>At the moment, there isn't enough out there.</p><p>The indignation of the intelligence agencies about Snowden's leaks are being increasingly accompanied by two charges. The first is that the revelations have made it easier for terrorists; and the second is that the files are now in the hands of foreign intelligence services.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Parker set out his fear, but in a way that presented it as fact: \"Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will.\"</p><p>Parker did not present any evidence to support this. He can't.</p><p>And those who doubt the claim cannot disprove it either.</p><p>But there are voices who doubt the extent of the \"gift\" Parker describes. Three weeks ago, Nigel Inkster, former deputy chief of MI6, played down the potential damage. \"I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred,\" he said.</p><p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times,  security specialist Bruce Schneier said: \"The argument that exposing these documents helps the terrorists doesn't even pass the laugh test; there's nothing here that changes anything any potential terrorist would do or not do.\"</p><p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">New York Times reported</a> Snowden's disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak.</p><p>Apparently, there has been a \"sharp drop in terrorists' use of a major communications channel\" after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East.</p><p>Nevertheless, even these opinions, and the story, don't prove anything either.</p><p>Parker's view counts, but he also knows the arguments about the damage that has been done are circular and unresolvable.</p><p>And the same can be said for the assertion that foreign intelligence agencies are now in possession of the documents Snowden took when he was working inside the NSA.</p><p>Perhaps the Russians and the Chinese do now have the files. But if they have obtained them, they have managed a feat that has so far eluded the combined efforts of the British and American intelligence communities.</p><p>Four months after this saga started, they still don't know how many files Snowden took. Whether he is regarded as a whistleblower, a traitor, a self-serving twerp – as Rimington described him – or a hero, Snowden knew about encryption, and he knew how to keep things safe.</p><p>Those people who believe the public does have a right to know about British and American surveillance programmes might feel more sympathetic to Parker if the scrutiny and oversight regimes had more muscle than they do now. But Parker made clear on Tuesday night he was happy with the current arrangements. He believes the intelligence and security committee (ISC) has enough powers to do its job.</p><p>The chair of the ISC, the former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, seems to agree. Which must make him the only chair of a parliamentary scrutiny committee not asking for even more tools to do his job.</p><p>Yet Rimington acknowledged that this status quo had to be changed. She <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3883536.ece\" title=\"\">told the Times last week</a>: \"It is very important for our intelligence services to have the kind of oversight that people can have confidence in, so that we can be quite sure that in giving them these powers we know that they are being supervised and scrutinised in the way they use them. And I think that may mean that now is the time to look again at the oversight of our intelligence services.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419472201|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a21326938b04dbff30e02d645d599cec44b2012b -->",

        "headline":"Five key claims from MI5 chief's defence of GCHQ surveillance analysed",
        "body":"<p><strong>On Tuesday the head of MI5 Andrew Parker </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\"><strong>gave a speech</strong></a><strong> in which he mounted a robust defence of GCHQ and its surveillance methods. Though he didn't name Edward Snowden or the Guardian by name, he explicitly criticised recent leaks from the whistleblower. Here are the key extracts from the speech – along with the Guardian's analysis and context:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong><em>\"We only apply intrusive tools and capabilities against terrorists and others threatening national security. The law requires we only collect and access information that we really need to perform our functions, in this case tackling the threat of terrorism.\"</em></p><p>It is true that if MI5 wants to target an individual, or a group, then it has to seek a warrant from the home secretary. But what Snowden revealed is something quite different. In Tempora, GCHQ has a programme that is capable of sucking up vast amounts of personal data from the undersea cables that carry internet traffic in and out of the UK. That is not a narrow targeting capability. It gives the agency access to the private communications of millions of people.</p><p>This is allowed under a little known section of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), which was brought in 13 years ago, long before Tempora was devised. GCHQ has relied on paragraph four of section 8 &nbsp;to gain \"external warrants\". In most Ripa cases, a minister has to be told the name of an individual or company being targeted before a warrant is granted. But section 8 permits GCHQ to perform sweeping and indiscriminate trawls of external data if a minister issues a certificate along with the warrant.</p><p>According to the Snowden documents, the certificate allows GCHQ to search for material under a number of themes, including intelligence on the political intentions of foreign governments; military postures of foreign countries; terrorism, international drug trafficking and fraud. One briefing notes says such sweeping certificates \"cover the entire range of GCHQ's intelligence production\".</p><p>The raw material is then recycled through machine-reading programmes which look for key words, names, phrases and patterns.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <em>\"In some quarters there seems to be a vague notion that we monitor everyone and all their communications … utter nonsense.\"</em></p><p>Nobody has ever claimed this is happening. But by exaggerating the point, Parker swerves around another truth – that the UK's intelligence agencies are already scooping up more material than ever before, and GCHQ has an ambition to go further.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">Documents seen by the Guardian</a> described how the agency is seeking to \"exploit any phone, anywhere, any time\". Tempora already gives GCHQ the capacity to collect more than 21 petabytes of data a day – equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours. In 2011, 350 British analysts and 200 from the NSA were sifting through the Tempora database.</p><p>In the US, Snowden's files have disclosed how the simple \"metadata\" of every single call made within America is available to the intelligence services. It is not known whether Britain has the same capability. The intelligence agencies argue these tools are essential for tracking down terrorists. Privacy campaigners insist the scope and reach of these programmes goes beyond the reach of a set of outdated laws, and that the agencies are acting without a public mandate.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><em>\"It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will.\"</em></p><p>This was the key soundbite of the speech – and it was provocative. But Parker did not provide any details to support the claim, nor can he. His view is the leaks have damaged national security, but the former director of operations and intelligence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/mi6-plays-down-damage-edward-snowden-leaks\" title=\"\">MI6, Nigel Inkster,</a> has been more sceptical. \"I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/06/11/in-nsa-leak-case-a-whistle-blower-or-a-criminal/before-prosecuting-snowden-investigate-the-government\" title=\"\">In an opinion piece for the New York Times</a>, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said the argument about compromising national security \"doesn't even pass the laugh test\".</p><p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">the New York Times reported</a> Snowden's disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak. Apparently, there has been a \"sharp drop in terrorists' use of a major communications channel\" after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <em>\"Successive governments have made careful decisions about both the scale and powers of organisations like MI5, proportionate to the threats, and have gone no further. Britain is a democracy that rightly prizes the freedom of the individual.\"</em></p><p>The three principal laws that set out the parameters for the intelligence agencies are the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act, and Ripa 2000. None of them could possibly have anticipated the technological advances that have been made in surveillance capabilities over the last few years. The former chair of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/26/uk-surveillance-laws-need-overhaul\" title=\"\">has said it is high time these laws are reviewed and updated</a>. The former director of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have also questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><p>None of them think the agencies have anything to fear by being a little more open and transparent. On Monday, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6, David Bickford, added his weight to the calls for change, saying the intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because of public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <em>\"Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.\"</em></p><p>Parker is upset about Snowden, but this is probably a veiled dig at the government too. The agencies have been frustrated that reporting of the Snowden files could not be shut down completely. For them, there is no public interest in revealing the scale of the programmes being undertaken.</p><p>Tuesday night's speech was the result of months of pent up frustration, and it glossed over the fact the Guardian changed significant details in some of the stories at the request of officials from the Cabinet Office. The number of people \"in the know\" about Britain's surveillance capabilities seems to be very small indeed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">Earlier this week the former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne said the Cabinet were kept in the dark</a>. The National Security Council wasn't told either.</p><p>Parker said MI5 could not stop every plot and neutralise every threat – which is true. But he has to be careful not to develop a narrative in which he is seen to be preemptively blaming whistleblowers for any future attacks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419511881|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ae0a03041c1ef4dd2ccfa0a1b9d2785b34d5e823 -->",

        "headline":"It's the spies, not the leaks, that threaten our security",
        "body":"<p>The war on terror has been a boon to the British intelligence services. After decades in which they became notorious for \"counter-subversion\" operations against political activists and trade unionists, colluding with death squads in Northern Ireland and helping the US to overthrow elected governments around the world, the spooks have at last had a chance to play the good guys.</p><p>Instead of the seedy anti-democratic gang that plotted against a Labour prime minister, they can claim to be the first line of defence against indiscriminate attacks on the streets of Britain. MI5 has well over doubled in size in the past 10 years. Glamorised beyond parody in TV dramas such as Spooks, the spying agencies' uncheckable pronouncements about their exploits and supposed triumphs are routinely relayed by the media as fact. The same has been true in the US, but on a far larger canvas.</p><p>So faced with the avalanche of leaks from the National Security Agency and GCHQ about the epic scale of their blanket electronic surveillance, both at home and abroad, the masters of Anglo-American espionage have played the \"national security\" card for all it's worth. The revelations of NSA contractor Edward Snowden in the Guardian have been a \"gift\" to terrorists, the head of MI5 Andrew Parker claimed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/09/david-cameron-mi5-chief-edward-snowden-gchq-leaks\" title=\"\">eagerly supported by the prime minister</a>. The leaks were the \"most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever\", insisted David Omand, the former head of GCHQ. They were cheered on by the trusties of the British press – a fertile recruiting ground for British intelligence and the CIA over many years. National security has been imperilled, they all warned, as Tory demands for the Guardian to be prosecuted have grown.</p><p>In reality, national security is a catchphrase so elastic as to be meaningless. As MI5 <a href=\"https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/what-we-do/protecting-national-security.html\" title=\"\">helpfully explains</a>, government policy is \"not to define the term, in order to retain the flexibility ... to adapt to changing circumstances\" – in other words, political expediency.</p><p>If it simply meant protecting citizens from bombs on buses and trains, of course, most people would sign up for that. But as the Snowden leaks have moved from capability to content, it's been driven home that much of what NSA and GCHQ (virtually one organisation) are up to has nothing to do with terrorism or security at all, but, as might be expected, the exercise of naked state power to gain political and economic advantage.</p><p>In the past few days the French have discovered (courtesy of Le Monde) that the NSA harvested 70m digital communications in France in one month, with special focus on French-American telecoms firm Alcatel-Lucent, while the Mexicans have learned (via Der Spiegel) that their president's emails were hacked into by US intelligence to \"plan international investments\" and strengthen US diplomatic leverage.</p><p>Something similar happened to Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, just as world leaders were targeted at the G20, while India and Germany were among other countries treated to the full electronic harvest treatment. Terrorism was clearly well down the priority list.</p><p>The protests of French and other western governments, which of course have their own, less effective espionage capability and collude with the US across the board, are largely for public consumption. France was among several European states that cravenly bowed to US pressure to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/bolivia-un-evo-morales-plane\" title=\"\">force the Bolivian president Evo Morales's aircraft to land</a> this summer, in a hamfisted attempt to kidnap the elusive whistleblower Snowden.</p><p>But it is the scale and reach of the NSA-GCHQ operation – and the effective global empire it is used to police – that sets it apart. And when it comes to terrorism, the evidence is that the US and British intelligence agencies are fuelling it as much as fighting it.</p><p>Take drone attacks, which are Obama's weapon of choice in the new phase of the war on terror. They are <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/\" title=\"\">reckoned to have killed up to 3,613</a> (926 of them civilians, including 200 children) in Pakistan alone. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/amnesty-us-officials-war-crimes-drones\" title=\"\">Amnesty International this week argued</a> that US officials should stand trial over evidence of war crimes in the Pakistan drone campaign. Human Rights Watch has made a similar case over the slaughter in Yemen.</p><p>The drone war is run by the CIA and US military. But, as the Snowden leaks confirm (this time in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/documents-reveal-nsas-extensive-involvement-in-targeted-killing-program/2013/10/16/29775278-3674-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html\" title=\"\">Washington Post</a>), the NSA is intimately involved in what are often anything but \"targeted killings\" – as is GCHQ, now facing legal action in London over war crimes brought by the son of a Pakistani victim of a 2011 drone attack. Drones have, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">as the New York Times put it</a>, \"replaced Guantánamo as the recruiting tool of choice for militants\", cited as justification by jihadists for attacks on western cities.</p><p>The same goes for the role of US and British intelligence, serviced by the NSA and GCHQ, in a decade of torture and state kidnapping. As the evidence of MI5 and MI6 complicity with CIA black sites, \"extraordinary rendition\", waterboarding and genital mutilation has built up – from Bagram to Guantánamo, Pakistan to Morocco – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/23/mi6-al-qaida-investigation\" title=\"\">court case has followed police investigation</a>. You might call it a recruitment \"gift\" to al-Qaida. But neither the agencies nor the politicians supposed to supervise them have yet been held to account.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite its multiple failures, the war on terror keeps expanding, spreading terror as it goes. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/world/africa/us-prepares-to-train-african-forces-to-fight-terror.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1&amp;\" title=\"\">new front is Africa</a>, where the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/us-military-bases-africa\" title=\"\">US military is now involved in 49 out of 54 states</a>. Two years after what was supposed to have been a successful intervention in Libya, the country is again on the brink of a new civil war, its prime minister begging to be rescued from the backlash over another US kidnapping.</p><p>It's a democratic necessity that the Snowden leaks are used to bring some genuine accountability to the NSA-GCHQ machine and its lawless industrial-scale espionage. But to frame the controversy as a trade-off between security and privacy misses the wider picture. The main western intelligence agencies are instruments of global dominance, whose role in the rest of the world has a direct impact on their own citizens. It's not the revelations that threaten our security, but the agencies and their political masters themselves.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420783778|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|24a2a32f00d145cea1e2ffcba5a1c7b9cb8648ea -->",

The audience was engaged and highly informed about the latest twists and turns in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/prism\" title=\"\">Prism story</a> and the saga of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a>. In Britain the vital debate about security, civil liberties and the right to know has been characterised by torpor.</p><p>That is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/09/david-cameron-mi5-chief-edward-snowden-gchq-leaks\" title=\"\">Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, is to be praised for raising the stakes</a> by putting the spy agencies' point of view. Before discussing the merits of his case, it is worth noting that the actual words he made in his speech are more thoughtful and sober than the spin accompanying it that was regurgitated by several newspapers yesterday.</p><p>Parker's central argument – which David Cameron unsurprisingly fully endorsed – boils down to this: anyone who reveals anything about the activities of GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 is, by definition, helping terrorists. \"The detail of the capabilities we use against them … represent our margin of advantage,\" he says. The word in question here is \"detail\". It is one thing to reveal operational detail; it is quite another to put into the public domain the broad strategy – the remarkable revelation of the extent of the snooping that has taken place unbeknown not just to the public but to many of the politicians who are supposed to oversee the agencies.</p><p>As Chris Huhne pointed out earlier this week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/06/cabinet-gchq-surveillance-spying-huhne\" title=\"\">he had no idea about the NSA's Prism programme or GCHQ's related Tempora project</a> – and he was a member of the UK National Security Council.</p><p>Members of US Congress have expressed similar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/nsa-reform-bill-surveillance-congress\" title=\"\">consternation about being kept in the dark</a>; this has led to a vigorous debate and forced Barack Obama to initiate a review. By contrast, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/10/william-hague-spying-scandal-nsa-statement\" title=\"\">William Hague went before parliament</a> to respond to the Guardian's first stories in June, his message was: don't concern&nbsp;yourselves, the excellent chaps at&nbsp;the agencies are doing everything they can to keep us safe.</p><p>And concern themselves they didn't. Indeed, the number of MPs and peers with a serious understanding of internet technology can be counted on the fingers of one hand. With a credulous parliament and with judges and ministers giving approval in secrecy, the \"highly accountable service\" that Parker proclaims is a chimera.</p><p>Most statements about terrorism – on both sides of the debate – are based on supposition. When the spooks call for more powers, arguing as they have done over the communications data bill that without new measures they cannot keep the streets safe, their claim can be neither proven nor disproven.</p><p>Trust is a necessary component, something we in Britain seem to have in abundance. Far more useful are transparency and accountability. At the moment, parliament's intelligence and security committee publishes only the most basic data on surveillance. What would happen if it disclosed the number of intercepts, the breakdown between email, direct messaging, phone calls and texts, and the proportion that relates to terrorism, organised crime and other serious issues? Would any of the operations be imperilled? Excessive secrecy is about more than national security; it is designed to protect organisations and individuals from embarrassment and from being properly accountable for their actions.</p><p>As for our media, it picks and chooses when to get upset about erosions of liberty. The Daily Mail appeared genuinely exercised by torture allegations under the last Labour government; it sprang to the defence of the computer hacker who was fighting off extradition to the US. Several Tory-leaning papers led the way on stopping ID cards. On the Prism issue, however, they have been cheerleaders to the authorities. In August, the German magazine Der Spiegel posited one theory: remember the Olympics opening ceremony, James Bond and Her Maj and the helicopter? We love our agents.</p><p>There is another possible explanation for the silence and sneers that have greeted the Guardian's coverage of the Snowden story: Leveson. Most rivals on Fleet Street think this paper has also been selective in its embrace of freedom of expression, siding as it did with advocates of greater regulation of the British press. This is payback time.</p><p>With so much at stake, one might reasonably (or naively) assume that, whatever their political hue, the media might work collaboratively in challenging the powerful. For as long as the press fails in its core function and for as long as our parliamentarians remain quiescent, the security services can act as they please, accumulating information on all of us they could never have dreamed of.</p><p>At one point in his speech, Parker asserts: \"I too believe strongly that the public is owed an explanation of the threats the country faces and what we are doing about them.\" How right he is.<em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419523256|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c7d9012d3e0e596cd4a9c6a1f977e848c6fd52ab -->",

Howarth suggested the chiefs might “speculate as to what further safeguards can be put into place” at the hearing.</p> <p>The public hearing would be important although the agency heads would not be able to speak totally freely, he said, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Maybe we need to justify all over again why it is that the state does require that we have secrets. And if you have secrets, who controls, who knows about those secrets. These are big, important questions, and I know they’re ones they’ll grapple with, the heads of the agencies, but we as a democracy, whether we’re parliamentarians on the intelligence and security committee, in the government, or just members of the public, are rightly concerned about [them].</p> </blockquote> <p>Howarth also returned the debate to Snowden’s revelations of government surveillance in the US and UK themselves, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Where is the balance between on the one hand the state’s need to know who’s doing what that might lead to harm to the people who live here … set against the civil liberties of people and the reasonable expectation that their communications aren’t going to be monitored to no useful purpose?</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked his view of where this balance should lie, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we looked at, in terms of the information-sharing that takes place between the National Security Agency [NSA] and GCHQ, our own agency, we found no evidence … of any wrongdoing. They behaved within the law. Authorisations have been properly obtained before any particular information has been accessed.</p> <p>So we start from a position where nobody’s actually breaking the law at the moment.&nbsp;</p> <p>The next question that arises, in terms of reassuring people that their privacy will be properly protected, is: “What safeguards are there in place, legally, to ensure that those communications aren’t tampered with in any way, improperly or in any way unethically?” And we’re at the point now I think where we need to think about that.&nbsp;</p> <p>I haven’t got a particular prescription at this stage. I’ve got an open mind.

He was called back for a third interview with MI5, who had a two-inch thick file on him and his family.</p> <p>Straw was questioned about his sister, Suzy, whom they believed, on the evidence of a neighbour, to be a member of the Communist party. The spook showed Straw a memo from someone who had been spying on his sister. Straw told them it was a mistake. His sister had merely fancied a member of the CP.</p> <p>He was then questioned about leftwing contemporaries while he had been President of the National Union of Students. He was confronted with detailed evidence from someone who had spied on a lunch he and another student had had in a pub years earlier – including a detailed account of their conversations.</p> <p>At the end of the meeting the spook asked Straw not to tell Barbara Castle about their meeting. Straw readily agreed. “On the way back to the DHSS I reflected on the fact that the Security Service had begun to put together this file on my family when I was 15 – and on the scale of the surveillance operation this implied.”</p> <p>Most people might have been troubled by this. Not Straw. He writes that he was “neither surprised nor shocked … This was the world we lived in.”</p> <p>So Straw is at least consistent. He didn’t mind himself, his family, his sister or his friends being put under close surveillance. And he doesn’t mind it for the rest of us, either.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5257e0f0e4b0f49d54fe28bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T12:29:04.670+01:00\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jack Straw attacks Guardian</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In contrast to Vince Cable’s comments, former Labour home secretary Jack Straw has hit out at the Guardian over the Snowden leaks. Straw said Guardian journalists’ “almost adolescent excitement” had gone to their heads.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that the head of the security service, MI5, has been absolutely right to say what he has said, and I regret what I can only describe as indulgent, irresponsibility by the Guardian newspaper. You can always justify everything, if you’re a newspaper, on the grounds that this is open journalism, but this is about much more than journalism, it’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest. And that’s not just about protecting the ‘establishment’, it’s about keeping people safe, it’s about avoiding another 7th of July 2005.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the revelations have risked lives, Straw said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, potentially. I’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody’s life. But what I do think is there sense of power of having these ‘secrets’ and excitement, almost adolescent excitement, about these secrets, has gone to their head and they’re blinding themselves about the consequence, and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particularly secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest.

I specifically said that one of the things that we’re going to have to discuss and debate is how were we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy, because there are some trade-offs involved.</p> <p>And I welcome this debate. And I think it’s healthy for our democracy. I think it’s a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate. And I think it’s interesting that there are some folks on the left, but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren’t very worried about it when it was a Republican president. I think that’s good that we’re having this discussion.</p> <p>But I think it’s important for everybody to understand, and I think the American people understand, that there are some trade-offs involved. You know, I came in with a health skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team’s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content — that on, you know, net, it was worth us doing.</p> <p>That’s — some other folks may have a different assessment of that. But I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have a hundred percent security and also then have a hundred percent privacy and zero inconvenience. You know, we’re going to have to make some choices as a society.</p> <p>And — (audio break) — I can say is, is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference — (audio break) — to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity. And the fact that they’re under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people’s phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents, absent further action by a federal court, that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation.</p> <p>I think, on balance, we — you know, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about. But again, this — these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate. And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up.</p> <p>And we’re happy to have that debate.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T11:28:18.907+01:00\">at 11.28am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5257c79be4b0f49d54fe28a9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T10:41:51.380+01:00\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>My colleagues in our Sydney office have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/nsa-revelations-australian-editors-back-the-guardian\">speaking to the editors of the Australian press</a>, who also back the Guardian's decision to publish.

Let’s not scrutinise those with the power and ability to carry out widespread surveillance on their own citizens. Let’s keep the public in the dark, rather than serving their right to know.

Osama bin Laden did not need Edward Snowden's revelations about Prism to realise the US was listening in to every bit of electronic communication: he had already seceded from the world of telephony and reverted to couriers. But millions of people in the US, the UK, Brazil, India and elsewhere, including national leaders, energy companies and others who are being spied upon for base reasons, were unaware of the fact that their privacy was being compromised.</p> </blockquote> <p>Frank Schirrmacher of Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says: “There is no indication whatsoever that those media organisations who reported about the NSA and GCHQ files have endangered our national security.”</p> <p>And Jill Abramson of the New York Times writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The accurate and in-depth news articles published by the New York Times and the Guardian help inform the public in framing its thinking about these issues and deciding how to balance the need to protect against terrorism and to protect individual<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy\"> privacy</a>.

Here are the full quotes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Q: Do you agree with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/debate-grows-orwellian-nsa-technology\"> the prime minister who [supports Andrew Parker's warning that] the Guardian's publication of those files handed the advantage to Britain's enemies,</a> it was a guidebook to terrorism, the Edward Snowden story.</p> <p>NC: I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information that actually most Guardian readers, or most of us, would not frankly understand but the only people who will understand are the technicians amongst the terrorists, then what's the public interest in that?</p> <p>However, I think of course there's a totally legitimate debate to be had about - and my experience speaking to people in the intelligence agencies is that they recognise this - the use of these new, incredibly powerful technologies. We have legislation, regulations, which were designed for an age which is quite different now. And both terrorists and states, and security agencies, now conduct this battle online in a way that was unimaginable a few years ago. And what they means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area of debate.</p> <p>How you hold the secret parts of any part of any state to account is an incredibly important issue. Because secrecy is necessary, of course it is. You absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy for the intelligence agencies, without which they can't keep us safe.</p> <p>But you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability.</p> <p>Now, we've improved it. This government has taken big steps - and I'm delighted that we've done this - to strengthen, for instance, the intelligence and security committee, which is the committee which holds the agencies to account in parliament. But I saw a previous head of MI5 say recently to expect the public just to accept that some slightly opaque arrangement in Westminster is the way to hold everyone to account, in which the public does not have much of an insight - I think it's right for us to ask whether there anything more we can do to make sure the public feel that accountability is working in this area properly.</p> <p>Q: But did the Guardian go to far with the level of detail it published?</p> <p>NC: Oh, I've got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by, because they were very technical, but will have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm.</p> <p>Q: So it should not have put it out there?</p> <p>NC: As I said, I think it's a totally legitimate debate, about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way, but I don't think just giving technical secrets, if I can put it that way, to people who want to do us harm, serves any purpose.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theresa May’s view was closer to that of Parker – and that expressed by David Cameron’s spokesman yesterday. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I agree with Andrew Parker. I think it is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates, then that does cause a problem – it can give some comfort to terrorists. And he was very clear about the statement that he made, and I think we need to be very clear about the need to ensure that we have the security arrangements in place that enable us to continue to protect the British public.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525681c0e4b068418f428162\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-10T11:39:06.023+01:00\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thursday 10 October 2013: Snowden's father in Moscow</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good morning. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>'s father landed in Moscow on Thursday morning and said he hoped to visit his son, who has not been seen in public since he was granted asylum in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> in August.</p> <p>&quot;I am his father, I love my son and ...

The spooks are not interested in building great haystacks of information; they are after the needles. In the search for those needles, however, they should not be permitted random walks through our privacy. The instinct of intelligence agencies is to push the boundaries. The role of politicians and the press is to test them in the search for balance between security and liberty.</p> </blockquote> <p>The boundaries of GCHQ's work is one of the key talking points. In his speech MI5 director general Andrew Parker said:<a href=\"https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/who-we-are/staff-and-management/director-general/speeches-by-the-director-general/director-generals-speech-at-rusi-2013.html\"> &quot;It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques.&quot;</a></p> <p>Stephens said their should be a balance between public oversight of the security services and trust in its activities.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The further they reach, the more intelligence agencies will have to provide more information about the what and why of their operations. The rest of us, however, need to recognise that the digital universe is a vast ungoverned space offering dark shelter to the enemies of freedom. Yes, champions of liberty should keep vigilant watch on the power of the state; but sometimes they should also be reassured by it.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T14:17:42.417+01:00\">at 2.17pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52554f76e4b0f6451e9a7fc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T13:51:19.549+01:00\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rusbridger vows to continue publishing Snowden leaks</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The editor of the Guardian has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jh1gj\">vowed to go on “responsibly” publishing leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden</a> despite the concerns of MI5.</p> <p>Alan Rusbridger insisted that revelations in the Guardian had helped stimulate public debate about the extent of surveillance by the state, and he would continue to publish them.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These revelations are not streaming out of the Guardian ... That’s because we are working slowly and responsibly. As we discover further stories that we think merit the debate – the debate that everyone says is necessary –&nbsp;then we will go on publishing.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Rusbridger said last night’s speech by MI5 director general Sir Andrew Parker was &quot;perfectly reasonable and what you would expect him to say&quot;.</p> <p>He added: “If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don’t want a debate and you don’t want the press writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate.”</p> <p>The Guardian editor insisted the paper's revelations were in the public interest.</p> <p>&quot;What is significantly new about what we have been revealing is the extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Rusbridger added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There a difference between harvesting and targeting. But is pretty plain they are harvesting a very great deal, and their ambition is to master the internet and scoop the entire lot up and to save it for as long as possible. They says that’s the haystack and they will then look for needles in extremely controlled circumstances.</p> <p>The question is who gets the oversight of that. Chris Huhne [the former cabinet minister] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state#comment-27692054\">has said</a> these vast new programmes weren’t discussed at the National Security Council [and] weren’t discussed at cabinet.</p> <p>There has to be wider debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked whether newspaper editors should be the arbiters of what is revealed, Rusbridger said only a handful of MPs were willing to speak out on the issue. He said: “If parliament is not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only discuss this in private, then absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public is intensely interested in.”</p> <p>Intelligence chiefs have always maintained that disclosing their tactics is a gift to terrorists, Rusbridger pointed out. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has to be a balance ... These technologies are formidable. They are beyond what Orwell could have imagined.</p> <p>It may that everything in a social democracy is fine at the moment and that oversight is working. But I would be very surprised if the current oversight methods really understood and knew about some of the things that we have been describing as a result of the Snowden revelations.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-31c86605-7c10-40c4-901f-d96d65a1df58\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381323419542/f02c4976-a61d-4e24-8972-1deea8fcacd5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridger\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger.

Hopkins writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In recent days, a former head of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, acknowledged her old agency needed to be more transparent.</p> <p>A former head of America's National Security Agency, General Michael Hayden, said much the same thing. Last week he told an audience in London: &quot;It's clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don't get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support. And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Hopkins also points out that there are those who doubt Parker's assertion that publishing information such as that leaked by Edward Snowden handed a &quot;gift&quot; to terrorists.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Three weeks ago, Nigel Inkster, former deputy chief of MI6, played down the potential damage. &quot;I sense that those most interested in the activities of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a>and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said: &quot;The argument that exposing these documents helps the terrorists doesn't even pass the laugh test; there's nothing here that changes anything any potential terrorist would do or not do.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>But he points out that neither Parker, nor those who doubt has claim, can prove their point. The same is true, he says, for the claim foreign intelligence agencies may now have access to Snowden's documents.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps the Russians and the Chinese do now have the files. But if they have obtained them, they have managed a feat that has so far eluded the combined efforts of the British and American intelligence communities.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5255319ee4b0f6451e9a7fbb\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T11:55:11.647+01:00\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greenwald's response</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who has had the most contact with Snowden, has balked at the treatment of Parker's speech by sections of the British press.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884089153302528\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How unusual: a top UK national security official screams &quot;The Terrorists!!&quot; over &amp; over to justify govt's actions <a href=\"http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY\">http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY</a></p>— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884089153302528\">October 9, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387885598616203264\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>To a right-wing paper, it's apparently heinous to publish even after the Government orders you not to <a href=\"http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY\">http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PressServants&amp;src=hash\">#PressServants</a></p>— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387885598616203264\">October 9, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>Greenwald doesn't buy MI5's anti-terror spin and questions why GCHQ are involved in spying on Brazilian government departments, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.petrobras.com%2F&amp;ei=mapOUoqECaSM7QbOlYHoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_M17wi07hoxbWwe7BjY2zYxBdMQ&amp;sig2=2ap1_n96xoCfxgWZE465cA&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.ZGU\">Petrobras</a> the oil company that funds social programmes in Brazil, and the US peace campaign the Organization of American States.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884279566315520\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Could the MI5 chief please identify the Al Qaeda elements at the OAS, Petrobras &amp; Ministry of Mines and Energy?

You have to have the rules set up so you can defend Wall Street.</p> </blockquote> <p>FP’s Shane Harris reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Drawing an analogy to how the military detects an incoming missile with radar and other sensors, Alexander imagined the NSA being able to spot &quot;a cyberpacket that's about to destroy Wall Street.&quot; In an ideal world, he said, the agency would be getting real-time information from the banks themselves, as well as from the NSA's traditional channels of intelligence, and have the power to take action before a cyberattack caused major damage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harris comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The analogy was a stretch. For starters, what's a &quot;cyberpacket&quot;? Presumably Alexander meant a sophisticated computer worm or virus designed to disrupt a computer or destroy the data inside it. (Maybe like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\"> one</a> his agency reportedly helped design to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility.) But the idea that a single, tiny packet could wipe out Wall Street is laughable.

Transparency, he argues, is the way to identify problems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among IT security professionals, it has been long understood that the public disclosure of vulnerabilities is the only consistent way to improve security. That's why researchers publish information about vulnerabilities in computer software and operating systems, cryptographic algorithms, and consumer products like implantable medical devices, cars, and CCTV cameras.</p> </blockquote> <p>The NSA's two conflicting missions, to protect US infrastructure as well as conducting surveillance to gather intelligence. During the cold war that meant defending domestic systems while attacking Soviet ones.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But with the rise of mass-market computing and the internet, the two missions have become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/dualuse_technol_1.html\">interwoven</a>. It becomes increasingly difficult to attack their systems and defend our systems, because everything is using the same systems: Microsoft Windows, Cisco routers, HTML, TCP/IP, iPhones, Intel chips, and so on. Finding a vulnerability – or creating one – and keeping it secret to attack the bad guys necessarily leaves the good guys more vulnerable.</p> <p>Far better would be for the&nbsp;NSA&nbsp;to take those vulnerabilities back to the vendors to patch. Yes, it would make it harder to eavesdrop on the bad guys, but it would make everyone on the internet safer. If we believe in protecting our critical infrastructure from foreign attack, if we believe in protecting internet users from repressive regimes worldwide, and if we believe in defending businesses and ourselves from cybercrime, then doing otherwise is lunacy.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524e9041e4b0b103eb47f3df\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T16:25:20.652+01:00\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">German intelligence service 'does the same as the NSA abroad'</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kai Biermann for the Guardian today examines the state of German security and says Europeans need to scrutinise their domestic security, rather than focusing on the NSA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German intelligence service – the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) – to name an example close to home, does exactly the same thing as the NSA abroad and it does so within a similar legal framework. &quot;The differences between the BND and the NSA are much smaller than is generally accepted by the public,&quot; write&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stiftung-nv.de/law_and_policy_in_internet_surveillance_programs\">Stefan Heumann and Ben Scott in their study</a>&nbsp;on the legal foundations of internet surveillance programmes in the US, the UK and Germany.</p> <p>Heumann works at the German thinktank Neue Verantwortung (New Responsibility), Scott was an adviser to the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and is now a policy adviser at the Open Technology Institute, part of the New America Foundation thinktank.

Other reports, as we indicated (including from the New York Times in 2009), have previously reported on efforts to wiretap even members of Congress.</p> <p>A major reason why those in power always try to use surveillance is because surveillance = power. The more you know about someone, the more you can control and manipulate them in all sorts of ways. That is one reason a Surveillance State is so menacing to basic political liberties.</p> <p>But there are all sorts of examples, including from recent history, demonstrating that even the most seemingly insurmountable institutions can be weakened or uprooted when they become abusive enough. The tide is clearly turning against the US National Security State in general and the NSA in particular in terms of their ability to dictate terms and control the debate, and they know it.</p> <p>What will ultimately determine the outcome here is how much pressure citizens continue to apply in defense of their privacy rights and against massive, ubiquitous, secret spying systems aimed at them.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-02T14:08:35.780+01:00\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524acda1e4b00c9d0a81100c\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-01T18:04:14.696+01:00\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Privacy activist Ilija Trojanow refused entry to US</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-865e732f-7f26-43df-a4eb-f8ed463df2d6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380647109029/6357641377_14bf9c9497_o-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Privacy activist Ilija Trojanow was barred from entering the US.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Privacy activist Ilija Trojanow was barred from entering the US. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/das-blaue-sofa/6357641377/\">Photograph: Blaues Sofa/flickr</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>A Bulgarian-German novelist and privacy activist was on Monday refused entry to the US, writes the Guardian's Berlin correspondent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/philip-oltermann\">Philip Oltermann</a>.</p> <p>Ilija Trojanow, who had been on his way to a literary conference in Denver, was told at Salvador da Bahia airport, Brazil, that US authorities wouldn't allow him into the country.

If we are to enjoy such debates in the future we cannot rely upon individual sacrifice. We must create better channels for people of conscience to inform not only trusted agents of government but independent representatives of the public outside government.</p> <p>When I began my work it was with the sole intention of making possible the debate we see occurring here in this body and in many other bodies around the world.</p> <p>Today we see legislative bodies forming new committees calling for investigations and proposing new solutions for modern problems. We see emboldened courts that are no longer afraid to consider critical questions of national security.

Why aren't the members of government and the NSA involved being sued for privacy issue and data infringement along with international espionage plus the trafficking of data involving matters of national security to another sovereign nation. The Agency breaks international laws and breaks all code of ethics yet still they are able to justify it.

        "headline":"MI5 chief: GCHQ surveillance plays vital role in fight against terrorism",
        "body":"<p>The new head of MI5 launched a robust defence of the techniques used by Britain's intelligence agencies in his first speech since taking the job and warned they would not be able to sustain current levels of counter-terrorism work without the help of surveillance from GCHQ.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Parker_%28MI5_officer%29\" title=\"\">Sir Andrew Parker</a> also acknowledged that the growth of the internet, technology and big data was \"transforming our society\" and that significant choices had to be made about which capabilities were required to track terrorists in this new and different world.</p><p>\"How the UK decides to respond to these developments will directly determine the level of security available against the threats we face,\" said Parker, who became director general of the counter-intelligence and security agency six months ago.</p><p>\"Retaining the capability to access such information is intrinsic to MI5's ability to protect the country. There are choices to be made including about how and whether communications data is retained.</p><p>\"It is not, however, an option to disregard such shifts with an unspoken assumption that somehow security will anyway be sustained. It will not. We cannot work without tools.\"</p><p>Though he did not mention Edward Snowden, some of Parker's strongest remarks appeared to be directed at the whistleblower who gave thousands of classified intelligence files to the Guardian.</p><p>They revealed the scale of surveillance programmes currently being undertaken by GCHQ and its US counterpart the National Security Agency (NSA).</p><p>Two of the most significant operations uncovered in the Snowden files were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/07/uk-gathering-secret-intelligence-nsa-prism\" title=\"\">Prism</a>, run by the NSA, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/legal-loopholes-gchq-spy-world\" title=\"\">Tempora</a>, which was set up by GCHQ.</p><p>Between them, they allow the agencies to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries.</p><p>The files also showed GCHQ was gathering personal information from mobile phones and apps, and has stated an ambition to \"exploit any phone, anywhere, any time\". In another document from 2011, the author said GCHQ was beginning to \"master the internet\". That report said GCHQ was in a \"golden age\" of surveillance capabilities that had allowed the agency to store 39bn separate pieces of information during a single day.</p><p>The files have raised questions about the scope of surveillance in the UK and US – and whether the agencies are facing enough scrutiny in this new era.</p><p>But Parker insisted MI5 did not have or want an \"all-pervasive, oppressive security apparatus\".</p><p>Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in London, he said: \"In some quarters there seems to be a vague notion that we monitor everyone and all their communications, browsing at will through people's private lives for anything that looks interesting.\" <a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/\" title=\"\"> </a> It was a notion that he said was \"of course, utter nonsense\".</p><p>In the first public defence of GCHQ by a senior intelligence official, Parker said the agency had played a vital role in stopping many of the terrorist plots MI5 and the police had tackled in the past decade.</p><p>\"We are facing an international threat and GCHQ provides many of the intelligence leads upon which we rely. It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists.</p><p>\"It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.\"</p><p>In the speech, Parker also estimated there were \"several thousand Islamist extremists [in the UK] who see the British people as a legitimate target\". He said he thought the terrorism threat had not increased but was \"more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable\".</p><p>Parker said it would be impossible for MI5 to stop every plot, or prevent every attack. He argued that the agencies should have the capabilities they need and that scrutiny of their work was strong enough.</p><p>\"We have a tough job to do in rapidly changing times. There are choices ahead that will determine whether we can sustain what we do, or accept that it will erode.\"</p><p>Parker, a keen ornithologist, succeeded Sir Jonathan Evans earlier this year and has been at the agency for 30 years. He led MI5's counter-terrorist response to the 7 July bombings in 2005 and was Evans's deputy, in charge of operations.</p><p>MI5 has previously indicated Syria is \"the destination of choice\" for Britons seeking jihad. It is thought several hundred Britons have travelled to Syria over the past two years to fight with the forces seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>\"A growing proportion of our casework now has some link to Syria, mostly concerning individuals from the UK who have travelled to fight there or who aspire to do so,\" Parker said.</p><p>The director said counter-terrorism was an \"extraordinary proposition because [it] is the one area of crime where the expectation sometimes seems to be that the stats should be zero.\"</p><p>\"Imagine applying the same target to murder in general, or major drugs trafficking. That is the stuff of 'pre-crime' in the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report.</p><p>\"Life is not the movies. In a free society, zero is of course impossible to achieve in the face of persistent and serious threats, though we will keep stretching for it.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419412785|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a0c0183fef8b1c0d079f7c789002eafaec5c1e8f -->",

        "headline":"MI5 chief's condemnation of Snowden GCHQ leaks backed by David Cameron",
        "body":"<p>David Cameron has endorsed  a speech by Andrew Parker in which the new head of MI5 suggested that the leaks by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden had undermined the fight against terrorism.</p><p>The No 10 spokesman said: \"The prime minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe.\"</p><p>Parker did not mention Snowden by name in a speech that defended Britain's intelligence agencies. But his remarks appeared to be aimed at the whistleblower who gave thousands of intelligence files to the Guardian that revealed surveillance programmes carried out by GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA).</p><p>Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, defended the newspaper's reporting of files leaked by Snowden that highlighted formidable technologies \"beyond what Orwell could have imagined\".</p><p>Rusbridger told The World at One on BBC Radio 4: \"If you read the whole of Andrew Parker's speech it is a perfectly reasonable speech and it is what you would expect him to say. If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don't want a debate and you don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate.\"</p><p>Rusbridger challenged Parker's claim that the leaking and publication of the NSA files posed a risk to national security. He said: \"Glenn Greenwald [the Guardian journalist who received the leaked documents] has a phrase that you would have to be a terrorist who didn't know how to tie his shoelace not to believe that people were watching things on the internet and scooping up telephone calls. I don't think some of this will come as a great surprise to terrorists.</p><p>\"But what is significantly new about what we have been revealing is the extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance. I have just spent a week in America where everybody is talking about this from the president down.\"</p><p>Rusbridger warned of attempts in the US to prevent reporting. \"There has to be a balance. There have been instances in the last few months where people have gone through metadata to find out reporters' sources&nbsp;… These technologies are formidable. They are beyond what Orwell could have imagined.</p><p>\"It may be that everything in a social democracy is fine and the oversight is working. But I would be very surprised if the current oversight methods really understood and knew about some of the things we have been describing as a result of the Snowden revelations.\"</p><p>In his speech the MI5 head defended the work of GCHQ and warned of the dangers of publishing documents which reveal some of its systems. Parker said: \"We are facing an international threat and GCHQ provides many of the intelligence leads upon which we rely. It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists.</p><p>\"It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.\"</p><p>Asked whether Cameron agreed with Parker that the leak of the Snowden files had been a gift to potential terrorists, the No 10 spokesman said: \"I would happily point you to all parts of the director general's speech. It was an excellent speech.\"</p><p>Asked whether the prime minister's endorsement covered Parker's claim that making public GCHQ's techniques provided \"the gift they [terrorists] need to evade us\", the spokesman said: \"Including that\".</p><p>The spokesman's remarks suggest Cameron agrees with MI5 that the government should try and revive the data communications bill, which has been dubbed the snooper's charter. The proposed legislation was blocked by Nick Clegg.</p><p>Asked whether Parker's remarks showed that the bill was not dead, the spokesman said: \"The position hasn't changed. The government continues to consider how best we continue to ensure our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement agencies are able to stay up to date in what is – in one of the points Andrew Parker was making – a continually evolving technological environment.\"</p><p>A Guardian News and Media spokeswoman said: \"A huge number of people - from President Obama to the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper - have now conceded that the Snowden revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue.</p><p>\"The president has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the US Congress and throughout Europe. Such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed. That is what journalism should do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419480074|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|f6d0c5bef3bbdb67f5558ac3fb526bfe8d9e72e5 -->",

        "headline":"Who should judge whether Snowden's leaked secrets are too sensitive to report?",
        "body":"<p>In the last few days, two national newspapers – the Times and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2451557/Daily-Mail-Comment-The-Guardian-paper-helps-Britains-enemies.html\" title=\"\">the Mail</a> – have suggested that the Guardian has been wrong to publish material leaked by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> on the specific grounds that journalists cannot be trusted to judge what may damage national security.</p><p>Ignore for a moment the vexing sight of journalists denouncing their own worth. Set aside too the question of why rival newspapers might want to attack the Guardian's exclusives. Follow the argument. Who should make the judgment?</p><p>The official answer is that we should trust the security agencies themselves. Over the past 35 years, I've worked with a clutch of whistleblowers from those agencies, and they've all shared one underlying theme – that behind the screen of official secrecy, they had seen rules being bent and/or broken in a way which precisely suggested that the agencies should not be trusted. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/11/media.freedomofinformation\" title=\"\">Cathy Massiter</a> and Robin Robison, for example, described respectively MI5 and GCHQ pursuing politically motivated projects to spy on peace activists and trade unionists. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/15/mi5-mi6-secret-wars-book-gordon-thomas\" title=\"\">Peter Wright</a> told of MI5 illegally burgling its way across London \"while pompous bowler-hatted civil servants in Whitehall pretended to look the other way\". David Shayler exposed a plot both lawless and reckless by MI5 and MI6 to recruit al-Qaida supporters to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p>All of this was known to their bosses. None of it should have been happening. But the agencies in whom we are invited to place our trust not only concealed it but without exception then attacked the whistleblowers who revealed it.</p><p>Would we do better to trust the politicians who have oversight of the agencies? It's instructive to look back from our vantage point, post-Snowden, to consider what was happening only two years ago when the government attempted to introduce new legislation which came to be known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/27/snoopers-charter-zero-chance-law\" title=\"\">snooper's charter</a>. If the oversight politicians are as well-informed as they claim, they must have known that this was in part a cynical attempt to create retrospective legal cover for surveillance tools that were already secretly being used, but they said nothing. And when parliament refused to pass that law, clearly indicating that there was no democratic mandate for those tools, they still stayed silent.</p><p>Politicians fall easy victim to a political Stockholm syndrome which sees them abandon their role as representatives of the people in favour of becoming spokesmen for the spooks. It was there in the 1970s when the New Statesman bravely exposed security lapses and financial corruption in GCHQ, only to face a prosecution orchestrated by a Labour attorney general; there again with Jack Straw describing in his autobiography how MI5 had spied on him and his family since he was 15 but declaring that he was \"neither surprised nor shocked – this was the world we lived in\"; and there again, of course, in the foreign secretary William Hague's bland presumption that \"if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear\" from the systems of mass surveillance exposed by Snowden.</p><p>So what about journalists? I suggest our track record is better. In a film muddied by fictional detail, the new Spielberg production Fifth Estate's portrayal of the Guardian's work with Wikileaks is accurate in describing the running dispute between journalists who wanted to redact documents to make them safe and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a> who wanted no such restraint. We ran dozens of stories, based on the biggest ever leak of military and intelligence material. We caused plenty of political embarrassment but we did so without jeopardising anybody's safety or damaging any nation's security.</p><p>I spent most of June with a handful of  colleagues in a secure and airless room in the Guardian combing through GCHQ documents provided by Snowden. We did so knowing that the pressure to avoid damaging national security was not only moral but political, that the security agencies and their political friends were poised to attack our work with their standard smear – that we were aiding the enemy. So we were careful. Repeatedly, we disclosed the outline but held back the detail. We had specialist reporters to advise us, and they in turn took advice from specialist outsiders. We talked to the government and invited it to show us if we were in danger of causing harm: it puffed and protested but failed (as they continue to fail) to come up with a single example of our making a dangerous disclosure. Its greatest angst was reserved for the possibility that we might name the phone companies that have allowed GCHQ to tap into the transatlantic telecoms cables – nothing to do with damaging national security, everything to do with protecting the companies from accountability to their customers.</p><p>And reading those documents, I was struck by two things. First, that GCHQ is much cleaner than it used to be, that it has now adopted internal procedures which are designed to ensure it complies with the law – and that surely can be seen, at least in part, as the achievement of those earlier whistleblowers. Second, that there is still ample reason to worry. Critics of the Guardian's Snowden stories insist that the power of GCHQ is used only to deal with terrorism and serious crime, but the signs of mission creep are there. As a single example: is migration from sub-Saharan Africa a serious crime? The Snowden material shows it has been targeted by GCHQ. Perhaps that is to be defended as essential for the UK's economy. Perhaps it is another example of a politically motivated project.</p><p>Which brings me back to the Daily Mail and a cautionary tale from the experience of the former MI5 officer Massiter. When first she tried to sound the alarm internally about the service's targeting, for example, of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, her bosses told her (with a gentle combination of sexism and Stalinism) that she was just being emotional and needed to see MI5's approved psychiatrist, which she did. When later she blew the whistle, MI5 used a compliant Tory MP as messenger to carry the wretched smear that she'd been treated for mental illness. You'll guess which newspaper put that on its front page.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419847001|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|cf9801df20590a7c3f8a4155738314bee4d24025 -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Law Society </a>is considering issuing new guidance to solicitors across England and Wales amid growing concern that the government's mass online surveillance operations are undermining their ability to take legal cases against the state.</p><p>Lawyers representing people who make serious complaints against the police, army or security services fear the industrial-scale collection of email and phone messages revealed by the Guardian over the past four months is threatening the confidential relationship between them and their clients, jeopardising a crucial plank of the criminal justice system.</p><p>\"These are absolutely fundamental issues,\" said Shamik Dutta, from Bhatt Murphy lawyers in London. \"The NSA revelations are having a chilling effect on the way a crucial part of the justice system operates. Individuals who are making serious allegations of wrongdoing against the state are becoming increasingly concerned about whether the information they share with their lawyers will remain confidential.\"</p><p>Files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden show the British eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its American counterpart, the National Security Agency, have developed capabilities to undertake mass surveillance of the web and mobile phone networks. This is done by trawling the servers of internet companies and collecting raw data from the undersea cables that carry web traffic.</p><p>Two of the programmes, Prism and Tempora, can sweep up vast amounts of private data, which is shared between the two countries. The Guardian recently revealed how GCHQ and the NSA have also successfully cracked much of the online encryption relied upon by hundreds of millions of businesses and individuals to protect their privacy.</p><p>The Law Society expressed concern about the possible impact on lawyers' day-to-day work. \"The ability of clients to consult and receive advice from lawyers with certainty of absolute confidentiality is fundamental to the rule of law and the values of our democracy,\" it said in a statement. \"The Law Society would regard it as very serious indeed if privileged correspondence were to be intercepted. We are looking at the issue and considering whether there needs to be advice given to the profession.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Bar Council said the \"enormous developments in the cyber world over the past decade\" meant it was right to question whether the proper safeguards were in place. \"The public need to be reassured that powers to intercept communications are properly exercised. We have long had concerns that the existing legislation fails to respect the right of individuals to consult privately with a lawyer. Any increase in the scope of the authorities' data gathering activities must be matched by the establishment of real protection for this fundamental aspect of the administration of justice.\"</p><p>Eric King, head of research at Privacy International, said there were real fears in the legal profession about confidentiality being breached by the security services following the NSA revelations. \"We are astonishingly concerned about privileged communications being swept up as part of the mass surveillance programmes we have learned about over the past few months,\" he said.</p><p>\"When you are talking about litigation involving major cases that challenge significant government policy, the intelligence that could be gained and the change in strategy that could be deployed by obtaining an idea of what the claimants were seeking to challenge, it could easily tip the balance decisively in what are critical cases.\"</p><p>Several law firms are reviewing the way they communicate with clients, especially in sensitive cases against the government.</p><p>Clive Stafford Smith, director at Reprieve, who has acted in a number of high profile human rights cases, said: \"What we have learned about the scale and reach of the security services' ability to monitor online communications over the past few months has far-reaching consequences for our ability to hold the state to account. I have periodically been told by people who would know that both the US and the UK snoop on my legal communications, and the impact of the latest revelations is obviously immense.</p><p>\"A prisoner needs to be able to communicate confidentially with a lawyer, but this is impossible if he thinks that a legal discussion is just another form of interrogation. For example, my Guantánamo client Shaker Aamer hates to talk about his torture, as he thinks the people who are illegitimately listening in will just use his words to abuse him more effectively in future.\"</p><p>Dutta said Bhatt Murphy was one of the firms reviewing its online security. \"Thankfully, we have effective ways of maintaining confidentiality. Nevertheless, it is deeply troubling that the victims of state misconduct should have these concerns; they should be able to rely upon the sanctity of solicitor-client privilege.\"</p><p>He said mass state surveillance had combined with the introduction of closed material proceedings in claims against the state and cuts to legal aid to drastically weaken citizens' abilities to hold the authorities to account. \"This government is undermining access to justice on a number of fronts. and these new revelations are likely to further erode people's faith in the justice system.\"</p><p>Professor Ross Anderson, a cybersecurity expert at Cambridge University, told the Guardian the Snowden revelations were causing a crisis in the IT industry as lawyers, academics, doctors and engineers realise they might be snooped on. \"How will the Prism affair affect ordinary middle-class people in Britain?\" he said. \"Surely we're of no interest to the analysts at the NSA? Yet some of our patients and clients surely will be.\"</p><p>With so much personal information being stored in 'cloud' based services, which are accessible to intelligence agencies, all professionals will have to rethink how they work, he said.</p><p>\"It's time for the British Medical Association, Law Society, Bar Council and other professional bodies to start thinking about the ethics of using cloud-based services for confidential client information.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419845485|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|000fe5c4386c55a2f5190f0e4e9b49d2c65e1582 -->",

        "body":"<p>Modern Britain has come a long way in its approach to national security issues since prime minister Harold Macmillan told MPs in 1963 that it was \"dangerous and bad for our general national interest to discuss these matters.\" Fifty years on, much has changed. The security and intelligence services now have a statutory existence which makes them proper subjects of public interest. The cold war is over and the threats to the post-Westphalian nation state come from terrorist cells and loners, not enemy states and armies. Meanwhile, the technologies of surveillance and record-keeping have been transformed out of recognition. The era of steaming open envelopes and even of phone-tapping has been supplanted by the mass collection of metadata in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq\" title=\"\">the NSA's Prism project in the United States and by GCHQ's Tempora programme</a> here.</p><p>Two things in the approach are relatively unchanged, however. The first is the state's appetite for information about perceived enemies. This appetite is as insatiable in peacetime when confronted with jihadist cells as it was in wartime when facing Hitler's Wehrmacht. The difference between then and now, however, lies in the capacity of modern technology to gratify that appetite. The other unchanged factor is the continued reluctance of the security and intelligence services to be meaningfully accountable, not just to the general public, where obvious practical limits apply, but even to the rest of government.</p><p>No one should deny that modern Britain faces a national security threat, nor deny that this challenge raises difficult issues for any liberal democracy. The Guardian's NSA and GCHQ reporting fully acknowledges this. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/10/alan-rusbridger-nsa-edward-snowden-video\" title=\"\">the reporting also exposes</a> what a bad job Britain is doing to keep the necessary work of the secret arms of the state within properly accountable bounds. The contrast with the United States, where the president has acknowledged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/hillary-clinton-spying\" title=\"\">the legitimacy of debate</a> and Congress is currently scrutinising three pieces of surveillance and data reform legislation, is acute.</p><p>Three genuinely important recent pieces of testimony have now brought the scale of our accountability deficit into focus. The first is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">the former cabinet minister Chris Huhne's revelation</a> that the government's National Security Council, supposedly the senior executive arm of government in security matters, was never briefed about Prism or Tempora. The second is the charge by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/nsa-shows-law-master-spying-technology\" title=\"\">the former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald</a> that parliamentary oversight is \"sickly\" and that the chair of the intelligence and security committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, is badly compromised in his oversight role because he is an ex-foreign secretary formerly responsible for MI6.</p><p>Now comes a third, equally disturbing complaint. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/conservative-peer-spying-gchq-surveillance\" title=\"\">The former Conservative minister Lord Blencathra</a>, now backed up by the former Labour minister Nick Brown, has revealed that their committee scrutinising <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/23/clegg-veto-snoopers-charter\" title=\"\">the government's abandoned data communications bill</a> – abandoned because of fears that the snooping powers it envisaged for hundreds of public authorities were too sweeping – was never even informed about GCHQ's existing and far more sweeping mass surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Here, therefore, is the pressing problem that faces Britain's political leaders. Our security services practice mass collection of communications metadata which, as an NSA official admits, \"tells you everything about somebody's life\", terrorist or not. Neither the cabinet nor the parliamentary oversight, nor the legislative committee looking into snooping laws, has provided real accountability over such sweeping activity. In this, as in other respects, the security services enjoy a degree of legal and operational autonomy that exceeds what many MPs and ministers, if they knew about it, would judge appropriate. The head of MI5 says such discussion helps the nation's enemies. That is untrue. It is the unregulated surveillance that poses a threat to the nation, along with the threat from our enemies. Parliament urgently needs to exert a proper grip and to find a better balance. Starting now.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420073804|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|94f9b3618f2d45958f5c7cc6cb3008eeff7d354d -->",

That is a stronger tradition in the US than it is here.\"</p><p>In the same interview, Abramson said that she would \"probably not\" sign up to the proposed royal charter on press regulation if she was editor of a newspaper in the UK.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420081919|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|81ce2d09983186b21d18972c8252171afd7bf28f -->",

        "headline":"How MPs and peers took on May and spy agencies over 'snoopers' charter'",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>If anybody thought that putting Lord Blencathra, a former minister in Michael Howard's Home Office, in charge of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee of Theresa May's \"snoopers' charter\" bill would provide a soft touch, then they were sorely mistaken.</p><p>They would have done well to pay attention to the peer's first statement as chairman of the joint committee of MPs and peers, in which he pointed out that the draft communications data bill would affect everyone in some way.</p><p>\"We all email, use websites and mobile phones and this committee wants to ensure the draft bill will ensure a sufficient balance between an individual's privacy and national security. We intend very thoroughly to examine the government's proposals,\" Blencathra said, launching the five month inquiry in July 2012.</p><p>To the surprise of some observers the MPs and peers proceeded to do just that.</p><p>The committee was extremely high-powered. It included Lord Armstrong, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office and cabinet secretary, who had famously gone all the way to Australia in a futile attempt to block the publication of the \"Spycatcher\" memoirs of the former MI5 officer, Peter Wright.</p><p>Other members included former Labour ministers who had been responsible for putting the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 on the statute book, an eminent QC specialising in human rights cases, former senior Whitehall civil servants and two Liberal Democrats, Julian Huppert and Lord Strasburger, well versed in the new digital politics.</p><p>Blencathra is not alone in feeling angered by the failure of the Home Office and the security services to inform them of the extent of GCHQ's personal data harvesting operations in its Tempora programme, while pressing for even more snooping powers: \"I sat on the committee and the Home Office misled parliament by concealing that they were already doing what the bill would have permitted,\" Strasburger said.</p><p>The first and perhaps most important clash between the committee and the government came when MI5, MI6 and GCHQ refused point black to engage with the MPs and peers directly: \"We asked to see the intelligence service, the security service and GCHQ. Their views on the draft bill would have been helpful to us. The home secretary, in accordance with usual practice, would not permit them to give evidence even in private,\" the committee revealed in their final report.</p><p>\"She offered us 'a general briefing on the threat, particularly that from international terrorism, and the security service's role in addressing it, [which] would take place off the parliamentary estate and would be strictly informal and off the record'. We did not see that this would advance our scrutiny of the draft bill, and declined the invitation,\" they added.</p><p>Blencathra now says that it was actually worse than that: \"We invited them to give evidence in private to our committee but they refused to do so, like they always refuse to, and sent us a pretty bland paper. Then of course they go and make public statements in other quarters. Just as they refused to give evidence to our committee, I think the then head [of MI5] gave a speech to the City on the need for the bill and wouldn't come to our committee to tell us why,\" he told the Guardian.</p><p>Instead of engaging with the MPs and peers, the security services would only talk to a parallel inquiry by the prime minister-appointed intelligence and security committee (ISC) which endorsed the bill's proposals to track everyone's email, phone and internet use. But even that body said, all be it without any sense of irony, that there had been insufficient consultations about their practical impact and a lack of \"coherent communication\" about the way communications data was used. The ISC's intervention did nothing to blunt the damning verdict from the MPs and peers that the bill paid too little regard to the privacy of individuals, was uncosted and unworkable, and gave too much power to the home secretary.</p><p>That verdict was based on a thorough inquiry. They held 20 meetings over the summer of 2012 and took evidence from 54 witnesses, and visited the Metropolitan police central intelligence unit to see how the police accessed communications data from the phone and internet companies and the offices of phone company Everything Everywhere to see how requests were handled by private companies.</p><p>Instead of the security services, the committee had to make do with evidence from Charles Farr, the Home Office's head of the office of security and counter-terrorism, and who has been described as one of Whitehall's most secretive mandarins. He more than any other civil servant has been leading the charge to give the police and security services the powers of mass surveillance.</p><p>Before the committee, Farr also confirmed that among the 552,000 requests for communications data each year were requests from local authorities for personal data to use in investigations into benefit fraud, trading standards offences and antisocial behaviour. That undermined May's claim in the Sun that the powers in the bill would only be used to track suspected terrorists, paedophiles and serious criminals.</p><p>He also made the case that technology was changing so rapidly that the police and security services can no longer access 25% of what they need because the companies do not store the details of someone's social media use beyond the normal phone and text details already collected for billing purposes. But he declined to give details of the 25% \"capability gap\" in public, saying it would simply tell criminals how to go about their business undetected. According to the redacted minutes of a subsequent private session, Farr found himself being pressed repeatedly by the former cabinet secretary, Lord Armstrong. He refused to spell out what forms of social media the security services were unable to track, insisting that to do so \"would advertise to people to whom we would rather not be advertising the existence of a gap\".</p><p>At this point Farr would have had the opportunity to outline what data GCHQ and the security services already had access to – including the vast harvesting capacity of Tempora, the programme that holds communications data flowing in and out of Britain in a 30-day buffer. But he made no mention whatsoever of these GCHQ programmes.</p><p>Instead, Farr warned that the \"capability gap\" would widen without legislation and as social media usage rose would \"grow to approximately 35%\". It was that so-called that \"capability gap\" that was the cornerstone of the government's case for the new surveillance powers.</p><p>Even the scrutiny committee accepted that it meant that there was a case for the legislation – but they argued that that particular bill was too sweeping and went further than it needed to or should.</p><p>Their report was important in persuading Nick Clegg to tell Theresa May bluntly that her communications data bill had to go back to the drawing board. It has not yet seen the light of day again - but as May hinted again on Tuersday - reports of its death are likely to prove exaggerated.</p><h2>The securocrat<br /></h2><p>Since Charles Farr moved from MI6 to become Whitehall's top \"securocrat\" he has been a driving force behind successive attempts to give the UK's intelligence services wide-ranging powers to monitor and store vast amounts of personal data. Unsurprisingly, as a result he has gained a reputation as the man behind \"Big Brother Britain\".</p><p>The high-flying official was moved from MI6 by the Labour home secretary John Reid in 2007 to head the Home Office's security and counter-terrorism office, the modern face of the UK's domestic counter-terrorism operations. Under Labour, he was central to a proposal to build a mega-database that would have held details of all emails and phone calls. The plan was dropped amid widespread political opposition.</p><p>After the election of the coalition, in 2010, Farr was instrumental in championing an alternative proposal, the communications data bill, which would have allowed the intelligence agencies to monitor social media, Skype calls  and email communications as well as logging every site visited by internet users in Britain. This time, the data would have been retained by the telephone and software companies.</p><p>Farr's day-to-day life in Whitehall is a stark contrast with his early career: after joining MI6 in the 1980s, he served in South Africa and Jordan, and <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/profiles/article1021573.ece\" title=\"\">is reported to have come to prominence flying round Afghanistan delivering hundreds of thousands of US dollars in cash to Afghan farmers in an attempt to stop them growing opium</a>.</p><p>After being awarded an OBE, he went on to run MI6's counter-terrorism department before moving to Whitehall. Admirers say he has shaken up the government's security machine and overhauled its anti-terror operations.</p><p>However, critics say the single-minded approach that served him well fighting the UK's enemies in the field ill- equips him for the complexities of reading Westminster's political runes as a ministerial adviser.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html\" title=\"\">One critic is Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee. The MP said last year</a>: \"He was not popular at MI6, and his secretive manner is not in keeping with the requirements of modern Whitehall.\"</p><p>Last year, Farr was in the running to become permanent secretary for the Home Office. At that time, it emerged he was in a relationship with Fiona Cunningham, the closest adviser to the home secretary, Theresa May. That prompted allegations of a possible conflict of interest. Farr missed out on the job, which went to Mark Sedwill. <strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078965|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|576f3436b241fa0d4093568f84317bf0b14b7182 -->",

        "headline":"Former Labour minister accuses spies of ignoring MPs over surveillance",
        "body":"<p>A former Labour cabinet minister has warned that GCHQ and Britain's other intelligence agencies appear to be undertaking mass surveillance without parliament's consent because the coalition failed to get the so-called \"snoopers' charter\" passed into law after Liberal Democrat opposition.</p><p>Nick Brown, a former chief whip who sat on the parliamentary committee scrutinising the draft communications data bill, said there was an \"uncanny\" similarity between the GCHQ surveillance programmes exposed by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden and proposals in the first part of the bill.</p><p>The communications data bill – dubbed the \"snoopers' charter\" by critics – would have given GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 much greater powers to gather and save information about people's internet activities but it was shelved in the spring amid Lib Dem fears that it intruded too much into privacy.</p><p>Brown, a Labour MP, said that it \"looks very much like this is what is happening anyway, with or without parliament's consent\" under GCHQ's secret Tempora programme, which was revealed by the Guardian in July in reports based on files leaked by Snowden. Tempora allows GCHQ to harvest, store and analyse millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries by tapping the transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic.</p><p>Brown's remarks closely echo those of Lord Blencathra, the Conservative chairman of the committee and a former Home Office minister, who on Monday said GCHQ may be operating \"outside the law or on the very edge of the law\" because of Tempora.</p><p>But in parliament, Theresa May, the home secretary, told the home affairs select committee there was nothing in the Snowden files that changed the case for new laws giving the security services more powers to monitor the internet. She also described the Guardian's publication of the material as \"damaging to the public interest\" and repeatedly rejected the need for a debate on oversight of the intelligence agencies.</p><p>Afterwards, it emerged that Julian Smith, a Conservative MP, had written to the Metropolitan police asking the force to investigate whether the Guardian has broken the law by communicating intelligence information obtained from Snowden. The MP wrote to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to ask if offences had been committed under Section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000 or the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>A Guardian spokesman said: \"The high public interest in the stories we have responsibly published is evidenced by the debates, presidential review and proposed legislative reforms in the US Congress, throughout Europe and in Westminster. We're surprised that, once again, it is being proposed that terror legislation should be used against journalists.\"</p><p>Brown, an ally of the former prime minister Gordon Brown, also called for \"grown-up cross-party discussions\" to look at how to protect the privacy of individual citizens as the security services seek to expand their ability to monitor the internet.</p><p>\"The similarity between part 1 of the proposed data communications bill and the events Mr Snowden is describing as already taking place is uncanny,\" Brown said. \"It covers the same set of circumstances. The bill was trying to be permissive in that all material could be saved for a year. It now looks very much like this is what is happening anyway, with or without parliament's consent.</p><p>\"I agree with Lord Blencathra's account of the evidence. I was sufficiently concerned not to accept part 1 of the [draft communications data] bill.\"</p><p>On Tuesday night, two other Liberal Democrat members of the joint committee also questioned why the Home Office did not reveal the extent of GCHQ's spying capabilities during the committee's inquiry, which concluded the bill carried a risk of \"trampling on the privacy of citizens\".</p><p>Lord Strasburger, a businessman, said nothing was mentioned about Tempora during two private \"no holds barred sessions with the Home Office\". \"You have to wonder why, even in the secret sessions, none of the witnesses mentioned Project Tempora … It was highly relevant to our work and I believe that deliberate failure to reveal it amounts to misleading parliament,\" he said.</p><p>Last night, Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, mounted a defence of the ability of journalists at her own paper and at the Guardian to publish public interest stories based on the  files leaked by Snowden.</p><p>\"I think … that those articles are very much in the public interest and inform the public,\" she said on BBC's Newsnight.</p><p>On claims by MI5 director general Andrew Parker that newspaper reports were causing \"enormous damage\" to the fight against terrorism, Abramson said that there had been no proof of actual harm to security.</p><p>Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat MP on the committee, also said he<br />thought it was astonishing that May did not reveal the current<br />capabilities of GCHQ to the committee through their Tempora and Prism<br />programmes.</p><p>\"Those of us on the committee were never told by any Home Office officials about the fact the data was already available,\" Huppert said. \"In our report, we accused them of being misleading. It seems they were far more misleading than we could have realised at the time. Presumably, the home secretary knew that this was information they already had available, in which case she was not fully open with the committee. If she didn't know, that raises real questions about her role.\"</p><p>He said the government must reveal which ministers knew about Tempora  after Chris Huhne, the former Lib Dem energy secretary, said he was not aware of the programme during his time in government.</p><p>\"We know the cabinet was not briefed,\" Huppert said. \"We have no idea who was. Was it just the prime minister? Was it a handful of others? Who made the decision not to tell other people? This is incredibly alarming. I hope we will be able to see proper debate and parliamentary scrutiny of this issue. We know that the security services play a very important role but they should operate with public consent.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 16 October 2013. The original piece omitted a paragraph explaining that Julian Huppert was a member of the committee scrutinising the draft communications data bill. The paragraph has been reinstated. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420063709|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|feeabe62cda47cf40b4a5869d69df094f764d625 -->",

I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.\"</p><p>The prime minister's spokesman refused to elaborate on what Cameron meant by the issue of the Guardian disclosures being examined by a select committee.</p><p>There are as many as four committees that might take up David Cameron's suggestion, including the culture select committee, the home affairs select committee, the defence select committee and the intelligence and security select committee.</p><p>The ISC largely meets in private but is due soon to meet the leaders of the spy agencies in public and it is certain that the issues raised by the Guardian, including the impact on national security, will be discussed.</p><p>Cameron did not follow calls by the backbench Tory MP Julian Smith for the police to prosecute.</p><p>Fox had asked the prime minister whether \"we can have a full and transparent assessment about whether the Guardian involvement in the Snowden affair had damaged Britain's national security\".</p><p>He said it was bizarre of the Guardian to claim that leaving Britain's secrets and security personnel more vulnerable was opening a debate about the accountability of the security services.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420138951|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a57fe0e0aa825b332c802c30e9a2bb22302f0040 -->",

        "body":"<p>A powerful group of MPs will investigate the Guardian's publication of stories about mass surveillance based on leaks by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, as part of a wider inquiry into counter-terrorism.</p><p>Keith Vaz, the Labour head of the Commons home affairs committee, said he would look into &quot;elements of the Guardian's involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks&quot; hours after the prime minister suggested a select committee might look at the issue.</p><p>It had emerged the matter would be considered by Vaz's parliamentary committee after former Tory cabinet minister Liam Fox asked him to investigate what damage the Guardian may have caused to national security.</p><p>&quot;I have received a letter from Liam Fox requesting that the home affairs select committee consider elements of the Guardian's involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks,&quot; Vaz said.</p><p>&quot;I will be writing to assure Dr Fox that the committee is currently conducting an inquiry into counter-terrorism and we will be looking at this matter as part of it.&quot;</p><p>A spokesman for Vaz could not confirm whether Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian editor-in-chief, would be called to give evidence, saying this would be a matter for all committee members to decide.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-420173332\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/16/ITNP_PMQS_FOX_GUARDIAN_16_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video><p>Earlier in the day, Fox asked David Cameron for a &quot;full and transparent assessment about the Guardian involvement in the Snowden affair&quot; at prime minister's question time in the House of Commons.</p><p>The Conservative former defence secretary had argued that the Guardian had been guilty of double standards for exposing the scandal of phone hacking by newspapers and yet had gone on to publish secrets from the US National Security Agency taken by Snowden.</p><p>In response, Cameron encouraged investigation of the issues through parliamentary select committees. &quot;The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files,&quot; he told MPs.</p><p>&quot;So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.&quot;</p><p>The prime minister's spokesman refused to elaborate on what Cameron meant by the issue of the Guardian disclosures being examined by a select committee.</p><p>There are as many as four committees that might take up David Cameron's suggestion, including the culture select committee, the home affairs select committee, the defence select committee and the intelligence and security select committee.</p><p>The ISC largely meets in private but is due soon to meet the leaders of the spy agencies in public and it is certain that the issues raised by the Guardian, including the impact on national security, will be discussed.</p><p>Cameron did not directly respond to calls for the police to prosecute by the backbench Tory MP Julian Smith, who has secured a debate on the issue in Westminster Hall on Tuesday next week.</p><p>Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat MP and Tom Watson, a Labour MP who campaigned against phone hacking, are also planning to request a debate in the House of Commons on greater regulatory oversight of the security services.</p><p>A Guardian spokesman said: &quot;The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging. We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p>&quot;That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded - along with the Guardian - for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a Presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182545|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5ff4ed20317a7ee35dfc0f80315b09bed88b65c6 -->",

        "headline":"Extent of spy agencies' surveillance to be investigated by parliamentary body",
        "body":"<p>The extent and scale of mass surveillance undertaken by Britain's spy agencies is to be scrutinised in a major inquiry to be formally launched on Thursday.</p><p>Parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC), the body tasked with overseeing the work of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, will say the investigation is a response to concern raised by the leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, said \"an informed and proper debate was needed\". One Whitehall source described the investigation as \"a public inquiry in all but name\".</p><p>The announcement comes four months after the Guardian, and leading media groups in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency.</p><p>The Guardian has been urging a debate about programmes such as GCHQ's Tempora and the NSA's Prism, which allow the agencies to harvest vast amounts of personal data from millions of people – intelligence that is routinely shared between the two countries.</p><p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee also announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p><p>It will also take written evidence from interested groups and the public, as well as assessing secret material supplied by the intelligence agencies. The Guardian will also consider submitting evidence.</p><p>Conceding that public concerns had to be addressed, Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, added: \"There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security.\"</p><p>The ISC, which has been criticised for being too close to the agencies, has been under pressure to provide more robust scrutiny of the intelligence community. In recent weeks Lord King, a former chair of the committee, Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, and Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, have all raised concerns about the laws governing the secret services and the amount of scrutiny they are subjected too.</p><p>Formally, the committee has decided to broaden an existing inquiry into whether the intelligence laws are \"fit for purpose\".</p><p>Rifkind said: \"In recent months concern has been expressed at the suggested extent of the capabilities available to the intelligence agencies and the impact upon people's privacy as the agencies seek to find the needles in the haystacks that might be crucial to safeguarding national security.\"</p><p>Nick Clegg, who had been asking for the oversight regime to be looked at afresh,  quickly welcomed the committee's move. A source close to the Liberal Democrat leader said on Wednesday night: \"We very much welcome the ISC's decision to broaden the scope of their investigation.</p><p>\"The deputy prime minister has been an outspoken advocate of the need for us to have a proper debate about these complicated and important issues. He very much backs other voices getting involved in that debate and looks forward to the ISC doing some of it in public.\"</p><p>The admission that legitimate issues have been raised by the Guardian investigation also undercuts those on the Conservative benches demanding that the primary response to the Guardian disclosures should be prosecution of the newspaper for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Those demands surfaced again in parliament on Wednesday.</p><p>At prime minister's questions David Cameron criticised the Guardian and urged select committees to hold inquiries, following a question from the former defence secretary Liam Fox asking whether it was double standards to prosecute newspapers that hacked the phones of celebrities, but not those papers that released information that endangered national security.</p><p>Responding, Cameron said: \"The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary, to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.\"</p><p>He added: \"So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.\"</p><p>But a spokesperson for the Guardian said: \"The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging.</p><p>\"We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p>\"That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded – along with the Guardian – for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.\"</p><p>Shortly after Cameron's intervention, it emerged that the Commons home affairs select committee would mount an investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian disclosures. It will also look into whether the paper has endangered national security and potentially broken the law, as part of a wider current investigation into counterterrorism. Rifkind said the ISC would be seeking contributions from outside the agencies \"to ensure that the committee can consider the full range of opinions expressed on these topics. Once it has considered those written submissions it will also hold oral evidence sessions, some of which it expects to hold in public.\"</p><p>Julian Smith, the Tory MP for Skipton who has written to the Metropolitan police calling for the newspaper to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act 2000, has been granted a debate in parliament next week in which \"he will lay out the reasons why I believe that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who seek to protect us\".</p><p>Elsewhere, privacy campaigners gave a cautious welcome to the intelligence committee's inquiry and said they would be prepared to submit evidence. But they all raised fears the ISC was still too sympathetic to the agencies and lacked the necessary clout to stand up to them.</p><p>Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: \"This is a welcome step forward given the widespread concern that Britain's laws are not fit for purpose. However, such a debate cannot be allowed to take place behind closed doors and without pressing questions being asked about the legal justification for what we know to be happening presently at GCHQ and elsewhere.\"</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: \"Some will say better late than never, others fear a tactical whitewash to calm public concern. It's certainly significant that the committee feels compelled to dig a little deeper but that's no substitute for much broader public and political debate.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185802|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|dc7443187264e5fdf17be4bb928925b4ce55b585 -->",

        "headline":"Nick Clegg welcomes inquiry into scale of spy agency work in Britain",
        "body":"<p>Nick Clegg has welcomed the decision of parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC) to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/17/uk-gchq-nsa-surveillance-inquiry-snowden\" title=\"\">launch an inquiry into the extent and scale of mass surveillance</a> undertaken by Britain's spy agencies.</p><p></p><p>The deputy prime minister said it was right to assess how \"big, new, powerful technologies\" are used by the intelligence agencies.</p><p></p><p>Clegg spoke out on his weekly LBC radio phone-in after the ISC, the body tasked with overseeing the work of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, announced an investigation in response to concern raised by the leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The Guardian has published a number of articles based on the leaks.</p><p></p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, said an informed and proper debate was needed. One Whitehall source described the investigation as \"a public inquiry in all but name\".</p><p></p><p>Clegg told LBC radio that it was right to examine the oversight of the intelligence agencies and to examine the extent of the new technologies. He said: \"I think it is entirely legitimate to ask ourselves whether the oversight arrangements – the way in which we make sure the agencies, who by definition have to work in secret, do so in a way which is accountable. If you don't have proper accountability in a way that the public trusts and understands – because quite a lot of the accountability mechanisms we have got at the moment are very much kind of Westminster village stuff – the problem then is people start losing faith in the whole system.</p><p></p><p>\"Then of course there is the bigger issue, a debate which is happening here and on the other side of the Atlantic, which is just how these big, new, powerful technologies are used both by security agencies and indeed by people who wish to do us harm.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg raised concerns about the leaking of information that could help terrorists. Asked by a caller whether he was pleased that the Guardian could face a police investigation into the publication of the Snowden files, after the Conservative MP Julian Smith called on the Metropolitan police to examine the matter, he said: \"Anything that helps terrorists and other people to learn more about the technical methods used by our agencies to keep us safe, and so allow them to do more harm to us, is a very bad thing.\"</p><p>The announcement of the new inquiry comes four months after the Guardian and leading media groups in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency.</p><p>The Guardian has been encouraging a debate about programmes such as GCHQ's Tempora and the NSA's Prism, which allow the agencies to harvest vast amounts of personal data from millions of people – intelligence that is routinely shared between the two countries.</p><p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p><p>It will also take written evidence from interested groups and the public, and assess secret material supplied by the intelligence agencies. The Guardian will also consider submitting evidence.</p><p>Conceding that public concerns had to be addressed, Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, added: \"There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security.\"</p><p>The ISC, which has been criticised for being too close to the agencies, has been under pressure to provide more robust scrutiny of the intelligence community. In recent weeks Lord King, a former chair of the committee, Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, and Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, have all raised concerns about the laws governing the secret services and the amount of scrutiny they are subjected to.</p><p></p><p>Formally, the committee has decided to broaden an existing inquiry into whether the intelligence laws are \"fit for purpose\".</p><p></p><p>Rifkind said: \"In recent months concern has been expressed at the suggested extent of the capabilities available to the intelligence agencies and the impact upon people's privacy as the agencies seek to find the needles in the haystacks that might be crucial to safeguarding national security.\"</p><p></p><p>The admission that legitimate issues have been raised by the Guardian investigation also undercuts those on the Conservative benches demanding that the primary response to the Guardian disclosures should be prosecution of the newspaper for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Those demands surfaced again in parliament on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>At prime minister's questions David Cameron criticised the Guardian and urged select committees to hold inquiries, following a question from the former defence secretary Liam Fox asking whether it was a double standard to prosecute newspapers that hacked the phones of celebrities but not those papers that released information that endangered national security.</p><p></p><p>Responding, Cameron said: \"The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary, to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.</p><p>\"So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.\"</p><p></p><p>A spokesperson for the Guardian said: \"The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging.</p><p></p><p>\"We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p></p><p>\"That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded – along with the Guardian – for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.\"</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Cameron's intervention, it emerged that the Commons home affairs select committee would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mps-investigate-guardian-edward-snowden-leaks\" title=\"\">mount an investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian disclosures</a>. It will also look into whether the paper has endangered national security and potentially broken the law, as part of a wider current investigation into counterterrorism. Rifkind said the ISC would be seeking contributions from outside the agencies \"to ensure that the committee can consider the full range of opinions expressed on these topics. Once it has considered those written submissions it will also hold oral evidence sessions, some of which it expects to hold in public\".</p><p></p><p>Julian Smith, the Tory MP for Skipton who has written to the Metropolitan police calling for the newspaper to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act 2000, has been granted a debate in parliament next week in which \"he will lay out the reasons why I believe that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who seek to protect us\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420234685|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|69766b551fcb3c1c15659fdebb5ac9d0edbe2d8b -->",

        "headline":"Senior Labour MP welcomes public debate over security service powers",
        "body":"<p>Hazel Blears, the senior Labour member of parliament's <a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">intelligence and security committee</a>, said  it was right that a debate was under way in Britain over the powers of the security services, adding that the inquiry into agencies' powerful new capabilities would go wherever the evidence takes it.</p><p>She also hit back at Nick Clegg for suggesting that there needed to be a review of the oversight of the security services, noting that the powers of the ISC had only just been enhanced.</p><p>Blears, a former cabinet minister with responsibility for counter-terrorism, was speaking the day after the ISC announced it was broadening its inquiry into the legal accountability of the services to include the balance between individual privacy and national security.</p><p>Her willingness to talk in public about the inquiry reflects a determination by the ISC to show greater openness about its work. The normally secretive committee, appointed by the prime minister, has tended to rely on statements from its chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, and its sometimes redacted published reports.</p><p>Blears said: \"We are going to ask people to come and give us evidence on these issues, and provided we are not dealing with classified information, then we should be able to do that in public which I think would be very helpful. In the next week or so, I think we are going to be sending out invitations to a wide range of people. There are quite a lot of NGOs and thinktanks, but we want as wide a range of views as we can get. There is a public debate going on, rightly so. Some of what we do is in private because we are dealing with classified information, but if you can do it in public, that is a good thing.</p><p>\"We have had a furore in the past couple of weeks. Some of it has been pretty inaccurate, such as calling for a review of oversight when we have only just done that in the Justice and Security Act.\" Confirming she was referring to Clegg, she said: \"He sounded as if he was not aware of the provisions of the legislation which gives us extra powers to cross-examine witnesses and do a bigger oversight job. We have now got increased powers, we are getting increased resources. The committee is becoming a more powerful body and we will soon be having our first open session with the heads of the agencies. Those are all symbolic of us operating in a more open way as far as is commensurate with some of the stuff we have to examine.</p><p></p><p>\"At the end of the day, it comes down to: 'Have they got the right powers? Are there sufficient safeguards? Are they appropriate for the massive explosion in internet traffic and capabilities?' All of those are inextricably linked with the legal framework. That is what we are about. We are a body of oversight to ensure that the agencies are operating in compliance not just with the law, but with human rights. Increasingly the threat to our national security is migrating from mobile phone to voice-over internet, PlayStation games and all of that.\"</p><p>The ISC is expected to call for evidence as early as next week, but may not start to take oral evidence until the new year when it will have completed its inquiry into the Woolwich murder. Heads of the agencies are due to appear in front of the ISC next month.</p><p>Blears said she did not know if the inquiry would reach a view on whether the Guardian had \"endangered national security\", as alleged by David Cameron. She said: \"We will be taken where the evidence takes us. We will not have very strict limts on the terms of reference because we want to do a proper job.\"</p><p>Clegg again questioned the quality of the oversight of the agencies. Speaking on LBC, the deputy prime minister said: \"I think it is entirely legitimate to ask ourselves whether … the way in which we make sure the agencies, who by definition have to work in secret, do so in a way which is accountable. If you don't have proper accountability in a way that the public trusts and understands – because quite a lot of the accountability mechanisms we have got at the moment are very much kind of Westminster village stuff – the problem then is people start losing faith in the whole system.</p><p>\"Then of course there is the bigger issue, a debate which is happening here and on the other side of the Atlantic, which is just how these big, new, powerful technologies are used both by security agencies and indeed by people who wish to do us harm.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420300007|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c56022c694f95100384ba3f06a23701463f996f3 -->",

        "headline":"New EU rules to curb transfer of data to US after Edward Snowden revelations",
        "body":"<p>New European rules aimed at curbing questionable transfers of data from EU countries to the US are being finalised in Brussels in the first concrete reaction to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden disclosures</a> on US and British mass surveillance of digital communications.</p><p>Regulations on European data protection standards are expected to pass the European parliament committee stage on Monday after the various political groupings agreed on a new compromise draft following two years of gridlock on the issue.</p><p>The draft would make it harder for the big US internet servers and social media providers to transfer European data to third countries, subject them to EU law rather than secret American court orders, and authorise swingeing fines possibly running into the billions for the first time for not complying with the new rules.</p><p>\"As parliamentarians, as politicians, as governments we have lost control over our intelligence services. We have to get it back again,\" said Jan Philipp Albrecht, the German Greens MEP who is steering the data protection regulation through the parliament.</p><p>Data privacy in the EU is currently under the authority of national governments with standards varying enormously across the 28 countries, complicating efforts to arrive at satisfactory data transfer agreements with the US. The current rules are easily sidestepped by the big Silicon Valley companies, Brussels argues.</p><p>The new rules, if agreed, would ban the transfer of data unless based on EU law or under a new transatlantic pact with the Americans complying with EU law.</p><p>\"Without any concrete agreement there would be no data processing by telecommunications and internet companies allowed,\" says a summary of the proposed new regime.</p><p>Such bans were foreseen in initial wording two years ago but were dropped under the pressure of intense lobbying from Washington. The proposed ban has been revived directly as a result of the uproar over operations by the US's National Security Agency (NSA).</p><p>Viviane Reding, the EU's commissioner for justice and the leading advocate in Brussels of a new system securing individuals' rights to privacy and data protection, argues that the new rulebook will rebalance the power relationship between the US and Europe on the issue, supplying leverage to force the American authorities and tech firms to reform.</p><p>\"The recent data scandals prove that sensitivity has been growing on the US side of how important data protection really is for Europeans,\" she told a German foreign policy journal. \"All those US companies that do dominate the tech market and the internet want to have access to our goldmine, the internal market with over 500 million potential customers. If they want to access it, they will have to apply our rules. The leverage that we will have in the near future is thus the EU's data protection regulation. It will make crystal clear that non-European companies, when offering goods and services to European consumers, will have to apply the EU data protection law in full. There will be no legal loopholes any more.\"</p><p>But the proposed rules remain riddled with loopholes for intelligence services to exploit, MEPs admit.</p><p>The EU has no powers over national or European security, for example, nor its own proper intelligence or security services, which are jealously guarded national prerogatives. National security can be and is invoked to ignore and bypass EU rules.</p><p>\"This regulation does not regulate the work of intelligence services,\" said Albrecht. \"Of course, national security is a huge loophole and we need to close it. But we can't close it with this regulation.\"</p><p>Direct deals between the Americans and individual European governments might also allow the rules to be bypassed.</p><p>Parallel to the proposed data privacy rules, there are various other transatlantic arrangements in place regulating European supply to the Americans of air passenger data, financial transactions and banking information aimed at suppressing terrorism funding and the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles\" title=\"\">Safe Harbour</a> accord allowing companies in Europe to send data to companies in the US where, as a result of Snowden, it is clear that that data can then be tapped by the NSA.</p><p>\"The Safe Harbour may not be so safe after all. It could be a loophole because it allows data transfers from EU to US companies, although US data protection standards are lower than our European ones,\" said Reding. \"Safe Harbour is based on self-regulation and codes of conduct. In the light of the recent revelations, I am not convinced that relying on codes of conduct and self-regulation that are not policed in a strict manner offer the best way of protecting our citizens.\"</p><p>The European commission is warning that it could suspend all these agreements unless the US commits to a new regime, but the commission's threats would also run into trouble with national governments, not least the British.</p><p>Brussels and Washington have also been negotiating a deal on police data exchanges for two years, but the talks are deadlocked because there is no legal redress for an EU citizen in the US courts if the system is abused.</p><p>Under the proposed new rules, the commission is calling for fines of up to 2% of a company's annual global turnover if it is found to be in breach, while the parliament calls for up to 5%.</p><p>Senior officials in Brussels describe the current penalties as a joke for mega-companies such as Google or Yahoo. The US-based companies, even when breaking European law, officials say, simply argue that they are not subject to it despite operating in Europe, while they are subject to the secret court orders of the US Fisa system facilitating the work of the NSA.</p><p>\"On the basis of the US Patriot Act, US authorities are asking US companies based in Europe to hand over the data of EU citizens. This is however – according to EU law – illegal,\" said Reding. \"The problem is that when these companies are faced with a request whether to comply with EU or US law, they will usually opt for the American law. Because in the end this is a question of power.\"</p><p>If the new rules are agreed next week by the parliament, they still need to be negotiated with the commission, which broadly supports them, and the 28 governments.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420262884|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6fc5be7b710a02bc230098214d3feb0ccc9edd8b -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain needs to have a full public debate about the scale of internet surveillance to give confidence that state powers are not being abused, the world's five biggest internet companies have told MPs.</p><p>In a joint memo, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo! and Twitter have called for the UK government to allow greater transparency about requests for them to hand over data on their users.</p><p>Their evidence to the home affairs select committee comes after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester\" title=\"\">Guardian's revelations about the scale of mass surveillance</a> by the security services in the US and UK based on leaked documents from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>The files reveal that GCHQ has been tapping undersea fibre-optic cables to get access to vast quantities of internet traffic under its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">Tempora programme</a>. They also disclose that the US National Security Agency has been collecting data directly from the servers of some internet companies, including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, although the firms deny this is done with their knowledge.</p><p>In their memo to MPs, the internet companies do not specifically mention the Snowden leaks but refer to growing public concern about surveillance issues.</p><p>\"We recommend that requests for user data made by the UK government are made as transparent as possible,\" they say. \"Each of our companies already publishes a transparency report and, as public concern grows around the world about the scale of digital surveillance, we believe that greater transparency is important in encouraging a full public debate and maintaining confidence that powers are not being abused.\"</p><p>It is signed by Emma Ascroft, the director of public policy at Yahoo! Europe; Becky Foreman, head of government affairs at Microsoft UK; Theo Bertram, public policy manager at Google UK; Sinead McSweeney, director of public policy for Europe at Twitter; and Simon Milner, director of public policy at Facebook UK.</p><p>Their comments echo calls for more transparency about state data requests in the US, where there has been a storm of political debate about the revelations and a series of follow-up investigations that have forced the Obama administration to consider reforms. Internet companies have been engaged in that US debate.</p><p>The UK authorities have been slower to respond and David Cameron has condemned the Guardian for endangering national security by publishing information from Snowden.</p><p>However, the first major inquiry into the extent of mass surveillance by GCHQ was formally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/17/gchq-mi5-mi6-inquiry-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">launched on Thursday</a> by parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC).</p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, conceded that public concerns had to be addressed, saying: \"There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security.\"</p><p>It comes four months after the Guardian and leading media groups in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the NSA. The Guardian has been urging a debate about Tempora and Prism.</p><p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee also announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p><p>In addition to the ISC inquiry, the Commons home affairs select committee will mount an investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian disclosures. After a request from Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, the committee chaired by the Labour MP Keith Vaz will look into whether the newspaper has endangered national security and potentially broken the law, as part of its investigation into counter-terrorism.</p><p>The developments come after MPs and peers expressed concern that they were not told about the surveillance programmes while scrutinising the communications data bill, commonly known as the snooper's charter, which would have handed greater spying powers to the secret services.</p><p>The joint statement from Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo! also contains a plea for the government not to introduce any more legislation on access to communications data until it has considered reforming international treaties that govern surveillance and law enforcement.</p><p>It suggests they remain opposed to any move to resurrect the communications data bill. Proposed laws handing greater internet surveillance powers to UK authorities were killed off by the Liberal Democrats this year but MPs and peers on a committee scrutinising the bill have warned that spies already appear to have access to this kind of data through the Tempora programme.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420347368|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|09c27467c79944266d69fb40a264f7b6e093bfe3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's most senior prosecutor has launched a robust defence of journalists who break the law pursuing investigations that have a genuine public interest. <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/guidance_for_prosecutors_on_assessing_the_public_interest_in_cases_affecting_the_media_/\" title=\"\">Legal guidelines had been drafted</a>, he said, to protect reporters.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions</a> (DPP), insisted it \"would be very unhealthy if you had a situation where a journalist felt that they needed to go to their lawyer before they pursued any lead or asked any question\".</p><p>In an interview with the Guardian, Starmer said: \"We've got to recognise that in the course of journalism, journalists will rub up against the criminal law and that is why, in our guidelines, we took the approach that we would assess where there was evidence of a criminal offence, whether the public interest in what the journalist was trying to achieve outweighed the overall criminality.\"</p><p>Starmer spoke at the end of another week in which the furore over the leaks from the whistleblower <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> has reverberated around Westminster. One backbench Tory MP has called for the Metropolitan police to investigate the Guardian for publishing stories about GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes.</p><p>Without mentioning Snowden, Starmer made clear he drafted guidelines specifically to allow journalists to pursue difficult stories without fear of prosecution, so long as a public interest threshold had been reached. He acknowledged there were \"potentially many offences that journalists could commit in the course of their business\" but said guidelines were there to offer them protection.</p><p>\"There are lots of examples of journalists who, on the face of it, may have broken the criminal law but have obviously pursued a greater good in doing so,\" said Starmer, who will step down as DPP at the end of the month.</p><p>\"That is why we wanted to issue guidelines, and our approach is very clear: first we look to see if an offence has been committed; well, if not, that's obviously the end of it. If an offence has been committed, we then say: did the public interest in what the journalist was trying to achieve outweigh the overall criminality, taking into account the nature of the lead, how much information there was, what they were trying to uncover etc?\"</p><p>He added: \"Defining of the public interest is always very, very difficult. We did go through a consultation exercise on that and I think we've got it about right.\"</p><p>Starmer joined lawyers, academics and senior members of the intelligence community who have said the laws governing Britain's intelligence agencies need to be reviewed in the light of Snowden's revelations about mass surveillance programmes  run by GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency.</p><p>The Intelligence Services Act was passed in 1994, and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in 2000 – long before some recent technological capabilities became available. \"I think there's a growing recognition that the legislation in place needs to be looked at again to see whether it works well in the current environment … some of the old laws should be looked at again. I think most people accept that it is necessary to have some surveillance in a democratic society. I think most people accept that it's important to have limits and clear safeguards on that.\"</p><p>The freedom of speech campaign group <a href=\"http://www.article19.org/\" title=\"\">Article 19</a> described calls for the Guardian to be prosecuted as deeply concerning because the Snowden disclosures had kickstarted \"a much-needed public debate about blanket surveillance\".</p><p>The New-York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said Scotland Yard's inquiry was \"chilling.\"</p><p>Earlier this week the home affairs select committee said it would investigate the Guardian's publication of stories about mass surveillance as part of a wider inquiry into counter-terrorism.</p><p>Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has said the extent of state surveillance needs to be properly debated. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said last week<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/guardian-correct-publish-nsa-vince-cable\" title=\"\"> the Guardian had performed a considerable public service</a> by publishing stories about surveillance. He said the Guardian had been \"entirely correct and right\" and \"courageous\".</p><p>Starmer's predecessor as DPP, Lord Macdonald, earlier this week accused the head of MI5 of using \"foolish, self-serving rhetoric\" to resist legitimate calls for Britain's intelligence agencies to face more scrutiny.</p><p>Macdonald said: \"It seems very obvious that when it comes to surveillance and techniques of domestic spying, the law should be the master of technology. Anything else risks a spiralling out of control, an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power.\"</p><p></p><h2>Sun journalist charged</h2><p></p><p>A journalist from the Sun has been charged with offences relating to the alleged theft of Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh's mobile phone.</p><p>Nick Parker, the Sun's chief foreign correspondent, is accused of one offence of receiving stolen goods and one offence of unauthorised access to computer material. A second man, Michael Ankers, 29, from south-west London, was charged with theft, over a mobile phone allegedly stolen from McDonagh in 2010.</p><p>They will appear at Westminster magistrates' court on 6 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420373140|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7b174b6b4eed268a2897ad65472a6168d33868cc -->",
