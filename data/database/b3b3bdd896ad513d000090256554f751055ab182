She claimed she had learned that Palme had been killed by an entrepreneur who feared the politician was a threat to his business.</p><p>The author, <a href=\"http://www.gunnarwall.se/\" title=\"\">Gunnar Wall</a>, said he had engaged in email correspondence with Rausing, who told him she had written to the businessman on three occasions about the allegations. In one email to Wall she wrote: \"Don't forget to investigate if I should suddenly die! Just joking, I hope.\"</p><p>Wall told the Guardian: \"When her emails stopped, I did not think too much about it, until I heard that she had died in circumstances that were unclear.\"</p><p>\"She also told me that she was going to inform the prosectors in Sweden and it seemed like she had some arrangement to meet them.\"</p><p>Hans Kristian Rausing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/10367712\" title=\"\">was given a 10-month suspended custodial sentence earlier this month</a> after admitting preventing the lawful burial of his wife, a fellow drug addict.

However, the appeal court later ruled that her eyewitness account was not credible and released him.
