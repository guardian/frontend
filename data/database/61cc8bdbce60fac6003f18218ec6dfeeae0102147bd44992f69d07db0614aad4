We will cover the interviews and reactions in a new live blog we&apos;re launching momentarily.</p> <p><strong>• The Syria debate underwent a sudden shift today, from the question of US strikes to potential new diplomatic headway in the form of Assad cutting some kind of deal that could diminish his chemical weapons arsenal. </strong></p> <p><strong>• Russia called on Syria to turn control of its chemical weapons arsenal over to international authorities as prelude to the arsenal&apos;s destruction. The Syrian foreign minister immediately &quot;welcomed&quot; the demand.</strong> The swerve in Russian rhetoric was variously depicted as a &quot;stalling tactic&quot; to put off US military strikes and as a sign of potential new diplomatic progress.</p> <p><strong>• The sudden shift in the Syria debate originated with apparently offhand remarks by US secretary of state John Kerry Monday morning.</strong> In a London news conference, Kerry said Assad could avoid strikes by surrendering control of &quot;every single bit&quot; of his arsenal to the international community by the end of the week. Soon afterward the state department walked back the statement, said Kerry was making a &quot;hypothetical&quot; &quot;rhetorical argument.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• And yet top US officials, including deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken, state department spokeswoman Marie Harf and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton appeared to take the proposal seriously.</strong> The White House said it would take a &quot;hard look&quot; at the proposal. All of the above stipulated that they did not expect much and that the push toward US strikes continues apace.</p> <p><strong>• At least 49 people have died from violence in Syria on Monday, including 25 in Damascus and environs,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=734641856562953&amp;l=ef4e5ac1f1\">according to</a> the Local Coordination Committees activist group.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T21:50:31.956Z\">at 10.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-522e3a57e4b0b4804819a481\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T21:15:03.554Z\">10.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov his comments about Syria averting a U.S. military strike by turning over its chemical weapons within a week were rhetorical and <strong>not meant to be a proposal</strong>, a senior U.S. Official said on Monday, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kerry also voiced &quot;serious skepticism&quot; when Lavrov offered to explore the idea, saying that the United States would take a look at any serious proposal, but this could not be a reason to slow the White House&apos;s efforts to secure congressional authorization to use force against Syria, the official told reporters traveling back from London with Kerry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-522e32d0e4b0716040115e8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-09T20:42:57.029Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This blog has featured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">firsthand</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/syria-crisis-iran-says-all-efforts-must-be-made-to-prevent-military-action-live#block-521f73f2e4b0cdd8c1412923\">interviews</a> with opposition fighters who are not happy about the idea of US strikes inside Syria because the <strong>fighters assume the real targets are them, not Assad</strong>.

Renewed diplomacy could make it more difficult for the US to launch any strikes. Any real or perceived movement by Assad on chemical weapons could compound the difficulty.

They cause vast destruction, wrecking the lives of civilians and increasing their dependency on their oppressors. Missile attacks are mere displays of power, usually as a spectacular alternative to a ground assault. Their military ineffectiveness makes them susceptible to mission creep.</p> <p>Already Obama has shifted from threatening a &quot;surgical punitive strike&quot; to a massively destructive one, intended to aid the insurgency and thus assist in regime change. This happens to be against international law. More to the point, such missile attacks did not &quot;work&quot; in Serbia, Iraq or Afghanistan. They merely served as a prelude to chaos on the ground and pressure for ground intervention.</p> <p>If Obama means to achieve regime change in Syria he should be ready to invade. Since he lacks the will and the means for this, he is merely heading for a second humiliation. He should back off and deploy diplomacy and humanitarian relief instead.

He said the entire US intelligence commnity was united in believing Assad was responsible.</p> <p>Kerry was speaking alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\">William Hague</a>, who was forced to deny that he had been pushed to the sidelines by the House of Commons decision 10 days ago to reject the use of UK force in Syria.</p> <p>The US Senate is due to vote this week on whether to approve an attack and Kerry was ambivalent over whether Barack Obama would use his powers to ignore the Senate, if it were to reject an attack.</p> <p>Kerry said the US had tracked the Syrian chemical weapons stock for many years, adding that it &quot;was controlled in a very tight manner by the Assad regime … Bashar al-Assad and his brother Maher al-Assad, and a general are the three people that have the control over the movement and use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>&quot;But under any circumstances, the Assad regime is the Assad regime, and the regime issues orders, and we have regime members giving these instructions and engaging in these preparations with results going directly to President Assad.</p> <p>&quot;We are aware of that so we have no issue here about responsibility.
