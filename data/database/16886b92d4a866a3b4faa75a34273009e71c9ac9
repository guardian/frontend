You have achieved all of this while working ceaselessly for the interests of the Scottish people within the United Kingdom.</p> <p>&nbsp;As we discussed when we spoke on Friday, I believe we now need to draw on different experience in the final year running up to the referendum itself and I am keen that just as we have benefited from your formidable skills over the past three years that we take advantage of other experience within our ranks during this period.</p> <p>&nbsp;I am immensely grateful for all the work you have done at the Scotland Office and for the very significant contribution you have made to the first coalition government in 70 years. I have no doubt that there will be an opportunity for your talents to be deployed in government in the future.</p> <p>&nbsp;Yours sincerely,</p> <p>&nbsp;Nick Clegg</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's Moore's reply.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Nick</p> <p>Thank you for your letter.</p> <p>&nbsp;I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be part of the cabinet. Putting Liberal Democrat policies into practice in government has been our party's ambition for a very long time and I have valued the chance to play a key role in it.</p> <p>This has been, and will continue to be, a hugely important time in Scottish politics and that has made it a challenging and rewarding time to be Secretary of State for Scotland. Taking the Scotland Act through Parliament and negotiating the Edinburgh Agreement have been the highlights of my time in office, as well as, more recently, making the case for Scotland to stay part of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>However, I have also valued the chance to get out and about around Scotland week after week to listen to the challenges facing people and make sure those are understood by colleagues elsewhere in government. I am glad that there are now early signs of economic recovery, but we must not lose sight of the huge difficulties many people still face.</p> <p>&nbsp;Over the last few years I have worked with a superb team of civil servants and advisers in the Scotland Office, and other government departments, in very challenging circumstances. I do not think the support teams for ministers always get the credit they deserve: I am very grateful for the support they have given me.</p> <p>&nbsp;In leaving the Scotland Office I am pleased that Alistair will be succeeding me.

The Prime Minister would do well to stick with rather than sack the women he has in Cabinet already. But if there were vacancies, the women Ministers below Cabinet level are: Helen Grant, Esther McVey, Chloe Smith, Anna Soubry and Elizabeth Truss. Cameron will have an eye to regional balance as well as political outlook if he is looking to promote one or more of them.</p> <p>McVey and Truss probably top the list. McVey is good at presenting, is handling a difficult brief deftly (she is Minister for Disabled People at a time of spending retrenchment), and, uniquely, is a Tory woman Minister from the most crucial swing area of all – the north-west. Truss may have lost a battle over childcare policy with Nick Clegg, but she hasn't lost her standing in government: she fronted the case for Michael Gove's GCSE changes last week. Soubry may be promoted if Cameron and the whips want to please the Party's left and like the way she fires from the hip.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2446112/Bus-drivers-son-grew-crime-ridden-area-Bristol-tipped-cabinet-role-reshuffle.html\">• The Mail on Sunday predicted that the Treasury minister Sajid Javid would be promoted to near &quot;the door of the cabinet&quot; in the reshuffle.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ken-clarke-faces-sack-david-2343435\">• The Sunday Mirror suggested that Kenneth Clarke, the veteran minister without portfolio, will be sacked.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-and-ed-miliband-vote-for-women-in-reshuffles-8861353.html\">• The Independent on Sunday said David Cameron would promote women.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While one or two cabinet ministers may see their jobs change, the main shake-up, expected tomorrow, will be in the junior ministerial ranks, with Liz Truss, Anna Soubry and Helen Grant tipped for promotion, along with Jessica Lee, a relatively unknown MP who is parliamentary aide to Dominic Grieve. The Prime Minister was heavily criticised a year ago for a reshuffle which saw the number of women in the Cabinet decrease from five to four.</p> <p>There were rumours in Whitehall this weekend that Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will be moved from his post – although not out of the Cabinet altogether – after complaints that the case for HS2 has not been made clear enough to voters. Mr Cameron and George Osborne are considering giving the job to someone who can better argue the case in the media and in Parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/66fc12d6-2e9b-11e3-9e14-00144feab7de.html#ixzz2h1UFWBxU\">• George Parker in the Financial Times (subscription) says Tory MPs who are female and northern are particularly likely to do well.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Tory reshuffle is not expected to extend to the cabinet but those tipped for promotion include Liz Truss, children’s minister; Amber Rudd, George Osborne’s parliamentary aide; and Claire Perry, another close ally of the chancellor.</p> <p>&nbsp;Those few Tory MPs who happen to be women and northerners are likely to be especially blessed: Jane Ellison, a Yorkshire-born former manager at John Lewis, and Esther McVey, a Liverpudlian former television presenter and businesswoman, are well-regarded in Number 10.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/10/female-and-northern-mps-charge-your-phone-the-reshuffle-is-on/\">• James Forsyth at Coffee House says Chloe Smith wanted to stand down to concentrate on holding her seat.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Chloe Smith quitting is going to tempt everyone to dust off the footage of that Paxman interview with her. But, I hear, that Smith’s desire to protect her own marginal seat was more important to the decision. There was actually a sense that Smith had recovered relatively well from that disastrous interview. So, Number 10 was fairly surprised when she wrote to the Prime Minister last month saying she wanted to step down.</p> <p>Tomorrow, we’ll hear who has been promoted. It is expected to be a good day for women and northern MPs. As I <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2446274/JAMES-FORSYTH-How-Eds-energy-price-freeze-gave-George-shivers.html?ico=home%5Eeditors_choice\">say in the Mail on Sunday</a>, Esther McVey is tipped for a second successive promotion. Amber Rudd, George Osborne’s PPS, is another who’d be well advised to make sure her phone is fully charged tomorrow. While the straight talking, Cameron loyalist Kris Hopkins is almost expected to do well. The promotion of this Yorkshire MP and former army private would help counteract the idea that the Tories are just a posh, southern party.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Labour</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rachel-reeves-lined-up-promotion-2339840\">• The Daily Mirror suggested that Rachel Reeves could become the new shadow work and pensions secretary and Tristram Hunt the new shadow education secretary.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2013/10/reshuffle-another-shadow-minister-steps-down-anne-maguire-tells-us-why-shes-leaving-labours-front-bench/\">• LabourList says two Labour shadow ministers, Robert Flello and Anne Maguire, have already stepped down.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525273e0e4b01e4020f8d932\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T09:43:29.213+01:00\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>There is definitely a Lib Dem reshuffle happening today.

I don't know how many we have done now, but until a new one starts, you forget how awful the process is.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's Alastair Campbell, writing in his diary on in May 2002. With two reshuffles expected today, that's a good place to start.</p> <p>Neither Downing Street nor the Labour party have formally confirmed that they are reshuffling today, and so there's a possibility that we could get to 6pm and with the headline I've put on this blog looking premature (like all those headlines about the &quot;pregnant&quot; panda in Edinburgh zoo - whatever happened to her). But Labour sources are saying that their reshuffle will be over before the Commons returns from its recess which suggests that, unless Ed Miliband wants to wrap it all up before lunch tomorrow, he's going to go today. And in some respects the government one has already started, because, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/06/chloe-smith-john-randall-resign\">as Rowena Mason reports on today's Guardian,</a> three ministers have already resigned.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>'s long-serving deputy whip, John Randall, and his youngest minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/chloe-smith\">Chloe Smith</a>, have resigned ahead of a reshuffle in which the prime minister is expected to promote a number of women.</p> <p>Downing Street's surprise announcements sparked speculation that Cameron will shake up junior roles within his team as early as Monday. They follow the resignation of transport minister Simon Burns, who wants to stand as deputy Commons speaker, with rising stars such as Sajid Javid, Esther McVey and Nicky Morgan tipped for bigger jobs.</p> <p>Randall, who has served in the Tory whips' office for 13 years, said he informed the prime minister last year that he wanted to return to the backbenches. He is best known for his role in the resignation of his boss, Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip, over the &quot;plebgate&quot; scandal just over a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>And even if we don't get all the names today, there's not much point blogging about anything else, because the two reshuffles may the the only things people are talking about at Westminster today.</p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary at about 1pm and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419226472|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|b5918d9e35800e6f4b5ddd5507d495e32183759c -->",

        "headline":"Cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ spying programmes, says Chris Huhne",
        "body":"<p>Cabinet ministers and members of the national security council were told nothing about the existence and scale of the vast data-gathering programmes run by British and American intelligence agencies, a former member of the government has revealed.</p><p>Chris Huhne, who was in the cabinet for two years until 2012, said ministers were in \"utter ignorance\" of the two biggest covert operations, Prism and Tempora. The former Liberal Democrat MP admitted he was shocked and mystified by the surveillance capabilities disclosed by the Guardian from files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>\"The revelations put a giant question mark into the middle of our surveillance state,\" he said. \"The state should not feel itself entitled to know, see and memorise everything that the private citizen communicates. The state is our servant.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">Writing in Monday's Guardian</a>, Huhne also questioned whether the Home Office had deliberately misled parliament about the need for the communications data bill when GCHQ, the government's eavesdropping headquarters, already had remarkable and extensive snooping capabilities.</p><p>He said this lack of information and accountability showed \"the supervisory arrangements for our intelligence services need as much updating as their bugging techniques\".</p><p>Over the past three months the Guardian has made a series of disclosures about the activities of GCHQ and its much bigger American counterpart, the National Security Agency. Two of the most significant programmes uncovered in the Snowden files were Prism, run by the NSA, and Tempora, which was set up by GCHQ. Between them, they allow the agencies to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries.</p><p>As a cabinet minister and member of the national security council (NSC), Huhne said he would have expected to be told about these operations, particularly as they were relevant to proposed legislation.</p><p>\"The cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ's Tempora or its US counterpart, the NSA's Prism, nor about their extraordinary capability to hoover up and store personal emails, voice contact, social networking activity and even internet searches.</p><p>\"I was also on the national security council, attended by ministers and the heads of the Secret [Intelligence Service, MI6] and Security Service [MI5], GCHQ and the military. If anyone should have been briefed on Prism and Tempora, it should have been the NSC.</p><p>\"I do not know whether the prime minister or the foreign secretary (who has oversight of GCHQ) were briefed, but the NSC was not. This lack of information, and therefore accountability, is a warning that the supervision of our intelligence services needs as much updating as their bugging techniques.\"</p><p>Huhne said Prism and Tempora \"put in the shade Tony Blair's proposed ID cards, 90-day detention without trial and the abolition of jury trials\".</p><p>He added: \"Throughout my time in parliament, the Home Office was trying to persuade politicians to invest in 'upgrading' Britain's capability to recover data showing who is emailing and phoning whom. Yet this seems to be exactly what GCHQ was already doing. Was the Home Office trying to mislead?</p><p>\"The Home Office was happy to allow the NSC and the cabinet – let alone parliament – to remain in utter ignorance of Prism/Tempora while deciding on the communications data bill.\"</p><p>The draft bill would have given police and the security services access, without a warrant, to details of all online communication in the UK – such as the time, duration, originator and recipient, and the location of the device from which it was made. The legislation was eventually dropped after splits in the coalition.</p><p>Proper scrutiny of the intelligence agencies was vital, said Huhne, and surveillance techniques needed to be tempered. \"Joseph Goebbels was simply wrong when he argued that 'if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear'. Information is power, and the necessary consequence is that privacy is freedom. Only totalitarians pry absolutely.\"</p><p>Huhne, formerly the energy and climate change minister, was jailed this year after he admitted perverting the course of justice over claims his ex-wife took speeding points for him. In February he was sentenced to eight months in prison but was released after serving 62 days.</p><p>His intervention comes as concern about the oversight and scrutiny of Britain's spy agencies grows. While former members of the intelligence community insist GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 operate with integrity and within the law, even they have questioned whether the oversight regime is fit for purpose following the Snowden revelations.</p><p>Over the last few days a former member of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, a former director of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><p>On Monday, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6 will add his weight to the calls for change. David Bickford told the Guardian Britain's intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high.</p><p>Bickford said the government should pass responsibility to the courts because of widespread \"dissatisfaction with the covert, intrusive powers of the UK intelligence and law enforcement agencies\".</p><p>\"Whether this is based on perception or reality doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"As long as government ministers continue to authorise the agencies' eavesdropping, telephone and electronic surveillance, and informant approval, the public will believe that there is an unhealthy seamless relationship between them.\" Bickford said it was time for ministers to \"step out of the equation and leave the authorisation of these highly intrusive methods to the judiciary\".</p><p>Bickford was drafted in to MI5 and MI6 following a series of scandals, including the furore over the book Spycatcher, written by the senior former MI5 officer Peter Wright. He worked for almost a decade until 1995 and still advises governments on countering international organised crime and terrorist money laundering.</p><p>Bickford said giving judges rather than cabinet ministers responsibility for authorising sensitive operations would \"reduce the risk of perception of collusion … and limit the room for accusations of political interference.\"</p><p>\"Government may argue that all this is unnecessary as there is adequate oversight of the agencies. However, that cannot substitute for independent judicial authority at the coal face.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, on Sunday, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) condemned the way the British government had threatened legal action against the Guardian newspaper unless it destroyed the copy of the Snowden files it had in London.</p><p>\"WAN-IFRA calls on democratic governments to recognise that acts of intimidation and surveillance against the press risk undermining the fabric of transparent, accountable governance,\" the organisation's board said in a resolution issued during its meeting on the eve of this week's World Publishing Expo in Berlin, Germany.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191378|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|8be66ff1adeddb3124984db75389980b83aa8e00 -->",

        "body":"<p>Libya has demanded an explanation for the \"kidnapping\" of one of its citizens by American special forces, hours after a separate US military raid on a terrorist target in Somalia ended in apparent failure and retreat.</p><p>In Tripoli the US army's Delta force seized alleged al-Qaida leader Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, known by his alias Abu Anas al-Liby and wanted for the 1998 bombings of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/aug/08/kenya.garyyounge\" title=\"\">US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> that killed more than 220 people.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/world/africa/a-terrorism-suspect-long-known-to-prosecutors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=1&amp;\">New York Times reported</a> that Liby was being held in military custody and interrogated on board a navy ship, the USS Antonio, in the Mediterranean.</p><p>But US navy Seals suffered a major setback when they launched an amphibious assault to capture an Islamist militant leader said to be Ahmed Godane, described as Africa's most wanted man and the architect of last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya-terror\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate shopping</a> mall in Kenya. The elite Seals were beaten back by heavy fire and apparently abandoned equipment that the Somali militants photographed and posted on the internet.</p><p>As dramatic details of Saturday's twin operations emerged, US secretary of state John Kerry insisted that terrorists \"can run but they can't hide\" <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/us-military-bases-africa\" title=\"\">, but faced growing questions about America's military reach in Africa</a> and the consequences of unilateral aggression.</p><p>Speaking in Indonesia on Monday, Kerry said the seizure of Liby complied with US law, the Associated Press reported. He said the suspect was a \"legal and appropriate target\" for the US military and would face justice in court. It was important not to \"sympathise\" with wanted terrorists, Kerry said.</p><p>Liby was captured outside his family home at 6.15am in Noufle'een, a quiet suburb in eastern Tripoli, according to witnesses, but there were conflicting reports over who took him. His brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press that Liby was parking when a convoy of three vehicles encircled his car. Armed gunmen smashed the car's window and seized Liby's gun before grabbing him and taking him away, the report said. The brother said Liby's wife saw the kidnapping from her window and described the abductors as foreign-looking armed \"commandos\".</p><p>But Liby's son Abdullah insisted Libyan forces were involved. Appearing on Tripoli's Nabir TV station, he said: \"The people who took my father were Libyan, not Americans – they spoke with Tripoli accents.</p><p>\"My mother was listening to the voices in the street and could see it all through the window. There were two cars and a bus with blacked-out windows and no number plates.\"</p><p>He said his father was dragged from his car and arrested while it was still moving, and the vehicle, driverless, continued driving empty down the road.</p><p>Liby, who was thought to be a computer specialist for al-Qaida and lived in Manchester in the UK during the 1990s, is believed to be 49 and on the FBI's most-wanted list with a $5m (£3m) bounty on his head. Pentagon spokesman George Little said he is \"currently lawfully detained by the US military in a secure location outside of Libya\".</p><p>Liby was expected eventually to be sent to New York for criminal prosecution, the New York Times reported.</p><p>Libya's government refused to say whether its forces were involved in the arrest and claimed it had not been informed in advance. A statement from the prime minister, Ali Zaidan, said: \"The Libyan government is following the news of the kidnapping of a Libyan citizen who is wanted by US authorities. The Libyan government has contacted US authorities to ask them to provide an explanation.\"</p><p>Thousands of miles away in Somalia, US special forces carried out a raid that was no less audacious but had a very different outcome. It was reportedly planned a week and a half ago in response to the Nairobi attack and came 20 years to the week after an American mission that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/01/black-hawk-down-reel-history\" title=\"\">infamously went awry</a> when Somali fighters shot down two Black Hawk helicopters.</p><p>Members of Seal Team Six – the unit that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan hideout in 2011 – swam ashore from speedboats before members of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab rose for dawn prayers, officials and witnesses said. They stormed a two-storey beachside house in Barawe said to be occupied by foreign members of al-Shabaab and battled their way inside, a fighter who gave his name as Abu Mohamed told AP. There was a heavy gunbattle at about 2.30am on Saturday, according to locals in Barawe, about 60 miles south of the capital Mogadishu. Mohamed Hassan, a schoolteacher, said: \"Nearly an hour before the morning prayer I heard dogs bark and I got up, but within minutes I heard small gun fire towards the direction of the beach. I raised my ears up as the shooting continued and continued. Soon it became like an exchange of fire. Then I heard one big explosion and two other explosions occurred. I could not go outside so I remained in my room to wait what was happening.\"</p><p>Hassan said the shooting he could hear was that of al-Shaabab's fighters because he understood the US forces were using silencer guns so no one could hear their shooting. \"In the morning, we saw people gathering near the house the US forces targeted and there was a lot of blood everywhere. The al-Shabaab fighters told us not to go to the direction of the house. I saw one dead and two others injured but they were not very critical.\"</p><p>No one in Barawe town could have imagined such an attack, he added, and they kept saying only \"white soldiers attacking Barawe town\". Local residents said late on Saturday that al-Shabaab deployed additional fighters in Barawe to keep guard at the beach where the navy Seals landed.</p><p>US officials told AP that the Seals encountered fiercer resistance than expected, so after a 15- to 20-minute firefight, the unit leader decided to abort the mission and they swam away.</p><p>A local resident, Haji Nur, said he saw military equipment which al-Shabaab claimed to have confiscated from the soldiers. \"I saw in the centre of the town a crowd of people gathering and looked at three rounds of M16 ammunition, one US-made hand grenade and one also a bulletproof jacket.\"</p><p>Al-Shabaab, which has a formal alliance with al-Qaida and claimed responsibility for the Nairobi mall killings that killed at least 67 people, posted what it claimed were pictures of the equipment on the web.</p><p>Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Mus'ab, a spokesman for al-Shabaab, said: \"Early on Saturday morning, around 2am, white soldiers attacked a house resided in by some members of the Mujahideen leaders in Somalia. They came from a waiting speedboat from warship and as they were approaching the house, our Mujahideen fighters repulsed them. They ran away. We chased them until they have reached the seaside where they urgently boarded their speedboats.\"</p><p>Mus'ab said one al-Shabaab member had died and claimed that the Seals lost a \"senior officer\". US officials said there were no US casualties in either the Somali or Libyan operation.</p><p>A resident of Barawe who gave his name as Mohamed Bile told the AP that militants closed down the town in the hours after the assault, and that all traffic and movements have been restricted. Militants were carrying out house-to-house searches, likely to find evidence that a spy had given intelligence to a foreign power used to launch the attack, he said.</p><p>A Somali intelligence official was quoted as saying that Godane, the al-Shabaab leader also known Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the target of Saturday's raid. Mohamed Ansari, a former al-Shabaab member now working with Somalia's counter-terrorism unit in Mogadishu, said: \"Godane is the only big fish in Barawe to hunt. Godane as the top leader of al-Shabaab and the only planner of the group's operations is seen as the mastermind of Westgate mall siege in Nairobi.\"</p><p>Unlike his Libyan counterpart, Somali prime minister Abdi Farah Shirdon welcomed the US intervention. \"We have close cooperation with the world, especially the western countries in the fight against al-Shabaab,\" he said in Mogadishu on Sunday. \"We welcome any operation to hunt the terrorist leaders and we are at the forefront. Al-Shabaab is a Somali problem, a regional problem and world problem.\"</p><p>The dual raids were a vivid of expression of how the <a href=\"http://www.africom.mil\" title=\"\">US has quietly been building its military capacity in Africa</a>. Kerry, who is in Indonesia for an economic summit, said: \"We hope that this makes clear that the United States of America will never stop in the effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror. Members of al-Qaida and other terrorist organisations literally can run but they can't hide.\"</p><p>But a diplomatic source focused on Somalia said: \"This is knee-jerk stuff and smacks of a massive failure of intelligence. Are extrajudicial killings and covert kidnapping raids the best way of dealing with the problem? Why is the international response so feeble?\"</p><p>But Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in South Africa, said that while it was in the interest of African governments to fight terrorism, he does not \"think the heavy-handed and unilateral way the US acts is helpful and it risks causing further instability, especially where there are weak governments like in Libya and Somalia\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191176|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|7582fe90bdb6de0348ac7c1ddc7cb12727645ab2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Some of the 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists being detained in Russia while awaiting piracy charges are being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, while others are held in \"extremely cold\" cells, according to the head of Greenpeace.</p><p>Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International's executive director, told the Guardian that the crew had been split up into several prisons across the port city of Murmansk in north-west Russia, which is in the Arctic Circle. Three of the group have been sent to a prison 150km away.</p><p>Naidoo said the organisation would have to \"take into account\" the way the protesters had been treated, but he added that Greenpeace had not been silenced by intimidation in the past and would continue to show \"leadership\" on the Arctic issue.</p><p>Over the weekend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/06/worldwide-vigils-greenpeace-activists-russian-authorities\" title=\"\">Vigils were held around the world to free the \"Arctic 30\"</a>, with celebrities including actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn joining an estimated 800 people who gathered outside the Russian embassy in London.</p><p>The activists, who come from a total of 18 countries and include six Britons, were detained after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic\" title=\"\">the Russian coastguard seized their vessel</a> following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/18/greenpeace-activists-russian-arctic-oil\" title=\"\">their protest in September against a Gazprom-owned oil platform in the Arctic</a>, Russia's first offshore drilling in the Barents Sea.</p><p>Naidoo said: \"Some of the colleagues are in cells which are pretty warm and reasonably OK to be in … whereas some are in cells that are extremely cold. This is the Arctic we are talking about.\"</p><p>Although several of the activists were being held in cells where they could interact with one another, Naidoo said that \"some are held in solitary where they are in the cell for 23 hours and they have one hour for exercise\".</p><p>Naidoo said he did not think splitting up the campaigners had been done maliciously and that he was grateful they had all met with consular representatives.</p><p>One of the Britons being held, Alexandra Harris, who has been named along with videographer Kieron Bryan, Philip Ball, Anthony Perrett, Frank Hewetson and Iain Rogers, <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1149872/greenpeace-piracy-charges-activist-falls-ill\" title=\"\">became ill earlier this month</a> and was taken to a hospital for examination but did not need treatment. Naidoo said that arrangements had been made for her medication. The other journalist is a Russian photographer, Denis Sinyakov.</p><p>The Greenpeace activists are being held for what the Russian courts have described as pretrial detention for two months, before facing piracy charges which carry a potential prison sentence of 15 years. \"Detention without trial is recognised as being unjust, unfair, and unacceptable,\" Naidoo said.</p><p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/25/vladimir-putin-greenpeace-kenya-mall-attack\" title=\"\">recently defended the actions of the coastguard</a>, saying they could not have known who the Greenpeace activists approaching the oil rig were, but said: \"I&nbsp;don't know the details of what went on, but it's completely obvious they aren't pirates.\"</p><p>Naidoo said that the strong response by the Russian authorities, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/24/greenpeace-activists-arctic-oil-russia\" title=\"\">which allowed a similar operation by Greenpeace in 2012 without arrests</a>, would not lead him to rule out future actions in Russia.</p><p>\"The events that have occurred we will have to take into account. We will have to think about what sort of actions we take in the future. As an organisation, we have never been silenced by repression from governments … If we are to save the Arctic, prevent catastrophic climate change, and resisting the inaction on the part of governments who should be taking leadership, we will do that,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419237608|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|b219f5d4a4ca5e50429d0a69119026b116a693c0 -->",

The cell, with its different compartments called organelles, faces a similar problem: cells produce molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines and enzymes that have to be delivered to other places inside the cell, or exported out of the cell, at exactly the right moment. Timing and location are everything. Miniature bubble-like vesicles, surrounded by membranes, shuttle the cargo between organelles or fuse with the outer membrane of the cell and release their cargo to the outside. This is of major importance, as it triggers nerve activation in the case of transmitter substances, or controls metabolism in the case of hormones. How do these vesicles know where and when to deliver their cargo?</p> <p>Traffic congestion reveals genetic controllers</p> <p>Randy Schekman was fascinated by how the cell organizes its transport system and in the 1970s decided to study its genetic basis by using yeast as a model system. In a genetic screen, he identified yeast cells with defective transport machinery, giving rise to a situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system. Vesicles piled up in certain parts of the cell<em>.</em> He found that the cause of this congestion was genetic and went on to identify the mutated genes. Schekman identified three classes of genes that control different facets of the cell&acute;s transport system, thereby providing new insights into the tightly regulated machinery that mediates vesicle transport in the cell.</p> <p>Docking with precision</p> <p>James Rothman was also intrigued by the nature of the cell&acute;s transport system. When studying vesicle transport in mammalian cells in the 1980s and 1990s, Rothman discovered that a protein complex enables vesicles to dock and fuse with their target membranes. In the fusion process, proteins on the vesicles and target membranes bind to each other like the two sides of a zipper. The fact that there are many such proteins and that they bind only in specific combinations ensures that cargo is delivered to a precise location. The same principle operates inside the cell and when a vesicle binds to the cell&acute;s outer membrane to release its contents.</p> <p>It turned out that some of the genes Schekman had discovered in yeast coded for proteins corresponding to those Rothman identified in mammals, revealing an ancient evolutionary origin of the transport system. Collectively, they mapped critical components of the cell&acute;s transport machinery.</p> <p>Timing is everything</p> <p>Thomas S&uuml;dhof was interested in how nerve cells communicate with one another in the brain. The signalling molecules, neurotransmitters, are released from vesicles that fuse with the outer membrane of nerve cells by using the machinery discovered by Rothman and Schekman. But these vesicles are only allowed to release their contents when the nerve cell signals to its neighbours. How is this release controlled in such a precise manner? Calcium ions were known to be involved in this process and in the 1990s, S&uuml;dhof searched for calcium sensitive proteins in nerve cells. He identified molecular machinery that responds to an influx of calcium ions and directs neighbour proteins rapidly to bind vesicles to the outer membrane of the nerve cell. The zipper opens up and signal substances are released. S&uuml;dhof&acute;s discovery explained how temporal precision is achieved and how vesicles&acute; contents can be released on command.</p> <p>Vesicle transport gives insight into disease processes</p> <p>The three Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental process in cell physiology. These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell. Vesicle transport and fusion operate, with the same general principles, in organisms as different as yeast and man. The system is critical for a variety of physiological processes in which vesicle fusion must be controlled, ranging from signalling in the brain to release of hormones and immune cytokines. Defective vesicle transport occurs in a variety of diseases including a number of neurological and immunological disorders, as well as in diabetes. Without this wonderfully precise organization, the cell would lapse into chaos.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T11:15:44.586+01:00\">at 11.15am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52528238e4b041f09f138ad9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:44:34.170+01:00\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">James Rothman explains his work</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's Prof Rothman speaking in December last year.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjurQ5i4PI\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMjurQ5i4PI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=170\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:57:34.270+01:00\">at 10.57am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525280c4e4b04e5d3aefa98d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:37:52.714+01:00\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is a summary from the Nobel Foundation of the scientists' discoveries that led to the prize:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 2013 Nobel Prize honours three scientists who have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system. Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and chemical signals called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three Nobel Laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time in the cell.</p> <p>Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. James Rothman unravelled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. Thomas S&uuml;dhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision.</p> <p>Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and S&uuml;dhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:38:57.532+01:00\">at 10.38am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52528041e4b04e5d3aefa98c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:35:52.202+01:00\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">More on the winners</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The affiliations of the winners - a full house for the US.</p> <p>James E Rothman, Yale University</p> <p>Randy W Schekman, Berkeley</p> <p>Thomas C S&uuml;dhof, Stanford University</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:39:34.014+01:00\">at 10.39am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52527dabe4b01e4020f8d93c\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:33:44.575+01:00\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">And the winners are...</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The winners of the 2013 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine are:</p> <p>James E Rothman</p> <p>Randy W Schekman</p> <p>Thomas C S&uuml;dhof</p> <p>For elucidating the machinery that regulates vesicle transport through the cell.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:37:10.263+01:00\">at 10.37am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52527e02e4b01e4020f8d93d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:31:13.929+01:00\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The committee is filtering into the room and taking their seats.

        "headline":"New National Crime Agency chief urges Theresa May to stick with Europol",
        "body":"<p>The head of the new National Crime Agency has urged the home secretary not to strip British police of crucial capabilities for fighting organised crime by withdrawing from the Europe-wide police unit that tackles international gangs.</p><p>Keith Bristow, who leads the £450m agency, which launches on Monday, faces one of his greatest political battles in persuading Theresa May to keep Britain in Europol. Bristow, who has promised that his 5,000 NCA agents will \"instill fear\" into organised criminals, faces the prospect of his new FBI-style agency being left in a power vacuum if May goes ahead with the withdrawal.</p><p>Ministers fear reforms to Europol could undermine national security by requiring Britain to share information with other countries. Police leaders, including Bristow, say that intelligence and information sharing within Europol is crucial to fighting organised crime. But the government refuses to commit to future co-operation with Europol. In addition, it is considering reviewing participation in the European arrest warrant.</p><p>Rob Wainwright, Europol's director, spoke last week of international concern that Britain appeared to be withdrawing from its commitment to share information just as the criminal threat became more global.</p><p>Asked if he had lobbied May to stay in Europol, Bristow said: \"I have made the case for staying in Europol. When the home secretary has sought my advice I have explained the capabilities that we need to have access to.</p><p>\"These are capabilities required for maintaining a crime-fighting organisation where we focus on serious organised crime. One of the key capabilities Europol gives us is the ability to share and assess intelligence. If we did not have that capability through Europol we absolutely would need it through another sort of approach. We must be able to share intelligence. We all know we live in an interconnected world where international borders are much less significant to people involved in serious organised crime.</p><p>\"What I have done is told the home secretary very clearly what international requirements and capabilities we need.\"</p><p>He said the NCA would also tackle cyber criminals, drug barons, paedophiles and people traffickers. Officers will take on the paedophile gangs who use the \"dark web\" (which anonymises user identities) to share images of the live abuse of children.</p><p>The NCA is staffed by police, computer experts, including specialists from industry, and child protection workers. The agents will work undercover and in uniform,  and within a specialist intelligence hub to analyse information from every police force, as well as MI5 and MI6.</p><p>Bristow said the agency would also have access to face-recognition software to tackle suspected criminals' movements.</p><p>The agency takes over the role of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which was the creation of the last government in its attempt to build a national police unit coordinating the work of the 43 police forces of England and Wales more effectively.</p><p>Soca was criticised for being too focused on intelligence and not enough on operational activity. The NCA addresses that.</p><p>\"We are going to be much more visible,\" said Bristow. \"We want the public to have confidence and trust in the work we conduct and we want criminals to fear us. We are operational crime fighters who are intelligence-led but not an intelligence agency.\"</p><p>The NCA will not operate as a police unit in Northern Ireland because of concerns over what some politicians there see as its lack of accountability – it reports directly to the Home Office.</p><p>Bristow said his officers would still retain the powers of immigration and customs officers in Northern Ireland but not that of police constables.</p><p>The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), which is being amalgamated into the NCA, will also not be able to operate as police investigators. Bristow said his officers would be doing all they could to support investigators in Northern Ireland, but concern is growing in Northern Ireland that children might not be properly protected. Northern Ireland's  justice minister, David Ford, said: \"When the NCA goes live its investigative remit will be largely restricted to non-devolved issues, such as serious and organised customs and immigration crime.</p><p>\"Civil recovery will be limited to non-devolved cases, for example, excise fraud. An obvious concern is that this could play into the hands of those accumulating assets through armed robbery, cash in transit attacks, trafficking and other devolved criminality.</p><p>\"Ceop, which is to become part of the NCA but with an enhanced role, cannot participate in the operational arena, and as a result I have serious concerns that there will be a gap in the support [it] can provide here in respect of protection of children.</p><p>\"This is an entirely unsatisfactory situation. It leaves obvious gaps in the protection of citizens in Northern Ireland, and I am continuing to work to achieve political agreement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192336|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|a85021e3fc12fe80b8581ea23abf249b1f44b421 -->",

        "headline":"Egypt: dozens of protesters killed as rival factions tear Cairo apart",
        "body":"<p>At least 51 people died in clashes across Egypt  as the country's two largest political factions gathered in rival commemorations of Egypt's participation in the 1973 war with Israel, a day of deep significance for many Egyptians.</p><p>Both opponents and supporters of the country's ousted president, Mohamed Morsi, rallied in their thousands – ostensibly to mark the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war which is viewed in Cairo as an Egyptian victory, despite ending in a stalemate that favoured Israel.</p><p>But rather than emphasising Egypt's unity, the different messages conveyed by each faction's demonstrations underscored divides. Morsi's supporters, whose marches filled highways in west Cairo, used the day to protest against his ousting, while his opponents took to Tahrir Square to praise General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's role in his overthrow. Deadly violence flared when tens of thousands of Morsi supporters tried to reach Tahrir Square. Soldiers, police and armed vigilantes blocked their path and started firing.</p><p>Arriving in west Cairo's Dokki suburb around 3pm, the marchers were met first by teargas, then rubber bullets and then live rounds, according to one witness who was at the front of the march.</p><p>\"It was three groups of armed people – police, army, and residents – attacking helpless protesters, who didn't even do much to fight back,\" said Mosa'ab Elshamy, a photographer known for <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mosaaberising/sets/72157636261057216/\" title=\"\">his pictures at Cairo clashes</a>. \"Today's march was made up largely of families, lots of women, lots of children. Sometimes marches take things into their own hands, start trouble, break something. But today's march was really remarkably peaceful until the police just shot at them without any kind of trigger.\"</p><p>Some reports suggested that a number of marchers carried firearms, but Elshamy said the protesters, who included hardcore football fans unaffiliated with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, simply held their ground for three hours – throwing stones and burning tires – before retreating.</p><p>He added: \"As a couple of people were running away, they were gunned down, and they left quite a trail of blood.\"</p><p>Opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood argued the Islamists and others had sought a violent response in order to garner sympathy internationally, or to gain concessions during negotiations.</p><p>\"They are trying to make trouble everywhere so that at some point, the deal will be: fine, stop the trouble, what do you want?\" Alaa al-Aswany, one of Egypt's best-known authors and a fierce critic of the Brotherhood, argued in the buildup to the celebrations.</p><p>As the day wore on, Cairo became a tale of two Tahrirs – Tahrir Square in the east, where army helicopters flew over pro-military bands, and Tahrir Street in the west, where police and secular locals fired bullets and teargas on the pro-Morsi marches.</p><p>The juxtaposition highlighted Egypt's ideological divisions. \"Today feels like a second victory,\" said Mohamed Abdel Aziz, a cleaner wearing a picture of Sisi around his neck. \"We feel like we have won our country back from a gang that doesn't belong to Egypt.\"</p><p>Across town, protesters carrying yellow placards – in memory of those who died at several <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\" title=\"\">summer massacres</a>  of Morsi supporters – had a different idea about what the day meant. \"Today is about saying no to the military coup, and bringing back liberty,\" said Saber Nafi, a pro-Morsi journalist.</p><p>What had been a festive afternoon quickly soured, with gangs of vigilantes and plain-clothed policemen in some streets attacking people suspected of being a foreigner, a journalist or a Muslim Brother.</p><p>Two liberal politicians – including <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/stabbed-egyptian-politician-decries-violence-215810533.html\" title=\"\">Khaled Dawoud</a>, a one-time spokesman for Egypt's main secular coalition – were attacked by Brotherhood supporters this weekend. Dawoud was spotted while driving through central Cairo, hauled from his car, and stabbed in his hand and twice in his chest. He is now recovering in hospital.</p><p>Clashes were reported in several other neighbourhoods in Cairo and across Egypt, though much of the country remained calm. Some Egyptians expressed frustration at their fellow citizens' overbearing nationalism, and at being pulled between what they feel to be two sides of the same authoritarian coin: the army and the Brotherhood.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194423|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|128fae5d632305693a2807e8472ac517113a8f69 -->",

Sadly thanks to the Federal Reserve’s endless QE, that restraint and imposed market discipline is no longer in place. And that is dangerous. Without the market check, Washington is risking ruin.</p> <p>So how are these “bond vigilantes” and how do they impose discipline on the ruling classes? They are simply the mass of investors in government debt who by their actions force governments back to the financial straight and narrow. If they think a Nation is spending too much without enough taxation, resulting in excessive deficits and ballooning debt, they will demand a higher interest rate. That is basic finance; higher risk is compensated by a higher return. So as a Nation’s debt rises rapidly, the nation has to pay higher interest rates. So bond yields - borrowing costs - rise. And that is the restraint imposed upon governments - borrowing becomes more expensive the more fiscally irresponsible the government becomes.</p> <p>That is the check to stop politicians getting their country overly indebted.</p> <p>And it is the same mechanism with irresponsible monetary policy too - a higher yield is required by investors to compensate for the loss in monetary value from inflation. So bond investors are really important for financially feckless nations, because they that drag the ruling classes back to sensible economic policies (by demanding higher interest rates).</p> <p>But the problem is that the Federal Reserve is currently buying $85bn of bonds a month, manipulating America’s borrowing costs lower.</p> <p>The Fed is the biggest player in the markets and if it wants bond yields down then few will bet they will go up. Thus there is no corrective mechanism. Without the Fed’s QE, the current Washington fiasco would have increased America’s borrowing costs and that would have helped to force politicians back to the negotiating table. It now looks likely that the Fed didn’t taper in September as it was concerned about the impact the shutdown would have on the economy. It is also likely that with no non farm payrolls figure being released on Friday, the Fed will not taper in October either.</p> <p>Implicitly the Federal Reserve is bailing out the incompetency of Washington. The stick has been removed allowing the political class to play wild and threaten default.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c82b6617-abdd-40e5-96aa-314d5f6c2e78\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381143769479/219da052-d3b2-468e-aedb-b2b8ce660f97-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking at a news conference, is seen on a television screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on September 18, 2013 in New York City..\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Wall Street eyes were glued on&nbsp;Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last month, as he explained why the Fed was not slowing its stimulus programme.

A good question (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thestalwart\">from&nbsp;Joe Weisenthal</a>) was what the Republicans would have used to justify the&nbsp;stalemate if Obamacare wasn't there to argue over.</p> <p>And while I am sure the&nbsp;GOP could have found a reason for disruptive politics, it also seems clear&nbsp;that Obamacare is too important to the President's 'legacy' for him to&nbsp;compromise on that, while the right wing of the GOP is opposed on principle&nbsp;as much as anything else. But it's also clear that the Republicans are<br />'losing' the public relations war. I don't think that merely reflects my&nbsp;Twitter stream or choice of on-line reading.</p> <p>The big winner of this mess&nbsp;will be Hilary Clinton. And that, in turn, means that a compromise, with tax&nbsp;cuts elsewhere, is likely to be found to get a deal through that allows the&nbsp;debt ceiling to be increased by 17 October.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jane Foley of Rabobank</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rallying call of Republican House Speaker Boehner over the weekend that it is “time for us to stand up and fight” looks set to commit the shutdown of the US government into a second week.&nbsp;</p> <p>The vote by Congress in favour of paying the government workers who has been sent home on leave will offset some concerns about the economic costs of the shutdown. Even so, with the October 17 deadline for a debt default looming, investors are likely to become increasingly nervous with every passing day.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shutdown Day 7 is unfortunately the theme for the day, and quite possibly for the week...</p> <p>While mutterings ahead of the weekend suggested that Boehner said he would make sure that there was no default, and some hopeful whispers of a few Tea Party aligned members of the House softening their stance, positioning as the week starts appears to be even more entrenched.</p> <p>The backlog of official US economic data is building quite rapidly with little obvious prospect of anything being published this week. One assumes that the end of week G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank heads may have little else to discuss, though the protests about the US political impasse (assuming it has not been resolved) from other G7 and EM countries will be vociferous.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Elsa Lignos of RBC Europe:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hard line on both sides has unsurprisingly been taken negatively by risky assets.&nbsp;The Yen and Swiss franc are outperforming, US equity futures are pushing down towards Thursday’s lows, while US Treasuries are still trading sideways.</p> <p>It is still a case of waiting and watching on developments in Washington. Our US Strategists expect that the longer the government remains dark, the greater the likelihood that the shutdown and debt ceiling issues are resolved together, which would result in a better outcome</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Investec Corporate Treasury</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some analysts have estimated that default is likely by November 1st when the Treasury Department is scheduled to make nearly $60 billion in payments to Social Security recipients, Medicare providers, civil service retirees, and active duty military service members.</p> <p>With such a limited window of time available all eyes will be on the US this week to see if a resolution can be reached. In the meantime expect the US shutdown to dominate currency markets and be prepared for some volatility if a default starts to look more likely.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Pawelmorski/statuses/387165328226398209\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>If the US was a person, the rest of us would be staging an intervention about now.</p>— Paweł Morski (@Pawelmorski) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pawelmorski/statuses/387165328226398209\">October 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T12:10:54.093+01:00\">at 12.10pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52528829e4b01e4020f8d945\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T11:25:08.040+01:00\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek budget predicts growth in 2014</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to Greece, where the government has predicted a return to growth next year after a six-year slump</strong>.</p> <p>The draft 2014 budget, announced this morning by deputy finance minister <strong>Christos Staikouras</strong><strong>,</strong> also forecasts a surplus excluding debt financing costs.

The economy is set to contract by 4 percent this year. Athens is also targeting a primary budget surplus of 1.6% of national output next year and is on track to post a small surplus this year.</p> <p>Attaining a primary surplus - excluding debt servicing costs - is key to helping Athens secure debt relief from its international lenders.</p> <p>&quot;In the last three years Greece found itself in a painful recession with an unprecedented level of unemployment,&quot; Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said as he unveiled the 2014 budget.</p> <p>&quot;Since this year the sacrifices have begun to yield fruit, giving the first signs of an exit from the crisis.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>These signs of recovery are encouraging hedge funds to buy stakes in Greek banks (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/07/us-debt-ceiling-deadlock-worries-markets-live#block-52526ac2e4b04e5d3aefa97f\"><strong>see 9.12am</strong></a>) and fuelling rumours that Greece could swap some debt for new 50-year bond (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/07/us-debt-ceiling-deadlock-worries-markets-live#block-52524f50e4b04e5d3aefa979\"><strong>see opening post</strong></a>).</p> <p>The budget also shows that Greece will run a deficit of 2.4% (including debt costs). <strong>This will push its public debt to 174.5% of GDP, despite investors taking a haircut early last year.</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52528137e4b04e5d3aefa98e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T11:04:42.691+01:00\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>How much damage would be caused if American politicians doesn't raise the debt ceiling before the October 17 deadline?</strong></p> <p>Goldman Sachs has crunched the numbers, and told clients over the weekend that the Treasury would be forced into a drastic cutback in spending from the end of October <strong>which would wipe 4.2% off annualised GDP</strong>.</p> <p>The research note (<em>from Saturday, but still well worth flagging</em>) showed how the Treasury is on track to hit its borrowing limit in two weeks.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d3f0c724-c13f-41bb-a055-c0f9fefe8af7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381139401540/e846355a-eb4b-4650-a4ce-3180f257edcd-460x261.png\" alt=\"US debt ceiling\" width=\"460\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph:/Goldman Sachs</figcaption> </figure> <p>After that point, the amount of money coming into&nbsp;the Treasury will&nbsp;equal only about 65% of&nbsp;spending going out, Goldman said.

We estimate that the fiscal&nbsp;pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The&nbsp;effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even&nbsp;greater. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn&nbsp;in economic activity if not reversed very quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>And more detail....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very short delay past the&nbsp;October deadline—for instance, a few days—could delay the payment of some obligations&nbsp;already incurred and would create instability in the financial markets. This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth.</p> <p>But a long delay—for example, several weeks—would likely result in a government&nbsp;shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown,&nbsp;there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has&nbsp;lost its authority to conduct &quot;non-essential&quot; discretionary programs which make up about&nbsp;15% of the federal budget.</p> <p>By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late&nbsp;October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled&nbsp;payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52527967e4b041f09f138ad5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:24:41.487+01:00\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">US deadlock hits euro investors</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b0128f8-a791-467e-8c2f-2c8feb559585\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381137864207/c92997d0-b72a-45e4-b1a7-acc6724d5a32-460x264.png\" alt=\"Eurozone investor confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Sentix</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The US government shutdown debacle has hit&nbsp;</strong><strong>investor confidence within the eurozone</strong>,&nbsp;according to the latest data from German research firm <strong>Sentix.</strong></p> <p>Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September.

        "body":"<p>The United States and Russia are \"very pleased\" with progress in destroying Syria's chemical weapons stocks,&nbsp;US secretary of state John Kerry said on Monday. He offered some rare, if qualified, US praise for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Kerry, speaking at a press conference with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, said the Assad regime deserved credit for its speedy compliance thus far with the UN security council resolution calling for the elimination of the weapons. But Kerry stressed Assad was not yet off the hook.</p> <p>\"Let me be crystal clear,\" Kerry said, \"we're very pleased with the pace of what has happened with respect to chemical weapons.\"</p> <p>He noted that&nbsp;experts had started the process of destroying the stockpiles on Sunday, just over a week after the United Nations security council and the international chemical weapons watchdog acted.</p> <p>\"I think that was a terrific example of global co-operation, of multilateral efforts to accomplish an accepted goal and they have moved with equal speed to get on the ground in Syria and begin the operations,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think it is also credit to the Assad regime for complying rapidly as they are supposed to,\" Kerry said. \"We hope that will continue. Now, I am not going to vouch today for what happens months down the road. But it is a good beginning and we should welcome a good beginning.\"</p> <p>Kerry and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit (Apec) on the Indonesian island of Bali.</p> <p>Lavrov said the Assad regime, an ally of Russia's, was co-operating fully. He stressed that the Western- and Arab-backed opposition must also comply and must ensure that chemical weapons not fall into the hands of extremists. Russia has accused the opposition of being behind the chemical weapons attack on 21 August that most countries blame on the regime.</p> <p>\"The responsibility is not only on the Syrian government, but also on the opposition and all the states in this sphere should of course not allow these weapons to fall into the hands of non-state actors,\" Lavrov said.</p> <p>Kerry and Lavrov said they continued to make progress on preparations for an international conference to help set up a transitional government for Syria. The United Nations has said it would like to host the meeting in Geneva in mid-November. The meeting has been repeatedly delayed but Kerry and Lavrov said they hoped the rough date would hold.</p> <p>Lavrov said the Syrian government had agreed to take part in the conference and urged the US and other supporters of the opposition to convince Assad's foes to attend. The opposition is splintered and has been unable so far to produce a delegation that could go to Geneva.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419213368|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|6f4d6b4d2c042433dcdb7c6e1fcb2a599500efed -->",

        "headline":"15-minute care visits too short, says charity",
        "body":"<p>Two-thirds of local councils are commissioning 15-minute visits for people with disabilities despite concerns these periods deprive them of essential care, a leading charity has warned.</p><p>Using data gathered from freedom of information requests, Leonard Cheshire, the largest voluntary sector provider of disabled care, found that in the past five years the proportion of visits lasting a quarter of an hour or shorter had risen by 15%.</p><p>Six in 10 local authorities now commission these slices of \"care time\" for frail, elderly and disabled people.</p><p>The charity said it wanted to roll back the trend whereby councils made cuts in frontline services to balance squeezed budgets – and the care industry, which employs a million workers, sent staff whizzing between the homes of vulnerable people's houses in shifts as short as 15 minutes.</p><p>Leonard Cheshire warned that the time allowed was too short to meet the needs of vulnerable people, and could force clients to choose between \"staying thirsty or going to the toilet\". This year it announced that it would not be bidding for contracts that included 15-minute calls.</p><p>The survey, the largest and most detailed of its kind, received responses from 120 of the 152 county councils that pay for social care in England. The local authorities agreed to answer in part because the charity guaranteed that the responses from individual councils would be kept confidential.</p><p>The report, entitled Ending 15 Minute Care, says UK adults take on average at least 40 minutes to carry out essential tasks including getting up, washing, dressing and eating breakfast. However, local councils increasingly expect disabled people to complete these tasks in 15 minutes. Leonard Cheshire said some local authorities were commissioning three-quarters of all their home care visits in 15 minutes or less.</p><p>The report quotes an 84-year-old woman who receives a 15-minute visit every afternoon. She spoke on condition of anonymity because the council warned her not to talk publicly. She told the charity: \"My carers are on pins all the time. They do try their best and they are lovely girls, but what can you do in 15 minutes?</p><p>\"I end up choosing – have I got time to check if they can fill the hot water bottle? Shall I choose between getting my meal prepared or them emptying my commode? Do I get a drink or do I go to the toilet?\"</p><p>In a ComRes poll of 2,025 adults conducted for the charity, there was overwhelming support for the idea that the 15-minute slot be abandoned, with 93% of the public saying it was not \"enough [time] to support a disabled or older person carry out everyday tasks like washing, getting dressed or getting out of bed\".</p><p>The findings are released ahead of the crucial report stage of the government's care bill in the Lords this week.</p><p>Clare Pelham, chief executive of Leonard Cheshire Disability, called on the Lords to back an amendment to make care visits last at least 30 minutes. \"Every day, many disabled and older people in the UK receive personal care. It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes.\"</p><p>Esther Rantzen, founder of the helplines ChildLine and Silver Line, is backing the charity's call to end 15-minute care visits. She said: \"I believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt. Providing this kind of care is a personal service and should be accompanied by conversation and at least half an hour of the care worker's time.\"</p><p>However, the association of directors of adult social services, who run local council budgets, argued that in some cases 15-minute visits at a home were \"fully justified and fully adequate\".</p><p>Sandie Keene, president of the association, said it was wrong to believe that all tasks needed more than 15 minutes to carry out. \"And frankly naïve to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services. It doesn't work like that.\"</p><p>The government said it would not legislate for a minimum number of minutes that care workers had for visits, preferring instead to say that councils would have to consider a person's wellbeing when commissioning support for elderly and disabled people.</p><p>Norman Lamb, the care and support minister, said: \"It's unrealistic to think that 15 minutes is enough time to help people who are older or who have a disability to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed. It's not fair on those who need support and it's not fair on care workers.\"</p><p>He said there would be an \"amendment to the care bill [ensuring] local authorities would have to consider a person's wellbeing when arranging their care\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419193550|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|1c31c8ad1c659954cc04fc6e2ddc77e201cf9702 -->",

        "body":"<p>Athletes and spectators attending the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February will face some of the most invasive and systematic spying and surveillance in the history of the Games, documents shared with the Guardian show.</p><p>Russia's powerful FSB security service plans to ensure that no communication by competitors or spectators goes unmonitored during the event, according to a dossier compiled by a team of Russian investigative journalists looking into preparations for the 2014 Games.</p><p>In a ceremony on Red Square on Sunday afternoon, the president, Vladimir Putin, held the Olympic flame aloft and sent it on its epic journey around the country, saying Russia and its people had always been imbued with the qualities of \"openness and friendship\", making Sochi the perfect destination for the Olympics.</p><p>But  government procurement documents and tenders from Russian communication companies indicate that newly installed telephone and internet spying capabilities will give the FSB free rein to intercept any telephony or data traffic and even track the use of sensitive words or phrases mentioned in emails, webchats and on social media.</p><p>The journalists, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, who are experts on the Russian security services, collated dozens of open source technical documents published on the <a href=\"zakupki.gov.ru\" title=\"\">Zakupki government procurement agency website</a>, as well as public records of government oversight agencies. They found that major amendments have been made to telephone and Wi-Fi networks in the Black Sea resort to ensure extensive and all-permeating monitoring and filtering of all traffic, using Sorm, Russia's system for intercepting phone and internet communications.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419182875'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381067839051/Putin-at-Olympic-flame-ce-009.jpg' alt='Putin at Olympic flame ceremony' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Putin at a Sochi Olympic flame ceremony in Moscow on Sunday. Photograph: Ivan Sekretarev/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The Sorm system is being modernised across Russia, but particular attention has been paid to Sochi given the large number of foreign visitors expected next year. Technical specifications set out by the Russian state telecoms agency also show that a controversial technology known as deep packet inspection, which allows intelligence agencies to filter users by particular keywords, is being installed across Russia's networks, and is required to be compatible with the Sorm system.</p><p>\"For example you can use the keyword Navalny, and work out which people in a particular region are using the word Navalny,\" says Soldatov, referring to Alexei Navalny, Russia's best-known opposition politician. \"Then, those people can be tracked further.\"</p><p>Ron Deibert, a professor at the University of Toronto and  director of Citizen Lab, which co-operated with the Sochi research, describes the Sorm amendments as \"Prism on steroids\", referring to the programme used by the NSA in the US and revealed to the Guardian by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. \"The scope and scale of Russian surveillance are similar to the disclosures about the US programme but there are subtle differences to the regulations,\" says Deibert. \"We know from Snowden's disclosures that many of the checks were weak or sidestepped in the US, but in the Russian system permanent access for Sorm is a requirement of building the infrastructure.\"</p><p>\"Even as recently as the Beijing Olympics, the sophistication of surveillance and tracking capabilities were nowhere near where they are today.\"</p><p>Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, which also co-operated with the research, said: \"Since 2008, more people are travelling with smartphones with far more data than back then, so there is more to spy on.\"</p><p>Wary of Sorm's capabilities, earlier this year a leaflet from the US state department's bureau of diplomatic security warned anyone travelling to the Games to be extremely cautious with communications.</p><p>\"Business travellers should be particularly aware that trade secrets, negotiating positions, and other sensitive information may be taken and shared with competitors, counterparts, and/or Russian regulatory and legal entities,\" the document reads.  The advice contains an extraordinary list of precautions for visitors who wish to ensure safe communications, such as removing batteries from phones when not in use and only travelling with \"clean\" devices.</p><p>Soldatov and Borogan have discovered that the FSB has been working since 2010 to upgrade the Sorm system to ensure it can cope with the extra traffic during the Games. All telephone and ISP providers have to install Sorm boxes in their technology by law, and once installed, the FSB can access data without the provider ever knowing, meaning every phone call or internet communication can be logged. Although the FSB technically requires a warrant to intercept a communication, it is not obliged to show it to anyone.</p><p>Tellingly, the FSB has appointed one of its top counterintelligence chiefs, Oleg Syromolotov, to be in charge at Sochi: security will thus be overseen by someone who has spent his career chasing foreign spies rather than terrorists.</p><p>Another target may well be gay rights, likely to be one of the biggest issues of the Games. Putin has said that competitors who wear rainbow pins, for example, will not be arrested under the country's controversial new law that bans \"homosexual propaganda\". However, it is likely that any attempts to stage any kind of rally or gathering to support gay rights will be ruthlessly broken up by police, as has been the case on numerous occasions in Russian cities in the past. Using DPI, Russian authorities will be able to identify, tag and follow all visitors to the Olympics, both Russian and foreign, who are discussing gay issues, and possibly planning to organise protests.</p><p>\"Athletes may have particular political views, or they may be openly gay,\" says Deibert. \"I think given recent developments in Russia, we have to be worried about these issues.\"</p><p>At a rare FSB press conference this week, an official, Alexei Lavrishchev, denied security and surveillance at the Games would be excessive, and said that the London Olympics featured far more intrusive measures. \"There, they even put CCTV cameras in, excuse me for saying it, the toilets,\" said Lavrishchev. \"We are not taking this kind of measure.\"</p><p>The FSB did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian, while a spokesperson for the Sochi Olympics referred all requests to the security services. But Russian authorities often express a belief that NGOs working on human rights and other issues have subversive agendas dictated from abroad, and the FSB apparently feels that with so many potentially dangerous foreigners descending on the Black Sea resort for the Olympics, it has a duty to keep an eye on them.</p><p>In the end, the goal is overarching, but simple, says Soldatov: \"Russian authorities want to make sure that every connection and every move made online in Sochi during the Olympics will be absolutely transparent to the secret services of the country.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418738377|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|b91e17b5621bb4698e34c0b7febaa9e650c87bbc -->",

        "body":"<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyhau, has said there will never be peace with the Palestinians until they recognise Israel as a Jewish state, and has dismissed Israel's military occupation of Palestinian land and the growth of Israeli settlements as the root cause of the conflict.</p><p>In an uncompromising speech, Netanyahu insisted  the Palestinians must abandon their core demand of the right of refugees to return to their places of origin. \"Unless the Palestinians recognise the Jewish state and give up on the right of return there will not be peace,\" the prime minister said in an address at Bar-Ilan University on Sunday.</p><p>But, he added, even such recognition by the Palestinian leadership would be insufficient. \"After generations of incitement we have no confidence that such recognition will percolate down to the Palestinian people. That is why we need extremely strong security arrangements and to go forward, but not blindly,\" he said.</p><p>The tone of Netanyahu's speech will dismay those on both sides and in the international community who believe that renewed peace talks, brokered by the US, represent possibly the last chance for a deal to create a Palestinian state and  end  the decades-old conflict.</p><p>It will fuel suspicion that, despite his professed readiness to engage in peace talks, Netanyahu is unwilling to make an historic agreement involving Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, dismantling settlements and sharing Jerusalem as the capital of both states.</p><p>The prime minister's speech was delivered at the same venue where Netanyahu first acknowledged the need for a two-state solution to the conflict in 2009. That address was hailed by many commentators as a significant breakthrough by the Israeli leader, and was vehemently attacked by rightwingers as a dangerous concession.</p><p>In Sunday's speech, Netanyahu dismissed Israel's 46-year-long occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza as the root cause of the conflict, saying it was based in Arab rejection of Jewish immigration to what was Palestine.</p><p>\"When anyone is asked what is the source of the conflict, the standard answer is the occupation, the territories, the settlements. They say that the Israeli takeover of Judea and Samaria [the biblical term for the West Bank] following the [1967] Six-Day war to a large extent created the conflict, and I ask whether that is true,\" he said.</p><p>\"The conflict, if I have to choose a date when it began in earnest, began in the year 1921, on the day Palestinian Arabs attacked the immigrants' house in Jaffa. This attack, of course, had nothing to do with the territories or settlements. It was against the immigration of Jews to the Land of Israel.</p><p>\"Then came the partition plan in 1947, with the suggestion of an Arab state alongside a Jewish state. The Jews agreed, the Arabs refused. Because the issue was not then the question of a Palestinian state – the issue was and remains the Jewish state. Then 19 years later came the stranglehold around us aimed at uprooting us. And why? After all, then there was no occupation.\"</p><p>The Palestinians say that their goal in peace talks is an end to the Israeli military occupation and the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. They say they have long recognised the state of Israel, but formal recognition of it as a Jewish state would be to deny the existence and rights of the 20% of Israel's population that is Palestinian and to effectively abandon the right of return.</p><p>Peace talks resumed in July and are scheduled to last until next spring but are said to be progressing slowly. The US secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.549061\" title=\"\">John Kerry, said last month</a> that  talks would intensify and \"American participation should be increased somewhat in order to try to help facilitate [progress]\".  His comments strongly suggested that the two sides were making little headway.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419222374|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|91ea0d5d08d642555c43f23cbda6627ef7814bd4 -->",

        "headline":"Royal Mail shares expected to soar as Labour warns taxpayers short-changed",
        "body":"<p>Investors in the Royal Mail selloff stand to generate an instant return of at least 12% on their investment if trading matches current speculation on grey markets, according to City experts.</p><p>Labour has stepped up demands for the government to pull the plug on the privatisation before applications for shares close on Tuesday evening, warning that taxpayers will be shortchanged in a \"bonanza for City speculators\".</p><p>The government is set to offer shares at a price of between 260p and 330p, valuing the company at up to £3.3bn.</p><p>But according to City spread betting firm IG Group, demand from speculators is likely to push share prices to between 370p and 390p when stock market trading opens.</p><p>David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, which has been running a grey market for retail investors for three weeks, said: \"We started quoting at £2.5bn and it's been pushed up to £3.8bn. Our price is being driven purely by our clients' activity.\"</p><p>He said that activity suggested prices would rise on the first day of trading to between 370p and 390p – a 12-18% profit even if the offer price were set at the maximum 330p, adding: \"This looks like an instant windfall to everybody.\"</p><p>The offer price will be announced on Thursday at 7am. Although it is widely expected now to be at least 300p a share, a host of City analysts say even that will undervalue the Royal Mail, in what is the biggest privatisation since the selloff of the railways in the 1990s. Gert Zonneveld, managing director of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, has said he believes the true value of Royal Mail could prove to be up to £4.5bn, while stockbroker ETX Capital said exceptional demand from retail investors would drive the shares as high as 365p on the first day.</p><p>Applications for shares close at a minute to midnight on Tuesday evening. Potential investors placed orders covering all the shares on offer within hours of the sale launching last week. Stockbrokers kept offices open through the weekend to field calls from smaller private investors, with the public able to buy shares when investing £750 upwards.</p><p>Around 60% of the company will be sold off, with 10% handed to employees and the government retaining at least a 30% shareholding.</p><p>Institutional investors will be allowed to trade shares conditionally from Friday, while retail shareholders – ordinary members of the public –  can potentially sell shares as soon as they are listed on the stock market on 15 October. Shares issued to employees are locked in for three years.</p><p>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \"It is not too late for the govemnment to pull the plug on this privatisation which appears to be about to deliver a huge bonanza for City speculators at the same time that it is massively shortchanging taxpayers.\"</p><p>Labour believes that the Royal Mail's property assets alone, including prime central London sites now regarded as surplus to requiremets, could be sold for billions.</p><p>The Communication Workers Union says the overwhelming majority of postal workers oppose the deal. A ballot for strike action may lead to a walkout later this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Royal Mail spokesman said that reports that the newly privatised firm would pay no corporation tax for a decade were \"entirely speculative\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192934|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|71351107ed9c642b94dd1af71348706f0f705a78 -->",

        "body":"<p>The family of a 32-year-old man who died in police custody after being restrained using a specially made emergency belt have criticised authorities for a \"lack of compassion\".</p><p>Thomas Orchard was arrested by Devon and Cornwall police and taken into custody on suspicion of a public order offence in October 2012. Orchard, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, later died in hospital after becoming unresponsive while in a police cell.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/police-told-to-stop-using-restraining-belts-as-spit-hoods\" title=\"\">Channel 4 News investigation</a>, during Orchard's detention, a seven-inch wide \"emergency response belt\" was placed on or around his face in order to stop him spitting or biting. The padded belt is designed to be used to restrain the upper body.</p><p>Speaking a year after his son's death, Ken Orchard said the family had had to wait seven months before their son's body was finally returned for burial. \"As a family grieving the loss of Thomas, we feel that there has been a lack of compassion from the powers that be,\" he said.</p><p>He said it was agony and that his family were \"really struggling to get any closure\" after failing to receive answers as to how his son died.</p><p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating the death, has told the family it could be many years yet before its investigation is completed.</p><p>The family have also been told that CCTV footage recording the restraint incident is very distressing, but have not yet been allowed to view it.</p><p>\"An emergency restraint belt was applied. We don't know why or how fully it was applied. We have massive concerns about its use and we continue to ask questions of the IPCC and the CPS, \" Thomas's sister Jo told Channel 4.</p><p>\"We've lost Thomas under horrible, horrible circumstances … at this point we just need answers,\" she added.</p><p>Deborah Coles, co-director of the charity Inquest, said Devon and Cornwall constabulary had to be held accountable for their actions. \"The police at an individual and corporate level must be held accountable for the exercise of their powers. Nowhere is this more important than where a vulnerable citizen dies in their custody following the use of force.</p><p>\"Questions must be asked about the use of the ERB [emergency response belt], who sanctioned it and what monitoring and regulation of its use took place.\"</p><p>Commenting more widely on police action over mental health in the community, Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of greater Manchester police, said deaths in custody occurred because his officers were not trained to deal with mental health issues.</p><p>Speaking on Radio 4 on Monday, Fahy, one of Britain's most senior police chiefs, said: \"A lot of the deaths in custody are because&nbsp;… people who have got mental illness are totally inappropriately taken to police stations. That's often when tragedies occur.</p><p>\"We need to fundamentally change the way that we actually address this wider issue about the number of ill people we take to police stations,\" said Fahy, adding that society should try to \"move away from the Victorian idea almost that people with mental illness are bad\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419241355|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|63be0c5ad17d89caa6d2b49e7ce9e23af7884bce -->",

        "headline":"World Cup 2014: Rio's favela pacification turns into slick operation",
        "body":"<p>First came troops with assault rifles and flak jackets, then street cleaners with brooms and buckets of whitewash, and finally satellite TV salesmen with a three-month special offer to first-time subscribers.</p><p>Rio de Janeiro's 35th favela pacification operation, which aimed to clear drug gangs from 12 shanty towns in the Lins favela complex, was over within hours on Sunday morning without a shot being fired.</p><p>But the commercial barrage has only just begun for the latest communities – all within 5km of the Maracanã World Cup final stadium – to be brought closer into the fold of government authority and global consumer culture.</p><p>Following a series of scandals relating to excessive use of force by the police, the latest battle was as much for hearts and minds as the city streets.</p><p>The paramilitary operation began when armoured personnel carriers roared through the suburban streets just after dawn while curious residents took smartphone pictures from their balconies and delivery men dropped off bundles of Sunday morning papers. Hundreds of heavily armed troops and paramilitary police then moved into the hillside favelas, sweeping the steep, narrow pathways. They are likely to stay for two weeks, after which a more lightly armed resident force known as the UPP will set up a base in the area.</p><p>While the morning's operation passed without incident, this pacification was not without casualties. One officer was killed and two injured in a gunfight during the \"softening up\" preparations the previous week. However, police spokesman Claudio Costa said he was satisfied with the way things had gone.</p><p>\"It's a success,\" he said. \"It was quiet today. This operation today will improve the confidence in the UPP.\"</p><p>Following the military operation, the authorities moved immediately to demonstrate the benefits that come with a return to the bosom of the state. A team of street cleaners swept the roadsides and picked some of the rubbish from the filthy stream below. Rio state governor Sergio Cabral said the authorities would spend £140m to improve living conditions.</p><p>Next followed a switch of symbols. Red Command graffiti was whitewashed over and the Policia Militar insignia – a dagger through a skull – was draped over the walls. A brief propaganda display followed: local children were invited to ride on police horses, a PR team displayed the bags of cocaine, cellophane-wrapped blocks of hash and the gun clips they said had been found in the search operations, and a mobile sound van repeatedly broadcast an appeal for support: \"People of Rio de Janeiro. As part of the ongoing pacification of our city, your community is being occupied. We rely on your co-operation to maintain stability. The new era begins now.\"</p><p>The change of power was marked with a ceremony in which marines and police presented arms as the flags of Brazil and Rio state were raised to mark the recovery of the territory by the authorities.</p><p>\"I don't know if this will be an improvement yet,\" said a local resident, Diane de la Rosa, looking out across an open sewer at the flag-raising ceremony. \"But I hope so. We all hope so.\"</p><p>There have long been questions about the pacification programme and whether it is merely a cosmetic exercise aimed at improving the city's image before the World Cup and Olympics. The authorities, however, insist it represents a long-term shift in priorities.</p><p>The results so far have been impressive. Official statistics show a sharp fall in murders, gun-related incidents and other crimes.</p><p>But concerns about excessive police violence have been revived in recent months. In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/shoot-out-rio-favela-protest\" title=\"\">police killed nine residents</a>, including seven suspected drug traffickers,  after an officer was murdered at the Maré complex, forcing the authorities to delay the planned pacification of that vast community. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/brazil-rio-police-charged-death-missing-man\" title=\"\">10 UPP officers were charged with the torture and killing of Amarildo de Souza,</a>  a resident of Rocinha, Rio's biggest favela.</p><p>\"There is a lack of confidence in the police. The Amarildo case showed that. It's not the first time,\" said Rodrigo Martins, an observer of the Lins pacification operation from the public defenders' office. \"Some people were a little afraid because there were so many police here, but we saw no arrests or incursions today. People are afraid to change.\"</p><p>The transformation has been dramatic.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/10/rio-police-favelas-world-cup\" title=\"\">The Guardian had visited one of the seven Lins communities</a>, Bairro Preto, six months earlier  when it was still controlled by Rio's most powerful gang, the Red Command. Back then, armed traffickers kept watch at the entrance of the favela, a makeshift drug factory had been set up in a back alley and dozens of zombie-like addicts lolled around inside a filth-strewn crack den.</p><p>The contrast this time was striking. The gangsters had faded into the backstreets and neighbouring favelas, the drug-packaging workshop had moved on and the crack den was empty of all but three sleeping or unconscious addicts. All that was left was a Mary Celeste-like scene with a still blaring radio and empty tin-foil crack wraps scattered over the floor. The departure of the residents was rapid.</p><p>\"They were still there last night when I got home,\" said their neighbour Michelle Xavier. \"But it is very quiet now. That's an improvement already. It was noisy all the time before. The crack users never sleep.\"</p><p>Her neighbours expressed amazement at the sight of a first taxi on their street, which drivers had previously deemed too dangerous to drive into.</p><p>Another eye-popping change was the arrival of two Sky salesmen, who quickly set up plastic tables for their subscription leaflets on exactly the same spots as the drug dealers had previously used to market their wraps of cocaine and hash.</p><p>\"I just came today. We always do this after a pacification operation,\" said Renate Isahu, who said he had already signed up 10 customers. \"It's a good time to pick up business.\" The Claro phone network was also following in the wake of the troops with a team of leaflet distributors.</p><p>Most residents were hopeful that pacification would bring an improvement in their lives.</p><p>\"We won't have to be so fearful. The community will be more peaceful,\" said Antonia Pereira, who has lived in the Gamba community of Lins for 30 years. \"It'll also be good for property values.\"</p><p>In nearby neighbourhoods which had often been targeted by crack users, there was a sense of relief. Claudia Guerreiro said she didn't dare wear jewellery or carry a phone in the street for fear of thieves. Her neighbour said he had been assaulted nine times. \"We've experienced so much crime here. I think the police presence will definitely make things better.\"</p><p>But there was more scepticism among those who had previously experienced pacification. Milena Moura had come to Lins from Alemão, a favela that had been the headquarters of the Red Command until it was taken over by police last year.</p><p>\"I've seen how it works. The police did bad things,\" she said. \"I've no confidence that they will be any better here.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Cowie</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419240631|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|ad3c0ee78872f670f0067ccf9b9ea4743446a0d9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Around 72% of the public believe that the Daily Mail was wrong to call Labour leader Ed Miliband's father Ralph the &quot;man who hated Britain&quot;, while about 69% of people in general and 57% of Daily Mail readers think the newspaper should apologise, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday.</p><p>The YouGov poll, conducted on behalf of the Sunday Times, came as about 200 protesters gathered outside the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday offices in London following the publication of the Ralph Miliband article last week, which the Labour leader said had left him &quot;appalled&quot;.</p><p>The row over the treatment of Miliband's late father, a Marxist academic, has reached a stalemate, with Labour demanding an apology but the Daily Mail refusing to retract its article.</p><p>Late Sunday the campaign group Hacked Off said it had written to the Daily Mail proprietor Lord Rothermere asking him to reconsider his rejection of an inquiry into ethics at the paper, called for by Miliband.</p><p>The dispute will be a part of the context for a meeting of the privy council on Wednesday, at which politicians are expected to make a decision about the future of press regulation. They are likely to look at a royal charter proposed by the newspaper industry, which has been examined by eight Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs over the summer. If this is rejected, the privy council is likely to back a royal charter agreed by all three leading political parties but rejected by some elements of the press.</p><p>The press industry is likely to set up its own form of regulation, even if it does not receive the seal of a royal charter.</p><p>In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, Miliband said he would never disparage David Cameron in the same way that Miliband's father Ralph had been by the Daily Mail, even though he believes the prime minister's policies are &quot;profoundly misguided&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I say judge him by his deeds,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;Let me put it this way: I would never say about David Cameron that he hates Britain, I would never say he doesn't want the best for this country. Of course he wants the best for this country. So what the Mail said about my dad, I would never say about David Cameron.&quot;</p><p>At the protest outside the Daily Mail offices, demonstrators said they were expressing anger in the wake of the Ralph Miliband story. &quot;The message is clear,&quot; said the journalist and campaigner Owen Jones, addressing the crowd. &quot;Enough is enough: stop your campaign of hatred.&quot;</p><p>Jones said the newspapers had spent years demonising large sections of society, from public sector workers to women and trade union members. &quot;We are speaking up for decency … this is a show of cheerful defiance by all the people who have been picked on by the Daily Mail.&quot;</p><p>Some Tory politicians have expressed fears that the backlash against Miliband's treatment will influence this week's discussions on press regulation at the privy council. David Davis, a senior Conservative and former leadership candidate, said David Cameron had ended up being forced to accept newspaper regulation because he &quot;didn't know how to deal&quot; with the phone-hacking scandal which led to the Leveson inquiry. &quot;I think he didn't know how to deal with it, truthfully. I actually don't think this is what they planned. I think the idea was ... I'm guessing what they thought was Leveson would come out with was a very ponderous and sort of sonorous condemnation of bad practices but the preservation of the free press – and in a way he sort of did – and that would be the end of it.</p><p>&quot;But actually the Hacked Off campaign, the Labour party has very strong campaigners – Tom Watson's one good example – drove the issue I think to the wrong conclusion. Maybe with the best intentions, but to the wrong conclusion.&quot;</p><p>David Davis, a senior Conservative and former leadership candidate, said the Daily Mail had been &quot;horribly heavy-handed&quot; towards Miliband but Labour is &quot;wrong to go down this route&quot; of pushing for strict press regulation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419197222|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|2850a2f6c3ae0dbf15086ab6d6cfb3e38ddcaafa -->",

        "headline":"Thatcher wanted Cecil Parkinson as foreign secretary, records show",
        "body":"<p>Margaret Thatcher planned to promote Cecil Parkinson to foreign secretary and effectively annoint him as her successor in the immediate aftermath of her 1983 post-Falklands general election landslide, according to the latest release of the former Conservative prime minister's personal papers.</p><p>She was due to make the move before she was told of his affair with his former Commons secretary Sara Keays.</p><p>Thatcher's Downing Street <a href=\"http://www.margaretthatcher.org/\" title=\"\">private office files</a> for 1983, released at the Churchill archives in Cambridge on Monday, show that the prospect of her handing one of the most senior jobs in government to the man who as party chairman had masterminded her victory election campaign filled some of her closest advisers with alarm. While they admired him as a communicator, some did not rate him as an intellectual.</p><p>David Wolfson, Thatcher's chief of staff, warned her that giving Parkinson the post would put in \"a position of immense power\" a man who had yet to prove himself as a cabinet minister. He suggested that Parkinson, as an accountant, might better be left in charge of the nationalised industries.</p><p>Thatcher's handwritten notes in her personal papers about her preparations for a post-election reshuffle show quite clearly that while there was some public speculation that Parkinson might replace Lord Whitelaw as home secretary, she fully intended to give Parkinson the job of foreign secretary.</p><p>Indeed, on the night when she won her 144-seat second-term majority she offered the post to Parkinson, only to be told by him of his affair with Keays.</p><p>Initially Thatcher did not think that an \"insuperable obstacle\" to his becoming foreign secretary. But when Keays' father wrote to tell Thatcher that Keays was pregnant with Parkinson's child and that he had promised to marry her, she decided instead to make him trade and industry secretary.</p><p>The only reference to the father's letter in Thatcher's papers is a draft reply saying: \"I understand that you have since spoken to the person concerned and have asked that I should return your letter which I now do.\" Instead she decided to destroy it by burning it in the fireplace of the sitting room at Chequers.</p><p>Thatcher, in her memoirs, says she showed Parkinson the letter when he arrived for lunch that Friday, the day after the election on 8 June. \"It must have been one of the worst moments of his life. It was immediately obvious I could not send Cecil to the Foreign Office with such a cloud hanging over him. I urged him to discuss the personal question with his family. Meanwhile I decided to make him secretary of state for the newly created Department of Trade and Industry.\"</p><p>Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said the move would have catapulted Parkinson up the party hierarchy. \"It's only speculative that she considered him to be her successor but it would appear that she was very serious about him indeed,\" he said. \"He had certainly risen very fast and she knew that by promoting him in this way, she would create an atmosphere around him.\"</p><p>Nicholas Ridley, who served in Thatcher's cabinet and was a close friend of Parkinson, said in his memoir My Style of Government: \"Her first choice of an heir apparent back in 1983 was Cecil Parkinson.\" He said her second choice was John Moore, and John Major, her eventual successor, was only her third choice.</p><p>Parkinson was forced to resign on the eve of Thatcher's triumphant party conference speech in October 1983 when Keays made the affair public in a newspaper interview. Thatcher's papers include the unpublished exchange of resignation letters between them in which she tells Parkinson that she and Denis were heartened by the way he was looking forward to the future with his wife, Ann, and his family.</p><p>\"I need not tell you how deeply Denis and I have felt for you and Ann and your family during this difficult time. And we are enormously heartened by the way you are now looking to the future with great courage and the strength which comes from the family,\" she wrote.</p><p>The scale of Thatcher's 1983 victory had left her with a freer hand in deciding who should be in her cabinet than at any other time as prime minister. Although the handwritten notes of potential cabinet lists clearly show her intention to make Parkinson foreign secretary, she seems to have kept the idea very much to herself.</p><p>Even Wolfson, her chief of staff, assumed that Parkinson might be made home secretary once the encumbent, Lord Whitelaw, had been persuaded to become leader of the House of Lords. In fact, Thatcher had pencilled in Geoffrey Howe, the eventual foreign secretary, for this job.</p><p>But that was enough to alarm Wolfson who, in a paper entitled Another View of the Reshuffle, told her in June 1983: \"As chairman and, say, home secretary, the party would suffer in the runup to an election. Cecil would be in a position of immense power, and you must judge whether he has yet proved himself as a cabinet minister.</p><p>\"Home secretary will be important, but not as important as it seems,\" wrote Wolfson. \"The crucial thing may well be having someone who can say with conviction that the riots, which we should expect, are not due to unemployment. That is why Francis Pym would be a hazard; he would not carry conviction. But possibly Patrick Jenkin, with his soft voice, would be as tough as Cecil and be more believable to the public?</p><p>\"Cecil might well be ideal at Industry. He is an accountant and could cope with the problem of controlling nationalised industries, as well as having good contacts with industrialists through his years as chairman,\" he said.</p><p>Howe in his memoirs reveals that he had embarrassingly interrupted  Thatcher and Parkinson in a huddle at the Conservative central office election night party: \"Not until much later did we discover the reason why … the prime minister was still considering whether she could appoint Cecil as her foreign secretary.\"</p><p>Howe says in his book Conflict of Loyalty that he would have been startled to realise that at the time. \"Although I had high respect for his potential, I should not have credited him with sufficient seniority or experience for this particular position … he had shown himself during the Falklands to be … a 'consummate executor of prime ministerial command' … I am not sorry – and not just for my own sake – that this plan was frustrated.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419190763|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|255a896bfcbbba8d8ec6ee2267c76603728f9820 -->",

        "headline":"Help to Buy: demand may outstrip supply as lenders brace for stampede",
        "body":"<p>More than 600,000 homes on the market are eligible for inclusion in the £12bn second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, according to the latest in a series of surveys leading to predictions that lenders will be flooded by pent-up demand for the government-backed mortgages.</p><p>Details of the 95% mortgages, which are available to existing homeowners as well as first-time buyers, are to be unveiled by the chancellor , with some banks expected to invite loan applications within hours of the Tuesday announcement. The second phase of the flagship scheme to give more first-time buyers and others wider access to the housing market was brought forward by three months, with a report from high street bank Santander claiming that up to 1.7 million people are planning to use the scheme.</p><p>\"It is going to accelerate more people going into the market, so the number of mortgage applications will increase and that will put more pressure on lenders and their [loan] processing,\" said David Hollingsworth of broker London &amp; Country Mortgages. \"But in terms of gross [mortgage] lending we are about less than half where we were in 2007.\"</p><p>Another mortgage broker predicted a surge in demand, stoked by media coverage of the scheme, that could be blunted by stringent eligibility checks from lenders. \"A lot of people want to get on the property ladder and the lenders who come out with these products will be inundated with inquiries,\" said Andrew Montlake of Coreco. \"But lenders are not going to suddenly forget about being prudent, so people are going to have to qualify for the loans.\"</p><p>Under this part of the Help to Buy scheme, buyers will need a minimum deposit of 5%, equivalent to about £10,000 for eligible homes in most regions of England and Wales. The government guarantees the next 15% of the property's value. The scheme is designed to encourage banks and building societies to offer more, and cheaper, mortgages, to people who can only manage relatively small deposits to secure a property.</p><p>Unlike some previous government home-buying initiatives, this one covers existing homes as well as new-build properties. Ministers have claimed it could assist more than 500,000 buyers over three years.</p><p>The level of interest rates that will be offered has yet to emerge, but banks have indicated that would-be buyers should not expect cheaper mortgages.</p><p>The Treasury is also likely to charge more to effectively insure loans to borrowers with the smallest deposits. Assuming the banks pass on the charges it means first-time buyers are still likely to face higher mortgage fees and interest rates than those borrowing to move house. Lenders are expected to charge rates of around 5% for the Help to Buy mortgages. Despite those reservations, mortgage commentators have expressed fears of a stampede for new applications. Research published on Friday found that two-thirds of adults under the age of 30 planned to buy their first home or move house during the three-year lifetime of Help to Buy.</p><p>The data, from the broker called the Mortgage Advice Bureau, also found that 20% of young adults said they were more likely to buy due to the scheme.</p><p>The property website Zoopla.co.uk has estimated that there are about 665,000 properties now on sale that are eligible for the second phase of Help to Buy. The scheme applies to any home up to a value of £600,000. Zoopla said that the average minimum deposit required to buy an eligible property was less than £10,000 in six of 10 regions in England and Wales: north-west and north-east England, the east and west Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and Wales. With the average asking price standing at £222,168, the required 5% deposit would be £11,108. But in London, where prices have been rising the fastest in the country in recent months, the figure would be £16,100.</p><p>Under the second part of Help to Buy, the government is making available £12bn of guarantees to lenders, though just three banking brands have indicated they will be offering the new deals from the outset: these are Royal Bank of Scotland, its NatWest arm, and Halifax.</p><p>RBS and NatWest said that from the launch date of the scheme customers would be able to visit any of their 2,000 branches or phone for advice. They added that opening hours would be extended at more than 740 branches across England, Scotland and Wales \"to help with customer demand\".</p><p>Estate agents and mortgage brokers have reported an increase in inquiries from buyers. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the London-based estate agent Marsh &amp; Parsons, said the new phase of Help to Buy would be \"like a shot of adrenalin\". He said of the London market: \"The capital needs this stimulus to free up mid-ladder buyers who want to become first-time sellers. This will create a much healthier balance between supply and demand.\"</p><p>Many experts have argued that the government should ditch the second phase of Help to Buy, because they fear it will artificially inflate house prices too much by ramping up demand at a faster rate than the supply of homes coming on the UK market. Mortgage availability has become more widespread following the launch of the government's funding for lending scheme in August last year, giving lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers. The first phase of Help to Buy provides equity loans but only applies to purchasers of new-build properties. The government has brought forward the second phase of Help to Buy despite opposition from within the coalition, including from backbench Conservatives.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198803|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|9b521fbdb11bc65952f677d2d5d7538aef7559e7 -->",

Of course he wants the best for this country. So what the Mail said about my dad, I would never say about David Cameron.&quot;</p><p>The row over the treatment of Miliband's father has reached a stalemate, with Labour demanding an apology but the Daily Mail refusing to retract its article.</p><p>However,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/06/protesters-daily-mail-offices-campaign\" title=\"\"> dozens of people protested about the newspaper's coverage outside its headquarters in Kensington</a> on Sunday morning. A new YouGov poll suggests even Daily Mail readers are not happy with the article, with 60% saying they thought the language used was unacceptable, compared to 29% who thought it was acceptable. Around 72% of the public thought calling Ralph Miliband the &quot;man who hated Britain&quot; was unacceptable.</p><p>About 69% of people in general and 57% of Daily Mail readers think the newspaper should apologise.</p><p>The dispute will be a part of the context for a meeting of the privy council on Wednesday, at which politicians are expected to make a decision about the future of press regulation. They are likely to look at a royal charter proposed by the newspaper industry, which has been examined by eight Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs over the summer. If this is rejected, the privy council is likely to back a royal charter agreed by all three major political parties but rejected by some elements of the press.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419184449|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|e2c7dddecb744f1482000be6aea28c06b16a7b9e -->",

        "body":"<p>The FBI has found that seizing an anonymous decentralised peer-to-peer currency was trickier than it seemed, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/bitcoin-silk-road-how-to-seize\">the Bureau&rsquo;s bust of the international drugs marketplace, Silk Road</a>.</p> <p>When Ross Ulbricht, known as Dread Pirate Roberts to users of the site, was arrested last week, the FBI seized 26,000 Bitcoins belonging to Silk Road customers. But it also attempted, unsuccessfully, to claim the nearly 600,000 - thought to be worth around $80m - which Ulbricht himself is thought to be holding.</p> <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency based on a methods of cryptography similar to those used to protect confidential emails. Due to its decentralised nature &ndash; the currency does not rely on any centralised agency to process payments, instead relying on work done by users&rsquo; computers&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it is popular for a number of fringe-legal and illegal uses. One of those uses was Silk Road, where Bitcoin was required for all transactions.</p> <p>In order to transfer Bitcoins out of a &ldquo;wallet&rdquo;, the name for the digital file which contains the encrypted information necessary to spend the currency, users need to know that wallet&rsquo;s password or &ldquo;private key&rdquo;.</p> <p>According to Forbes&rsquo; Kashmir Hill, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/04/fbi-silk-road-bitcoin-seizure/\">that hurdle is causing the FBI difficulty.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/04/fbi-silk-road-bitcoin-seizure/\">&ldquo;The FBI has not been able to get to </a>Ulbricht&rsquo;s personal Bitcoin yet,&rdquo; wrote Hill. An FBI spokesperson said to Hill that the &ldquo;$80m worth&rdquo; that Ulbricht had &ldquo;was held separately and is encrypted&rdquo;. At current exchange rates, that represents slightly more than 5% of all bitcoins in circulation.</p> <p>Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, merely having possession of the wallet file itself is enough to prevent the coins being spent. The Bureau is in a position equivalent to having seized a safe belonging to a suspect with no idea of the combination &ndash; and no hope of forcing it open any other way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know-silk-road\">&bull; <strong>Bitcoin sounds confusing, but the revolutionary digital currency is easy to understand.</strong></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419238411|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|4508d8f23775c37c76db104441bf8a9e2b9e6a05 -->",

        "body":"<p>The secretary-general of North Korea's ski association views the sprawling alpine landscape before him with unabashed pride. Facing a strong, cold wind, he points to a dip in the rugged, tree-covered mountains and says the sunrise  is a sight of unmatched beauty, worthy of the nation's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.</p><p></p><p>This is the Masik Pass ski resort, North Korea's latest megaproject and the product of 10 months of furious labour intended to show that the country, so often derided for its poverty and isolation, is as civilised and culturally advanced as any other.</p><p></p><p>The complex of ski runs, resort chalets and sleigh rides will  open formally on Thursday, though late last month the main hotels appeared to be little more than shells, potholes filled the access roads and foundations were still being dug for secondary buildings.</p><p></p><p>Who will ski here? Perhaps Kim Jong-un, who reportedly enjoyed the sport as a teenager studying in Switzerland. By the estimate of the ski official, Kim Tae Yong, there are only about 5,500 North Korean skiers in this country of 24 million – a skiing population of 0.02%.</p><p></p><p>Even so, as he sweeps his hand over the scene, the official displays no doubt that what his country really needs right now is a multimillion-dollar ski resort in the secluded depths of North Korea's east coast. Kim bristles at the suggestion Masik will be a playground for the nation's elite and a trickle of eccentric tourists. This, he says, is his country at work. It is proof of the great love of the great leader.</p><p></p><p>The narrow road to Masik Pass winds through rugged mountain terrain, small farming hamlets and lush foliage – beauty untouched by modern development. As the road turns to dirt, brightly coloured propaganda posters and ubiquitous slogans in blood-red letters come into view, followed by rows of barracks for workers – drab, hastily built shacks of stone carved out of the slopes along a clear flowing river.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that, hundreds, if not thousands, of soldier-builders in  olive uniforms – \"shock brigades\" assigned to especially urgent and difficult tasks – scour the slopes. Other workers pound at the stone with hammers. Young women march with shovels over their shoulders. Minivans equipped with loudspeakers blast patriotic music into the crisp mountain air.</p><p></p><p>Masik's ski runs – at the moment long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass – cut their way through the trees to converge at the hotel construction site below. Though two simple lifts have been installed, neither was working during a recent visit by  journalists; visitors drove to reach the top of the slope at Taehwa Peak.</p><p></p><p>As the showcase capital of Pyongyang, with its  amusement parks,  bronze statuary and countless marble-laden pavilions so amply demonstrates, North Korea has a tradition of diving into lavish, monumental projects, no matter their relevance to larger economic conundrums such as producing reliable electricity or adequate food.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With South Korea set to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, there is little doubt Pyongyang felt it had to do something lest it be outdone yet again by its prosperous southern brethren.</p><p></p><p>Ski chief Kim said Masik was floated as a potential venue for the 2018 Games, but Seoul turned that offer down. Kim – who began skiing as a child and competed in international cross-country competitions – vowed that with Masik as a training centre, North Korea will have a world champion of its own in just a few years' time. So far, it has won only two medals at the Winter Games – both in speed skating.</p><p></p><p>But North Korea has not forgotten that Kim has vowed that improving the economy is as important as nuclear weapons development.</p><p>Kim and his coterie of advisers have vowed repeatedly to lift North Korea's standard of living, which is among the world's lowest .</p><p></p><p>North Korea has focused on boosting tourism, providing the impoverished country with the accoutrements of a \"civilised\" nation and, most visibly, encouraging a broader interest in sports. The development of Masik Pass dovetails nicely with all three policy goals.</p><p></p><p>Sports are billed as a means of energising and mobilising the masses, or as North Korea's slogan-spinners say, \"the hot wind of sports blowing through Korea\".</p><p>All this is reflected in North Korea's otherwise head-scratch-inducing association with former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who had Kim's ear and received the red carpet treatment both times he visited this year.</p><p></p><p>In Pyongyang, a plethora of recreational sports parks, basketball courts and inline skating rinks have popped up over the past several months. While few North Koreans could afford a trip to Masik Pass, the leadership could offer visits as a reward for loyalty or exceptional work. Planners foresee hordes of tourists driving to the resort after arriving by plane at a converted military airbase in the nearest city, Wonsan. The resort also has its own heliport.</p><p></p><p>\"All of Wonsan will be turned into a tourist area,\" Ri Ki Song, an economist for the Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in a recent interview in Pyongyang. \"It will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy. It will also be a place for our own people to use.\"</p><p></p><p>Many  economists outside the country argue that if it is serious about improving its economy, North Korea should implement market reforms, build its energy and agricultural sectors and improve international relations by focusing less on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p><p></p><p>\"Certainly, the calculus is different in North Korea than in most places – they've demonstrated pretty consistently that economic efficiency is not the priority,\" said Andray Abrahamian, the executive director of Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit organisation that aims to build North Korean business savvy and economic growth. But Abrahamian said Masik is not merely a gilded albatross.</p><p></p><p>\"These kinds of projects are no more a boondoggle than say, hosting the Olympics or the World Cup,\" he said. \"The financial costs are very high, but the broader social gains – which don't show up on a balance sheet – are deemed to be higher. Nationalism, civic pride, health, urban regeneration, tourism dollars, construction projects for cronies – all these things come into consideration.\"</p><p></p><p>Though the ski season begins in December, officials plan to open the resort on 10 October on the 68th anniversary of the Korean Workers party. Kim Jong-un has visited the site twice, most recently last month. \"Masik Pass Speed\" has joined the long list of North Korean propaganda accolades for those who selflessly carry out the orders of their rulers.</p><p></p><p>With the clock ticking, the pace is frenetic. North Korean media recently claimed workers are \"carrying out their daily quotas at more than 200%.\" As recently as last week, worker brigades were scrambling to finish not only the two main hotels – a 250-room, eight-story building for foreigners and a 150-room hotel for Koreans – but also an underground parking lot, employee housing and access bridges and a pumping station.</p><p></p><p>The resort won't be finished by Thursday; Kim Tae Yong, the ski association chief, said much of it will be built in phase two. His only concern is the ski lifts.</p><p>Last month, the Swiss government blocked plans for a company to sell North Korea $7.7 million-worth (£4.8m) of lifts and cable car equipment because of new sanctions barring the sale of luxury goods to the North. Austrian and French ski-lift manufacturers also have reportedly said no.</p><p></p><p>North Korea's state-run media has called the Swiss decision a \"serious human rights abuse that politicises sports and discriminates against the Koreans\". Kim called it \"a pity\". but said Masik Pass will have three functioning lifts this year.</p><p>\"We can make nuclear weapons and rockets,\" he said. \"We can build a ski lift.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419238545|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|4e65062d7f9d7284c7b1d094b2fe5cfa8280e6d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Harry Redknapp does not believe the Football Association's senior officials are equipped to make high-level sporting decisions and said he \"would not trust them to show him a good manager if their lives depended on it\".</p><p>Redknapp was considered to be the clear favourite to take the England job when Fabio Capello resigned last year, but the FA opted to approach Roy Hodgson, then in charge at West Bromwich Albion.</p><p>It had been considered a near-certainty that Redknapp would leave Tottenham to take the job, and he has admitted he believed as much himself, going as far as asking Brendan Rodgers, then at Swansea and now at Liverpool, to be his assistant at Euro 2012.</p><p>Although Redknapp maintains he holds no grudge against Hodgson, Redknapp is still unhappy and claims he was the leading choice with the fans and the players, suggesting senior members of the national squad like Steven Gerrard texted him to offer their support for him to succeed Capello.</p><p>\"I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it. How would they know? What clubs have they ever run? Who do they speak to who really knows the game?\" the QPR manager said in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail.</p><p>\"This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue. And they get to pick the England manager.</p><p>\"Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job. I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry. But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager – a man who is more their cup of tea.\"</p><p>While Redknapp was expected to leave Tottenham for England, he ended up leaving them without a job at all as the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy parted company with him that summer.</p><p>A number of Spurs fans had held the belief Redknapp had allowed the England job to become the focus of his attention and, despite denying that, he has confessed to making plans for the national team while in the Tottenham dugout.</p><p>\"If I had become the England manager I would have taken Brendan Rodgers as my number two,\" he added. \"My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?</p><p>\"So when Tottenham played Swansea on April 1, 2012, I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championship in the summer as my part-time coach?</p><p>\"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it.</p><p>\"Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day, by the way.</p><p>\"It didn't work out. On April 1, I was contemplating the way forward for England with Brendan Rodgers – and on April 29 the FA offered the job to Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"I'll admit, I thought it was mine. Everyone seemed so certain, everyone I had met from all parts of the game seemed utterly convinced it was my job.\"</p><p>Redknapp believes that the issue of compensation to Tottenham remains one of the reasons why he was never asked.</p><p>\"I'm sure the FA would deny they were interested in me anyway, they always like to say they got their No1 choice, but maybe what helped make their minds up was the thought of writing a cheque in the region of £16million to Levy.</p><p>\"He is known for driving a hard bargain at the best of times; get Daniel on a bad day and I would have ended up more expensive than Capello – and the FA were already getting a lot of criticism over his £6m-a-year salary.</p><p>\"Of all the reasons doing the rounds for me not becoming England manager, the compensation issue makes most sense.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419236317|2013-10-07T11:12:38Z|df7e45e4297abae9bd3816253f87685cedbc2496 -->",
