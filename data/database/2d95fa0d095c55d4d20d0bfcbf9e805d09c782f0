        "body":"<p>Exhausted airline pilots are frequently falling asleep in the cockpit, with one in six admitting to having slept at the same time as their co-pilot, their union has warned.</p><p>The British Airline Pilots Association released the findings of its survey after reports of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/airbus-pilots-asleep-autopilot-caa\" title=\"\">an incident in August</a> where a passenger plane belonging to a UK airline was left on autopilot as the crew slept.</p><p>Neither pilot had slept more than five hours in the past two nights before flying the Airbus A330, according to the official incident report logged by the Civil Aviation Authority, which did not issue further details.</p><p>The CAA report warned of aircrew suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue which one of the pilots ascribed to \"longer duty periods with insufficient opportunity to sleep\".</p><p>The CAA said it was an isolated incident while Balpa said it came as no surprise; it said it had repeatedly warned the CAA of the risk of both pilots falling asleep.</p><p>In its survey of 500 commercial pilots, conducted by ComRes, Balpa found that 56% admitted to having fallen asleep on the flight deck, with 29% of those having woken to find the other pilot asleep. The vast majority, 84%, said they believed their abilities had been compromised by tiredness in the past six months.</p><p>The survey showed that half of pilots believed fatigue represented the biggest threat to flight safety â€“ but a similar number also thought that their airline bosses would not back them if they refused to fly because of tiredness.</p><p>Balpa issued its warning ahead of a European parliament vote on Monday on new EU rules for pilots' flying hours. The union argues that the attempt by the European Aviation Safety Agency to standardise the rules will lower current British safety standards. It claims that new leeway to land a plane after 22 hours without sleep would mean a level of tiredness that equates to being four times over the legal alcohol limit for flying.</p><p>Jim McAuslan, general secretary of Balpa, said: \"A European regulator that lacks scientific and medical expertise is being allowed to tear up UK flight safety rules. Why this government is bending the knee to Europe rather than the wisdom of the piloting profession is as baffling as it is dangerous.\"</p><p>The CAA said: \"We understand Balpa are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now.\"</p><p>Earlier this month the Commons transport select committee said that while the draft European proposals had been toughened, it remained concerned that safety would be compromised. The committee said it was particularly worried that no lower limit for night flight duty was set, which they say goes against scientific evidence.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418359317|2013-10-07T11:13:02Z|21eedd895a8de34bd21ca94e2403f72a98df67b5 -->",

I think lessons will be learned from this. We are circulating this report within the industry.</p><p>\"We don't know why the pilots had had so little sleep before this flight. They were taking it in turn to have rest periods, with the one always checking the autopilot and it looks as if both fell asleep at the same time.\"</p><p>Details of the incident, logged by the CAA as a mandatory occurrence report, were obtained by a news agency that had asked about incidents relating to pilot fatigue.</p><p>The CAA did not say which airline was involved nor where the aircraft, an Airbus A330, was travelling.</p><p>The report, which was headed \"Flight crew suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue,\" said: \"Reporter (almost certainly the captain) suggests both members of flight crew had only five hours' sleep in two nights due to longer duty periods with insufficient opportunity to sleep. Both crew rested for 20-minute rotations and fell asleep.\"</p><p>Balpa said: \"In the UK we have a strict set of flight safety rules which govern how long and how often a pilot can fly before their performance is impaired.</p><p>\"The EU is proposing more permissive flight safety rules which would allow pilots to be flying aircraft whilst dangerously fatigued. These rules were not developed using scientific data and could have a grave impact on the safety of UK aviation.\"</p><p>Balpa said the EU proposals were flawed in many areas, with pilots being legally allowed to land an aircraft having been awake for 22 hours, pilots operating longer-haul flights (such as west coast US) with only two crew rather than  three at present, and pilots possibly being forced to work up to seven early starts in a row.</p><p>The CAA said on Thursday: \"We understand that Balpa are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now.\"</p><p>Balpa said last month's incident \"comes as no surprise\", adding that it had repeatedly warned the CAA of the risk of both pilots falling asleep, including in a letter to each member of the CAA board last year.</p><p>The Balpa general secretary, Jim McAuslan, said: \"British pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face. As the regulator responsible for UK flight safety, the CAA has been far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the under-reported problem.</p><p>\"In fact, the CAA and government are backing EU cuts to UK flight safety that will increase tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418306294|2013-10-07T11:13:02Z|b33c5f91730354a35984c4b3cd148df969110305 -->",

        "body":"<p>Exhausted airline pilots are frequently falling asleep in the cockpit, with one in six admitting to having slept at the same time as their co-pilot, their union has warned.</p><p>The British Airline Pilots Association released the findings of its survey after reports of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/airbus-pilots-asleep-autopilot-caa\" title=\"\">an incident in August</a> where a passenger plane belonging to a UK airline was left on autopilot as the crew slept.</p><p>Neither pilot had slept more than five hours in the past two nights before flying the Airbus A330, according to the official incident report logged by the Civil Aviation Authority, which did not issue further details.</p><p>The CAA report warned of aircrew suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue which one of the pilots ascribed to \"longer duty periods with insufficient opportunity to sleep\".</p><p>The CAA said it was an isolated incident while Balpa said it came as no surprise; it said it had repeatedly warned the CAA of the risk of both pilots falling asleep.</p><p>In its survey of 500 commercial pilots, conducted by ComRes, Balpa found that 56% admitted to having fallen asleep on the flight deck, with 29% of those having woken to find the other pilot asleep. The vast majority, 84%, said they believed their abilities had been compromised by tiredness in the past six months.</p><p>The survey showed that half of pilots believed fatigue represented the biggest threat to flight safety â€“ but a similar number also thought that their airline bosses would not back them if they refused to fly because of tiredness.</p><p>Balpa issued its warning ahead of a European parliament vote on Monday on new EU rules for pilots' flying hours. The union argues that the attempt by the European Aviation Safety Agency to standardise the rules will lower current British safety standards. It claims that new leeway to land a plane after 22 hours without sleep would mean a level of tiredness that equates to being four times over the legal alcohol limit for flying.</p><p>Jim McAuslan, general secretary of Balpa, said: \"A European regulator that lacks scientific and medical expertise is being allowed to tear up UK flight safety rules. Why this government is bending the knee to Europe rather than the wisdom of the piloting profession is as baffling as it is dangerous.\"</p><p>The CAA said: \"We understand Balpa are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now.\"</p><p>Earlier this month the Commons transport select committee said that while the draft European proposals had been toughened, it remained concerned that safety would be compromised. The committee said it was particularly worried that no lower limit for night flight duty was set, which they say goes against scientific evidence.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418359317|2013-10-07T11:13:02Z|21eedd895a8de34bd21ca94e2403f72a98df67b5 -->",
