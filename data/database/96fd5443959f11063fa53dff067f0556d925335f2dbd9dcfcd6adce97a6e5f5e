        "body":"<p>David Cameron this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/21/cameron-defends-wind-farm-mps\" title=\"\">strongly defended onshore wind power</a>, saying that he is determined to seize the economic opportunities in renewable energy supply chains, a position I strongly support.</p><p></p><p>Last year I launched a white paper on local transport, Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon. As far as I am concerned, they are two sides of the same coin.

They couldn't be more wrong.</p><p></p><p>The way to grow jobs is not by propping up the past, but by investing in the future. At the Department for Transport, we have made it clear that we need to do all we can to decarbonise road transport. Our firm commitment to low-carbon vehicles is beginning to pay off, not simply in lower carbon emissions but in terms of investment in jobs for the future. We will shortly see manufacture of the new electric Nissan Leaf begin in Sunderland, safeguarding 360 jobs and creating 200 more with the production of the new lithium ion battery.</p><p></p><p>Our ambitious investment in rail, particularly in electrification, is creating jobs today and cutting carbon tomorrow. Our Green Bus Fund, now in its third round, is not just cleaning up our buses, but proving a real boon for British bus manufacturers, both in terms of domestic supply and export potential. And our record spend on local sustainable transport is cleaning up our cities and boosting their economies.</p><p></p><p>So embracing green is good for jobs. The environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, hit the nail on the head at a Rio+20 Earth summit event recently, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/09/rio-20-earth-summit-caroline-spelman-speech?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">she said</a>: \"Being green is integral to sustainable economic growth.\"</p><p></p><p>The simple fact is that while much of the economy is struggling, there is a growing demand for green products. Private companies invested Â£2.5bn in renewable energy projects in the seven months from last April, with 11,619 new jobs being created, often in areas of higher unemployment such as the north-east, an area which has also enthusiastically embraced the move to electric vehicles.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Britain has the world's sixth largest low-carbon and environmental goods sector, employing over 900,000 people and growing by 4% a year. As a government we are determined to build on this using the British genius for invention and innovation to capitalise on the low-carbon future the world is embracing.</p><p></p><p>One reason why investment levels have been buoyant in green areas is because industry understands that we have to do things differently in the future. To take just one example, the growth of the emerging economies, particularly China, has led to a real terms increase in commodity prices of 147% over the past decade. If we want to prosper tomorrow, we cannot simply pull away at yesterday's levers. We need new answers, and ideally ones which are free from price fluctuation or the whims of unstable regimes. And that means reducing our dependency on oil for transport and energy. The result: more energy security, more UK-based jobs, less carbon.</p><p></p><p>But we also need to ensure that the decisions that individual departments like Transport take are properly joined up across government. We have set ourselves a tough challenge: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to be the greenest government ever</a>. It is a challenge that we in government are determined to meet, working across government departments rather than pigeon-holing the environment in only one or two departments of government. Safeguarding our environment has to be a cross-government purpose as important to the Business Department, the Treasury or Communities and local government as it is to Defra or Decc.</p><p></p><p>Governments can of course only do so much, but one key way to make a difference is to set a clear direction of travel and stick to it. So another reason why green investment has been buoyant is because of the clear buy-in by all three major political parties that tackling climate change is an essential, not just for environmental reasons, but economic ones too. If anyone doubted that, the game-changing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">Stern report</a>, emanating from the heart of the City, made it very clear that the price of doing nothing was greater than the price of taking action.</p><p></p><p>That is why creating growth and cutting carbon are twin objectives that we are determined to remain focussed on in government so that we can deliver both a stronger economy and a safer world.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/386334830|2014-05-14T16:53:39Z|e9477d9efa4e06d103e5d38676df7c39a7efc3f9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The prime minister has mounted a strong defence of the government's plans to build huge wind farms around the country in the face of strong opposition from his own members of parliament.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/82548604/David-Cameron-wind-letter\">David Cameron has written</a> to more than 100 of his own backbenchers who published an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/9061554/Full-letter-from-MPs-to-David-Cameron-on-wind-power-subsidies.html\" title=\"\">open letter to the PM</a> asking for subsidies for \"inefficient\" on-shore wind power to be slashed, and complaining about planning policies putting national energy policies ahead of local objections.</p><p>In his reply, addressed to <a href=\"http://heatonharris.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Heaton-Harris</a>, the Tory MP who organised the original letter, Cameron says he has sympathy with local residents' concerns, but insists there are \"perfectly hard-headed reasons\" for building more on-shore wind farms â regardless of the UK's commitments to meet targets for renewable energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"On-shore wind plays a role in a balanced UK electricity mix, alongside gas, nuclear, cleaner coal and other forms of renewable energy,\" said the prime minister. \"A portfolio of different supplies enhances energy security and prevents the UK from becoming over-reliant on gas imports.\"</p><p>In a nod to the growing pressure on the government to do more to stimulate the economy and in particular meet ambitious promises to create thousands more \"green jobs\", Cameron added: \"I am also determined that we seize the economic opportunities in renewable energy supply chains as the global race for capital in low-carbon sectors intensifies.\"</p><p>The PM also repeated the government's existing policy of <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_85/pn11_85.aspx\" title=\"\">cutting subsidies to on-shore wind by 10%</a> in the near future in recognition that the building cost had fallen.</p><p>The letter will offer some reassurance to the renewable energy industry, but is likely to disappoint MPs who signed the original letter, including some senior party figures such as the former party chairman and leadership challenger David Davis, and Nicholas Soames.</p><p>In return Heaton-Harris, who believes he has enough cross-party support â including at least 10 Labour MPs â to form an all-party group to keep the issue alive, said they would request a meeting with the PM to press for further concessions.</p><p>\"I obviously didn't expect the prime minister to just say: 'OK, you are right,' and change policy in this area and I am pleased he understands the massive concern that local residents have about these plans,\" Heaton-Harris told the Guardian.</p><p>\"However, those who signed the letter would like to see a cut in subsidy to on-shore wind greater than the 10% proposed, and hope that our suggested amendments to the national planning policy framework are taken on board. We are also concerned at how the cost of this type of renewable energy is adding to fuel poverty.\"</p><p>The prime minister's letter also said that new government planning laws were intended to give residents more say in combating unpopular planning proposals in their areas, while the Department of Energy and Climate Change has put forward a scheme under which local communities could take a financial stake in new renewable energy and claim some of the profits.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/386289604|2014-05-14T16:53:39Z|d73cbcafc70a69f68f18d1af7b204a74edfa2a79 -->",

        "headline":"Chris Huhne's successor faces clash as Tories attack windfarms spending",
        "body":"<p>The challenge facing the new Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, has been laid bare by the revelation that 101 Tory MPs are demanding drastic cuts to the Â£400m-a-year government subsidies for windfarms.</p><p>The demands from Conservative MPs, made in a letter to David Cameron, came as a former Liberal Democrat leader, Menzies Campbell, warned that there would be serious trouble from his party's activists if there was any rowing back from the coalition's commitment to run the \"greenest government ever\".</p><p>Policy on windfarms threatens to become a major fault line between the Tories, many of whom say they are expensive and inefficient, and the Lib Dems, who see the building of 4,500 more turbines as an essential part of the drive to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>In the letter, the Tory MPs tell the prime minister they are becoming \"more and more concerned\" about the commitment to \"support for onshore wind energy production\".</p><p>The letter is evidence of growing pressure from Conservatives to resist Liberal Democrat pressure to promote green policies which many Tories believe have no proved economic or environmental benefit. The warning came as Campbell said the Lib Dem grassroots would tolerate no rowing back from the green agenda that is central to their purpose in government following the resignation of Chris Huhne.</p><p>Huhne, one of the Lib Dems' toughest operators, resigned as energy secretary to mount a \"robust defence\" of claims that he persuaded his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, to take his penalty points for a speeding offence in 2003. The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, and his ex-wife, who faces a related charge, will appear before Westminster magistrates on 16 February. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>Campbell told the <em>Observer</em> that the Lib Dems' credibility rested on the new energy secretary taking as tough a line on green issues as Huhne and not giving in to the demands of the Tory right.</p><p>\"Liberal Democrat voters, and in particular Lib Dem activists, will not be content if there is any rowing back on the green agenda,\" he said. \"Commitment to the environment has an iconic place in the Lib Dem approach and if we were seen to water that down, publicly and privately, things could get very tough.\"</p><p>Environmentalists expressed dismay at the loss of Huhne from the heart of government. Greenpeace said he had been \"a vocal advocate for the green agenda in a government whose green credentials are looking more than a little tarnished\".</p><p>Huhne was furious when the chancellor, George Osborne, suggested in his autumn statement last November that the government could not put green policies before the need to create jobs.</p><p>\"We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminium smelters and paper manufacturers,\" the chancellor said. \"All we will be doing is exporting valuable jobs out of Britain.\"</p><p>Davey, 46, the former consumer affairs minister, , who has had a relatively low-profile career in the party until now, will join Nick Clegg  at an event which officials insist will demonstrate the party's determination to keep green policies at the top of the government's agenda.</p><p>Clegg is due to give a major speech on the environment within weeks, before Osborne's budget next month. Lib Dem sources said Davey, Clegg and others would be working on ideas on how to raise money to pay for more tax cuts for low earners through pollution taxes, most probably on aviation.</p><p>On his promotion to the Cabinet, Davey said he was \"particularly conscious of the impact on consumers' households across the country of high energy bills\". He made clear he would continue with Huhne's plans to increase the number of windfarms and \"a green economy where there's lots of green jobs to help growth in our economy\".</p><p>He added: \"I am determined to work to follow on Chris's priorities, the Liberal Democrats' priorities, the coalition government's priorities and make them my priorities.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/385505966|2014-05-14T16:53:39Z|782a91f85b94338032ea31e365065c82dabbb505 -->",
