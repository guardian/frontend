This is, of course, a hatchet long since buried, but even those of us who usually find regional pride to be infantile get prickly on this one against our own best judgment.

Has the loss of David Gill affected their business savvy in terms of deal-making. Tobias Sindram suggests that there may still be a delay on Herrera to save Bilbao's face with their fans:&nbsp;&quot;Bilbao tried the same to prevent Javi Martinez from joining Bayern on his €40m buy-out-clause. It halted the transfer for a couple of days but in the end Bayern managed to get around it, I think. And rightly so: If a club does not want to lose their player on the amount agreed in his buy-out-clause, well, don’t agree to that particular buy-out-clause. To insist on the player depositing the sum himself is at best sneaky and should constitute an action in bad faith. Anyway, what happened to inserting fantastic zillion-Euro-buyout-clauses nobody (bar Real Madrid, maybe) would ever be willing to trigger? I think maybe Bilbao just insists on the personal buy-out by the player to appease their own fans: 'See, we fought to keep the player. And no, we never actually thought of selling him for the buy-out-clause we deliberately agreed on.' By the way, I don’t care if United buy Herrera or not.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224c2fbe4b03491b6ac853b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:58:37.682+01:00\">5.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">David Moyes keeps hitting his redial button</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's Andy Hunter, our Stanley Park correspondent:</p> <blockquote> <p>Everton rejected a third joint offer from Manchester United for Fellaini and Baines at the weekend - this time &pound;40m - and today a separate &pound;15m offer for Baines as Jamie Jackson has reported.

Manchester United’s ability to sign the midfielder will depend on their resolve to test the rules governing buy-out clauses in Spain and the response of the league and the tax authorities to their actions. <br />Here, it becomes very complicated in theory. <br />Every player in Spain has a formal rescission clause, registered with the league which fixes the amount at which a player can unilaterally end his contract and move to another club. That player deposits the amount stipulated in his clause (in Herrera’s case, €36m) with the league and is then free to move. <br />Clubs agreed in principle that if another club pays the buy-out clause they will sell at that total price, meaning that the player does not actually pay the money: it effectively becomes a transfer like any other. But when it is a hostile bid, two other scenarios open up: one, that the club accepts the buy-out fee but, as all Spanish companies do, adds VAT (at 21%). And two, when the club does not accept the fee at all, the player deposits the money at the league himself. <br />Of course, in practice Herrera does not have €36m lying around, so United could in theory pay the money on his behalf. Yet that could be challenge by both the tax authorities and the league itself as the player would strictly be liable for 50% income tax.<br />None of this has been tested and some experts believe United would face no legal challenge. And yet the whole transfer is complicated enough to cause a few headaches on both sides.</p> </blockquote> <p>My brain hurts. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224bc67e4b074ec23392220\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:32:14.205+01:00\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Libor rigging?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Aston Villa are holding talks with Lazio over a deal for forward Libor Kozak, Sky sources understand,&quot; says a persistent correspondent.

There will now have to be some serious talking between the France midfielder, his agents and Pardew. A public apology to fans for his recent strike seems called for on Cabaye's part. Then he needs to nail on his World Cup place by helping turn this into a much better than expected season for Newcastle. Pardew had hoped to sign another striker - so much for Joe Kinnear's boast about being the greatest Director of Football - but at least they did get Loic Remy in on loan from QPR. Considering five players were signed last January and Hatem Ben Arfa and Fabricio Coloccini are now fit again the lack of transfer business is probably far from a disaster.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224b63ee4b0b6f34d589f59\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T17:03:55.257+01:00\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Do my eyes deceive me or is <strong>Gareth Bale</strong> wearing a Livestrong wristband for his big day? &quot; writes Neil Graham.

Liverpool have so far been unequivocal that he is not going, though.<br />&quot;Athletic Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde yesterday said he didn't expect <strong>Ander Herrera</strong> to go. That's essentially because Athletic will demand the buy-out clause and not only have United not matched that (€36m euros), but if they do it would be liable to tax at either 21% (VAT) or over 50% (income tax because player would deposit money).

Fellaini may submit a transfer request should Everton refuse United's latest offer but if it meets or even surpasses &pound;23.5m - the buyout clause that expired on 31 July and is reactivated on 1 January - that would be unlikely.</p> <p>To illustrate how this is normal managerial practise,&nbsp;Roberto Martinez will step up his efforts to sign <strong>James McCarthy</strong> from Wigan today. Everton had a cut-price offer in the &pound;10m region rejected on Sunday but, having received encouragement from Wigan that they are open to an increased, bulk payment deal for the midfielder, they will return as the Fellaini transfer progresses. <strong>Fellaini to United and McCarthy to Everton?</strong> Who would have thought it when that was reported on Martinez's first day as Everton manager back in June?</p> <p>And so to <strong>Baines</strong>. He is the one Everton and their fans would be loth to lose and United's offers so far have not come close to the club's valuation of the England international and their most creative outlet. Everton need all the creativity they can find on the evidence of recent matches but an improved offer above &pound;15m for the 28-year-old would leave Martinez and chairman Bill Kenwright with a difficult decision to make.</p> <p>Everton remain in talks for <strong>Gareth Barry</strong>, though it needs a compromise with Manchester City on his &pound;120,000-a-week wages for that to go through.</p> <p>Martinez is also an admirer of <strong>Tom Ince</strong> but not of Blackpool's &pound;8m asking price.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5224537be4b03491b6ac84f5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T10:01:26.808+01:00\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Will anything be happening at <strong>Manchester City</strong>?

He looked relaxed at Anfield yesterday, as he sat next to Richard Arnold, United’s managing director. But if 11pm is reached and Moyes has not been handed at least one midfielder questions are sure to be asked both inside the club and by United fans.</p> <p>The prospect of singing Roma’s defensive midfielder <strong>Daniel de Rossi</strong> appear dashed after his manager, Rudi Garcia, was quoted as saying yesterday: “We spoke when he came back from his holidays. We said that if it got past a certain date he would certainly remain with us. He will stay here for the season and that satisfies me a lot.”</p> <p>There remains hope that Fellaini’s team-mate <strong>Leighton Baines</strong> could also be signed.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52245069e4b0b6f34d589f28\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:48:22.542+01:00\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tyneside watch</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> with what to watch out for in the north east today:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;<strong>Andrea Dossena</strong>, the Napoli left back is reported to be flying to the north east ahead of a medical at Sunderland with a view to a season long loan.

Whether Glen Johnson's ankle injury will have an impact on that thinking remains to be seen. </p> <p>Spare a thought too for Martin Skrtel, who was outstanding against Manchester United on Sunday having been brought in from the cold due to injury to Kolo Toure. Skrtel was told he could leave earlier in the summer then, with Liverpool short in defence, that he had to stay. His application was clearly not disturbed against United but now with Sakho and Ilori pushing him further down the pecking order his prospects appear limited once again.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52244cc6e4b03491b6ac84f3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T09:35:16.746+01:00\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Ozil has chosen to stay at Real Madrid'</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So says Spanish newspaper <strong>Marca</strong>, who tend to be on the ball when it comes to life at the Bernabeu.

        "headline":"Michael Le Vell raped young girl as she held teddy bear, court hears",
        "body":"<p>The Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell raped a young girl as she clutched a teddy bear, a court has been told.</p><p>He allegedly told her: \"It's OK, just keep calm, stay asleep … I'm going to get rid of the evil.\"</p><p>The 48-year-old, who plays car mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV soap, is appearing at Manchester crown court under his real name, Michael Turner, and denies all the charges against him.</p><p>He faces five counts of rape, three of indecent assault, and two each of sexual activity with a child and causing a child to engage in such activity.</p><p>Eleanor Laws QC, prosecuting, told the jury the abuse began when Le Vell slipped his hand under the girl's clothing. Afterwards Le Vell seemed happy, \"as if it was giving him pleasure\".</p><p>The abuse progressed to Le Vell allegedly forcing the girl to touch him, with her \"too frightened\" to do anything to resist.</p><p>The first time he raped the girl, she clutched one teddy while Le Vell put another one over her mouth, it is alleged. The jury heard that on another occasion Le Vell raped the girl orally.</p><p>Laws said that after the first rape the girl had nightmares and frequently wet the bed. \"She talked to no one but her teddies about what had happened to her. She was scared if she told anyone she would get into trouble.\"</p><p>Le Vell allegedly threatened her, telling her: \"It's our little secret. No one needs to know, otherwise you'll be taken … You'll die and the evil will come over you.\" The child believed him, said Laws.</p><p>The actor's alleged victim frequently broke down as she described a series of attacks that she said began years before she reached puberty.</p><p>At first he would walk around the bedroom, just looking at her. She would half-open her eyes and so realized it was him. \"I remember being scared,\" she told the jury. \"It just didn't feel quite right.\"</p><p>Later, he would get in bed beside her and start moving his hand up and down her leg. \"He would say: 'It's alright. You know I'll never do anything to hurt you. It's just getting rid of all the bad and all the evil.'</p><p>\"He was saying it was OK, it was safe and things like that. But it obviously wasn't. It didn't feel nice at all. It felt really bad and I didn't like it. He said it was our little secret. I was 16 when I first told someone.\"</p><p>She claimed that during one rape he prevented her from speaking by putting one of her favourite teddy bears over her mouth \"so I could still breathe but not say anything\".</p><p>\"When it ended he just sort of got off, kissed my left cheek and then left. I was so in shock I felt as though I wasn't even in my body.\"</p><p>The alleged victim said that after some of the attacks she would \"start crying with my teddy bears and tell them what had happened\".</p><p>She felt \"more ashamed\" when he raped her orally. \"It felt more disgusting, more dirty,\" she told the jury.</p><p>The girl eventually told her mother what Le Vell had been doing to her while mother and daughter were attending a conference in London.</p><p>\"I told her he had raped me,\" she said. \"She just burst into tears and gave me a cuddle. She said it was going to be okay. I was relieved. I thought: 'I'm not going to let it ruin any more of my life.'</p><p>\"I'd felt as though I had done something wrong [because] he said there was evil in me. He made me feel I was a bad person and I wasn't.\"</p><p>The allegations against Le Vell emerged in September 2011.</p><p>A medical  examination found no apparent damage to the girl's hymen. But Laws said: \"It is important to understand that a substantial proportion of sexually abused children have no abnormal signs. Children can be confused as to what full sexual intercourse really involves.\"</p><p>It was common for a child to misinterpret simulated or attempted intercourse for full penetration. \"That is what the Crown suggest has happened in this case,\" Laws said.</p><p>Le Vell told police his accuser was \"a fantasist and an attention seeker and he thought this was just another of her fantasies\".</p><p>The actor, of Hale, Greater Manchester, accepted that he drank too much and had tried Alcoholics Anonymous in the past, though it had not worked for him.</p><p>Le Vell sat in the glass-panelled dock wearing a light grey suit and pink tie, with a charcoal grey scarf draped over his shoulders. He leaned forward intently in the dock as the girl gave her evidence and occasionally shook his head.</p><p>Earlier, Judge Michael Henshell had emphasised to the provisional jury that the man on trial was Michael Turner, rather than the character he plays in Coronation Street. He went on to urge them to tell him if they were avid fans of the actor, and gave them 15 minutes to think about it. \"If any of you want to be excused, I will excuse you.\"</p><p>Two female jurors were subsequently excused and a further two jurors selected.</p><p>The girl is due to be cross-examined on Tuesday. The trial continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416331784|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|87f3e3d2cc7a5c4e2f8e35103a825755d9a66abe -->",

        "body":"<p>Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson have landed the high-profile roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey in Sam Taylor-Johnson's forthcoming big screen adaptation of literary sensation Fifty Shades of Grey.</p><p>British author EL James, whose infamous knee-trembler has sold more than 70m copies worldwide, revealed the news on Twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/E_L_James\">She wrote</a>: \"I am delighted to let you know that the lovely Dakota Johnson has agreed to be our Anastasia in the film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey.\" A few minutes later, the novelist added: \"The gorgeous and talented Charlie Hunnam will be Christian Grey in the film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey.\"</p><p>Speculation over the identity of the main cast members for Taylor-Johnson's film has been at peak intensity since March 2012, when the project was first announced. Dakota Johnson, who is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, as well as the granddaughter of Hitchcock star Tippi Hedren, was <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/package/0,,20584416,00.html\">tipped for the role</a> of Anastasia by Entertainment Weekly last month. The US magazine also predicted that Britain's Hunnam might take the role of kinky billionaire business magnate Christian Grey, though the Sons of Anarchy star later denied the rumour.</p><p>Johnson is best known for small roles in the Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137709/social-network\">The Social Network </a>and comedy The Five Year Engagement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5rCHdw6CQ0\">in which she portrays </a>an energetic young woman with a high sex drive. Hunnam, who made his name in the cult US TV show Sons of Anarchy (and long prior to that, the British children's series Byker Grove), is riding high after strong reviews and decent global box office returns for Guillermo Del Toro's sci-fi action movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141017/pacific-rim\">Pacific Rim</a>.</p><p>Fifty Shades centres on Grey's recruitment of a young virgin, Anastasia Steele, to be his well-renumerated sex slave. It is expected to be the first of a trilogy based on James' triptych of novels, which began life as fan fiction for the hugely successful supernatural romance saga Twilight but have gone on to compete with their source material in terms of popularity.</p><p>Taylor-Johnson was r<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/20/fifty-shades-of-grey-sam-taylor-johnson\">evealed as the surprise director of the film version in June</a>. The artist turned film-maker, whose only feature film to date is the acclaimed 2009 John Lennon biopic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/132848/nowhere-boy\">Nowhere Boy</a>, reportedly beat out luminaries of the calibre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/10/50-shades-of-grey-joe-wright\">Joe Wright</a>, Bennett Miller and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/24/fifty-shades-of-grey-gus-van-sant\">Gus van Sant</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141017/pacific-rim\">• Full coverage: Pacific Rim</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416354680|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|abad80aa52260d6189f3dc85317ac7a9bc0f3347 -->",

        "headline":"Mesut Ozil signs for Arsenal in a £42.5m transfer deal from Real Madrid",
        "body":"<p>Arsène Wenger has given Arsenal's supporters the statement signing that they have craved with the €50m (£42.5m) purchase of the attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid, a move that has nearly trebled the club's previous highest outlay on a player. After a long summer of expressing his confidence that a big name would arrive and the club's increased financial firepower would claim a prize, Wenger raided Madrid for a player that he has long admired.</p><p>Ozil becomes the second most expensive signing in British football history, behind Fernando Torres, who joined Chelsea from Liverpool for £50m in 2011, and he has agreed a five-year contract, which is worth a basic £150,000 a week, with bonuses on top. The 24-year-old underwent his Arsenal medical in Germany on Monday, where he is preparing with his national team for the World Cup qualifier against Austria on Friday.</p><p>In some respects, the signing, which was completed about half an hour before the deadline, served to rescue a testing transfer window for Arsenal. They had previously looked to A-list strikers, namely Gonzalo Higuaín, Luis Suárez and Wayne Rooney only to fail to entice any of them while a loan move for Chelsea's Demba Ba broke down close to the deadline. Chelsea were reluctant to loan Ba to a Premier League rival.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-416318766\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/2/130902wenger-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/9/2/130902wenger_vpx.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/2/130902wenger_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/9/2/130902wenger_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/9/2/130902wenger-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/9/2/130902wenger/130902wenger.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>To onlookers, a top-class centre-forward had been Arsenal's priority followed, in no particular order, by a defensive midfielder, a centre-half and a goalkeeper. A midfield playmaker had appeared to be further down the wish-list but the opportunity to sign an international like Ozil does not come around very often and Wenger duly authorised the move, even if the fee might have gone against his natural instincts.</p><p>Arsenal's previous record signing was Andrey Arshavin at £15m from Zenit St Petersburg in 2009. The attacking midfielder was released on 30 June upon the expiry of his contract.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416371086'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378123648209/Arsenal-fans-show-their-s-008.jpg' alt='Arsenal fans show their support for Mesut Ozil' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Arsenal fans show their support for Mesut Ozil. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Wenger had said on Sunday night, after the 1-0 derby win over Tottenham Hotspur, that he was prepared to pay \"a bit over the market, as long as it is not crazy\" and he has stretched to make an extremely exciting signing. Ozil is the king of the assist – he has 72 over the past five seasons – while his technique and smooth passing style mark him out as a fans' favourite. At Gareth Bale's unveiling as a Real player on Monday afternoon, the crowd had chanted: 'Don't sell Ozil.'</p><p>Wenger's interest in Ozil dates to 2007, when the player was at Schalke. He would move to Werder Bremen in 2008 and make a significant impression upon the English conscience in 2009, at the European U21 Championship final, when he orchestrated Germany's 4-0 destruction of England in the final. Ozil starred for the senior Germany team at the 2010 World Cup and, although Wenger tried to sign him that summer, he moved to Real for €15m.</p><p>Ozil has had his reservations about the switch to Arsenal and only last Wednesday, he said that he would be staying at Real. \"A lot has been written about other teams but I have the coach's confidence and I feel good,\" he added. \"It's a pleasure and an honour to play for Real Madrid.\" When he joined Real, he had said that it was the one club a player could not refuse while he subsequently spoke of possibly ending his career at the Bernabeu.</p><p>He was talked round, however, by Wenger, after also realising that his chances in attacking midfield stood to be restricted at Real. The Spanish club have not only signed Bale this summer but, also, Isco from Málaga to supplement their existing options. Manchester United and Paris St-Germain had monitored Ozil's situation over the previous days but it was Arsenal who acted decisively.</p><p>Wenger had already signed the striker Yaya Sanogo and the former Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini, both as free agents, and he added the goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano on a season-long loan from the Serie B club Palermo earlier on Monday. The 27-year-old, capped six times by Italy, spent last season on loan at Fiorentina, where he kept 11 clean sheets in 32 Serie A appearances. He has been signed to provide cover and competition for the first-choice Wojciech Szczesny.</p><p>Wenger said: \"Viviano is a player that we have rated for some time and we are very pleased to have signed him on loan. He's experienced and has proved himself at a high level, and provides us with excellent cover to our existing goalkeepers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416326728|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|c008b82b65cc5b15a0f473e7d9039e88654379eb -->",

        "headline":"Smartwatches: what are Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft up to?",
        "body":"<p>\"The wrist is interesting,\" <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/05/29/apples-tim-cook-points-to-dearth-of-multiple-use-wrist-gadgets/\">said Apple chief executive Tim Cook</a> at the All Things Digital D11 conference in May 2013, when being quizzed about his company's potential plans for wearable technology in the years to come.</p><p>\"For something to work here you have to convince people it's so incredible, that they want to wear it... If we had a room full of 10 to 20-year-olds and we said, 'Everyone stand up that has a watch,' I'm not sure anybody would stand up.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Apple is one of the technology giants at the centre of growing speculation about smartwatches. Along with Samsung – whose Galaxy Gear is expected to be unveiled later this week – Google and Microsoft, the wrist is proving interesting for anyone who's anyone in the smartphone world.</p><p>Research firm Canalys recently claimed that 500,000 smartwatches will be sold this year, but then 5m in 2014 thanks to the entry of Apple, Samsung, Google and other technology firms into the market, alongside traditional watch-makers. </p><p>Rival IDC even thinks that <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24291713\">demand for wearables (including watches) could slow down tablet sales</a> over the coming years, reducing its forecasts accordingly. So what do we know – or, to be more accurate, what's been rumoured – about the plans of the big tech firms?</p><h2>Apple</h2><p>Apple has been rumoured to be making a smartwatch for some time now – it's a perennial rumour alongside an Apple television, hence those questions for Cook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/01/apple-register-iwatch-trademark\">Apple's registration of iWatch as a trademark</a> in Japan in June this year only fanned the flames of that speculation.</p><p>That came after a New York Times report claiming that the company had been <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/disruptions-apple-is-said-to-be-developing-a-curved-glass-smart-watch/?smid=tw-share\">\"experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass\"</a> and running  iOS software.</p><p>Past employees have been speculating too: <a href=\"http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/\">interface expert Bruce Tognazzini claimed the \"iWatch\" would</a> \"fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem. It will facilitate and coordinate not only the activities of all the other computers and devices we use, but a wide array of devices to come\".</p><p>Fellow ex-Appler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/mar/11/apple-iwatch-technology-monday-note\">Jean-Louis Gassée provided his own opinions back in March</a>, suggesting that \"the iWatch will enrich the iOS ecosystem: Reasonably useful on its own, but most important as a way to increase the value/enjoyment of other iDevices… at least for now.\"</p><p>In July, reports suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/apple-iwatch-hiring-outside-expertise\">Apple had made a number of \"acqui-hires\" of small companies</a> to build its \"iWatch\" team, sitting within a wider wearables group at the company. The Financial Times claimed that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a3cbfce-ec0f-11e2-bfdb-00144feabdc0.html\">Apple had been forced to turn to outsiders</a> to help with \"hard engineering problems that they've not been able to solve\" in-house.</p><p>In August, reports in Taiwan claimed that two local companies, Quanta and Inventec, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/29/apple-iwatch-suppliers-samsung\">won the contracts to build Apple's first smartwatch</a>, with suggestions that they could build up to 38m units in 2014 – although CIMB Securities analyst Wanli Wang predicted 63m units shipping in the first year after the device launched.</p><h2>Samsung</h2><p>Plenty of details have leaked out about Samsung's smartwatch plans: it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/16/samsung-apple-smartwatch-galaxy-gear-release\">expected to be called the Galaxy Gear</a>, and will be unveiled on 4 September ahead of the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin.</p><p>Last weekend, VentureBeat claimed a scoop: <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear-smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/\">actual pictures of the Galaxy Gear</a>, although the description – \"a blocky health tracker with a camera\" – didn't exactly whet the appetite.</p><p>The emphasis was firmly on fitness though: \"My initial impression was that it's a new wearable fitness device to rival a Nike Fuelband or Fitbit Flex — a smartphone companion rather than a smartphone alternative,\" wrote journalist Christina Farr. Separately, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/373185266720055296/photo/1\">shots of Samsung's app for controlling the watch</a> have also leaked, via the @evleaks Twitter account.</p><p>The expectation: a device designed as a companion to Samsung's Galaxy range of Android smartphones. As with other companies mentioned here, the inspiration is thought to be as much fitness-tracking bands by the likes of Jawbone, Nike and Fitbit rather than trying to squeeze a smartphone's guts into a watch-shaped device.</p><h2>Google</h2><p>It's just emerged that <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/08/30/google-wimm-labs-smartwatch-acquisition/\">Google quietly bought a smartwatch startup called Wimm Labs</a> in 2012: the company had released its own <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/9/2546990/wimm-one-review\">WIMM One</a> smartwatch in 2011 before shutting down in 2012 due to \"an exclusive, confidential relationship for our technology\". Google.</p><p>WIMM had been trying to build a platform for developers rather than just a device, although within Google it's now part of an even bigger platform and developer community: Android. Yet the other interesting thing about the WIMM One was its ability to work as a standalone gadget with its own apps, rather than simply controlling apps on a paired smartphone.</p><p>News of the acquisition made previous Google smartwatch rumours worth a second reading. The Financial Times reported in March, for example, that <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2013/03/google-smart-watch/?\">Google was working on a smartwatch project</a> within its Android unit, and cited a <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&amp;r=23&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(20121002.PD.%20AND%20Google.ASNM.)&amp;OS=ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google&amp;RS=(ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google)\">patent application by the company from 2011</a> for a \"smart-watch\" including a \"tactile user interface\".</p><p>The Wall Street Journal followed that up in June with claims that<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323689204578571992848684764-lMyQjAxMTAzMDIwNzEyNDcyWj.html\"> a smartwatch was being developed alongside a games console</a>, both powered by Android, as Google moved more into hardware. There was a hint that the two devices may be in competition in terms of securing a commercial release: \"The Internet giant hopes to design and market the devices itself and release at least one of them this fall,\" as journalist Amir Efrati put it.</p><h2>Microsoft</h2><p>Microsoft and smartwatches? There's some history behind that: the company's SPOT platform tempted the likes of Fossil, Suunto, Swatch and Tissot when its first watches launched in 2004, but <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/spot-watches-r-i-p-2004-2008/\">by 2008 it was toast</a>, filed alongside Tablet PC in the company's possibly-too-soon filing cabinet.</p><p>And in 2013? Suppliers to Microsoft <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324485004578423522275087936.html\">told the Wall Street Journal in April</a> that the company was sourcing components for a smartwatch prototype, including 1.5-inch displays. </p><p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524286/microsoft-surface-watch-smartwatch-testing-rumors\">The Verge followed up</a>, suggesting that devices were now being prototyped \"directly under the Surface team as the firm moves its wrist-worn device closer to reality\". The trouble with all Microsoft rumours right now, however, is that with chief executive Steve Ballmer on the way out, it's unclear what his replacement's strategy will be regarding schemes at the prototype stage.</p><h2>And the rest?</h2><p>Pebble Technology has sold more than 85,000 of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/21/pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter\">Pebble watches</a> since raising $10.3m to make them on Kickstarter. Sony is already on its second device, the SmartWatch 2, which went on sale earlier this year.</p><p>High-end smartwatch <a href=\"http://smartwatch.fm/blog/2013/8/30/exclusive-hyetis-crossbow-already-has-sold-300-smartwatches-at-1200-a-pop\">the Hyetis Crossbow has sold more than 300 units</a> – and that's at $1,200 per device. Intel is also testing some smartwatch devices in its labs.</p><p>\"The watch is kind of — if you want to put the time on it, that's fine,\" <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/17/smartwatch-intel/\">chief technology officer Justin Rattner told a Bloomberg conference</a> in June 2013. \"But if you're talking about texting today, wouldn't it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?\"</p><p>\"Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smartwatch\" <a href=\"http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/\">noted Quartz in July 2013</a>. And that's not to mention the traditional watch manufacturers.</p><p>\"Suddenly, everyone's discovered the wrist,\" Casio's chief executive Kazuo Kashio <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/technology/in-advent-of-the-smartwatch-a-name-thats-been-there-before.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times in August</a>. \"We've known for a long time it's prime real estate. We're prepared.\"</p><h2>What does this all mean?</h2><p>How much of the excitement about smartwatches is due to the desire within the technology industry (yes, including journalists) for a new category-shaking range of devices, rather than actual demand from buyers or a strong sense of why these smartwatches would be useful?</p><p>\"Smartwatches are a great idea – except for the 'smart' and 'watch' parts,\" <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/06/25/smartwatches-are-a-great-idea-except-for-the-smart-and-watch-parts/\">noted Time's Harry McCracken in June</a>. He went on to outline the barriers: battery life, display quality and \"no true killer apps\" – although he admitted that fitness-tracking gadgets may offer the most interesting path forward.</p><p>Even so, the interest in the future of the wrist – from Tim Cook and his fiercest rivals' companies – is genuine, as are the questions around the category's future.</p><p>Will these devices be more wrist-worn controllers for smartphones (and other devices) than running their own apps? Will they kill off the fitness-tracking bands, or provide the companies making those like Jawbone, Fitbit and Nike with a new product category to move into? Those questions won't be answered until 2014 at the earliest, whenever the Galaxy Gear goes on sale.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416339563|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|8393308ef0a420eb86e60a4d1a083df1f1120810 -->",

It blames rebel forces for using the chemical bombs.</p><p></p><p>The document states: &quot;Syria has one of the most important operational stocks of chemical weapons as part of an old and diversified programme that has been the subject of surveillance by the French [intelligence] services, and those of our principle partners, for a long time. This programme is one of the primary threats in terms of the proliferation of arms of massive destruction&nbsp;…</p><p>&quot;In its battles engaged against the opposition to the regime of President Assad, Damascus has already employed such arms, namely sarin, in limited attacks against its own population, particularly in April 2013.</p><p>&quot;The analysis of information that we have today leads us to believe that on 21 August 2013 the Syrian regime launched an attack on certain areas of the Damascus suburbs held by opposition units, using a combination of conventional weapons and the massive use of chemical weapons.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The report details the Syrian chemical weapons programme, which it says began in the 1970s with the importing of chemical weapons.

This branch, it claims, is &quot;composed only of Alawite military personnel … distinguished by a high level of loyalty to the regime&quot;.</p><p></p><p>&quot;Bashar al-Assad and certain influential members of his clan are the only ones permitted to give the order for the use of chemical weapons. The order is then transmitted to those responsible at the competent branches of the CERS. At the same time, the army chiefs of staff receive the order and decide on targets, the weapons and the toxic agents to put in them,&quot; it states.</p><p></p><p>The French report claims the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons against areas held by opposition forces &quot;with the aim of taking territory or causing terror&quot; for several months.</p><p></p><p>&quot;The competent French services have recuperated biomedical samples (blood, urine), environmental samples (earth) and materials (munitions) taken from victims or sites of attacks on Saraqeb, on 29 April 2013, and Jobar, in mid April 2013. The analysis carried out confirms the use of sarin.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The document's publication is aimed at swaying public opinion. While France, along with the United States, is pushing for military action against the Assad regime, a poll at the weekend showed that 64% of French people were opposed to a military intervention.</p><p></p><p>After the United Nations sent in an inspection team to verify the claims and counter-claims, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato secretary general, said he was personally convinced that Assad was responsible for the attacks.</p><p>The former French prime minister Alain Jupp&eacute; told French journalists France could not act alone, but must act.

And this time Gareth Bale was coming.</p><p>Tottenham Hotspur's chairman, Daniel Levy, had kept him waiting, forcing Real Madrid to dismantle and then rebuild the stage upon which they planned to present him, but just after quarter past one on the final day of the transfer window, the Welshman finally appeared at the Bernabéu, dressed in a skinny black suit. Down the steps from the directors' box he came: the world's most expensive player.</p><p>Bale took his place in the front row, introduced by the club's president, Florentino Pérez. Then it was his turn to take centre stage, yet centre stage did not appear to be his place. He was awarded <em>galáctico</em> honours but there was nothing flash about him at this unveiling. He later maintained that Cristiano Ronaldo, not he, is the \"boss\", the best player in the world, noting with a smile that he would ask permission before taking free‑kicks from the Portuguese.</p><p>As for the price, that was nothing to do with him: \"The transfer is between Tottenham and Real Madrid,\" he said. \"I'd have come here for a penny.\"</p><p>In for penny, in for a hundred million pounds. A hundred million euros, anyway. Real Madrid's official media quote a price of £78m (€91m) while sources at Spurs say €105m. Madrid's institutional director, Emilio Butragueño, accompanied him in the 45-minute press conference after the formal presentation here, while his family, including his daughter, Alba, sat in the front row. There was no attempt to correct questioners who referred to Bale as a record signing.</p><p>Levy had won a small victory, waiting until the penultimate day to give the all‑clear; he had won a big victory with the fee too. But Bale had what he wanted. Called to the stage, he gave a timid \"hello\" that was largely drowned out by the crowd cheering and chanting his name.</p><p>\"I just want to say that it is amazing to be here,\" he continued. \"It's a dream and I hope we can bring the 10th European Cup to the club.\" The <em>decima</em> is Madrid's obsession and it was the kind of line that would normally draw a huge roar but he had delivered it in&nbsp;English. \"I'm going to try a few words in Spanish,\" he said, adding: <em>\"Es un sueño para mí jugar en el Real Madrid, gracias. Gracias por esta gran acogida. Hala Madrid!\"</em> (It is a dream for me to play at Real Madrid, thank you. Thank you for this great welcome. Up&nbsp;Madrid!)</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416352272'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378137349931/Gareth-Bale-greets-Real-M-008.jpg' alt='Gareth Bale greets Real Madrid fans during his official unveiling at the Bernabéu' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gareth Bale greets Real Madrid fans during his official unveiling at the Bernabéu after his world record transfer. Photograph: Oscar Gonzalez/NurPhoto/NurPhoto/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>This time there was a roar. There was also a message for the club from those supporters: fans chanted the name of the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who is currently not in the side, and sang: \"Don't sell Ozil!\"</p><p>Bale then circled the pitch, timidly doing kick-ups and hitting footballs into the crowd, goalkeeper-style. Unlike Isco, signed earlier in the summer, he did kiss the badge for photographers. Then he headed back down the tunnel. \"It was a very surreal situation and I was very nervous,\" Bale admitted. \"I&nbsp;don't know if you could tell.\"</p><p>But at last he was here. \"It has been difficult but I am here now and I am delighted. Tottenham was great for me but when a club like Real Madrid comes in it is hard to turn down and I think they will understand that,\" Bale said. \"The president and José [Angel Sánchez, Madrid's director general] have put a lot of effort in and I put my trust in them the whole way. I believed from the beginning that they would make it happen. Everyone knows that [Levy] is a hard businessman and everyone knows he wanted to do the business for Tottenham and he has done well for&nbsp;them.\"</p><p>Bale said Madrid were always his target and he denied, not altogether convincingly, that Ryan Giggs had called him to persuade him to join Manchester United. Asked if Levy had broken a promise about letting him go to Madrid if Spurs did not make the Champions League, he replied: \"That's in the past. We had our own private conversation but we reached an agreement finally.\"</p><p>The agreement was made public on Sunday at 8pm and Bale arrived in Madrid at 2am on Monday and was driven to the Sheraton hotel. At 9.30am he underwent the medical in La Moraleja, to the north of Madrid, and posed for the obligatory photos: lying down on a medical bed, chest bare, cables connected, thumbs up. By 10.30 there were already queues at the Bernabéu, the lower tier of the stadium filling. As the clock ticked towards one, the second tier was opened too.</p><p>As the media entered, they were greeted by the surprise that Pérez had been gleefully preparing: a photograph of a grinning Bale, aged about 10, wearing a Real Madrid shirt, and performing a victory gesture. The shirt was from the 2001 season, a shirt worn by Steve McManaman. The photograph was blown up in huge format, adorning the stage, and was on the giant screens at each end of the stadium.</p><p>Pérez is fond of saying that his signings were \"born to play for Madrid\". This time he could do so with a little more credence. So, too, Bale when he talked, as he did often, of a dream come true. \"I've always followed Spanish football,\" he said. \"It's an amazing league and I have always loved Real Madrid. I have followed them all my life. I had the shirt when I was nine, 10, 11 years old.\"</p><p>Now he was handed a Real Madrid shirt of his own: No11, the number worn by Paco Gento – the only player to have won six European Cups. \"That's a bit of pressure,\" Bale said, smiling. \"I came here not just to play in the European Cup but to try to win it. I remember Zidane scoring the goal that won the Champions League [in 2002].\"</p><p>Bale had been asked about his first memories of Real Madrid. If the question was a test, he passed it.</p><p>This was a big event but did not have the choreographed charm of David Beckham's presentation, nor was it the bombastic occasion that Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival was, when 80,000 turned out and he paraded a walkway across the pitch. It was better that way; Bale was keen to dismiss suggestions that he would prove competition for the Portuguese, a pretender to his crown.</p><p>Asked if he would be taking free‑kicks, Bale grinned: \"Ronaldo's the boss here, I'll have to wait to see what he says. He's the main player, he's the best player in the world.\" So had he come to help Ronaldo then? Another grin. \"I don't think he needs much help.He's already proven that he's the best. He was a massive factor as to why I came here and I'm looking forward to that.\"</p><p>The question now is: when? Could there be another long wait? Bale has been training alone and has not played a match for 47 days. He will now fly out of Spain to join up with Wales. \"It's not been ideal but I've been doing my fitness training and I will meet up with Wales,\" he said. \"That should help my match fitness and my country as well. I would like to play with Wales and hope to come back fitter than I am now. I just want to get started now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416350885|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|05c7ca238ee94a2631dc5ec07dcae12e07b2283c -->",

        "headline":"Vladimir Putin under new pressure over Syria",
        "body":"<p>Vladimir Putin is to be confronted at the G20 summit of world leaders in St Petersburg this week with an array of western intelligence including damning new French evidence directly linking Syrian government forces with a massive and co-ordinated chemical attack on 21 August that led to hundreds of civilian deaths.</p><p>The Russian president will also be urged to show a new diplomatic flexibility and come closer to accepting that the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, has to stand aside.</p><p>A nine-page declassified French intelligence report was released on Monday which claimed to show Assad forces had launched an attack on Damascus suburbs held by opposition units using a combination of conventional weapons and \"the massive use of chemical weapons\".</p><p>The report follows similar documents from British and American intelligence.</p><p>The Nato secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen also insisted that \"personally I am convinced, not only that a chemical attack has taken place … but I am also convinced that the Syrian regime is responsible.\"</p><p>The French intelligence includes satellite imagery showing the attacks coming from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus and targeting rebel-held zones. The report said Assad's forces had since bombed the areas to wipe out evidence.</p><p>\"Unlike previous attacks that used small amounts of chemicals and were aimed at terrorising people, this attack was tactical and aimed at regaining territory,\" the report said.</p><p>Nearly 47 amateur video clips reportedly filmed on the morning of the attack and showing the impact on civilians had been authenticated by French military doctors, according to the intelligence. French evidence gave details of other suspected chemical attacks, in the towns of Saraqib and Jobar in April, which now appeared to have killed about 280 people, the report said.</p><p>The fresh information will also help Barack Obama in his uphill efforts to persuade Congress next week to back a punitive military strike against Assad.</p><p>Assad, in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, again denied the use of chemical weapons. \"Whoever makes accusations must provide proof,\" he said. \"We have challenged the US and France to put forward a single piece of proof. Mr Obama and Mr Hollande have been incapable of doing so. The Middle East is a powder-keg, and today the spark is getting closer.\"</p><p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, also rejected the western intelligence as absolutely unconvincing, saying that there was \"nothing concrete, no geographical co-ordinates or details … and no proof the test was done by professionals\".</p><p>He urged the west to lift the veil of secrecy over its allegations.</p><p>British sources said Putin, host of the G20, will face a concerted challenge at the summit on Thursday and Friday both to accept the intelligence, and propose a fresh diplomatic solution to the crisis by easing his support for the Assad regime.</p><p>Some senior Tories continued to put pressure on Downing Street to say it might be willing to hold a second Commons vote on whether Britain would in some circumstances participate in an attack on Syria in retaliation for the chemical attack.</p><p>Cameron unexpectedly lost the vote last week, but the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell led calls for Britain to keep an open mind. \"I believe taking legal and proportional action will be better than doing nothing – I think it will be more likely to bring this catastrophe to a close,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's why I think it's very important in this rapidly moving situation that we don't rule anything out and it may be, for example, that after lengthy and careful consideration, Congress affirms its support for the President's plans and in the light of that our Parliament may well want to consider this matter further\"</p><p>Advocates of a second vote were briefly given succour when the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said there might be a second vote if there were a very significant change in circumstances.</p><p>But Labour sources poured cold water on a second vote, saying the government had ruled out military action. Apparently raising the bar on military action higher than last week, Labour sources said a second vote could only be countenanced if there was evidence that al-Qaida had got hold of significant stocks of chemical weapons, or there was a direct threat to national security.</p><p>The Labour motion last week was less specific about the trigger for action, and it was not clear if all shadow cabinet members were aware of this hardened stance.</p><p>Labour instead tried to refocus on diplomacy, with the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, telling the Guardian: \"An objective for the G20 summit in St Petersburg should be to establish a Syria contact group, like that which helped end the civil war in Lebanon. Unlike the Friends of Syria group, which was established as a forum for supporting the Syrian opposition, a Syria contact group could bring together those countries that are currently backing opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, of course including Russia, but also key sponsors within the region such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.\" The contact group would work to bring the participants in the two-year civil war to talks in Geneva. Washington, with British backing, has opposed Iranian involvement in talks.</p><p>Plans to stage a second round of peace talks on Syria in Geneva have been stalled since March, partly over the US veto on Iranian attendance, and partly due to disputes in the Syrian rebel forces over the composition of its delegation, and the presence of forces loyal to Assad. Cameron will not have been emboldened by the publication of three separate polls on Monday showing strong opposition to British involvement in military action. A BBC/ICM poll found 71% supporting the Commons decision to stop British involvement in military action with 67% saying that \"the special relationship is not relevant to the modern age\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416366247|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|a4efabb57818c6cf8083582e1191089e1064988d -->",

        "body":"<p>He was simply a source of grace, a blessing, and you always knew he was on your side. I was lucky to know those qualities and see them captured in a single name – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/30/seamus-heaney\" title=\"\">Seamus</a>. What is it about some people that they seem to carry a kind of moral gladness with them?</p><p>Not that they are always good or always right, but that they hold out the&nbsp;possibility of a better selfhood for everybody. In the few days since he died, I've been feeling sore in the heart, because a light has gone out, a&nbsp;reliable comfort. More than that: a&nbsp;genius with a sublime human touch&nbsp;is now beyond reach. I recall the story of the little boy who watched as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robertburns\" title=\"\">Robert Burns</a>'s funeral cortege passed through the town of Dumfries. \"But who will be our poet now?\" he said to his mother.</p><p>Two decades ago, when I worked at&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\" title=\"\">London Review of Books</a>, the editor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/tretower-clyro-karl-miller-review\" title=\"\">Karl Miller</a>, would ask me to get people on the phone. Late one afternoon, when the paper was being put to bed, he had his nose about two inches from the page, a galley of Seamus's poem in tribute to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/03/poetry1\" title=\"\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>. \"Seamus, I'm very grateful to you,\" said the editor to the poet down the line. \"The problem is this. We're delighted with the poem, but there's a&nbsp;mistake in it.</p><p>(\"A mistake?\" I imagined Seamus saying. \"We can't have mistakes in the London Review of Books.\")</p><p>\"The thing is, you have this thing about MacDiarmid's 'chattering genius'. That's wrong. I'm from Scotland myself. You once said sheep chatter. And I can tell you Scottish sheep don't chatter, Seamus – they blether. Surely you mean MacDiarmid's 'blethering genius'?\"</p><p>In more recent years, the three of us&nbsp;started going on jaunts together. Everywhere we went, Seamus was recognised, and people felt he might have made their day or changed their life. (It was part of his good nature that each claim seemed to have the same weight with him.) Three years ago, I&nbsp;went with him to the University of Strathclyde so that he could receive an honorary doctorate. His wife Marie and I thought he wasn't looking well and, indeed, he suffered a minor stroke before the event and was taken to the Royal Infirmary. Before the ambulance doors closed, he gave me his speech and told me to read it out. \"They'll be waiting,\" he said. \"I know you'll do some credit to the words.\"</p><p>When the ceremony was over and I&nbsp;turned up at the hospital, he was sitting up in bed, joking with Marie, while the young doctor spoke to him about how much he loved his poem <a href=\"http://theleanover.tumblr.com/post/5837928582\" title=\"\">The Skunk</a>.</p><p>My father had died at the beginning of that week. \"No matter what happens,\" he had said to me, \"make sure you go and do that thing with Seamus. He's been good to you and he's a lovely man.\" When I got back to Inverness, I read a poem of Seamus's at my father's funeral and dropped the poem into his grave. My father's ancestors had come to Scotland from Magherafelt – a few miles from where Seamus grew up – and it felt proper to let the poetry of the old country go with him into the stony ground. I knew both men would appreciate it, allowing neighbouring voices to bridge the day, and it gave me comfort to know that all appointments had been met.</p><p>Memory was everything to Seamus. The memory of his father digging in the yard. <a href=\"http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/poetry/poetry_otherwars3.html\" title=\"\">The memory of peeling potatoes with his mother, or once noticing the glad eye of the coalman.</a> He had a mind to Ireland's memory, the seasonal return of faith and possibility, the falling away and the coming back of things. He cared for this the way other people care about politics. He wanted to offer value to a notion of existence beyond the bounds of sense, and that is where his language led him, to the power of wonder and miracles in daily life. Great is the friend whose one small shove can put you on the upswing. Being with him, I always felt able to give everything its due. His was a steadiness that befriended the person you wanted to be.</p><p>In Ayrshire, I once walked with him in a garden next to the town where I grew up. We took our drinks over the grass, and I showed him a gap in the trees revealing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21878099\" title=\"\">Ailsa Craig</a>, the rock that stands in the sea between Ireland and Scotland. Later on, at the birthplace of Robert Burns, we looked in on a multimedia exhibition called the Tam O'Shanter Experience.</p><p>\"Soon there'll be the Seamus Heaney Experience,\" said Karl Miller.</p><p>\"That's right,\" said Seamus. \"It'll be a few churns and a confessional box.\"</p><p>I asked Seamus how the folk around where he grew up reacted to him being&nbsp;awarded the Nobel prize for literature. \"Ignored it for the most part, I'm sure,\" he said. \"But yes, after the Stockholm Intervention, a certain Jackie Graham of the local grocery shop in Bellaghy wanted to open a Heaney Museum. 'It'll be good for you and good for us,' he said.\" Seamus didn't stand in his way and made sure some manuscripts and posters were put into the fellow's hands.</p><p>We drove on and went into the old church at Ettrick, and Seamus climbed up to the pulpit. He began quoting Thomas Hardy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/dec/28/poem-of-the-week-the-darkling-thrush-thomas-hardy\" title=\"\">The Darkling Thrush</a>, 31 December 1900. He spoke of a visit he and Marie made to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/flashlamp/1453688031/\" title=\"\">Stinsford Churchyard in Dorset, where Hardy's heart is buried</a>, at Hogmanay in the year 2000.</p><p>\"It's so quiet in here,\" I said. And the poet's voice rose up and seemed to rescue the beams from their own dampness. \"That's a warm voice, Seamus,\" I said.</p><p>\"Well,\" he replied, \"the long day wanes, as the master said.\"</p><p>The greatest of our trips was the one to the west of Ireland. We stopped for lunch at a favourite place of Seamus's called Moran's. It specialises in oysters, and they gave us a table to ourselves in the snug. There was a nice bottle of Alsace and we all three had chowder. Seamus once wrote a poem after coming here, called <a href=\"http://sweatshirtpoesy.com/2010/08/03/seamus-heaney-oysters/\" title=\"\">Oysters</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>We had driven to that coast <br />Through flowers and limestone <br />And there we were, toasting friendship, <br />Laying down a perfect memory <br />In the cool of thatch and crockery.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Laying down a perfect memory. That was it, wasn't it? That was the thing, and I knew it at the time. In the main room of Yeats's tower at Ballylee, with the shallow stream below and the light coming at the green-framed window, I looked at Seamus and Karl and suddenly had a vision of a time when none of us would be alive.</p><p>Yeats wrote about such a feeling in&nbsp;his poem <a href=\"http://ireland.wlu.edu/landscape/Group1/poem.htm\" title=\"\">In Memory of Major Robert&nbsp;Gregory</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>Now that we're almost settled in our house <br />I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us …<br />… Or mere companions of my youth, <br />All, all in my thoughts tonight being dead.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>We went to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/19/inis-meain-hotel-aran-islands\" title=\"\">Aran Islands</a>. As we left the boat at Inisheer, I could hear people whispering Seamus's name, and he was very good with that, saying hello to people. The island was so serene and filled with literary echoes. We climbed into a pony and trap at the pier and were soon off round the island. The man driving the vehicle was the very picture of robust outdoor health, and Seamus took pleasure, he said, in the way the fellow \"lazily whipped\" the pony every few seconds. \"You're the famous poet,\" he said. He clearly thought Seamus was a country man who had made it into the universe of electricity and television.</p><p>The next day, back in Dublin, Seamus took us over to St Patrick's Cathedral, and we stood before Swift's grave, reading Yeats's tribute, then Pope's. I&nbsp;went round the corner from there and&nbsp;saw a plaque on the wall to Swift's servant – put there, apparently, by Swift himself. I thought this was very cheerfully democratic and said so&nbsp;to Seamus as we stood in the cathedral's main aisle. \"Diligence and prudence,\" said Seamus. \"Well played, that man.\"</p><p>Three winters passed before we got another journey together. We'd been thinking about Wales for some time and set out at the start of the summer in 2010. Seamus agreed that we should pick him up at a hotel near Birmingham airport. By the Birkenhill Parkway, Seamus was standing outside his hotel next to a fire engine, as the entire human contents of the building were evacuated in a drill. Seamus was staring into space. \"Look,\" said Karl, \"the Great Bucolic Contemplates Life Among the Ring Roads.\"</p><p>The landscape at the Welsh border was green and silvery and not short of&nbsp;magnificent, the hills rising from nowhere. Wordsworth saw a model of&nbsp;immortality in the hills. \"Without the consciousness of a principle of immortality in the human soul,\" he writes in his <a href=\"http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/47764/\" title=\"\">Essay Upon Epitaphs</a>, \"man could never have had awakened in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows … To be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in&nbsp;absolute coincidence.\"</p><p>The grave of the poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/09/poem-of-the-week-henry-vaughan\" title=\"\">Henry Vaughan</a> can be found on a hill next to the River Usk. He lies in the graveyard of Llansantffraed Church, where there&nbsp;are trees on every side, the trees advancing like Birnam Wood. There are&nbsp;words, of course, on all the graves, but more than that there are words in the air:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>They are all gone into the world of light!<br />And I alone sit ling'ring here; <br />Their very memory is fair and bright, <br />And my sad thoughts doth clear.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Vaughan's grave is under a giant yew tree. It is stained with moss and lichens, its Latin phrases shaded. There's no obvious path up from the road, so we climbed through the grass and found the grave looking not obscure but unvisited. There's a bench to one side, with a bank of very old gravestones – some as old as Vaughan's (1695) – now attached to the wall for their preservation.</p><p>I took pictures while Karl and Seamus sat on a bench and argued about the Latin on Vaughan's grave. The epitaph speaks of maximum sin and an eternity of supplication before God. Seamus later wrote a poem where he referred to me as \"ardent Andrew\" and pictured him and Karl on \"the mossy seat\".</p><p>\"Well, here's Vaughan,\" said Karl. \"A&nbsp;believer. It's hard to think of you, Seamus, without belief. I find it hard not to believe you believe.\"</p><p>\"I stopped practising a long time ago,\" said Seamus, \"but some of it holds. If you have it as a child, it gives you a structure of consciousness – the&nbsp;idea there is something more.\"</p><p>\"I probably wouldn't go that far,\" said Karl. \"But I have to say: I always believed I would see my granny again. She was good to me.\"</p><p>\"For me, it was my father,\" said Seamus. \"I'd hope to see him again, all&nbsp;right.\"</p><p>We stayed there for a while and Seamus spoke about <a href=\"http://www.coldbacon.com/poems/fq.html\" title=\"\">TS Eliot and his&nbsp;Four Quartets</a>. In all our gadding&nbsp;about, there had been many&nbsp;versions of pastoral and an easy&nbsp;dalliance of time past and time present, but I sensed that, for Seamus at least, it wasn't like Eliot's rose garden up here. It was just a place where you could rest your bones, take&nbsp;a breath. And that's what we did&nbsp;that day as the world of light came into the trees.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416353281|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|844e109a1822ac41c0a8de0079d744fe54f154d1 -->",

        "body":"<p>His voice quavering, the son of Seamus Heaney has told mourners of his father's final words, minutes before his death.</p><p>At a requiem mass in Dublin, crowded with mourners, Michael Heaney described how the poet and Nobel laureate, who died last week at the age of 74, had chosen Latin for the message to his wife, Marie. His last words were \"in a text message he wrote to my mother just minutes before he passed away, in his beloved Latin and they read: 'Noli timere' – 'don't be afraid.'\"</p><p>Mourners at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, south Dublin, were led by the poet's widow, Marie, and their three children, Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann.</p><p>But such was Heaney's impact and the affection in which he was held that the crowd was swollen by Hollywood actors, rock stars, presidents past and present and prime ministers, as well as scores of ordinary people whose lives were touched by the Nobel prize winner's poetry.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416358637'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378122583712/Seamus-Heaney-funeral-010.jpg' alt='Seamus Heaney funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, left, at the funeral.

Shane MacGowan, former frontman for the Pogues, arrived as Holy Communion was being given out.</p><p>The president of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, attended as did the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, his deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore and the former Irish president Mary McAleese. Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams represented Sinn Féin.</p><p>Heaney's fellow poet Paul Muldoon recalled that when he landed in Belfast international airport on Sunday a security officer checking his passport had asked what he did for a living in the United States.</p><p>\"I told him I was a teacher and when he asked me what I taught, I said poetry. And then he looked at me directly and said: 'You must be devastated today.'\" For Muldoon the words of genuine concern from a border control official reflected how his friend's work had touched so many around the world.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416358638'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378122658318/Seamus-Heaney-funeral-Ger-010.jpg' alt='Seamus Heaney funeral: Gerry Adams' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness attend the service.

Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Among the celebrities and politicians were ordinary people, some of whom had their own stories about encountering Heaney. Pat McParland from south Armagh told the Guardian how the poet gave him and his future wife Joanne an impromptu engagement present inside a Dublin restaurant six years ago.</p><p>\"Joanne and I were in Dunne and Crescenzi, an Italian restaurant in Dublin's Frederick Street to celebrate our engagement. Seamus Heaney was sitting nearby us with some people having dinner. We kept getting mobile phone calls as people rang in to congratulate us getting engaged. Seamus must have overheard us and went over to wish us all the very best. Then he pulled out a poetry collection which contained his poem Scaffolding. He then wrote a couple of verses from that poem into the book by hand and then gave it to us as an engagement present. This gift from Seamus has become a very precious thing for Joanne and myself,\" McParland said.</p><p>Among others from the Irish literary world were one of his oldest friends and fellow Northern Irish poet Michael Longley. Other mourners included the former Beirut hostage and author Brian Keenan as well as the folk singer Paul Brady whose songs reflected in music the concerns and pain of the Northern Ireland Troubles that Heaney wrote about in so much of his poetry. Liam O'Flynn played haunting traditional Irish laments on the uillean pipes during the service.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416358640'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378122753729/Bono-at-Seamus-Heaneys-fu-009.jpg' alt='Bono at Seamus Heaney's funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The U2 frontman Bono with his wife, Alison Houston, at Heaney's funeral. Photograph: Liam Mcburney/PA</figcaption></figure><p>After the mass ended the funeral cortege began the long journey north, across the border and into south Derry where Heaney drew much of his inspiration in his early poetry.  He was buried in Bellaghy, the south Derry village where he grew up.</p><p>There has been wave after wave of tributes to the Nobel laureate since his death was announced on Friday. Around 80,000 stood up and clapped and cheered in his honour for three minutes at the All Ireland Gaelic football semi-final on Sunday between Dublin and Kerry. Books of condolence have been opened in Derry, Belfast and Dublin. But it was his son Michael's speech which he said would be \"nothing fancy\" that encapsulated the writing and the philosophy of the greatest Irish poet since WB Yeats.</p><p>Seamus Heaney told generations of aspiring writers: \"Do not be afraid\" in taking up the pen. Through decades he implored politicians, north and south, unionist and nationalist, \"do not be afraid\" in choosing the path of peace and eventually ending the Troubles by putting down the gun.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416357822|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|b73b36f8cded3b984cb47d9fbefb0c791f9ce6e9 -->",

Welcome to Middle East Live.</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/obama-seeks-syria-support-from-former-foe-mccain-13273.html\"><strong>President Barack Obama is meeting Senator John&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>McCain</strong></strong><strong> at</strong><strong> the White House, today hoping his foe in the 2008 presidential election will help sell the idea of a US military intervention in&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>Syria</strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;.</strong></a> The meeting is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama is not doing enough to punish&nbsp;Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, which the US says was behind an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that it claims included sarin gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children. McCain is perhaps the loudest voice in US politics in favour of intervention on behalf of the Syrian rebels. Yesterday, he said that that the president should threaten to take out Assad, warning that &quot;pinprick&quot; cruise missile strikes are unlikely to have much effect. He also warned against the possibility of Congress defying the president.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/us-members-congress-syria-briefing\"><strong>After a</strong><strong> classified briefing was held on Capitol Hill yesterday, </strong><strong>it was clear that the Obama administration could not be sure of the outcome of the vote on military action.</strong></a> In particular, Obama could not count on his own party to deliver the votes. &quot;I don't know if every member of Congress is there yet,&quot; said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat who said she would vote no on authorising a military strike. &quot;The room was sceptical,&quot; said Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/obama-strike-syria-congress-kerry\"><strong>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, expressed confidence that Congress would back Obama but said the president could go ahead with military strikes even without its approval.</strong></a>&nbsp;&quot;We don't contemplate that the Congress is going to vote no,&quot; Kerry said, but he stressed the president had the right to take action &quot;no matter what Congress does&quot;.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/02/ministers-face-questions-chemicals-syria\"><strong>British ministers are to face further questions over the decision to allow the export of substances used to make&nbsp;</strong><strong>chemical weapons</strong><strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;</strong><strong>Syria</strong><strong>, months after the country descended into civil war. </strong></a>In a letter to the business secretary,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a>, to be sent on Monday, a member of the House of Commons' committee on arms export controls will demand to know who was allowed to sell the chemicals and what other licences for the export of dangerous materials to Syria have been granted.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279620/Pressure-on-Cameron-for-new-vote-on-Syria-strikes.html\"><strong>David Cameron is under increasing pressure to return to parliament for another vote on British military action against Syria after the US postponed missile strikes for at least a week, the Daily Telegraph writes.&nbsp;</strong></a>Lord Howard, a former Conservative leader, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, and Lord Ashdown, a former Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday led calls to vote again. The London mayor, and potential future Tory leader, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279546/The-delayed-attack-on-Syria-is-good-for-Britain-and-the-PM.html\">Boris Johnson, writes in the Telegraph</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is new and better evidence that inculpates Assad, I see no reason why the government should not lay a new motion before Parliament, inviting British participation.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416301924|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|1e9f8233bc3f13ddd0afc961638c77d2182c52a8 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>So now that autumn is pretty much upon us, what are the big trends this season?</strong><br /><em>Mary-Catherine, by email</em></p><p>Well, Mary-Catherine, as if it's not enough that you cram two names into one, you ask a veritable mothership of a question, one that magazines this month take more than 400 pages to resolve, whereas we merely have this paltry column. Truly, it is quite overwhelming. I need to sit down for a second.</p><p>Right, that's better. OK, I just don't think I can handle this on my own, so I'm going to have to defer this question to the noble fashion council. Sorry, Mary-Catherine. I guess I just needed a bigger boat today.</p><p><strong>Alexandra Shulman:</strong> Right, order, order! What are we decreeing is de rigueur for the next six months?</p><p><strong>Alexa Chung:</strong> Pink! Lots of pink coats! I saw loads of them in the collection and they were GORGE.</p><p><strong>Shulman (rolling her eyes): </strong>Yes, thank you, Alexa. That's all well and good for gamine young things like you, but for the rest of us who don't want to look like Grayson Perry, any thoughts?</p><p><strong>Marc Jacobs:</strong> Yeah, I'm, like, really feeling the kind of dishevelled vibe, you know? Like, a super-sexy woman in a hotel who goes out in the middle of the night in just her negligee and a fur coat? That vibe is coming through really strongly for me. Is anyone doing a Starbucks run?</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Riiiiiight, thanks for that, Marc. Anyone have any thoughts for those of us who aren't Charlotte Rampling?</p><p><strong>Miuccia Prada:</strong> Si, dishevelled, si! But not negligees, no. More, um, how you say, jumpers. Si, jumpers.</p><p><strong>Shulman (perking up):</strong> Ooh, jumpers are good! Carry on, Miuccia.</p><p><strong>Prada: </strong>Si, jumpers. A very thick cardigan. Then over the cardigan you wear a gold leather bodice and then a giant tartan coat. It's a mix of frumpy and sexy, you see?</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Er, right. Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce? Do you want to contribute anything?</p><p><strong>Domenico Dolce:</strong> Molto, molto gold!</p><p><strong>Stefano Gabbana:</strong> E molto religious.</p><p><strong>Dolce e Gabbana: </strong>Si si, the donne – scusa – the ladies should look like the roofs of grand cathedrals. Molto bella e molto sexy!</p><p><strong>Shulman (head hitting her hands in despair):</strong> Uh, Karl? You want to step in?</p><p><strong>Karl Lagerfeld (his ponytail is perfectly powdered, he is wearing giant sunglasses and a plump white cat sits in his lap, which he strokes with the menacing solemnity of a Bond villain):</strong> Over-the-knee boots. Chic.</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Right, that was, um, brief.</p><p><strong>Lagerfeld: </strong>Brief is chic.</p><p><strong>Shulman: </strong>Sure.</p><p><em>(Suddenly, a chill enters the room and everyone freezes. Everyone, even Karl Lagerfeld, looks momentarily terrified. Welcome, Anna Wintour.)</em></p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Ah, Anna. How kind of you to make an appearance at the council. We're just …</p><p><strong>Anna Wintour (pointing her finger imperiously, like Cruella de Vil):</strong> Silence! I know, of course, what you are talking about. And I have come to tell you this: the trends for this coming season will be extremely expensive furs, very high-heeled shoes and full-length ballgowns. Now I'm off to eat a raw cow for lunch. Good day!</p><p><em>(Exit Anna Wintour.)</em></p><p><strong>Shulman: </strong>Well! Always nice to get a visit from our overlord. But perhaps we need a younger perspective. Not you, Alexa, and yes, I have already noted down your vote for peter pan collars. How about you, Cara?</p><p><strong>Cara Delevingne (slumped  in her seat, wearing a giant alligator onesie with a beanie on her head and gigantic Adidas trainers sticking out of the alligator's tail):</strong> Um, like, cropped tops and onesies?</p><p><strong>Shulman (realising perhaps the voice of youth is a little overrated):</strong> Well! Maybe we'll get some words from the quieter women in the room. Phoebe?</p><p><strong>Phoebe Philo:</strong> Whisper whisper whisper.</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Can you speak up, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Philo: </strong>Whisper whisper whisper.</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Er, great, thanks for that, Phoebe. Look, does anyone have anything the least bit useful to add here? Rei?</p><p><strong>Rei Kawakubo, the founder of Comme des Garçons:</strong> Weird pink kaleidoscope prints!</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Hedi?</p><p><strong>Hedi Slimane, designer for Saint Laurent: </strong>Grunge and tuxedos!</p><p><strong>Shulman: </strong>Tom?</p><p><strong>Tom Ford:</strong> Sex!</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Philip?</p><p><strong>Philip Green, CEO of Topshop:</strong> Hotpants!</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Mickey?</p><p><strong>Mickey Drexler, CEO of J Crew: </strong>Preppy!</p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Oh, for pity's sake … How about if we just tell them that tweed is back, coats are crucial, there's a bit of colour about, a bit of sexiness, fashion is fun, hemlines are both high and low, yadda yadda yadda. Will that do? Everyone happy with that?</p><p><em>(Non-committal grunts from the council.)</em></p><p><strong>Shulman:</strong> Good – meeting adjourned. And Marc? Get me a latte from Starbucks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416327292|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|c540fba558f7ede81d8473c254b7177387816507 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thousands of cyclists rode slowly past parliament on Monday evening in one of the bigger two-wheeled protests seen in Britain in recent years, timed to coincide with a Commons debate on measures designed to significantly boost cycling around the country.</p><p>The protest, <a href=\"http://lcc.org.uk/articles/join-our-2-september-space-for-cycling-protest-ride-telling-the-mayor-that-we-need-dedicated-space-for-cycling\" title=\"\">organised by the London Cycling Campaign (LCC)</a>, will set off from the south bank of the Thames at around 6.30pm, before snaking around Parliament Square. It is hard to predict numbers, but they are expected to be high, with feeder rides joining from several other parts of the capital.</p><p>The event, billed Space for Cycling, has two purposes: firstly, to pressure London's mayor, Boris Johnson, into speeding up a programme to make the city's roads more cycle-friendly; and also to remind MPs and ministers in the Commons chamber that there is an appetite for change among two-wheeled voters nationally.</p><p>One of those waiting at the start of the protest, Holi-May Thomas, from Brixton in south London, was joining the event on a sturdy sit-up-and-beg bike, wearing a summer dress and no helmet (\"I've got a sensible bike but I'm not a sensible girl\").</p><p>The 27-year-old cafe manager said she rode everywhere but wanted to call for more respect for cyclists on the road: \"It can be scary, and there's so many reasons why cycling is good for a city. We all need to be able to share the roads better.\"</p><p>The Commons debate was focused on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/apr/24/all-party-cycling-inquiry-report\" title=\"\">the Get Britain Cycling report</a> produced by an all-party group of MPs earlier this year, which recommended a series of measures including central targets to boost the proportion of overall journeys made by bike nationally from the currently tiny 2% to 10% and then 25%, and the creation of a \"cycling champion\" to lead efforts.</p><p>Somewhat dispiritingly for supporters of the report, the <a href=\"http://t.co/vH2Gxd73bK\" title=\"\">official Department for Transport response</a>, released last week, rejected the measures listed above, and offered little else in the way of new funding or policies.</p><p>Last month David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/12/cycling-groups-welcome-government-fund\" title=\"\">announced £77m of what was billed as new money for cycling</a>, but Mike Cavenett from the LCC said the overall message from central government was not good. He said: \"Once you dig around in the figures a bit you realise they're actually putting less into cycling now than when they abolished Cycling England three years ago. There is not the leadership coming from the prime minister.</p><p>\"There's a few pilot projects, but the time for pilot projects is over. The evidence is there for cycling, the health benefits, reducing congestion, fixing a lot of problems we have in our cities. It's time for evidence-based policy and putting money into things that work.\"</p><p>Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP who co-chaired the Get Britain Cycling inquiry with Labour's Ian Austin, said \"parts of government still don't get it\" on cycling.</p><p>Huppert said he was particularly worried about comments from Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, who has in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23837610\" title=\"\">called for councils to avoid \"anti-car\" road humps and high parking charges</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Anti-car-Cambridge-criticised-by-communities-secretary-Eric-Pickles-20130828060200.htm\" title=\"\">condemned Cambridge for having a pro-cycling policy</a> based on \"how some of the elite think we should live\".</p><p>\"I was really surprised by those comments,\" Huppert said. \"Cyclists are not the elite. It's a perfectly affordable thing for everybody to do. To get things done with planning there's a lot that comes from planning, so there's real issues there.\"</p><p>However, Huppert said Monday's debate was still hugely important as it was a formal motion with a vote at the end: \"This is a choice for parliament. Parliament could vote for or against it. I hope parliament will vote in favour of it, massively, and that would be a clear statement. This government should listen to it but also any future government.\"</p><p>The Lib Dem conference later this month <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/liberal-democrat-federal-conference-agenda-available-35625.html\" title=\"\">will debate whether to make the Get Britain Cycling recommendations formal party policy</a>, something other parties could choose to do as well. Huppert added: \"The debate is a staging post but it is still very significant.\"</p><p>The LCC and other cycling groups acknowledge that Johnson and his advisers, in contrast, have shown boldness in their plans. The <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/transport/publications/mayor-s-vision-for-cycling\" title=\"\">mayor's so-called Vision for Cycling</a>, produced in March, was praised for its ambition, a near billion-pound scheme including projects such as a long, segregated east-west cycling highway, and the creation of several \"mini-Hollands\" in outer London boroughs.</p><p>But Cavenett said more needed to be done: \"We've been impressed by the Vision for Cycling, we called it a groundbreaking document. But there's frustration among London cyclists that the mayor has been in charge for five years and very little has actually changed on the streets.\"</p><p>Recent cyclist deaths in London, including <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23210035\" title=\"\">one near the notorious Aldgate gyratory near the City</a>, highlighted the urgency, he said. \"It's known as a dangerous location, on one of the mayor's flagship superhighways. But at the moment we still don't have a timetable for upgrading that section of the superhighway. One of the core demands is: give us a timetable, tell us what you're going to do.\"</p><p>Andrew Gilligan, a journalist who now works as Johnson's cycling commissioner, said critics had to be realistic: \"We're going pretty quickly by local government standards. We don't own 95% of the roads, we have to bring lots of different groups on board, and make sure the schemes work for all vulnerable users, including pedestrians, and we have to get people used to the idea of taking space away from cars and giving it to bicycles.</p><p>\"It's a big change and you can't just throw it in overnight. The danger is that if you do that there's a backlash and you end up having to take it out again.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416344402|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|912a7a47cd485f1f96bbfdce3e7e7ecfeb45b09b -->",

The defence ministry declined to comment.</p><p>Barack Obama said on Saturday he would seek congressional authorisation for punitive military action against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after what the US says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people.</p><p>Russia says the US has not proved its case and that it believes the attack was staged by rebels to provoke intervention in the  civil war.</p><p>Russia is one of Assad's biggest arms suppliers and has a naval maintenance facility in the Syrian port of Tartous. Moscow opposes any military intervention in Syria and has shielded Damascus from pressure at the UN security council.</p><p>Interfax said the Priazovye would be operating separately from a navy unit permanently stationed in the Mediterranean in a deployment that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said is needed to protect national security interests.</p><p>The defence ministry said last week that new warships would be sent to the Mediterranean to replace others in a long-planned rotation of  ships based there.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416308910|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|a32bbf5634cb2c6164ff1bc99c2cd717faa495fd -->",

        "headline":"Is Britain a nation of addicts?",
        "body":"<p>Othello, act 2, scene 3. As part of his evil plan, Iago, you will remember, is trying to get Cassio drunk, singing a song to get him rowdy. \"I learned it in England,\" he says, \"where, indeed, they are most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander – Drink, ho! – are nothing to your English.\" Ever the entertainer, Shakespeare knew that you could always get a cheer from a crowd in this&nbsp;country by complimenting them on their drinking.</p><p>But why is it a compliment? The crippling intensity of one's hangover the morning after, the unwiseness of one's antics the night before, what makes these things that Britons boast about? The Centre for Social Justice, founded by Iain Duncan Smith, has just&nbsp;released <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/addict.pdf\" title=\"\">a report that argues for it to be a matter of shame</a>. \"Britain is the addicted man of Europe,\" the authors say. \"Growing sections of society are dependent upon mind-altering substances.\"</p><p>The report itself is a muddled, shrill and selective document, determined to&nbsp;bring together issues such as binge drinking, heroin addiction, legal highs, cannabis smoking and alcoholism, which have different levels of seriousness, patterns of use and potential for harm. Yet at the heart of it lies a truth: Britain&nbsp;is a nation addicted, not necessarily to drugs or alcohol per se, but to excess itself.</p><p>Here the facts are not in question. Although rates of drug use are broadly stable or falling, rates of opiate addiction are high in European terms, and in its penchant for party drugs Britain leads the world. Last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/jul/02/drug-use-map-world\" title=\"\">World Drugs report</a>, which ranked countries on the prevalence of different drugs, put the Isle of Man and Scotland at numbers one and two for cocaine use, with England fourth and Wales sixth. All four figured in the top 10 for ecstasy use as well. Britain also appears to be a&nbsp;hub for the development of new synthetic drugs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/28/legal-high-deaths-increase-year\" title=\"\">often known as \"legal highs\"</a>, because our laws take a while to&nbsp;ban them.</p><p>Yet <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health3/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning/2012/stb---deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning-2012.html\" title=\"\">the harms these do</a> are insignificant <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health4/alcohol-related-deaths-in-the-united-kingdom/2011/sty-alcohol-related-deaths.html\" title=\"\">compared with alcohol</a>. In western Europe, the report claims, British men have the second-highest rate of alcohol dependence. (Although, by eastern European standards, we look almost teetotal.) Among British women, however, alcohol dependence is the highest in the continent.</p><p>Still worse than mere dependance, however, is a culture that depends on bingeing. \"Bingeing is worse, because it's the peak alcohol that maximises toxicity,\" says Professor David Nutt, author of Drugs Without the Hot Air and former chair of the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. \"And the binge tradition is something that Britain has pioneered.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/07/safe-level-alcohol-consumption\" title=\"\">According to Nutt</a>, since the early 1970s, when the figures began to be collected, deaths from alcohol-related liver disease in the UK have quadrupled. At the same time, deaths from heart disease – for instance – have halved.</p><p>In part this reflects an increase in alcohol consumption (which has not quite doubled, even while its real price has fallen to about a third of what it was). But it is the pattern of consumption – the focus on excess – that is doing the most damage. Today, in Britain, men under 60 are more often killed by their own drinking than by anything else – and yet people almost seem to be&nbsp;refusing to notice. Amy Winehouse will be famous for ever as the brilliant musician who – once again – was killed by a drug overdose. But she wasn't. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/08/amy-winehouse-alcohol-poisoning-inquest\" title=\"\">She died of acute alcohol poisoning</a>. In&nbsp;Britain, three more young people join her every week.</p><p>Cigarettes make an interesting comparison. Tobacco isn't a drug of excess – it barely alters the mind at all – and here, although many Britons smoke, the rate is low by European standards, and is falling steadily. (Even so, <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/lung/smoking/lung-cancer-and-smoking-statistics\" title=\"\">around 114,000 people die every year from smoking in the UK</a>, compared with 1,496 last year from illegal drug poisoning, and 52 from legal highs, which was&nbsp;sufficient to cause a panic.) Look, instead, at football hooliganism or teenage pregnancy – other often harmful behaviours – and once again this country has led the way.</p><p>So what makes Britons rejoice in getting wasted, despite the harm? \"I&nbsp;think that there's a certain rigidity in&nbsp;the British and their class system,\" says Mike Power, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drugs-2-0-Revolution-Thats-Changing/dp/1846274591\" title=\"\">Drugs 2.0</a>, \"and there can be a kind of escape from&nbsp;that through bingeing. The Britain that I grew up in, lads didn't dance. They certainly didn't hug each other. I remember the first time I&nbsp;saw&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancefloor explode on ecstasy, I&nbsp;just didn't feel like I was in Britain at&nbsp;all.\"</p><p>Other explosions, controlled or otherwise, take place every evening in&nbsp;the country's pubs – those friendly drinking dens for which Britain is famous, and where the emphasis is always social. Intoxicate yourself alone, and you appear pathetic, as though it's the condition of being you that needs escaping from. Do it in a group, however, and it's the public condition – having to maintain dignity and self-control and not say the wrong thing – that you are throwing off. \"There is something we're trying to escape,\" Power says. \"I think it's just the pain of&nbsp;being British.\"</p><p>This ritual is not only enjoyed, remember; it's enforced. It's not just that drinking, especially, is celebrated; not drinking is resented too. Going to the pub with a friend and having an orange juice while they work through several beers is to let them take on the risk of making a fool of themselves on their own, while you – it is implied – can play spectator. In Britain, the sin is similar to visiting a nudist beach with your clothes on. It's what makes Iago Shakespeare's greatest villain. In that scene, you may remember, he isn't drunk at all.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416356207|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|6c950194397dfad523bcd06c989a7c19967df181 -->",

        "headline":"The women of Greenham Common taught a generation how to protest",
        "body":"<p>It is often said that the protest at Greenham Common was  ineffectual. The eventual closure of the US base at Newbury is deemed to have been an almost inadvertent side effect of much more important (ie male) political forces. In this version of history the bunch of women sitting near a fence in middle England 30 years ago are rendered pretty much irrelevant.</p><p>But, as campaigners save the village of Balcombe, at least temporarily, from the possibility of fracking, and the cries for fair taxation from UK Uncut are mirrored by world leaders at the G20, perhaps the real success of the protest was not simply what it changed at Greenham Common but how it changed the nature of protest.</p><p>Thirty years ago this month marked a high-water mark of sorts for the Greenham Common protests. In the summer of 1983, nearly two years after the campaign began on 5 September 1981, thousands of women took part in the Star Marches, simultaneous marches across the country to Greenham which helped show the extent of national support. G<a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/greenham-common-30-years-on/23788#sthash.GrjBrk6m.dpuf17\" title=\"\">overnment papers</a> released only a few weeks ago by the National Archives, show how senior Conservative ministers were worried that they were in danger of losing public opinion over the deployment of Cruise missiles.</p><p>Yet by November, the first of the missiles arrived and – despite the triumph of protesters occupying the central tower by the end of the year – by March 1984, the local council had joined forces with the Ministry of Defence and local police to start a process of mass evictions at the camp. Despite these evictions and the dismantling of the camp, an inevitable blow struck&nbsp;Greenham in the form of the international non-proliferation treaties of the late 80s.<strong> </strong>Closed for years, the symbolic Greenham tower has recently been put up for sale <a href=\"http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/2013/for-sale-bids-invited-for-greenham-common-control-tower\" title=\"\">with the deadline for bids on 11 September</a>.</p><p>In 30-plus years since I sat at the yellow gate filming the heavy hand of the police and the inexplicable prejudice of the media against a group, whose major crime seemed to be the absence of men, I have often reflected upon the creative solutions that the women found to issues that thwart even the most sophisticated of our politicians. This was a community making up its rules as it went along, and&nbsp;yet the lessons have been learnt by a generation.</p><p>Everything, from how to allocate donations to the distribution of cooking rotas was democratically decided. Who should speak, travel and represent the protest was a constant source of frustration to those from outside who demanded leaders while those within demanded that there should be none. Meanwhile, the women worked out how to care for the young, how to humiliate the authorities on the ground while arguing the case in the highest courts of the land, how to live with difference while living in a community that claimed one thing – the decommissioning of nuclear weapons – was more important than all other considerations.</p><p>In my time there helping to make Carry Greenham Home, the first film the protest, I saw a baby born, relationships come and go, and incredible acts of violence and kindness, from outsiders and wellwishers. I saw how a&nbsp;community could care for its young, its old, its needy and its troubled, showing compassion even for those who attacked it.</p><p>At a time when politics in its traditional form struggles to show leadership and find favour with the public, we should be more attentive to those who protest. The Blair government showed scant regard for those who marched against the Iraq invasion – in retrospect, showing more wisdom than their gung-ho leaders.</p><p>The Countryside Alliance carried the anger of those who live outside the urban sprawl and who have suffered decades of public policy that has eviscerated train services and post offices, favoured supermarkets over farmers and drained the countryside of its young and its identity.</p><p>More recently, the Occupy movement was the target of media sniggering because it could not offer soundbite solutions to the crimes of global finance. How naive to say \"We&nbsp;are the 99% and we want better,\" said commentator after commentator. No one seemed to observe that, given the lack of progress of both the international community and national governments in reforming the financial sector, wanting better seemed entirely appropriate.</p><p>Scratch the surface of many women in public life and you can often find a Greenham woman underneath. We know politics is the way you live your life, not the way you vote. Leadership is taking what and who is around you and working out how to make it better. Violence should not always be met with violence. Protest is what you do when those you elect are not listening, and it can, on occasion, be powerful to dress up in fancy dress and sing.</p><p>Greenham was a place where a generation of women found a public voice. It was a voice that was predicated on inclusion and difference, multiple perspectives not a single dominant view. It identified earlier than most that we had been let down by a political class, that the interests of ordinary people had been ignored in favor of warmongers and international business interests.</p><p>Far from being an irrelevance, the demands of the Greenham women have echoed down the years. And if you listen carefully you can still hear their demand: \"We want better.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416358176|2013-09-02T21:32:37Z|5d2181129481831f2faae5186ea046e272d3661f -->",
