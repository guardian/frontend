        "body":"<p>As a borderline running addict I've been on back-to-back marathon and ultra training schedules for the past four years, but have never tackled a multi-day race – until now.</p><p>To banish some post-race blues a few weeks back I found myself signing up for the <a href=\"http://www.4deserts.com/gobimarch/\" title=\"\">2014 Gobi March</a>, a marathon a day for four days, followed by a 50-mile run and ending with a 10K – all done while lugging a backpack with a week's food, clothing and sleeping bag. Part of the <a href=\"http://www.4deserts.com/\" title=\"\">4 Deserts series</a>, the 155-mile race passes through remote alpine grasslands, dry riverbeds and mountain passes in the remote Bortala Mongol and Yili Kazakh autonomous areas of Xinjiang province in north-west China.</p><p>So, what have I let myself in for and how different will it be to a regular marathon? \"In a single day race you can give it everything you've got,\" says <a href=\"http://www.rorycoleman.co.uk\" title=\"\">performance coach Rory Coleman</a>. \"If you're going for a marathon PB it doesn't matter if you can't walk the next day because you know you've given it your best – but in a multi-day race you've got to be able to run again the next day and the day after that.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421727379'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383316394738/Climbs-on-the-Gobi-March-008.jpg' alt='Climbs on the Gobi March' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Gobi March features some tough climbs, reaching 2,500m at its highest point. Photograph: Scott Manthey/4 Deserts</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://ryansandes.com/\" title=\"\">Ryan Sandes</a> won the Gobi March in 2008 (when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/30/dean-karnazes-man-run-forever\" title=\"\">Dean Karnazes</a> came fourth). The South African's first big victory launched him on a full-time running career and he went on to take the title at <a href=\"http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/311976-lt-100-mile-run\" title=\"\">the Leadville 100</a> a couple of years later.</p><p>\"The Gobi March was my first ultra and multi-day stage race so I would say it was one of the toughest I've done,\" says Sandes. \"Day one is easy as you start with fresh legs; days two and three are hardest as you wake up sore and mentally you know you are not even halfway; come day four my body starts to adapt; and the long stage on day five is all mental – waking up with sore legs and then running 80km takes quite a bit of psychological strength. It's about staying focused and getting through one stage at a time.\"</p><p>One of the main challenges of a self-supported multi-stage race is learning to run efficiently with a heavy rucksack so Sandes completed all his long training runs with a pack. He also built up to four consecutive long runs before tapering for the race.</p><p>\"Don't go into the race overtrained and make sure you get lots of sleep the week before,\" he warns. \"Keep eating during the race and stay hydrated, because if you get even slightly dehydrated it will really affect you on the remaining stages.\" Oh, and don't forget your earplugs.</p><p>Aside from the adventure of exploring a little-visited region of China and the challenge of a race over harsh and unpredictable terrain, many multi-day runners look forward to the luxury of being able to ditch the mobile and concentrate on nothing but racing and recovery for seven days.</p><p>Jo Eades, a solicitor based in Hong Kong who came second in the Gobi March last year, says: \"I love the complete ability to get away from everything and only be surrounded by positive things. I love the fact that each day all you are worrying about is your feet and food and enjoying complete immersion in the scenery. The course is stunning – and a good mix of running and hills.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421727380'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383316517688/Gobi-March-2013-winner-St-008.jpg' alt='Gobi March 2013 winner Stefano Gregoretti (left) nears the finish line' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gobi March 2013 winner Stefano Gregoretti (left) nears the finish line. Photograph: Scott Manthey/4 Deserts</figcaption></figure><p>Next June will see the 11th edition of the race – and its second year on a new course after organisers <a href=\"http://uk.racingtheplanet.com/store/\" title=\"\">Racing the Planet</a> decided the original location was becoming overrun by economic development. What were paths a few years ago had become 4x4 tracks, and what were tracks had become highways.</p><h2>Back-to-back runs and strength training are key</h2><p>Coleman – a veteran of more than 800 marathons and ultras including 4 Deserts' Atacama Crossing and 10 Marathon des Sables – has just clocked his fastest marathon time in 14 years on the back of <a href=\"http://tribesports.com/blog/28-days-of-28-miles-for-stoptober\" title=\"\">running 28 miles a day for 28 days</a> to publicise the government's Stoptober campaign, so knows a thing or two about endurance training.</p><p>He advises a schedule based on week-long blocks of medium effort, hard effort and harder effort, followed by a recovery week. For me, that's 50-60 miles (medium), 65-80 miles (hard), 80-100 miles (harder) and 20 miles (recovery) – starting at the lower end of those ranges and building up as the four-week cycle repeats.</p><p>Back-to-back runs – for example, running 20 miles on Saturday and another 20 on Sunday – are a key component. Some weeks I'll also squeeze in a fast 13 miles on the Friday so I enter the back-to-back weekend fatigued and get used to running on tired legs. My training peaks with four consecutive 20-25 milers.</p><p>There will be at least one long run a week with a pack slightly lighter (about 5kg) than the one I'll be carrying in the Gobi (about 7.5kg with food but not water). And Coleman suggests any time I can spend hiking in the mountains will pay off too because rough trails, hills and tiredness mean I will be power-walking some of the way.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.running-training-tips.com/weight-training-for-runners.html\" title=\"\">Strength training</a> will prepare my back and shoulder muscles for the burden of six days running with a heavy rucksack – seated rows to work the rhomboids, dumbbell shrugs for the traps and lat pull downs for the latissimus dorsi – plus the usual daily plank, sit-ups and squats session to maintain core strength.</p><p>\"Every session's got to count,\" says Coleman. \"Think 'what can I do every day to make my race better?' Multi-day races are about running within your comfort range – and the training is partly about extending that range. But strengthening the mind is important too and if you can run four consecutive 20-mile runs back-to-back you'll know you can do anything.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421694587|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|e212d2b093b925899d892b7c3637fdc732f6fa90 -->",

        "body":"<h2>The recipe </h2><p>Peel and thinly slice two shallots and put them into a&nbsp;deep pan with a tablespoon of oil and the leaves from six small sprigs of thyme. Stirring regularly, cook the shallots over a moderate heat until they are soft and pale. Add three shredded sage leaves, then pour in 500ml of stock and simmer gently.</p><p>Lightly oil and season a&nbsp;400g piece of skirt or rump steak. Warm a shallow, nonstick pan over a moderately high heat, add the steak and brown briefly on both sides. Add a 40g piece of butter to the pan, let it melt and start to fizz then continue cooking the steak, basting the meat with the butter until the steak is cooked to your liking. Remove the meat from the pan and let it rest, covered lightly with foil, in a warm place. Finely chop two tablespoons of parsley and two of chives. Slice the meat thinly, then divide it between two large soup bowls. Add the chives and parsley to the broth then ladle in the herb broth, spooning in the shallots as you go. Serves 2 generously.</p><h2>The trick </h2><p>Skirt is a thin cut, and will cook exceptionally quickly. As soon as it has browned on the outside, start basting with the butter, then lift it out to rest after just a couple of minutes. Rump will take longer. Resting the meat is essential. To get a clear broth, remove any froth that may rise to the surface as it simmers. A&nbsp;piece of kitchen paper wiped across the surface is a neat trick for removing the froth.</p><h2>The twist</h2><p>Chives and parsley have a natural affinity with beef, but you could also use tarragon or chervil to good effect. A vegetarian version of this dish can be made using thick slices of porcini in place of the meat, basting them in exactly the same way. Slice them thinly and add to the broth.</p><p>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nigelslater\" title=\"\">guardian.co.uk/profile/nigelslater</a> for all his recipes in one place</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421278953|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|c1c5b511be9995fe9709ec7fbe1f2d60eff90fdf -->",

        "headline":"Three things for swimmers in London to look forward to",
        "body":"<p>I like having swimming things to look forward to, but particularly ones I can get to on the bus. Here's three I've got my eye on – one short term, one medium term and one so far in the future that buses will have been replaced by personal jetpacks by then.</p><p>In the short term: shiny new pools. I do love baths – even the word is satisfying chunky, not thin and weedy like \"leisure centre\". But I also love shiny new pools (I may be shallow, but at least I'm layered. I'm basically a lasagne). It's all that glass and concrete, light and space; new lockers, new tiles, clean water. The one I'm most looking forward to, which most perfectly fills that brief, opens next April: the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Aquatics_Centre\" title=\"\">Aquatics Centre</a>. Its not one but <em>two</em> 50m pools will bring the number of 50m indoor pools in London to a dazzling five. (The other three are at Hillingdon, Gurnell and Crystal Palace. For comparison, according to the book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905624522\" title=\"\">Great Lengths</a>, a fantastic history of indoor pools, there are 18 50m pools in Paris alone – almost as many as in the whole of Britain. Lucky Paris.) I didn't see this pool in action – the only Olympic tickets I could have got were £900 for the pair, and I figured that if I were going to buy a pair of anything for £900, it would be cheap breasts.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to get a tour while the centre was being turned into a public swimming space, and it is glorious. Each of the pools has a different ambience – one under a waffled Middle Eastern-style low ceiling and an almost golden light; the other, the TV star, sits centrally in the belly of a enormous polished concrete whale, the diving boards rising from the floor at the end like baleens. <a href=\"http://www.gll.org/b2b\" title=\"\">Greenwich Leisure Limited</a>, which will be running the pool, has agreed to keep entrance prices in line with other local facilities, so this will really be proper legacy stuff. I can't wait.</p><p>The medium-term thing I'm looking forward to is planned for 2015: a swim at the very heart of my city. The Thames is what London is built around, shaped by and tribalised by. <a href=\"http://www.swimthethames.co.uk\" title=\"\">Swim the Thames</a> is a mass swim across the river, south to north, from near Tower Bridge, an area appropriately called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_of_London\" title=\"\">Pool of London</a>. The aim is to get 100 people doing a controlled, safe and legal swim across. Clearly, it would be extremely negligent to do it in any way other than fully supported by <a href=\"http://www.pla.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Port of London Authority</a>. The organiser Amy Sharrocks says in the blurb: \"We are reassured on many sides that the river is clean enough to swim in, so for one day let's submerge ourselves, dive in together and swim across the tide.\" All of which is right up my schwimstrasse, so I've put my name on the list. Why not add yours?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421691661'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383648852875/The-proposed-Thames-Baths-009.jpg' alt='The proposed Thames Baths Project.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The proposed Thames Baths Project. Photograph: Studio Octopi</figcaption></figure><p>Mention swimming in the Thames and everyone brings out their vomiting tales, so this next one will open the gates to D&amp;V hell. For what it's worth, I've swum in the Thames a few times and been utterly fine. So at some time far off in the distance (2023), I'll pop on my jetpack and zoom off for a rare treat: a new lido. I'm as full of anticipation as a kid waiting for Christmas. The proposed <a href=\"http://stockley.co.uk/uncategorized/london-as-it-could-be-now-the-thames-bath-project-2\" title=\"\">Thames Baths Project</a>, developed by architects Studio Octopi, puts a lido by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_Bridge\" title=\"\">Blackfriars Bridge</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://assets.inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/07/New-York-Floating-Pool-3b.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://inhabitat.com/water-purifying-floating-pool-cleans-new-yorks-rivers/&amp;h=370&amp;w=537&amp;sz=64&amp;tbnid=nde0J8_1u8JcxM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=131&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__uXCpunhtx3RQ-DL0Hh-c9KNrNI8=&amp;docid=vJAsNpHKlaqVxM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S8N4UtjlCqrI0QXkvYGABA&amp;ved=0CDIQ9QEwAA\" title=\"\">New York floating pool</a> is making a comeback – but that's plonked on top of the river. This one is not just on the water, it's in and of the water (though with protection from flotsam and passing river trade). The drawings are so tempting: a naturally landscaped site with floating pools filled by the tide would make a stunning addition to the river. To allay any immediate \"I'm not going in there, I'll get the fearsome squits and die\" conversations, by 2023 the new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24046324\" title=\"\">\"super sewer\"</a> will be in place, so water quality will be far superior. When the first sewers were opened in 1875, swimming in the river became commonplace – so this is at once terribly modern and also harks back to old times (without the concomitant death rates).</p><p>I'm an optimistic realist. I know that Christmas always comes and new lidos rarely do. In Victorian times, plans like this might have found favour with rich philanthropists; in these days of \"progress\", a backer is more likely to be corporate. I suggest they approach Coca-Cola, because the only time I consider drinking the foul stuff is when I get out of the Thames – <a href=\"http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/10985/Food++Dining/Top+25+Other+Uses+for+CocaCola.aspx\" title=\"\">its germ-killing abilities are legend among swimmers</a>. I'm amazed they don't use that in their ads.</p><p>All these things are London-centric, because that's where I live – but have jetpack, will travel. So at the risk of making the comments section into a community notice board, and on the basis that there would be nothing wrong with that at all, I'd like some more swimming things in the capital and nationwide to look forward to. Any suggestions?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421688943|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|4cbb4c2689be757c94b2289b85cc3190b32cd1f6 -->",

Huy Fong Foods' version, known as \"rooster sauce\", isn't the only brand of the unpronounceable (SIR-rotch-ah) relish available in the UK, but it is one of the world's most popular. With 20m bottles a year now rolling off its production line, the threatened factory closure (averted – but only for the time being) <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/31/sriracha_lawsuit_court_denies_irwindale_request_to_shutter_huy_fong_foods.html\" title=\"\">raises the spectre of a gobal shortage</a>.</p><p>The British have long had the hots for hot food. Hannah Glasse published the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry#cite_note-22\" title=\"\">first curry recipe in English in 1747</a>, signalling the start of our obsession with spiced – or devilled – dishes. But in recent years our hankering for fiery flavourings has intensified, and chilli sauce is now the fastest-growing category of table sauce on the market.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.iriworldwide.co.uk/About/tabid/223/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">the consumer research group IRI</a>, overall sales of table sauce fell by 0.3% in the 12 months to October, but sales of chilli sauce grew by 1.7% (with sweet chilli sauce recording 6.6% growth). We <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429718/Heinz-Tomato-Ketchup-is-off-the-table-as-shoppers-opt-for-more-exotic-condiments\" title=\"\">might be turning our backs on the likes of bog-standard ketchup</a>, but we're happy to shell out over £21m a year for the punchier stuff.</p><p>Not so long ago, a few dainty drops of Tabasco were pretty much all that was available to spice up a bloody mary or a plate of eggs (and didn't that dolly-sized bottle seem to last forever?). Now, if the top shelf of your fridge is anything like mine, there is a chaotic selection of sriracha, chipotle (both sauce and paste), harissa, sweet chilli, wasabi, horseradish … I dollop chilli sauce in/on pretty much everything: eggs, broth, potatoes, noodles, bolognese sauce – you name it, I think it tastes better with a dab of spicy heat.</p><p>\"The growth in sales of hot sauce in recent years has been staggering,\" says Karl Wirrmann, the founder of online chilli sauce company <a href=\"http://www.scorchio.co.uk\" title=\"\">Scorchio.co.uk</a>. \"I started the business as a hobby in 2006 because I was a fan of hot sauce and I couldn't find it easily in the UK. That's all completely changed now.\"</p><p>Heinz recently <a href=\"http://www.promomarketing.info/shopper/heinz-promotes-new-chilli-ketchup-with-pizza-hut-p/18776\" title=\"\">added a fiery chilli tomato ketchup to its range</a> in an effort to woo back British palates. Even <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/11/01/subway-sriracha-fast-food-trends/3329043/\" title=\"\">takeaway sandwich giant Subway is riding the wave of the sriracha craze</a>.</p><p>Wirrmann's company now specialises <a href=\"http://www.scorchio.co.uk/daves-gourmet-ultimate-insanity-sauce-p-399.html\" title=\"\">in \"insanely hot\" chilli sauce</a>, as consumer tolerance to \"mouth fire\" heightens. \"People can't get enough of the heat and the strength, and some just want their sauces hotter and hotter,\" he says. \"It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/sep/14/chilli-hot-food\" title=\"\">seems to have</a> an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jan/15/chilli-pepper-hot-for-you\" title=\"\">addictive quality</a>.\"</p><p>Wirrmann believes the increase in restaurants in which chilli is a key ingredient – Mexican, Vietnamese, Caribbean, southern US \"soul food\" – has awoken British taste buds to the joy of food that twins flavour with fire. There are also other benefits. A dash of sriracha, with its rich combination of chilli, vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt, can hide a multitude of culinary sins – Wirrmann carries a bottle with him when he's travelling to perk up plates of indifferent food. Nigella Lawson is also known to carry a bottle of Tabasco in her handbag for peppery punch when she's on the hoof, and <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/31/2203570.htm\" title=\"\">also – weirdly – keeps a bottle by the bed</a>.</p><p>Juliette Wall, the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.phocafe.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Vietnamese restaurant chain Pho</a>, attests to our ever-growing appetite for the hot stuff. In the past year, customers sweated through a quarter of a million teaspoons of sriracha. \"Many customers eat whole spoonfuls with every bite of pho,\" Wall says. \"They eat it like ketchup. Our spicy pho is now our biggest seller and we have extra chillies next to the till. We've also had to add chillies to our noac cham sauce – which never had chillies in it before – to cater to the demand for heat.\"</p><p>Sriracha devotees can take some comfort from the fact that, whatever the fate of the Huy Fong factory, they will never be short of tongue-igniting alternatives. <a href=\"http://readcereal.com/magazine/volume-2/gochujang/\" title=\"\">Korean gochujang</a> has been mooted as the new coolest chilli sauce in town, <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/community/cooking-fresh-wasabi\" title=\"\">with wasabi</a> hot on its tail. A friend swears by <a href=\"http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/p-8310-dollee-crispy-prawn-chilli.aspx\" title=\"\">Malaysian crispy prawn chilli</a> – it is wonderful with crispy cubes of Spam, apparently.</p><p>Do you douse everything you eat with chilli sauce, or is it a sure-fire way to obliterate the taste of good food?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421644311|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|33048e8b4dbe55352d9969cca022a0b94ac2b0e9 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Lamb 'osso buco' with parsley pappardelle</h2><p>One of those dinners that look as if they've taken forever but are in fact very quick. Ask your butcher for lamb leg steaks with the bone in. If you have no luck, then use a thick chump chop, bone in.</p><p>Enough for 4</p><p><strong>olive oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>leg of lamb steaks, bone in</strong> 4, about 1kg in total<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 large<br /><strong>celery</strong> 2 ribs<br /><strong>carrots</strong> 2 large<br /><strong>Marsala</strong> 250ml<br /><strong>pappardelle</strong> 250g<br /><strong>parsley</strong>, 4 tbsp, finely chopped<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g</p><p>Heat the olive oil in a large shallow pan, then brown the lamb steaks on both sides. Remove to a plate. Chop the onion, celery and carrots into roughly 1cm cubes and add to the pan in which you browned the meat. Cook over a moderate heat for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, till they are nicely coloured and approaching softness. Return the lamb to the pan, add the Marsala, season and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and continue cooking, covered with a lid, for 30-40 minutes, till the lamb is tender.</p><p>Cook the pappardelle in plenty of generously salted water till al dente, then drain. Remove the lamb and vegetables from the pan, dividing them between 4 warm plates. Add the pasta and parsley to the lamb cooking pan together with the butter and a grinding of black pepper. Let the pasta warm through in the butter and pan juices, then serve with the lamb steaks and vegetables.<br /><strong>From Kitchen Diaries II</strong></p><h2>Brussels sprouts, bacon and almonds</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421287790'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383138157684/Brussels-sprouts-bacon-an-009.jpg' alt='Brussels sprouts, bacon and almonds' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Brussels sprouts, bacon and almonds. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</figcaption></figure><p>I have been slowly coming round to the Brussels sprout. Not a Damascene conversion, more a slow warming (I have still to work out the allure of cooked carrots). Fried rather than boiled, partnered with the meat of the pig and slathered in cream, these are the sprouts for me. They never see water in this recipe – only hot butter, cream and bacon. There are almonds too, an inspiration. They were cooked for the last show of my third cookery series, a programme set in Scotland, where they appeared with roast wild venison and potatoes cooked with onions. The recipe is not mine but one of my assistant James's. I used purple Brussels sprouts but use whatever you have.</p><p>Enough for 4 as a side dish, 2 as a main dish with brown rice<br /><strong>smoked streaky bacon </strong>100g<br /><strong>onion</strong> 1<br /><strong>Brussels sprouts</strong> 400g<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br /><strong>whole unskinned salted almonds</strong> 100g<br /><strong>double cream</strong> 250ml</p><p>Cut the bacon into finger-width strips and let them cook in a large, shallow pan over a moderate heat till the fat runs and colours to a pale gold.</p><p>Peel and thinly slice the onion. Trim the sprouts and cut each one in half.</p><p>Place them cut-side down in a single layer in the pan, add the butter and let them brown very lightly, then add the onion. Continue cooking for about 10 minutes, until the sprouts are softening and the onion is translucent.</p><p>Add the almonds, then the cream. You need no salt, because of the salted almonds and the bacon. Leave to bubble briefly, then serve.<br /><strong>From Kitchen Diaries II</strong></p><h2>Pumpkin and tomato laksa</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421287791'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383138510318/Pumpkin-and-tomato-laksa-009.jpg' alt='Pumpkin and tomato laksa' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pumpkin and tomato laksa. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</figcaption></figure><p>Enough for 4<br /><strong>pumpkin</strong> 250g unpeeled weight<br /><strong>red bird's eye chillies</strong> 5 small<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br /><strong>ginger</strong> a lump the size of your thumb<br /><strong>lemon grass</strong> 2 plump stalks<br /><strong>lime leaves</strong> 6<br /><strong>coriander roots</strong> 5 or 6<br /><strong>coriander leaves</strong> a large handful<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> a little<br /><strong>chicken or vegetable stock</strong> 500ml<br /><strong>coconut milk</strong> 400ml<br /><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 24<br /><strong>nam pla (Thai fish sauce)</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>lemon</strong> the juice of ½</p><p><strong>dried noodles</strong> 100g, cooked as it says on the packet<br /><strong>mint leaves</strong> a large handful</p><p>Cut the pumpkin into large chunks and place in the top of a steamer (alternatively, steam them in a colander balanced over a pan of boiling water). The pumpkin should be tender in 12-15 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p><p>Chop the chillies, removing the seeds first if you wish, peel the garlic and ginger and chop roughly. Put them all into a food processor. Discard the outer leaves of the lemon grass and roughly chop the inner leaves, shred the lime leaves, then add them to the chillies. Scrub the coriander roots and add them to the chillies, along with half the coriander leaves and stems. Blitz them to a pulp, adding a little vegetable oil if the mixture needs it to go round.</p><p>Place a fairly deep pan over a moderate heat, add half the spice paste (keep the other half in the fridge for tomorrow) and fry it, moving it round the pan so it does not scorch. Do this for 1-2 minutes, then pour in the stock and coconut milk and bring to the boil.</p><p>Cut the tomatoes in half and add them to the soup with the nam pla and lemon juice. They will take 7-10 minutes to cook. Add the chunks of pumpkin and continue cooking for a minute or two. Place a swirl of cooked noodles in each of four bowls, pour over the laksa and add the mint and the remaining coriander leaves.</p><p><strong>From Kitchen Diaries</strong></p><h2>Seared beef with mint and mustard dressing</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421287792'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383138738855/Seared-beef-with-mint-and-009.jpg' alt='Seared beef with mint and mustard dressing' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Seared beef with mint and mustard dressing. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</figcaption></figure><p>Serves 4?<br /><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>Maldon sea salt</strong> ½ tbsp<br /><strong>beef fillet (thick end)</strong> 500g<br /><strong>olive oil</strong><br /><strong>lemon</strong> to serve</p><p>For the dressing:<br /><strong>grain mustard </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>lemon</strong> the juice of ½<br /><strong>mint</strong> a small handful (about 20 leaves)<br /><strong>egg yolks</strong> 2<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>about 4-5 tbsp</p><p>Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 7. Crush the peppercorns roughly with a pestle and mortar and mix them with the salt. Rub the beef with a little olive oil, then roll it in the seasoning, pressing down so that most of the salt and pepper sticks to the meat. Warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a roasting tin placed over the heat. When the oil starts to sizzle, add the meat and brown it quickly on all sides, then roast in the oven for 10 minutes only. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.</p><p>To make the dressing, put the mustard, lemon juice, mint leaves and egg yolks in a blender and whiz for a few seconds. Pour in the oil slowly, stopping when you have a dressing the consistency of double cream.</p><p>Slice the beef very thinly, then spoon over the dressing at the table. Pass a cut lemon round for anyone who wants it.<br /><strong>From Kitchen Diaries</strong></p><h2>Lime mascarpone sorbet</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421287793'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383138810091/Lime-mascarpone-sorbet-009.jpg' alt='Lime mascarpone sorbet' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lime mascarpone sorbet. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</figcaption></figure><p>Serves 4–6<br /><strong>water</strong> 750ml<br /><strong>golden caster sugar</strong> 350g<br /><strong>limes</strong> the juice and finely grated zest of 5<br /><strong>mascarpone</strong> 250g</p><p>Put the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Stir in the lime zest and set aside to cool. Now stir in the juice and the mascarpone. Scrape into a metal or plastic container and put in the freezer or an ice-cream machine.</p><p>If you are using a freezer, remove the sorbet after two hours and beat it firmly, bringing the frozen edges into the middle. Now return it to the freezer for a further hour, repeat, then freeze again. At this point you might well wonder what on earth I am up to as the mixture will look somewhat dodgy, with a frozen layer of white on top and a liquid layer underneath. Trust me. It will all blend together at the final beating.</p><p>When the mixture is well on its way to being frozen (the length of time this will take depends entirely on your freezer but it will probably be a good couple of hours) you must take it out and beat it again. Move the sorbet to the fridge 15-20 minutes before you intend to serve it.<br /><strong>From Real Food </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781841151441\" title=\"\"><strong>Buy Real Food from the Guardian Bookshop </strong></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007199488\" title=\"\"><strong>Buy Kitchen Diaries from the Guardian Bookshop </strong></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420787388|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|a23ac7f411e9a3452e3fb1c32473ed6befe8e3e5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Champagne has been enjoying a great run in Australia over the past year, with 11% sales growth over a period when the rest of the fizz field has stayed, ahem, flat &ndash; and little wonder with the strong dollar pushing down the average bottle price by $8 to $57 over the past five years.</p> <p>But is the fancy French stuff really the ideal match for the fascinators of Flemington? When it comes to the Melbourne Cup &ndash; a thoroughbred example of Australia&rsquo;s unique approach to sport and socialising &ndash; we should ditch the imported bubbles and choose Australian bottles as the ideal accompaniment to an afternoon of racing.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m not criticising champagne, but a visit to the recent Australian Sparkling Wine show &ndash; founded to support the regeneration of Marysville, the beautiful area beyond Victoria&rsquo;s Yarra Valley that was devastated by bushfires in 2009 &ndash; threw up some perfect wines for trackside drinking.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.courabyrawines.com\">Courabyra 805 Sparkling 2001 (Tumbarumba, NSW), 13% alcohol by volume, $65</a></h2> <p>This blend of 60% pinot noir, 30% chardonnay and 10% pinot meunier hails from the cool foothills of the Snowy Mountains and picked up the overall trophy at the Australian Sparkling Wine show. From the 2001 vintage, it&rsquo;s taken on a golden hue and calls to mind lemon zest, white stone fruits and freshly buttered croissants. It&rsquo;s dry and pretty full, still fresh in the mouth with peach and citrus, finishing with a nutty, biscuity complexity.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.leuraparkestate.com.au\">Leura Park Grande Sparkling Blanc de Blanc 2012 (Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria), 12%, $30</a></h2> <p>Made from 100% chardonnay grapes grown on the estate vineyard near Geelong, this is a crisp, lively young sparkling wine displaying notes of citrus sorbet, tonic and patisserie. The medium-bodied palate brings on lemon and apples with underlying toast, cream and vanilla.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.sheerdropwines.com.au\">Sheer Drop Sparkling Red NV (Bendigo, Victoria), 14%, $25</a></h2> <p>I was at an event recently where a US sommelier hailed the peacemaking qualities of sparkling shiraz. The label on this distinctly Aussie drop says non vintage but this is actually from 2008, and time has yielded a wine that is soft and rounded, with fresh blackberries, dark chocolate, pepper and cloves.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.houseofarras.com.au\">House of Arras Ros&eacute; 2004 (Tasmania) 12.5%, $80</a></h2> <p>House of Arras is the sparkling gem in Australia&rsquo;s crown, and this pinot noir-led blend is a beauty. Rose gold in colour, it smells of strawberries and cherry clafoutis. Strawberries, raspberries and nougat flood the creamy-textured, brioche-accented palate. For a cheaper alternative, try the<a href=\"http://www.dominiqueportet.com\"> Dominique Portet Brut Ros&eacute; NV</a> from the Yarra Valley ($28).</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.innocentbystander.com.au\">Innocent Bystander Moscato 2013 (Victoria), 5.5%, $20 a bottle or $120 for 24 slimline cans</a></h2> <p>An option prized by the sweet-toothed cognoscenti. This pink fizz is now in its 10th year and comes with trademark perfume, sass and spritz. It offers strawberries, raspberries and pink grapefruit alongside a touch of fairy floss.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662770|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|a62ccae0adcc271a3238ef1f83c0f115ad4f1f9b -->",

        "body":"<p>You can replace the squid with steamed prawns or fish, roast chicken or a barbecued and sliced beef or pork fillet. Add some pounded coriander roots to the dressing to lift the flavour. Tamarind can be bought either in water form ready to go, or as a pulp where you soak it in hot water then strain. Or you can add more lime juice or replace the tamarind with rice wine vinegar. </p><p>Wild green chillies of Thailand are also known as bird's eye chillies or heavenly rat droppings! The chillies have a wonderful immediate heat and a citrus lime flavour. </p><p><strong>For the salad<br />300g (10½oz) cleaned squid<br />3 red Asian shallots, thinly sliced <br />1 makrut lime leaf, julienned<br />½ lemongrass stem, pale part only, tough outer leaves removed, julienned<br />1 small handful mixed coriander, mint and Thai basil leaves<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />For the dressing<br />4 wild green chillies, thinly sliced <br />1 tablespoon caster sugar <br />Juice of 1 lime<br />2 tablespoons tamarind water<br />2 tablespoons fish sauce </strong><br />\t\t\t\t<br />For the dressing, pound the chillies and sugar in a mortar with a pestle to form a paste. Stir in the lime juice, tamarind water and fish sauce and check the seasoning.<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />To prepare the squid, cut off the tentacles and cut down the centre of the squid so it will open out flat. Score the inside with a criss-cross pattern then slice lengthways into 2 cm (¾ inch) wide strips. Cut the tentacles in half.<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />Blanch the squid in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for about 30 seconds or until it just turns opaque. Drain and allow to cool.<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />Toss the squid, shallots, lime leaf, lemongrass and herbs together in a bowl. Add the dressing, gently toss again and serve.<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />• These recipes come from Simply Good Food by Neil Perry, published by Murdoch Books.

        "body":"<p>Small and quietly spoken, Yas Necati is telling a room full of teenage girl guides about her last birthday; she spent it campaigning for better sex&nbsp;education and launching a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/petitions/david-cameron-bring-sex-and-relationship-education-into-the-21st-century-bettersexeducation\" title=\"\">petition</a> that now has more than 50,000 signatures. She is 17.</p><p>After her talk, a group of guides aged between 13 and 15 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Girlguiding/status/395215419000496128/photo/1\" title=\"\">present their own campaign</a>, one calling for an end to airbrushing in the media without consent or disclosure. By the end of the day, another group heads to the Houses of Parliament with hastily-made \"No More Page 3\" posters to protest against topless pictures of women in the Sun. These guides are already on their way to earning a new badge for campaigning and activism launched at Google Campus in London's Shoreditch, a venue meant to encourage collaboration, which seems apt.</p><p>The new badge's <a href=\"http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/Guides/gfibadge/gfi/2082_GFI_BeTheChange.pdf\" title=\"\">focus on empowerment and leadership</a> seems a far cry from traditional images of the 104-year-old organisation, whose hostess and needlecraft badges made it seem more akin to a junior Women's Institute. The new initiative, called Be the Change and launched in association with petition platform Change.org, also marks the first anniversary of the new chief executive of Girlguiding UK,&nbsp;Julie&nbsp;Bentley.</p><p>The former head of the Family Planning Association, who has previously campaigned on issues such as the cervical cancer vaccination, began her tenure by declaring Girlguiding UK the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/nov/15/girl-guides-feminist-organisation\" title=\"\">\"ultimate feminist organisation\"</a>. In the past year, Girlguiding has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/18/girl-guides-queen-god-country-promise\" title=\"\">dropped the historical allegiance to God and country </a>from the promise taken by guides, campaigned for better role models and body image for girls, and signed up to the No More Page 3 campaign after <a href=\"http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/news/no_more_page_3.aspx\" title=\"\">88% of its members</a> aged 16 to 25 voted in favour.</p><p>Yet in an interview before last week's launch, Bentley downplays her role in the change of tone and insists that the charity has always operated in this way.    \"I've been totally blown away by this organisation. It's been totally misunderstood by the general public,\" she says.</p><p>Bentley says that Be the Change was the brainchild of two teenage guides chosen to attend the Girls World Forum in Chicago to discuss issues such as poverty, gender equality and sustainability with guides from more than 100 countries. One of them, Amy&nbsp;Carmichael, says: \"Having met so many amazing girls from around the world, it was hard to believe that only 20% of parliamentary seats worldwide are held by women, and that it is only 22% in the UK. We wanted to develop the Be The Change resource to try and change this.\"</p><p>For Bentley, the highlights of her first year in the job include \"22,000 girls screaming in unison at the recent Big Gig in London's Wembley, six guides speaking on the platform at the Conservative party conference and the sight of a young woman in a wheelchair going down a zip wire\".</p><p>With 50,000 girls on a waiting list to join more than half a million others in what is already the largest youth organisation in the UK, the charity needs new volunteers to lead groups. \"I don't want [girlguiding] to be a secret, because we want and really need more volunteers to come and join us so we can meet the growing demand.\"</p><p>It could be said that the guides started as a feminist and campaigning group when girls \"gatecrashed\" the first Boy Scout Rally at Crystal Palace in 1909, demanding <a href=\"https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/about_us/key_information/history.aspx\" title=\"\">\"something for girls too\"</a>.</p><p>Listening to some of the young women speak at the launch of Be the Change is an antidote to much that is written about the young millennials of Generation Y,  that they are more apolitical and less collective than their predecessors. Yet Brie Rogers Lowery, who set up Change.org in the UK 18 months ago, believes the more politicised nature of the youth organisation makes it part of the zeitgeist rather than at odds with it. \"I often hear people say two things about today's society – that we are powerless to do anything to change things and that it doesn't matter because young people in particular don't care about politics. That makes me really annoyed, because what I&nbsp;see every day through our users on&nbsp;Change.org is that&nbsp;the opposite is&nbsp;true.\"</p><p>In contrast to the Generation X definition of \"Girl Power\" – the sort of assertiveness and individualism popularised by the Spice Girls – young women now use social media to join with those of a like mind for a common cause – whether it's inequality or the way they are judged on appearance. Examples are not just Necati and her <a href=\"http://campaign4consent.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign4Consent </a>cause but the<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TwitterYouthFeministArmy\" title=\"\"> Twitter Youth Feminist Army </a>or <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\" title=\"\">@everydaysexism</a>.</p><p>Increasing sexualisation and other signs of inequality have given these young women issues to campaign on of course. In the Girlguide's fifth Girls' Attitudes Survey, to be published at the beginning of December, many worry about body image, with satisfaction about appearance declining 30% among guides from the age of 10 to 16.  What's more, 68% of those surveyed said women were judged more for appearance than ability.</p><p>Isabelle Mahoney, about to start her A-levels in Woodford, Essex, says: \"I&nbsp;religiously read the paper every morning and if a woman isn't pretty, she won't be on the front cover. Women are there if they've got big boobs or they're married to someone.\"</p><p>There appears to be one thing the girl guides are not keen to campaign on, however – letting boys join. Girls have been allowed into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scout_Association\" title=\"\">Scout Association since 1976</a> and Bentley says she is willing to work \"collaboratively\" with the organisation that started life as a boys-only rival.  \"One of the things we consistently hear from our members is that they value the fact we are girl-only. Just last week I was visiting a guide group on the Kent coast, and they were invited to tell me one thing that they wanted to stay the same in Guiding. It was unanimous – girls only, please.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646570|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|f62ac6afb7b5ca67405867f654b9dab21564cb03 -->",

        "headline":"The thigh-gap obsession is not new but it's the most extreme body fixation yet",
        "body":"<p><strong>I read a piece in the Observer about young women's latest obsession: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/03/thigh-gap-pressure-point-women-self-esteem\" title=\"\"><strong>having a gap between their thighs</strong></a><strong>. Surely this must be the harbinger of the apocalypse.</strong></p><p><em>Rita, by email</em></p><p>Come come, Rita. To intimate the apocalypse you're going to have to do better than citing an obsession with one's legs. As all Bill Murray fans know, the only true harbingers of an apocalypse are \"human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together – mass hysteria!\" So until you show me any feline and canine cohabitation, I'm going to maintain you're still OK to make holiday bookings for next year without any risk of losing your deposit due to brimstone flooding.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/03/thigh-gap-pressure-point-women-self-esteem\" title=\"\">as my colleague Rosie Swash detailed in her article</a>, the thigh gap obsession is not good. In fact, this column is officially dubbing it A Bad Thing. To type \"thigh gap\" into Instagram is to gaze down a dark hole of scary sadness. The sense of horror Edvard Munch captured in The Scream is the terror he felt upon seeing Instagram names such thigh_gap_please and Twitter accounts such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarasThighGap\" title=\"\">@CarasThighGap</a>. No, it is not a&nbsp;widespread trend and, no, not every single female between the ages of 14 and 29 is obsessed with ensuring that their thighs don't touch any more than every single female thinks it is totally normal to wear 5in Louboutin heels every day (or ever). What it is, though, is an example of yet another form of body hatred that has been successfully marketed to vulnerable girls and women, and anyone who says that these&nbsp;trends are propelled by articles (such as – wahey! – this one) about said trends has clearly not spent much time talking with teenage girls recently or looking at their social media.</p><p>Just when you think there hasn't been an inch of the female body that has failed to be deemed in some way wanting, along comes another body obsession, whether it's the Daily Mail wailing about women's cankles or Instagram accounts obsessing&nbsp;over Alexa Chung's thigh gap. From&nbsp;one perspective, one could see this&nbsp;as proof of the inexhaustible ingenuity of the human species. From another, one might want to crawl under&nbsp;a rock.</p><p>Two popular misconceptions, though, should be cleared up from the start. This column has always given a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/mar/05/caryn-franklin-carer-partner-multiple-sclerosis\" title=\"\">big thumbs-up to Madame Caryn Franklin</a>, but her contention in Swash's piece that young women aspiring to unachievable physical ideals is a new development won't quite do. \"I had spent my teen years listening to Germaine Greer and Susie Orbach talking about female intellect,\" she says, and cheers all round. But to&nbsp;suggest that there is a dichotomy between having body neuroses and being intellectually stimulated isn't fair&nbsp;and misunderstands the problem here. When I was a teenager in the 90s, I&nbsp;happily read Charlotte Brontë and Chaim Potok novels, but simultaneously became so obsessed with having a flat stomach when I was 14&nbsp;that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jun/21/fashion.hadleyfreeman\" title=\"\">I pretty much stopped eating for a decade</a>. Turns out that intellectual pursuits are no guarantee of good mental health. To reduce body obsession to empty-headed narcissism feels like yet another way to criticise women and girls. Moreover, to claim that&nbsp;it's only in the past few years that women have been encouraged to suppress signs of sexual maturity in favour of looking like little girls is very selective imagining.</p><p>Nor, incidentally, is thigh-gap obsession new, it's just that it has only recently transferred over from the myopic enclave of the fashion world. I remember reading an article in US Vogue several years ago by a British writer in her late 30s about her devastation that she no longer had a gap between her thighs after having had two children. Incidentally, this writer studied at Oxford: clearly, as has been repeatedly proved throughout British history, that is no guarantee of intelligence or even common sense, but it does reinforce the point that intellectual stimulation is not a guaranteed medicine against body obsession.</p><p>Yet if the tendency to obsess over one's body doesn't change, certainly the extent of the obsession is getting more extreme. My sad little fascination with having a flat stomach looks downright wholesome next to Instagrammed photos of thigh gaps. So what next? A&nbsp;fetishisation of visible collar bones is already here, with various beauty products on the market designed to enhance women's collar bones, for that de rigueur \"starving child in Ethiopia\" look. Perhaps thinning hair due to malnutrition? Internal organ shut down? If I don't see someone down at the Dalston Superstore hooked up to an IV feeding tube by next fashion week, someone's not trying hard&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The question of what to do about it is, I'm afraid, disappointingly prosaic. No one can stop women and girls hating their bodies, no matter how many novels they read. But what we – the adults who don't obsess over thigh flesh – can do is to keep reinforcing the message to young people that to be strong and healthy is a good thing and to be frail and sickly is dangerous, and that anyone who feels differently is not to be hated but to be pitied. And, most of all, we need to live by our words and set the example accordingly. Because, ultimately, a&nbsp;life&nbsp;spent measuring your thighs is a&nbsp;life wasted.</p><p><em>• Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "headline":"Three things for swimmers in London to look forward to",
        "body":"<p>I like having swimming things to look forward to, but particularly ones I can get to on the bus. Here's three I've got my eye on – one short term, one medium term and one so far in the future that buses will have been replaced by personal jetpacks by then.</p><p>In the short term: shiny new pools. I do love baths – even the word is satisfying chunky, not thin and weedy like \"leisure centre\". But I also love shiny new pools (I may be shallow, but at least I'm layered. I'm basically a lasagne). It's all that glass and concrete, light and space; new lockers, new tiles, clean water. The one I'm most looking forward to, which most perfectly fills that brief, opens next April: the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Aquatics_Centre\" title=\"\">Aquatics Centre</a>. Its not one but <em>two</em> 50m pools will bring the number of 50m indoor pools in London to a dazzling five. (The other three are at Hillingdon, Gurnell and Crystal Palace. For comparison, according to the book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905624522\" title=\"\">Great Lengths</a>, a fantastic history of indoor pools, there are 18 50m pools in Paris alone – almost as many as in the whole of Britain. Lucky Paris.) I didn't see this pool in action – the only Olympic tickets I could have got were £900 for the pair, and I figured that if I were going to buy a pair of anything for £900, it would be cheap breasts.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to get a tour while the centre was being turned into a public swimming space, and it is glorious. Each of the pools has a different ambience – one under a waffled Middle Eastern-style low ceiling and an almost golden light; the other, the TV star, sits centrally in the belly of a enormous polished concrete whale, the diving boards rising from the floor at the end like baleens. <a href=\"http://www.gll.org/b2b\" title=\"\">Greenwich Leisure Limited</a>, which will be running the pool, has agreed to keep entrance prices in line with other local facilities, so this will really be proper legacy stuff. I can't wait.</p><p>The medium-term thing I'm looking forward to is planned for 2015: a swim at the very heart of my city. The Thames is what London is built around, shaped by and tribalised by. <a href=\"http://www.swimthethames.co.uk\" title=\"\">Swim the Thames</a> is a mass swim across the river, south to north, from near Tower Bridge, an area appropriately called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_of_London\" title=\"\">Pool of London</a>. The aim is to get 100 people doing a controlled, safe and legal swim across. Clearly, it would be extremely negligent to do it in any way other than fully supported by <a href=\"http://www.pla.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Port of London Authority</a>. The organiser Amy Sharrocks says in the blurb: \"We are reassured on many sides that the river is clean enough to swim in, so for one day let's submerge ourselves, dive in together and swim across the tide.\" All of which is right up my schwimstrasse, so I've put my name on the list. Why not add yours?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421691661'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383648852875/The-proposed-Thames-Baths-009.jpg' alt='The proposed Thames Baths Project.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The proposed Thames Baths Project. Photograph: Studio Octopi</figcaption></figure><p>Mention swimming in the Thames and everyone brings out their vomiting tales, so this next one will open the gates to D&amp;V hell. For what it's worth, I've swum in the Thames a few times and been utterly fine. So at some time far off in the distance (2023), I'll pop on my jetpack and zoom off for a rare treat: a new lido. I'm as full of anticipation as a kid waiting for Christmas. The proposed <a href=\"http://stockley.co.uk/uncategorized/london-as-it-could-be-now-the-thames-bath-project-2\" title=\"\">Thames Baths Project</a>, developed by architects Studio Octopi, puts a lido by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_Bridge\" title=\"\">Blackfriars Bridge</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://assets.inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/07/New-York-Floating-Pool-3b.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://inhabitat.com/water-purifying-floating-pool-cleans-new-yorks-rivers/&amp;h=370&amp;w=537&amp;sz=64&amp;tbnid=nde0J8_1u8JcxM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=131&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__uXCpunhtx3RQ-DL0Hh-c9KNrNI8=&amp;docid=vJAsNpHKlaqVxM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S8N4UtjlCqrI0QXkvYGABA&amp;ved=0CDIQ9QEwAA\" title=\"\">New York floating pool</a> is making a comeback – but that's plonked on top of the river. This one is not just on the water, it's in and of the water (though with protection from flotsam and passing river trade). The drawings are so tempting: a naturally landscaped site with floating pools filled by the tide would make a stunning addition to the river. To allay any immediate \"I'm not going in there, I'll get the fearsome squits and die\" conversations, by 2023 the new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24046324\" title=\"\">\"super sewer\"</a> will be in place, so water quality will be far superior. When the first sewers were opened in 1875, swimming in the river became commonplace – so this is at once terribly modern and also harks back to old times (without the concomitant death rates).</p><p>I'm an optimistic realist. I know that Christmas always comes and new lidos rarely do. In Victorian times, plans like this might have found favour with rich philanthropists; in these days of \"progress\", a backer is more likely to be corporate. I suggest they approach Coca-Cola, because the only time I consider drinking the foul stuff is when I get out of the Thames – <a href=\"http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/10985/Food++Dining/Top+25+Other+Uses+for+CocaCola.aspx\" title=\"\">its germ-killing abilities are legend among swimmers</a>. I'm amazed they don't use that in their ads.</p><p>All these things are London-centric, because that's where I live – but have jetpack, will travel. So at the risk of making the comments section into a community notice board, and on the basis that there would be nothing wrong with that at all, I'd like some more swimming things in the capital and nationwide to look forward to. Any suggestions?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421688943|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|4cbb4c2689be757c94b2289b85cc3190b32cd1f6 -->",

Huy Fong Foods' version, known as \"rooster sauce\", isn't the only brand of the unpronounceable (SIR-rotch-ah) relish available in the UK, but it is one of the world's most popular. With 20m bottles a year now rolling off its production line, the threatened factory closure (averted – but only for the time being) <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/31/sriracha_lawsuit_court_denies_irwindale_request_to_shutter_huy_fong_foods.html\" title=\"\">raises the spectre of a gobal shortage</a>.</p><p>The British have long had the hots for hot food. Hannah Glasse published the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry#cite_note-22\" title=\"\">first curry recipe in English in 1747</a>, signalling the start of our obsession with spiced – or devilled – dishes. But in recent years our hankering for fiery flavourings has intensified, and chilli sauce is now the fastest-growing category of table sauce on the market.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.iriworldwide.co.uk/About/tabid/223/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">the consumer research group IRI</a>, overall sales of table sauce fell by 0.3% in the 12 months to October, but sales of chilli sauce grew by 1.7% (with sweet chilli sauce recording 6.6% growth). We <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429718/Heinz-Tomato-Ketchup-is-off-the-table-as-shoppers-opt-for-more-exotic-condiments\" title=\"\">might be turning our backs on the likes of bog-standard ketchup</a>, but we're happy to shell out over £21m a year for the punchier stuff.</p><p>Not so long ago, a few dainty drops of Tabasco were pretty much all that was available to spice up a bloody mary or a plate of eggs (and didn't that dolly-sized bottle seem to last forever?). Now, if the top shelf of your fridge is anything like mine, there is a chaotic selection of sriracha, chipotle (both sauce and paste), harissa, sweet chilli, wasabi, horseradish … I dollop chilli sauce in/on pretty much everything: eggs, broth, potatoes, noodles, bolognese sauce – you name it, I think it tastes better with a dab of spicy heat.</p><p>\"The growth in sales of hot sauce in recent years has been staggering,\" says Karl Wirrmann, the founder of online chilli sauce company <a href=\"http://www.scorchio.co.uk\" title=\"\">Scorchio.co.uk</a>. \"I started the business as a hobby in 2006 because I was a fan of hot sauce and I couldn't find it easily in the UK. That's all completely changed now.\"</p><p>Heinz recently <a href=\"http://www.promomarketing.info/shopper/heinz-promotes-new-chilli-ketchup-with-pizza-hut-p/18776\" title=\"\">added a fiery chilli tomato ketchup to its range</a> in an effort to woo back British palates. Even <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/11/01/subway-sriracha-fast-food-trends/3329043/\" title=\"\">takeaway sandwich giant Subway is riding the wave of the sriracha craze</a>.</p><p>Wirrmann's company now specialises <a href=\"http://www.scorchio.co.uk/daves-gourmet-ultimate-insanity-sauce-p-399.html\" title=\"\">in \"insanely hot\" chilli sauce</a>, as consumer tolerance to \"mouth fire\" heightens. \"People can't get enough of the heat and the strength, and some just want their sauces hotter and hotter,\" he says. \"It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/sep/14/chilli-hot-food\" title=\"\">seems to have</a> an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jan/15/chilli-pepper-hot-for-you\" title=\"\">addictive quality</a>.\"</p><p>Wirrmann believes the increase in restaurants in which chilli is a key ingredient – Mexican, Vietnamese, Caribbean, southern US \"soul food\" – has awoken British taste buds to the joy of food that twins flavour with fire. There are also other benefits. A dash of sriracha, with its rich combination of chilli, vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt, can hide a multitude of culinary sins – Wirrmann carries a bottle with him when he's travelling to perk up plates of indifferent food. Nigella Lawson is also known to carry a bottle of Tabasco in her handbag for peppery punch when she's on the hoof, and <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/31/2203570.htm\" title=\"\">also – weirdly – keeps a bottle by the bed</a>.</p><p>Juliette Wall, the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.phocafe.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Vietnamese restaurant chain Pho</a>, attests to our ever-growing appetite for the hot stuff. In the past year, customers sweated through a quarter of a million teaspoons of sriracha. \"Many customers eat whole spoonfuls with every bite of pho,\" Wall says. \"They eat it like ketchup. Our spicy pho is now our biggest seller and we have extra chillies next to the till. We've also had to add chillies to our noac cham sauce – which never had chillies in it before – to cater to the demand for heat.\"</p><p>Sriracha devotees can take some comfort from the fact that, whatever the fate of the Huy Fong factory, they will never be short of tongue-igniting alternatives. <a href=\"http://readcereal.com/magazine/volume-2/gochujang/\" title=\"\">Korean gochujang</a> has been mooted as the new coolest chilli sauce in town, <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/community/cooking-fresh-wasabi\" title=\"\">with wasabi</a> hot on its tail. A friend swears by <a href=\"http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/p-8310-dollee-crispy-prawn-chilli.aspx\" title=\"\">Malaysian crispy prawn chilli</a> – it is wonderful with crispy cubes of Spam, apparently.</p><p>Do you douse everything you eat with chilli sauce, or is it a sure-fire way to obliterate the taste of good food?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421644311|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|33048e8b4dbe55352d9969cca022a0b94ac2b0e9 -->",

The South African's first big victory launched him on a full-time running career and he went on to take the title at <a href=\"http://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/page/show/311976-lt-100-mile-run\" title=\"\">the Leadville 100</a> a couple of years later.</p><p>\"The Gobi March was my first ultra and multi-day stage race so I would say it was one of the toughest I've done,\" says Sandes. \"Day one is easy as you start with fresh legs; days two and three are hardest as you wake up sore and mentally you know you are not even halfway; come day four my body starts to adapt; and the long stage on day five is all mental – waking up with sore legs and then running 80km takes quite a bit of psychological strength. It's about staying focused and getting through one stage at a time.\"</p><p>One of the main challenges of a self-supported multi-stage race is learning to run efficiently with a heavy rucksack so Sandes completed all his long training runs with a pack. He also built up to four consecutive long runs before tapering for the race.</p><p>\"Don't go into the race overtrained and make sure you get lots of sleep the week before,\" he warns. \"Keep eating during the race and stay hydrated, because if you get even slightly dehydrated it will really affect you on the remaining stages.\" Oh, and don't forget your earplugs.</p><p>Aside from the adventure of exploring a little-visited region of China and the challenge of a race over harsh and unpredictable terrain, many multi-day runners look forward to the luxury of being able to ditch the mobile and concentrate on nothing but racing and recovery for seven days.</p><p>Jo Eades, a solicitor based in Hong Kong who came second in the Gobi March last year, says: \"I love the complete ability to get away from everything and only be surrounded by positive things. I love the fact that each day all you are worrying about is your feet and food and enjoying complete immersion in the scenery. The course is stunning – and a good mix of running and hills.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421727380'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383316517688/Gobi-March-2013-winner-St-008.jpg' alt='Gobi March 2013 winner Stefano Gregoretti (left) nears the finish line' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gobi March 2013 winner Stefano Gregoretti (left) nears the finish line. Photograph: Scott Manthey/4 Deserts</figcaption></figure><p>Next June will see the 11th edition of the race – and its second year on a new course after organisers <a href=\"http://uk.racingtheplanet.com/store/\" title=\"\">Racing the Planet</a> decided the original location was becoming overrun by economic development. What were paths a few years ago had become 4x4 tracks, and what were tracks had become highways.</p><h2>Back-to-back runs and strength training are key</h2><p>Coleman – a veteran of more than 800 marathons and ultras including 4 Deserts' Atacama Crossing and 10 Marathon des Sables – has just clocked his fastest marathon time in 14 years on the back of <a href=\"http://tribesports.com/blog/28-days-of-28-miles-for-stoptober\" title=\"\">running 28 miles a day for 28 days</a> to publicise the government's Stoptober campaign, so knows a thing or two about endurance training.</p><p>He advises a schedule based on week-long blocks of medium effort, hard effort and harder effort, followed by a recovery week. For me, that's 50-60 miles (medium), 65-80 miles (hard), 80-100 miles (harder) and 20 miles (recovery) – starting at the lower end of those ranges and building up as the four-week cycle repeats.</p><p>Back-to-back runs – for example, running 20 miles on Saturday and another 20 on Sunday – are a key component. Some weeks I'll also squeeze in a fast 13 miles on the Friday so I enter the back-to-back weekend fatigued and get used to running on tired legs. My training peaks with four consecutive 20-25 milers.</p><p>There will be at least one long run a week with a pack slightly lighter (about 5kg) than the one I'll be carrying in the Gobi (about 7.5kg with food but not water). And Coleman suggests any time I can spend hiking in the mountains will pay off too because rough trails, hills and tiredness mean I will be power-walking some of the way.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.running-training-tips.com/weight-training-for-runners.html\" title=\"\">Strength training</a> will prepare my back and shoulder muscles for the burden of six days running with a heavy rucksack – seated rows to work the rhomboids, dumbbell shrugs for the traps and lat pull downs for the latissimus dorsi – plus the usual daily plank, sit-ups and squats session to maintain core strength.</p><p>\"Every session's got to count,\" says Coleman. \"Think 'what can I do every day to make my race better?' Multi-day races are about running within your comfort range – and the training is partly about extending that range. But strengthening the mind is important too and if you can run four consecutive 20-mile runs back-to-back you'll know you can do anything.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421694587|2013-11-05T17:52:53Z|e212d2b093b925899d892b7c3637fdc732f6fa90 -->",
