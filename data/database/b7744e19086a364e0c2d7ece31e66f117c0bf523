        "body":"<p>What are the ingredients for your perfect night out? A meal out with friends? Seeing your favourite band or DJ? How about a spot of theatre? Or, you could gorge yourself on all of the above in just one sitting.</p><p>Ignore the colder weather and the slightly darker evenings, as now is the perfect time to head out and enjoy the best the north has to offer thanks to the return of the Urban Night Feast to Newcastle and today's (Friday's) launch of an exciting new event at Belgrave Music Hall, Leeds.</p><p>What these evening fillers and the others gathered here have in common is a desire to offer people some rather different fodder for an evening out. There's access to great food without a formal atmosphere or the need to book, and music and dancing without the club attire. Ultimately, they are spaces where your money stretches just a little bit further thanks to the super-sizing of what's on offer.</p><p>These are occasions catering to groups who want to have their cake and burger and ribs and ice cream and pizza and eat it all washed down with great ale, cocktails and to the backdrop of not just one band or DJ but several and maybe a cinema showing, too.</p><p>Food and music combo nights that have been bubbling away across the north for some time; some are annual events while others have become firmly established and highly anticipated regular nights out. To cover them all would be a major feat, so here's a pick of some of the best, but please do share details of any we might have missed in the comments below.</p><p></p><h2>Urban Night Feast</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> The Boiler Shop, the Robert Stephenson Centre, Newcastle</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Bringing together street food, drinks and music with some of the regions foremost DJs, including Lil Kriss, Cool Aid and Lauren Archer.</p><p><strong>What to expect:</strong> The best of the north including bacon jam burgers from Fat Hippo and 'proper food' from the Broad Chare. Also making an appearance will be Real Nice Ice lollies, Pla's Asian Kitchen with their offering of authentic Thai street food, Rileys Fish Shack, Papa Ganoush with middle eastern food plus lots of exciting out of town visitors including the likes of Horn Ok Please, Deeneys, the Rib Man, Big Apple Hot Dogs, the Travelling Gin Company, speakeasy drinks specialists Purl, Mexican food specialists Luardos, all finished off with a heap of local music talent.</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> Entry to Urban Night Feast is free. This is an inclusive event so children are welcome in the early evening. UNF is has a young, fresh atmosphere and is a great night out for food lovers and also those who want to experience the speakeasy bar or on the hunt for music and more.</p><p><strong>A word from those in charge:</strong> \"Urban Night Feast is about celebrating British street food and introducing the concept of late night feasts, which are prominent in places like Asia and the Middle East. Foodies get a taste of culinary delights from experts in the county and from further across the country, served up in an amazing historical venue with brilliant cocktails, beers, wine and DJs. It's a holiday, a tasting menu and a club night all-in-one served up over three nights.\"</p><p><strong>Next helping:</strong> Urban Night Feast is on until October 5th, though you can also find the Steamer running in the same venue on a monthly basis.</p><p><strong>Get involved:</strong> Visit the <a href=\"http://www.urbannightfeast.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Urban Night Feast</a> website or follow Twitter handle @urbannightfeast</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419057741'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380883803807/Guerilla-Eats-001.jpg' alt='Guerilla Eats' width='220' height='243' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Guerilla Eats.</figcaption></figure><p></p><h2>Guerilla Eats</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Manchester/Salford/Stockport</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Guerrilla Eats was set up by the traders Dirty Dogs and Fire and Slat BBQ — as small, recently established street food sellers they found that many events/markets would charge over the odds, pricing out the smaller, independent vendors. After looking at events going on in the Manchester/Salford area they discovered plenty of nights dedicated to nights out and plenty dedicated to food but none dedicated to both at the same time. So, they decided to put passionate, affordable food at the centre of a night out.</p><p><strong>What to expect:</strong> A mix of street vendors selling everything from outrageously indulgent burgers, to authentic chaat and out of this world ice cream. Guerrilla Eats don't focus on one particular cuisine and like to give new street vendors a platform when they start out and keep their pitch fees low in order to do so, though they are very picky about who they have on board, vetting everyone who trades. Music, bands, entertainment and arts all have a part to play but are more of a focus at special events.</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> Guerrilla Eats goers tend to be food people, students and those looking for a cheap eat and nice atmosphere to warm up before hitting the bars or gigs. The events are described as inclusive and parents are encouraged to bring children along earlier in the evening.</p><p><strong>A word from those in charge:</strong> \"Once you get out of your early 20s, you suddenly find you are presented with the option to carry on drinking like a loon or go out for dinner. As people are getting more interested in food and other cultural experiences, they want nights that mix these together. Also, you can eat and drink pretty well for £15 at a street food night, going out to dinner or drinking in a club can be expensive.</p><p>\"I think there is a big emphasis on packing more in for less — people don't have much disposable income at the moment, so they want nights that offer them more than one thing.\"</p><p><strong>Next helping:</strong> Sat 19 Oct – Guerrilla Eats Street Food Party</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419057742'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380883882212/Belgrave-Music-Hall-Cante-001.jpg' alt='Belgrave Music Hall Canteen' width='160' height='160' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Belgrave Music Hall Canteen.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Get involved:</strong> Guerrilla Eats events are free to attend in order to encourage people to try as much of the food on offer as they can. The group are always looking for volunteers/helpers who get to sample all the food first! Get in touch via Twitter @guerrilla_eats or through the website <a href=\"http://www.guerrillaeats.co.uk\" title=\"\">www.guerrillaeats.co.uk</a></p><p></p><h2>Belgrave Music Hall and Canteen</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> Leeds, Belgrave Hall, the Northern Quarter</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Simon Stevens and Ash Kollakowski — the duo behind this new Leeds event — are part owners in successful northern festivals Beacons and Constellations and have witnessed firsthand the rise of good food combined with good music. Anyone who was lucky enough to attend Beacons this year will know how capable these guys are at dishing up something extra special. Their festival experience and a smattering of inspiration from London's Dalston feast, trips to sxsw in Austin and a diversion to street food mecca Portland all fed into this latest venture.</p><p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Value and something new with the best of the north put together by northern street food guru Andrew Creighton (Northern StrEats). Opening weekend features Laynes, Fish&amp;, Hell Fire, Diamond Dogs, Bundobust (by esteemed veggie venue Prashad and bier café The Sparrow) and Dough Boys pizza alongside a musical line-up that includes Yorkshire bands Black Moth and Wet Nuns.</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> The music promises to be just as much a main course as the food on offer here, with some fantastic acts lined up to play the venue the crowd is likely to be just as focused on getting up close with established and upcoming talent as discovering a new favourite food. There are also plans for cinema screenings and art displays and to make the most of the roof terrace you may want to take your coat.</p><p><strong>A word from those in charge:</strong> \"Festival culture is moving into everyday life and people want a lot from a night out. So many passionate people have been inspired by travelling and the relatively cheap start up costs of street food compared to a restaurant are allowing more people to get involved. It used to be John Peel saying you could knock over a telephone box and release a punk 7 inch — now it's borrow a gazebo, fridge and hot plate and get going!\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419057743'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380883738605/The-Boiler-Shop-Steamer-001.jpg' alt='The Boiler Shop Steamer' width='220' height='249' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Boiler Shop Steamer. Photograph: S Noble</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Next helping:</strong> The first event is taking place this weekend 4th-5th October.</p><p><strong>Get involved:</strong> Take a look at the Belgrave Hall Facebook page for details of future events or follow @Belgrave_Leeds</p><h2>The Boiler Shop Steamer</h2><p><strong>Where:</strong> The Robert Stephenson Centre, Newcastle</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Inspired by other street food events in Newcastle and beyond, the Steamer is run by street food specialist Riley's Fish Shack along with local producer Wylam Brewery in association with Silverlink Holdings. Once the home to those who built the world's first steam boilers, the venue provides the perfect backdrop for cinema screenings, performances by bands and DJs and performance artists. It has organically attracted customers looking for an evening that incorporates more than just food or entertainment and has established itself as a platform for those already working as food such as restaurants and supperclub specialists who want to make contact with a new audience.</p><p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Thanks to the food, music, pop up cinemas, exhibitions and boutique stalls the Steamer has an atmosphere that sits somewhere between an intimate gig in your living room and a trip to a market. Some come for the food from vendors like Lulu Chai and Electric East and the fantastic Ouseburn Coffee espressos and stay for the music and other performances. Last month during the Newcastle-Gateshead Eat! Festival there were also food demonstrations. There is a small charge for entry (usually £3) but things tend to kick off late afternoon or early evening and in Summer attendees basked in the sun even earlier, with Wylam beers in hand.</p><p><strong>Who:</strong> The Steamer attracts a really eclectic mix, which ranges from those with art and design interests to the pre-bar crowd, as well as those who want to avoid bars altogether. It's popular with some students, the region's food appreciators and those in search of a different drinks offering. Children are also welcome providing they are accompanied by an adult and attendees encompass the full age range from seven to 70.</p><p><strong>Next helping:</strong> After a brief break in October to make way for Urban Night Feast, the Steamer returns to its slot on the first Friday and Saturday of each month in November.</p><p><strong>Get involved:</strong> Take a look at the Boiler Shop Steamer website, or follow @steamerevent on Twitter.</p><p></p><p>• Follow Fay Nyberg on Twitter: @foodfablesuk</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419051594|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|c3af440f3ff3636bae662020dc80adaaf49b4dfa -->",
