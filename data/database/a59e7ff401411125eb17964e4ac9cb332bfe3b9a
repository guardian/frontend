US General Tommy Franks claimed in 2002: \"We don't do body counts.\"</p><p>The mass of leaked documents provides the first detailed tally by the US military of Iraqi fatalities. Troops on the ground filed secret field reports over six years of the occupation, purporting to tot up every casualty, military and civilian.</p><p>Iraq Body Count, a London-based group that monitors civilian casualties, told the Guardian: \"These logs contain a huge amount of entirely new information regarding casualties. Our analysis so far indicates that they will add 15,000 or more previously unrecorded deaths to the current IBC total. This data should never have been withheld from the public.\"</p><p>The logs record a total of 109,032 violent deaths between 2004 and 2009. It is claimed that 66,081 of these were civilians. A further 23,984 deaths are classed as \"enemy\" and 15,196 as members of the Iraqi security forces. The logs also include the deaths of 3,771 US and allied soldiers.</p><p>No fewer than 31,780 of the total deaths are attributed to the improvised landmines laid around Iraq by insurgents. There were 65,439 successful \"improvised explosive device\" (IED) blasts in the period, according to the logs, with another 44,620 IEDs found in time and disarmed.</p><p>The other major recorded cause of death is the civil war that broke out during the US military occupation. There are 34,814 victims of sectarian killings recorded as murders in the logs. The worst single month was December 2006 when 2,566 Iraqis were found dead.</p><p>The data cannot be relied upon as a complete record of Iraqi deaths. IBC, for example, had previously calculated that up to 91,469 civilians were killed from various causes during the period covered by the leaked database. While detailing the 15,000 previously unknown deaths, it also omits many otherwise well-attested civilian fatalities caused by US troops themselves. Nor does the Pentagon data cover any of the initial invasion fighting throughout 2003; IBC has identified 12,080 purely civilian deaths in that year.</p><p>The US figure is far lower than another widely quoted estimate of more than 650,000 \"excess deaths\" extrapolated on a different basis and published in a 2006 study in the Lancet.</p><p>A key example of the failure by US forces to record civilian casualties they have inflicted comes in the two major urban battles against insurgents fought in 2004 in Falluja. Numerous buildings were reduced to rubble by air strikes, tank shells and howitzers, and there were well-attested deaths of hundreds of civilians. IBC has identified between 1,226 and 1,362 such deaths during April and November. But the leaked US internal field reports record no civilian casualties at all.</p><p>One of the most publicised allegations was that a clinic in central Falluja was shelled on 9 November. Doctors claimed to international media that two strikes on the roof had killed scores of patients and staff. The IBC puts the total number of civilian deaths at 59.</p><p>The US military maintained these claims were \"unsubstantiated\", and the leaked database does not record any civilian deaths in the logs of these incidents.</p><p>But the logs do reveal corroborating evidence, furnished at the time by US troops involved in the fighting, that the clinic was a target for shelling.</p><p>A surveillance unit reported that it \"observed anti-Iraq forces unloading a vehicle at the clinic south of the Hydra mosque … Another vehicle arrived and an unidentified number of armed individuals exited the vehicle.\"</p><p>On that morning of 9 November the field reports describe heavy street fighting as the area is surrounded and the mosque captured. A detachment of the 1st Battalion 8th US Marines called in repeated heavy artillery strikes.</p><p>At 6.53am the marines' Bravo company, \"heavily engaged\" by machine-guns, rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire, called in eight successive high explosive rounds from 155mm howitzers that landed in the mosque area.</p><p>The soldiers then signalled: \"Battle damage assessment unknown.\" This is a frequent report about air and artillery strikes during the entire week of ferocious fighting.</p><p>At other times the troops record Iraqi deaths but invariably classify all the corpses as \"enemy\". When a helicopter gunship killed two Reuters journalists with a group of other men in a Baghdad street, in one notorious 2007 incident, all were listed as \"enemy killed in action\".</p><p>John Sloboda, IBC co-founder, has called for a British judicial inquiry into the civilian deaths, which he says have not been addressed by the Chilcot hearings. \"If we try to hide the reality of what happened we are going to sow seeds of hatred among those whose trust we are trying to gain and in whose name we said we were doing all of this.\"</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs reveal 15,000

His comments contrasted with a statement from the Ministry of Defence today, which warned that the posting of classified US military logs on the WikiLeaks website could endanger the lives of British forces.</p><p>Clegg said: \"We can bemoan how these leaks occurred, but I think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious. They are distressing to read about and they are very serious. I am assuming the US administration will want to provide its own answer. It's not for us to tell them how to do that.\"</p><p>Asked if there should be an inquiry into the role of British troops, he said: \"I think anything that suggests that basic rules of war, conflict and engagement have been broken or that torture has been in any way condoned are extremely serious and need to be looked at.</p><p>\"People will want to hear what the answer is to what are very, very serious allegations of a nature which I think everybody will find quite shocking.\"</p><p>A Channel 4 Dispatches programme on Monday night is expected to add further details based on the logs of alleged abuse directly by coalition forces. Only two cases of alleged involvement of British troops have so far been mentioned.</p><p>Within the huge leaked archive is contained a batch of secret field reports from the town of Samarra. They corroborate previous allegations that the US military turned over many prisoners to the Wolf Brigade, the feared 2nd battalion of the interior ministry's special commandos.</p><p>In Samarra, the series of log entries in 2004 and 2005 describe repeated raids by US infantry, who then handed their captives over to the Wolf Brigade for \"further questioning\". Typical entries read: \"All 5 detainees were turned over to Ministry of Interior for further questioning\" (from 29 November 2004) and \"The detainee was then turned over to the 2nd Ministry of Interior Commando Battalion for further questioning\" (30 November 2004).</p><p>The field reports chime with allegations made by New York Times writer Peter Maass, who was in Samarra at the time. He told Guardian Films : \"US soldiers, US advisers, were standing aside and doing nothing,\" while members of the Wolf Brigade beat and tortured prisoners. The interior ministry commandos took over the public library in Samarra, and turned it into a detention centre, he said.</p><p>An interview conducted by Maass in 2005 at the improvised prison, accompanied by the Wolf Brigade's US military adviser, Col James Steele, had been interrupted by the terrified screams of a prisoner outside, he said. Steele was reportedly previously employed as an adviser to help crush an insurgency in  El Salvador.</p><p>The Wolf Brigade was created and supported by the US in an attempt to re-employ elements of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, this time to terrorise insurgents. Members typically wore red berets, sunglasses and balaclavas, and drove out on raids in convoys of Toyota Landcruisers. They were accused by Iraqis of beating prisoners, torturing them with electric drills and sometimes executing suspects. The then interior minister in charge of them was alleged to have been a former member of the Shia Badr militia.</p><p>It is unclear which US unit filed the report of complaint that detainees were being specifically threatened with being turned over to the Wolf Brigade. The entry describes the capture of prisoners near the town of Falluja, west of Baghdad.</p><p>It is headed \"Alleged detainee abuse by interrogators\", and reads: \"On 14 December 2005, a raid was conducted whereby five individuals were detained for suspicion of emplacement of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] as a result of a pid [positive identification]. \"During the interrogation process the RO [ranking officer] threatened the subject detainee that he would never see his family again and would be sent to the 'Wolf Battalion' where he would be subject to all the pain and agony that the 'Wolf Battalion' is known to exact upon its detainees.\"</p><p>The war logs also disclose that Wolf Brigade members were themselves at risk of reprisals. In January 2007, US soldiers reported a gruesome discovery in a street near Baghdad: \"Only the severed head was found. A wire was run through the ear with the corpse's ID attached to the wire. 3rd bn [battalion] commander identified the remains as Ahdel Abu Hussain, he was an officer in the NP [national police] Wolf Brigade.\"</p><p>Lawyers said the reports may embroil  British as well as US forces in an alleged culture of abuse and extrajudicial killings. Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers, appearing alongside the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, at a press conference in London, said some of the deaths may have involved British forces and could now go through the UK courts.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: US turned over captives to Iraqi torture squads","trailText":"<p>Nick Clegg calls for answers to 'extremely serious' abuse reports, but

They weren't secret. They were tolerated, sanitised – justified, even. Take the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/24/iraq-war-logs-us-iraqi-torture\" title=\"Guardian: Iraq war logs: US turned over captives to Iraqi torture squads\">Wolf Brigade</a>, the 2nd battalion of the interior ministry's special commandos. Everybody knew about them. You would see them in their pick-up trucks wearing balaclavas. When there was a sectarian murder people would talk about the wolves, until they became a shorthand to describe a certain kind of cruel violence. The wolf commandos became killers in the uniform of the Iraqi police.</p><p>I recall speaking to UN human rights investigators, western police advisers, diplomats and army officers about what was going on. In 2005 an Iraqi government official confirmed a list of places where she believed torture and murder were taking place. A British police mentor described entering the office of a notorious figure at the interior ministry and found a man with a bag over his head standing in the corner of the office.</p><p>Some of us who covered Iraq wrote about what we found. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/03/iraq.iraq\" title=\"Guardian: UK aid funds Iraqi torture units\">In summer 2005</a>, I described the operation of the torture squads. Human rights organisations prepared their own reports. But nothing very much happened, except excuses.</p><p>When the bodies started turning up in western Baghdad in 2004, the official line was that it was former Ba'athists who were being killed. Like the looting that occurred in the aftermath of the fall of Iraq, it was \"understood.\" The victims probably deserved it, was the unspoken intimation. Officials, British and American, were really not that bothered.</p><p>Later, when it was men in police uniforms who were doing the killing, reported in the Iraqi papers day after day, the official line was \"anyone could buy a uniform\" or that these were difficult times and there would be \"bad apples\".</p><p>But they weren't bad apples. I spoke to people who had been taken to the interior ministry and heard the screams. One day a DVD was brought to me of a former interview subject who had been tortured to death after being taken by men in uniform. Like others, I wrote up what I knew. But nothing much ever happened.</p><p>It's true that when things sometimes became too embarrassing – too obvious – a local police chief implicated in killings might be removed or officials at the ministry re-organised. But the murder continued. There was a new excuse: the police had been infiltrated by Shia extremists. Which was true, up to a point. Except it wasn't really infiltration, more of an alliance in many places: a coincidence of sectarian interest.</p><p>Sometimes I would come across soldiers who would intervene. One day, at the Ministry of the Interior, a group of American soldiers arrived to free some men who were being abused in a facility called the \"guest house\" which was being guarded by other American soldiers. An argument between two US officers ensued. The beaten Iraqis were released.</p><p>Sometimes it was an awful game. In 2007, I was embedded with a US unit in Baghdad, tasked to go after some Shia militiamen suspected of attacking Sunnis. The rules then required an Iraqi police escort. The chief of police found excuses for over an hour to prevent the raid commencing. Everybody knew that the targets were being warned off by the police – or suspected it at least. But nothing much happened except some grumbles at the wasted time. And it is this that makes me angry now when I hear UN officials and politicians, after the event, calling for inquiries. Yes, there we things we didn't know: about the US order not to investigate allegations of murder and torture; the evidence of collaboration. And yes, an inquiry is an absolute necessity. But why now, not then? For who in Iraq did not know about the killing and torture? About the police death squads? About nothing ever really happening to halt it when we had a chance? Investigate, by all means – but it is too late.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: These crimes were not secret, they were tolerated","trailText":"<p><strong>Peter Beaumont: </strong>Why did we not investigate allegations of murder and torture in Iraq at the time, when it was well known what was going on?</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"Guardian Weekly","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kj4c","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/19/1282247777894/Iraqi-soldiers-Baghdad-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/19/1282247777894/Iraqi-soldiers-Baghdad-002.jpg","wordcount":"671","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"368026413","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3957886","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Peter Beaumont","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-26T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1470513","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-28T11:00:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/25/iraq-torture-no-secret","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/25/iraq-torture-no-secret","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/libertycentral","webTitle":"liberty central","references":[],"type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/libertycentral"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/law","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/law/law"},{"id":"world/war-logs","webTitle":"The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/war-logs"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq"},{"id":"profile/peterbeaumont","webTitle":"Peter Beaumont","rcsId":"GNL042165","r2ContributorId":"16261","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/9/1336590438734/Peter-Beaumont.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Peter Beaumont writes on foreign affairs for the Guardian and Observer.

US and UK officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities.</p><p>The numerous reports of detainee abuse, often supported by medical evidence, describe prisoners shackled, blindfolded and hung by wrists or ankles, and subjected to whipping, punching, kicking or electric shocks. Six reports end with a detainee's apparent death.</p><p>As recently as December the Americans were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/BCD499A0-F0A3-2B1D-B27A2F1D750FE720\" title=\"\">passed a video apparently showing Iraqi army officers executing a prisoner</a> in Tal Afar, northern Iraq. The log states: \"The footage shows approximately 12 Iraqi army soldiers. Ten IA soldiers were talking to one another while two soldiers held the detainee. The detainee had his hands bound … The footage shows the IA soldiers moving the detainee into the street, pushing him to the ground, punching him and shooting him.\"</p><p>The report named at least one perpetrator and was passed to coalition forces. But the logs reveal that the coalition has a formal policy of ignoring such allegations. They record \"no investigation is necessary\" and simply pass reports to the same Iraqi units implicated in the violence. By contrast all allegations involving coalition forces are subject to formal inquiries. Some cases of alleged abuse by UK and US troops are also detailed in the logs.</p><p>In two Iraqi cases postmortems revealed evidence of death by torture. On 27 August 2009 a US medical officer found <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/5D554D29-AA6A-1679-3B0EDB9A4357473F\" title=\"\">\"bruises and burns as well as visible injuries to the head, arm, torso, legs and neck\"</a> on the body of one man claimed by police to have killed himself. On 3 December 2008 another detainee, said by police to have died of \"bad kidneys\", was found to have \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/FC615C05-E517-5C89-78B2CF941B76EDE4\" title=\"\">evidence of some type of unknown surgical procedure on [his] abdomen</a>\".</p><p>A Pentagon spokesman told the New York Times this week that under its procedure, when reports of Iraqi abuse were received the US military \"notifies the responsible government of Iraq agency or ministry for investigation and follow-up\".</p><p>The logs also illustrate the readiness of US forces to unleash lethal force. In one chilling incident they detail how an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/E8DE9B9F-E468-B587-E4B332C09FF48BE2\" title=\"\">Apache helicopter gunship gunned down two men</a> in February 2007.</p><p>The suspected insurgents had been trying to surrender but a lawyer back at base told the pilots: \"You cannot surrender to an aircraft.\" The Apache, callsign Crazyhorse 18, was the same unit and helicopter based at Camp Taji outside Baghdad that later that year, in July, mistakenly killed two Reuters employees and wounded two children in the streets of Baghdad.</p><p>Iraq Body Count, the London-based group that monitors civilian casualties, says it has identified around 15,000 previously unknown civilian deaths from the data contained in the leaked war logs.</p><p>Although US generals have claimed their army does not carry out body counts and British ministers still say no official statistics exist, the war logs show these claims are untrue. The field reports purport to identify all civilian and insurgent casualties, as well as numbers of coalition forces wounded and killed in action. They give a total of more than 109,000 violent deaths from all causes between 2004 and the end of 2009.</p><p>This includes 66,081 civilians, 23,984 people classed as \"enemy\" and 15,196 members of the Iraqi security forces. Another 3,771 dead US and allied soldiers complete the body count.</p><p>No fewer than 31,780 of these deaths are attributed to improvised roadside bombs (IEDs) planted by insurgents. The other major recorded tally is of 34,814 victims of sectarian killings, recorded as murders in the logs.</p><p>However, the US figures appear to be unreliable in respect of civilian deaths caused by their own military activities. For example, in Falluja, the site of two major urban battles in 2004, no civilian deaths are recorded. Yet Iraq Body Count monitors identified more than 1,200 civilians who died during the fighting.</p><p>Phil Shiner, human rights specialist at Public Interest Lawyers, plans to use material from the logs in court to try to force the UK to hold a public inquiry into the unlawful killing of Iraqi civilians.</p><p>He also plans to sue the British government over its failure to stop the abuse and torture of detainees by Iraqi forces. The coalition's formal policy of not investigating such allegations is \"simply not permissible\", he says.</p><p>Shiner is already pursuing a series of legal actions for former detainees allegedly killed or tortured by British forces in Iraq.</p><p>WikiLeaks says it is posting online the entire set of 400,000 Iraq field reports – in defiance of the Pentagon.</p><p>The whistleblowing activists say they have deleted all names from the documents that might result in reprisals. They were accused by the US military of possibly having \"blood on their hands\" over the previous Afghan release by redacting too few names. But the military recently conceded that no harm had been identified.</p><p>Condemning this fresh leak, however, the Pentagon said: \"This security breach could very well get our troops and those they are fighting with killed. Our enemies will mine this information looking for insights into how we operate, cultivate sources and react in combat situations, even the capability of our equipment.\"</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture","trailText":"<p>Military files analysed by the Guardian show how US authorities have let crimes go unpunished and concealed civilian deaths</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2ktcx","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2010/10/22/1287772544239/Iraq-Rawa.-Operation-Stee-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2010/10/22/1287772544239/Iraq-Rawa.-Operation-Stee-002.jpg","wordcount":"996","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"367967656","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3939309","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Davies, Jonathan Steele and David Leigh","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1469989","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:26:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

The major political groupings have seized upon these allegations in their battle for power.</p><p>The incumbent prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, attempted to dismiss the leaks as \"media games and bubbles\". He suggested that the timing of their release, just as he appears to have made decisive progress in forming a new coalition government, is a conspiracy against him. Maliki chose instead to focus on what the leaks said about the deaths caused by the US security company Blackwater, arguing he would secure justice for Iraqi citizens killed by foreign contactors.</p><p>Ayad Allawi and his Iraqiya coalition, the main rival for power, seized upon the leaks as evidence of Maliki's dictatorial ambitions and his use of Iraqi special forces to cow opposition. Iraqiya spokesperson, Maysoon al-Damluji, used the revelations to push their policy agenda, this would wrest control of security from Maliki as part of any new coalition government.</p><p>\"Putting all the security powers in the hands of one person who is the general commander of the armed forces have led to these abuses and torture practices in Iraqi prisons\".</p><p>Three days after the documents were released, Iraq's national security council agreed to establish a cross-government committee to examine the evidence of the endemic use of torture and extrajudicial murder by all of the state's security services.</p><p>However, the political storm caused by the WikiLeaks documents failed to ignite public outrage. The Iraqi population has lived with violent instability, a civil war and routine abuse by militias, police and the army since the invasion of 2003.</p><p>The war logs certainly provide evidence of this to the wider world but Iraqis have lived with these conditions for the past seven years. All the major political groupings now vying for power have been culpable in state-sponsored human rights abuses. Allawi was PM during the interim government from 2004 to 2005, when torture and state-sanctioned murder regularly occurred. His putative partner in any new government, the Islamic supreme council of Iraq, ran the interior ministry during 2005, when its national police was responsible for the religious cleansing of Baghdad, driving Sunnis from the city in a campaign of murder and terror.</p><p>Likewise, the two main Kurdish parties, kingmakers of any new government, have been repeatedly criticised by Amnesty International for the prisons they run in northern Iraq. Iraqis did not need WikiLeaks to tell them about the hell they have lived in since the US-led invasion.</p><h2>Philippe Sands QC, professor of law at University College London, and author of Torture Team (Penguin)</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368158276'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/17/philippe_sands_140x140.jpg' alt='Philippe Sands' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> On its face the material looks deeply troubling but I've learnt that it's important not to begin by cherry-picking those documents that look most troubling: you have to go through each and every document, place it in its context, find other material that confirms or challenges a particular account. Then you can begin to form a solid view as to the significance of documents such as these. Things are not always what they seem. It takes time.</p><p>The content of the materials doesn't seem that surprising, against the background of the realities of war and what we already know about the steps taken by the Bush administration in the conduct of military hostilities. What is striking, however, is the rawness of the accounts, the authenticity of the entries; they cut through the sanitisation of media presentation and popular film depictions, and seem to tell a brutal set of stories.</p><p>What should we be looking for? The documents may be significant if they point to torture and abuse – and the turning of blind eyes – as a result of policy, rather than the acts of \"a few bad eggs.</p><p>It is known that the Bush administration consciously disapplied the Geneva conventions to certain detainees in Iraq, to decide that some individuals – alleged \"terrorists – had no rights at all under Geneva or international laws.</p><p>These documents might go a long way in confirming – or undermining – the existence of facts that would tend to show whether or not the torture and abuses described were the direct result of policy and legal decisions taken by the US defence secretary at the time,Donald Rumsfeld, and sanctioned by his general counsel, Jim Haynes.</p><p>And they show something else: President Obama's policy of moving on will fail. The damage is too great, and there is a pressing need for a proper factual accounting by the US of what happened and why.</p><p>Until that occurs, documents such as these and others that are yet to emerge – more photos and even videos of abuse at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere – will shock and will undermine US and British authority around the world.</p><h2>Anthony Cordesman, a former director of intelligence assessment for the US defence secretary who is now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368158277'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/8/31/1251735714136/Anthony-Cordesman.jpg' alt='Anthony Cordesman' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> Dumping this much information on an entire war without context, which is generally being covered by people who don't have any real history of what happened during the course of the conflict and how things changed, has not produced much more than irritation (at the Pentagon).</p><p>A lot of the issues raised are issues the Pentagon's been trying to deal with throughout the course of the war. You've restructured your training, your field manuals on counter-insurgency and on stability operations to deal with these issues. You've brought in new approaches to civil/military operations. You've changed the way in which you've trained Iraqi forces. You've restructured large elements of the Iraqi national police to the point where they don't have the same name.</p><p>Almost all of their commanders have changed and they don't have the same uniforms. You've dealt with a restructuring of the entire US system, not simply for handling detentions. So getting this kind of data dump has virtually no impact (on military policy) whatsoever.</p><p>(Ordinary Americans) care about the human rights aspects. They care about how we're going to leave an Iraq that is more developed and has reasonably stable military forces. They care about it when US troops commit any kind of war crimes.</p><p>All of these are things people care about a lot. They care about how WikiLeaks handled it. I think US papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post, the main papers and media, handled it reasonably well although the very nature of trying to get an article above the fold means they don't have much context.</p><p>But did it change American perceptions? In general i think the answer would be this was about two to three days work of headlines in the context of something that has been a constant media concern since 2003.</p><p>Did it alter American perceptions and interests? Only at the far margins where people are polarised anyway. If they are concerned with opposing the war they'll feel validated and if they feel that any kind of leak of classified information is truly horrifying then they'll feel validated too.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kengude\" title=\"\">Ken Gude</a>, managing director of national security and international policy at the Centre for American Progress Action Fund, in Washington</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368158278'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/12/ken_gude_140x140.jpg' alt='Ken Gude' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> Perhaps the most surprising thing about the release of nearly 400,000 previously secret documents about the Iraq war by WikiLeaks is the muted response in Washington. Sure, it provided a great deal more detail about how the war was fought, but a political bombshell like the Pentagon Papers this was not. Yes, we got the ritual Pentagon denunciation of the leaks, and some elected officials tried to demonstrate their national security bona fides by proposing new legislation to crack down on whistleblowing.</p><p>Yet, it has had virtually no impact on the midterm election campaign or in the broader public probably because Americans as a whole have simply moved beyond Iraq.</p><p>The publication of these documents does clearly illustrate, however, one of the driving contradictions about American government – and a puzzling paradox of the Obama administration. A country that cherishes both freedom of speech and freedom of the press and has decades-old legislation designed to improve the public's access to information also has a vast national security state that shrouds much government action in a veil of secrecy.</p><p>And the Obama administration, which came into office promising to be the \"most transparent administration ever\", has also been the most aggressive in prosecuting alleged leakers and has extended many Bush-era claims of secrecy.</p><p>The system to classify government information as secret is completely out of control. The incentives are entirely skewed towards overclassification, as officials appear to risk little when information is withheld but greatly fear the revelation of even minor details.</p><p>The 9/11 Commission was highly critical of a culture that \"nurtures overclassification\", which not only restricts the public's access to information but actually impairs the government's ability to share important information internally. The six years since that report's release have only witnessed an explosion in classification – to the point where many experts now say that \"nine out of 10 secret documents should not be classified\"</p><p>This engine of unnecessary secrecy was what Barack Obama pledged to break down when he declared his desire for openness in his administration. And to be fair, he has made improvements to the public's access to the routine operations of government that were previously beyond their view.</p><p>But it is the enthusiasm to protect government secrecy and shield it from scrutiny in court that has justifiably shocked many observers. The department of justice is on pace to easily surpass any previous administration in criminal cases against alleged leakers, and it has heavily relied on claims of secrecy to quash judicial review of many controversial practices of both the Bush and Obama administrations in the fight against al-Qaida.</p><p>Excessive secrecy undermines government performance and erodes public trust in government action. Clearly, there needs to be some government decision-making and action that is withheld from public view. But as the tame response to WikiLeaks's release of nearly 400,000 previously secret documents demonstrates, far too much information is hidden behind the veil of government secrecy.</p><p>The Obama administration appears to have been taken in by the national security state. It needs to snap out of its grasp and get back to its original intent to restore transparency and trust to the functioning of government.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: experts' views","trailText":"<p>Our panel dissects what the WikiLeaks revelations mean for the Iraq war, the US and international attitudes to terrorism</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kyn5","wordcount":"1806","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"368151286","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3972218","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Toby Dodge, Philippe Sands, Anthony Cordesman and Ken Gude","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-29T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1472477","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-31T21:01:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/28/iraq-war-logs-experts-views","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/28/iraq-war-logs-experts-views","tags":[{"id":"world/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration"},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk"},{"id":"profile/anthony-cordesman","webTitle":"Anthony Cordesman","r2ContributorId":"33937","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/8/31/1251735714136/Anthony-Cordesman.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Anthony Cordesman holds the Burke chair in strategy at the <a href=\"http://csis.org/expert/anthony-h-cordesman\">Centre for Strategic and International Studies</a> in Washington DC</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-cordesman","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/anthony-cordesman"},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq"},{"id":"profile/philippesands","webTitle":"Philippe Sands","rcsId":"GNL001801","r2ContributorId":"22474","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/17/1358416740482/Philippe_Sands.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Philippe Sands QC is a barrister in the Matrix Chambers and a professor of international law at University College London.

protests were made to Iraqi interior minister after death of Abbas Alawi while in custody of Basra police","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2013-07-11T15:51:27Z","body":"<p>An Iraqi criminal prisoner was tortured and beaten to death within three days of being turned over to police in Basra by British troops.</p><p>This latest detailed evidence of previously covered-up Iraq atrocities has emerged following the leak of a vast number of Iraq war logs compiled by the US army and containing hour-by-hour military field reports.</p><p>The 391,832 previously secret field reports, passed to the Guardian and other newspapers by the online whistleblowing group WikiLeaks, has already shown that US authorities <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks\" title=\"\">failed to investigate</a> hundreds of reports of abuse, rape and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers.</p><p>According to the new evidence, British authorities were well aware of the atrocities that were occurring in Basra and were unhappy about them.</p><p>An autopsy was conducted on the prisoner, the police officer said to have killed him was named in a UK investigation, and high-level diplomatic protests were made to the Iraqi interior minister, without apparent result.</p><p>Documents obtained by the Guardian and by a Danish newspaper detail the arrest of Abbas Alawi by a joint British and Danish patrol on 10 April 2005.</p><p>In Operation Grey Wolf, Alawi – code-named Bravo One – was picked up along with three other men in a dawn raid by British infantry of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. The logs record that the prisoners were handed over to the Basra police, controlled by Iraq's ministry of the interior.</p><p>A press officer boasted on the Danish military website at the time that Alawi was a much-feared gangster and fuel smuggler who had terrorised his neighbourhood.</p><p>A Danish lawyer, Jes Rynkeby Knudsen, currently serving as a military judge advocate, confirmed today that Alawi was killed by the police. He told the Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information: \"I saw pictures of his body afterwards.\"</p><p>Alawi was kept in a secret and illegal jail for three days, from 10-13 April. When his blood-covered corpse was collected by relatives, the Basra governor ordered an autopsy which \"substantiated charges that Allawi was beaten to death\".</p><p>The death appears to have been a last straw for the exasperated western occupiers. On 1 June the Danish ambassador, Torben Getterman, accompanied by a British diplomat, Tim Torlot, and the US charge d'affaires, David Satterfield, confronted the Iraqi interior minister in Baghdad.</p><p>According to documents from diplomatic sources, they told the minister, Baqr Jabr, who was also responsible for the notorious Wolf Brigade torture squads, that the situation caused \"grave concern\". The diplomatic trio handed over an intelligence report of an investigation carried out by the British 12th Mechanised Brigade HQ.</p><p>It implicated three members of the investigations support unit (ISU), including a named lieutenant said to have killed Alawi, in \"assassinations, kidnappings, intimidation, threats against the judiciary and illegal attacks against the citizens\".</p><p>Torlot told the minister: \"The problem … is far more widespread than indicated in a single report. Grave concerns regarding the Basra situation extend to the ministry of the interior as a whole … The crimes of the corrupt Iraqi police are well known on the streets of Basra.\"</p><p>A few days earlier, the Basra chief of police, General Hassan al-Sade, who was advised by a British deputy chief constable, Colin Smith, admitted to the Guardian that the Basra police were effectively out of control. He said: \"I trust 25% of my force, no more.\"</p><p>The Iraq war logs have provided a wealth of evidence about the reported abuse of detainees by Iraqi forces, with at least six people reported to have died. US army reports, some supported by medical evidence, describe prisoners experiencing whipping, kicks, punches or electric shocks. As recently as December US forces were handed a video seemingly showing Iraqi army officers executing a prisoner.</p><p>Other revelations from the files include an incident in 2007 in which a US helicopter gunship <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-apache-insurgents-surrender\" title=\"\">killed two Iraqi men attempting to surrender</a> and a previously unknown US military tally of civilian and insurgent casualties during the US occupation. According to Iraq Body Count, which monitors civilian casualties in the country, the leaked files detail around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/true-civilian-body-count-iraq\" title=\"\">15,000 extra civilian deaths</a>.</p><p>A US intelligence analyst formerly based in Baghdad, Bradley Manning, faces a court martial charged with leaking similar material to WikiLeaks, which has also released similar logs concerning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-war-logs\" title=\"\">operations in Afghanistan</a>.</p><p>The UN's chief investigator on torture has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/23/united-nations-call-obama-investigation-abuses-iraq\" title=\"\">called on Barack Obama</a> to order a full investigation into US forces' involvement in human rights abuses in Iraq.

US General Tommy Franks claimed in 2002: \"We don't do body counts.\"</p><p>The mass of leaked documents provides the first detailed tally by the US military of Iraqi fatalities. Troops on the ground filed secret field reports over six years of the occupation, purporting to tot up every casualty, military and civilian.</p><p>Iraq Body Count, a London-based group that monitors civilian casualties, told the Guardian: \"These logs contain a huge amount of entirely new information regarding casualties. Our analysis so far indicates that they will add 15,000 or more previously unrecorded deaths to the current IBC total. This data should never have been withheld from the public.\"</p><p>The logs record a total of 109,032 violent deaths between 2004 and 2009. It is claimed that 66,081 of these were civilians. A further 23,984 deaths are classed as \"enemy\" and 15,196 as members of the Iraqi security forces. The logs also include the deaths of 3,771 US and allied soldiers.</p><p>No fewer than 31,780 of the total deaths are attributed to the improvised landmines laid around Iraq by insurgents. There were 65,439 successful \"improvised explosive device\" (IED) blasts in the period, according to the logs, with another 44,620 IEDs found in time and disarmed.</p><p>The other major recorded cause of death is the civil war that broke out during the US military occupation. There are 34,814 victims of sectarian killings recorded as murders in the logs. The worst single month was December 2006 when 2,566 Iraqis were found dead.</p><p>The data cannot be relied upon as a complete record of Iraqi deaths. IBC, for example, had previously calculated that up to 91,469 civilians were killed from various causes during the period covered by the leaked database. While detailing the 15,000 previously unknown deaths, it also omits many otherwise well-attested civilian fatalities caused by US troops themselves. Nor does the Pentagon data cover any of the initial invasion fighting throughout 2003; IBC has identified 12,080 purely civilian deaths in that year.</p><p>The US figure is far lower than another widely quoted estimate of more than 650,000 \"excess deaths\" extrapolated on a different basis and published in a 2006 study in the Lancet.</p><p>A key example of the failure by US forces to record civilian casualties they have inflicted comes in the two major urban battles against insurgents fought in 2004 in Falluja. Numerous buildings were reduced to rubble by air strikes, tank shells and howitzers, and there were well-attested deaths of hundreds of civilians. IBC has identified between 1,226 and 1,362 such deaths during April and November. But the leaked US internal field reports record no civilian casualties at all.</p><p>One of the most publicised allegations was that a clinic in central Falluja was shelled on 9 November. Doctors claimed to international media that two strikes on the roof had killed scores of patients and staff. The IBC puts the total number of civilian deaths at 59.</p><p>The US military maintained these claims were \"unsubstantiated\", and the leaked database does not record any civilian deaths in the logs of these incidents.</p><p>But the logs do reveal corroborating evidence, furnished at the time by US troops involved in the fighting, that the clinic was a target for shelling.</p><p>A surveillance unit reported that it \"observed anti-Iraq forces unloading a vehicle at the clinic south of the Hydra mosque … Another vehicle arrived and an unidentified number of armed individuals exited the vehicle.\"</p><p>On that morning of 9 November the field reports describe heavy street fighting as the area is surrounded and the mosque captured. A detachment of the 1st Battalion 8th US Marines called in repeated heavy artillery strikes.</p><p>At 6.53am the marines' Bravo company, \"heavily engaged\" by machine-guns, rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire, called in eight successive high explosive rounds from 155mm howitzers that landed in the mosque area.</p><p>The soldiers then signalled: \"Battle damage assessment unknown.\" This is a frequent report about air and artillery strikes during the entire week of ferocious fighting.</p><p>At other times the troops record Iraqi deaths but invariably classify all the corpses as \"enemy\". When a helicopter gunship killed two Reuters journalists with a group of other men in a Baghdad street, in one notorious 2007 incident, all were listed as \"enemy killed in action\".</p><p>John Sloboda, IBC co-founder, has called for a British judicial inquiry into the civilian deaths, which he says have not been addressed by the Chilcot hearings. \"If we try to hide the reality of what happened we are going to sow seeds of hatred among those whose trust we are trying to gain and in whose name we said we were doing all of this.\"</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs reveal 15,000

Precisely how many were killed will never be known partly because the US and UK did not consider it necessary to keep any public record. However, we now know from the important work of <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\" title=\"Iraq Body Count\">Iraq Body Count </a> that the war logs disclosed increase the previously known number of deaths by a staggering 15,000.</p><p></p><p>Some of those deaths will be in circumstances where the UK had a clear legal responsibility. My firm, Public Interest Lawyers, is acting for many Iraqi civilians killed or tortured by UK forces. Some died from indiscriminate attacks on civilians or from the unjustified use of lethal force. Others have been killed in custody – the most notable being <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/10/iraq.military1\" title=\"Guardian: Background: the killing of Baha Mousa\">Baha Mousa </a>who died after sustaining 93 separate injuries.</p><p></p><p>The UK's legal responsibility is clear where Iraqis died under the effective control of its forces: under arrest, in vehicles, helicopters, or detention facilities. A key test case before the European court of human rights (<a href=\"http://www.barhumanrights.org.uk/docs/reports/2009/Al-Skeini_Intervention.pdf\" title=\"Bar Human Rights (Pdf)\">the Al-Skeini case</a>) is expected to confirm that these deaths will fall within the jurisdiction of the European convention on human rights.</p><p></p><p>Others deaths will not be covered by the European convention, such as a case we are pursuing where a rifleman from a tank stopped in broad daylight and shot and killed an eight-year-old girl playing in the street. However, we argue English common law similarly provides that a public inquiry into the legality of such deaths must be held. If unjustified or unlawful force has been used, accountability including prosecutions must follow. PIL is bringing forward a new case seeking accountability for all these deaths.</p><p></p><p>There is a huge body of evidence about killings, ill-treatment and torture of Iraqis while in custody with UK forces. We act for hundreds of Iraqis who complain of being subjected to deeply disturbing coercive interrogation techniques at the hands of a secret squad of UK interrogators. Insofar as the logs add to this body of evidence, it will help us to gain a single public inquiry into the UK's detention policy.</p><p></p><p>But further, a huge number of logs detail horrendous torture and abuse of Iraqis by the Iraqi national guard or police. The US and UK appear to have adopted an order that required them to take no action. This is completely contrary to international law.  There is an absolute prohibition on torture: it may never be used. All states owe a duty to each other to co-operate to stamp it out so that torturers know that they will be found out and prosecuted for their \"war crimes\". US and UK forces cannot turn a blind eye on the basis it wasn't their forces doing the torturing. That they did not take action makes them complicit. We at PIL will be seeking accountability for the UK's failure to act.</p><p></p><p>We also act for families in Falluja, where there has been an alarming increase in the rate of birth defects since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/14/iraq.iraq3\" title=\"Guardian:  Civilian cost of battle for Falluja emerges \">the attacks on the city in November 2004</a>. Such is the concern from the medical profession that parents are being warned not to have children because of the risks. It is suggested by many professionals that the health problems plaguing the population have been caused by the weapons systems used by coalition forces during the attacks. The UK provided material assistance to the US and bears a heavy responsibility to answer and address this emerging public health crisis. A case on behalf of those parents will be lodged at the high court in London shortly.</p><p></p><p>As evidence of atrocities perpetrated in Iraq by UK forces continues to grow, we must act to ensure

He is currently \"in hiding\" in London, according to his friends. He is planning to surface for a news conference tomorrow.</p><p>Manning, a junior intelligence analyst formerly based in Baghdad, was arrested in the spring. He was shipped to solitary confinement in a military prison in Kuwait and then to the marine base at Quantico, Virginia. He faces a court martial in the new year. So far his charge sheet includes the claim that he leaked a notorious cockpit video of an Apache helicopter gunship killing Reuters employees and wounding children in the streets of Baghdad. He is also charged with leaking another explosive archive of US diplomatic cables. That material has not yet been published.</p><p>After the Apache helicopter video was handed to WikiLeaks, Assange and a team of supporters in Iceland edited it into a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\" title=\"\">clip they posted on the web</a>, provocatively captioned Collateral Murder.</p><p>The subsequent posting this summer by WikiLeaks of another 75,000 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-war-logs\" title=\"\">Afghan war logs</a> infuriated the Pentagon. This anger is unlikely to be reduced with the latest haemorrhage of Iraq material. Manning faces a theoretical total of 52 years' imprisonment if he is convicted.</p><p>Assange's refusal to heed Pentagon demands that he and his fellow activists stop publishing the leaked documents has led him into choppy waters. The payments firm <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/14/wikileaks-says-funding-is-blocked\" title=\"\">Moneybookers has closed down its WikiLeaks donations account</a>, citing WikiLeaks's appearance on a \"US watchlist\". Assange says his airline baggage, including the encrypted computers he carries everywhere, disappeared en route from Stockholm to Berlin. Unfounded smears that he is, for example, financed by the Chinese government have started to float around the blogosphere.</p><p>But claims by US military chiefs that he might have \"blood on his hands\" failed to gain traction: the Pentagon now concedes that no one has so far apparently suffered reprisals from the Afghan leaks, and the WikiLeaks team has gone to elaborate lengths to redact the new Iraq files in order to protect individuals.</p><p>But Assange has had two setbacks. His hopes of being able to operate his whistleblowing site from media-friendly Sweden have been checked, with the refusal of a residence permit last week. He found himself in further trouble in Sweden after two  women with whom he had sexual encounters on successive nights in Stockholm sought to press charges of rape because he did not use a condom. That criminal investigation has stalled because Assange failed to return from London for a formal interview.</p><p>Assange turned over his earlier batch of Afghan files for analysis to three major news organisations: the Guardian, the New York Times and the German magazine Der Spiegel. On this occasion he released the data to other outlets including Channel 4's Dispatches, Le Monde in Paris, al-Jazeera in Doha and Channel 4 News.</p><p>The move testifies to Assange's determination to cause a splash. But it also represents a further challenge to the US administration: how to close down WikiLeaks without turning its charismatic spokesman into a global free speech martyr?</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: WikiLeaks v Washington","trailText":"The latest leak of US military material will raise US pressure on Julian Assange and dissident soldier Bradley Manning","newspaperPageNumber":"5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kt4f","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287752639070/Wikileaks-founder-Julian--002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287752639070/Wikileaks-founder-Julian--002.jpg","wordcount":"538","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367958711","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3939572","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Leigh","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1469787","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:29:09Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-wikileaks-washington","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-wikileaks-washington","tags":[{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/war-logs","webTitle":"The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/war-logs"},{"id":"profile/davidleigh","webTitle":"David Leigh","rcsId":"GNL041963","r2ContributorId":"15562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/david_leigh_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Leigh is the Guardian's investigations executive editor, whose work was behind the jailing of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/aitken\">Jonathan Aitken</a> and the exposure of secret payments by arms company BAE</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidleigh","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidleigh"},{"id":"world/iraq-war-logs","webTitle":"Iraq: The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq-war-logs"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-367958997","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287752642581/Wikileaks-founder-Julian--006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","altText":"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and American dissident soldier Bradley Manning","height":"276","credit":"Guardian","caption":"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and American dissident soldier Bradley Manning.

He demanded a public inquiry into allegations that British troops were responsible for civilian deaths during the conflict.</p><p>The Guardian has analysed the 400,000 documents, the biggest leak in US military history, and found 15,000 previously unreported civilian deaths. The logs show how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and generally unpunished.</p><p>Nowak said that if the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq-war-logs\" title=\"\">files released through WikiLeaks</a> pointed to clear violations of the UN Convention Against Torture <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/23/obama-investigate-war-logs-torture\" title=\"\">the Obama administration had an obligation to investigate them</a>.</p><p>The logs paint a disturbing picture of the relationship between US and Iraqi forces. Nowak said that UN human rights agreements obliged states to criminalise every form of torture, whether directly or indirectly, and to investigate any allegations of abuse.</p><p>Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Nowak, who has spent years investigating allegations of US participation in extraordinary rendition and the abuse of detainees held by coalition forces, said the Obama administration had a legal and moral obligation to fully investigate credible claims of US forces' complicity in torture.</p><p>A failure to investigate, Nowak suggested, would be a failure of the Obama government to recognise its obligations under international law. He said the principle of \"non-refoulement\" prohibited states from transferring detainees to other countries that could pose a risk to their personal safety.</p><p>The documents, which cover the period in Iraq from 2004 onwards, have prompted claims that this principle has not been observed. The files contain evidence that US forces were ordered to turn a blind eye to abuses committed by the Iraqi authorities.</p><p>Numerous reports of detainee abuse, often supported by medical evidence, describe prisoners shackled, blindfolded and hung by wrists or ankles and subjected to whipping, punching, kicking or electric shocks. Six reports end with a detainee's apparent death.</p><p>Nowak said the US had an obligation \"whenever they expel, extradite or hand over any detainees to the authorities of another state to assess whether or not these individuals are under specific risk of torture. If this assessment is not done, or authorities hand over detainees knowing there is a serious risk of them being subjected to torture, they violate article 3 of the UN convention that precludes torture.\"</p><p>Nowak said it would be up to the Obama administration to launch an \"independent and objective\" investigation with a view not only to \"bring the perpetrators to justice but also to provide the victims with adequate remedy and reparation\".</p><p>He noted that neither the US nor Iraq had ratified the international criminal convention that would see officials from either country brought before the international courts for war crimes. It would be up to the US courts to determine whether US officials or soldiers had breached human rights laws. \"If it is established that a particular individual is responsible for torture directly or by complicity, this person should be brought to justice in the domestic courts,\" Nowak said.</p><p>As recently as December, the Americans were passed a video apparently showing Iraqi army officers executing a prisoner in Tal Afar, northern Iraq. The log states: \"The footage shows approximately 12 Iraqi army soldiers. Ten IA soldiers were talking to one another while two soldiers held the detainee. The detainee had his hands bound … The footage shows the IA soldiers moving the detainee into the street, pushing him to the ground, punching him and shooting him.\"</p><p>The report named at least one perpetrator and was passed to coalition forces. But the logs reveal that the coalition has a formal policy of ignoring such allegations. They record \"no investigation is necessary\" and simply pass reports to the same Iraqi units implicated in the violence. By contrast all allegations involving coalition forces are subject to formal inquiries. Some cases of alleged abuse by UK and US troops are detailed in the logs.</p><p>In two Iraqi cases postmortems revealed evidence of death by torture. On 27 August 2009 a US medical officer found \"bruises and burns as well as visible injuries to the head, arm, torso, legs and neck\" on the body of one man claimed by police to have killed himself. On 3 December 2008 another detainee, said by police to have died of \"bad kidneys\", was found to have \"evidence of some type of unknown surgical procedure on [his] abdomen\".</p><p>A Pentagon spokesman told the New York Times this week that under its procedure, when reports of Iraqi abuse were received the US military \"notifies the responsible government of Iraq agency or ministry for investigation and follow-up\".</p><p>In response to the revelations, the Iraqi government has vowed to probe the allegations made against its soldiers and police. \"The government will show no leniency when it comes to the rights of its citizens,\" said a statement issued by prime minister Nouri al-Maliki's office.</p><p>Shiner told a press conference organised by WikiLeaks in London today that he plans to use material from the logs in court to try to force the UK to hold a public inquiry into the unlawful killing of Iraqi civilians.</p><p>Shiner warned that it would be wrong to assume the US military files \"had nothing to do with the UK\". He said: \"Some have been killed by indiscriminate attacks on civilians or the unjustified use of lethal force. Others have been killed in custody by UK forces and no one knows how many Iraqis lost their lives while held in British detention facilities.</p><p>\"If unjustified or unlawful force has been used, prosecutions for those responsible must follow, so we are bringing forward a new case seeking accountability for all unlawful deaths, and we argue that there must be a judicial inquiry to fully investigate UK responsibility for civilian deaths in Iraq.\"</p><p>He cited one case in which he claimed a British rifleman had shot dead an eight-year-old girl who was playing in the street in Basra. \"For some reason the tank stopped at the end of the street, she's there in her yellow dress, a rifleman pops up and blows her away,\" he said.</p><p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, which has set up the Iraq Historic Allegations Team to investigate allegations of abuse, said: \"It would be inappropriate to speculate on the specific detail of these documents without further investigation while the Iraq Inquiry is ongoing. There is no place for mistreatment of detainees and we investigate any allegation made against our troops.\"</p><p>The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, told the press conference that the disclosure of the secret files was about getting to the truth of the Iraq conflict.</p><p>\"We hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war, during the war, and which has continued since the war officially concluded. While I am not sure we have achieved the maximum possible [political impact], I think we are getting pretty close.\"</p><p>Assange highlighted how the reports documented 109,000 deaths – including 66,000 civilians, of which 15,000 were previously undocumented. \"That tremendous scale should not make us blind to the small human scale in this material. It is the deaths of one and two people per event that killed the overwhelming number of people in Iraq.\"</p><p>The electronic archive is believed to emanate from the same dissident US army intelligence analyst who earlier this year is alleged to have leaked a smaller tranche of 90,000 logs chronicling bloody encounters and civilian killings in the Afghan war.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: UN calls on Obama to investigate human rights abuses","trailText":"<p>• Demand follows massive leak of military documents<br />• UK lawyer warns crimes may have involved British forces</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kttp","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287765247268/A-hooded-Iraqi-detainee-a-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287765247268/A-hooded-Iraqi-detainee-a-002.jpg","wordcount":"1304","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"367983267","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3954783","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Batty and Jamie Doward","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1470175","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-26T12:41:00Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/23/united-nations-call-obama-investigation-abuses-iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/23/united-nations-call-obama-investigation-abuses-iraq","tags":[{"id":"profile/davidbatty","webTitle":"David Batty","rcsId":"GNL004817","r2ContributorId":"15538","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/01/david_batty_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Batty is a news editor and reporter.

The files are believed to have come from the same dissident US army intelligence analyst who earlier this year is alleged to have leaked <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-war-logs\">90,000 logs chronicling civilian killings and human rights abuses in the Afghan war</a>.</p><p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq-war-logs\">Guardian's special report on the Iraq war logs here</a>.</p><p>The main revelations are:</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-detainee-abuse-torture-saddam?intcmp=239\">US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers</a> whose conduct appears to go unpunished.</p><p>• A US helicopter gunship involved in a notorious Baghdad incident had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-apache-insurgents-surrender?intcmp=239\">previously killed Iraqi insurgents after they tried to surrender</a>.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/true-civilian-body-count-iraq?intcmp=239\">More than 15,000 civilians died in previously unknown incidents.</a> US and UK officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities.</p><p>The Pentagon has condemned the new leaks, once again calling on WikiLeaks to delete the files. Spokesman Marine Corps Colonel Dave Lapan said: \"We deplore WikiLeaks for inducing individuals to break the law, leak classified documents and then cavalierly share that secret information with the world, including our enemies.</p><p>\"We know terrorist organisations have been mining the leaked Afghan documents for information to use against us, and this Iraq leak is more than four times as large.</p><p>\"The only responsible course of action for WikiLeaks at this point is to return the stolen material and expunge it from their websites as soon as possible.\" </p><p>US secretary of state Hilary Clinton' has also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11611439\">condemned the leak in a TV address</a>.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/\">United Nations special rapporteur on torture</a>, Manfred Nowak, said there was now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/23/obama-investigate-war-logs-torture\">a duty on the US to investigate whether its officials were involved in or complicit in torture</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9120000/9120593.stm\">Speaking on the BBC's Today programme</a>, Novak, who has spent years investigating allegations of US participation in extraordinary rendition and the abuse of detainees held by coalition forces, said the Obama administation came to power promising change. </p><p>\"President Obama came to power with a moral agenda, saying \"we don't want to be seen to be a nation responsible for major human rights violations\",\" Novak said. A failure to investigate credible claims of US forces' complicity in torture, Novak suggested, would be a failure of the Obama government to recognise the US's obligations under international law.</p><p>WikiLeaks is holding a press conference about the Iraq war logs this morning in conjuntion with the Iraq Body Count group, which is trying to compile a full list of civilian deaths since the 2003 invasion.

It also details the previously unreported civilian deaths and the abuse of detainees, but it gives greater prominence than the Guardian to Iran's role in the ongoing conflict, particularly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23iran.html?_r=1\">how the Islamic republic has aided Iraqi Shia militias</a>.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>10.18am:</strong> Der Spiegel's special report on the Iraq war logs can be found <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/topic/iraq_war_logs/\">here</a>. </p><p>The Iraq war logs have been passed on to a wider range of media organisations than the Afghan war logs.

Among its findings are more than 300 reports alleging abuse by US forces on Iraqi prisoners after April 2004; evidence of more than 1,300 individual cases of the torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Iraqis in police stations and army bases; and how the US authorities were aware of horrific violence by Iraqi militias, including 32,500 murders - of which 160 victims were children.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/23/iraq-war-logs-torture-frago242\">the Guardian has a special video report on the war logs which details how the US military ordered its forces to turn a blind eye to the torture and abuse of detainees</a> by the Iraqi forces and the police.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>10.54am:</strong> WikiLeaks founder <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11612695\">Julian Assange has been speaking at a news conference in London</a> about the release of the Iraq war logs.</p><p>\"This disclosure is about the truth. We hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war, during the war, and which has continued on since the war officially concluded. While I am not sure we have achieved the maximum possible [political impact] I think we are getting pretty close.\"</p><p>Assange highlighted how the reports documented 109,000 deaths - including 66,000 civilians, of which 15,000 were previously undocumented.</p><p>\"That tremendous scale should not make us blind to the small human scale in this material. It is the deaths of one and two people per event that killed the overwhelming number of people in Iraq.\"</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>10.58am:</strong> Solicitor Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers told the press conference that some of the deaths documented in the reports could have involved British forces and would now be the subject of legal action through the UK courts.</p><p>\"Some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the UK have a very clear legal responsibility,\" he said.</p><p>\"This may be because the Iraqis died while under the effective control of UK forces - under arrest, in vehicles, helicopters or detention facilities.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>11.42am:</strong> The main Iraqi political group opposed to prime minister Nouri al-Maliki says the details of torture by Iraqi soldiers and police revealed in the Iraq war logs show what can happen when too much power is given to a single leader.</p><p>\"Putting all the security powers in the hands of one person who is the general commander of the armed forces have led to these abuses and torture practices in Iraqi prisons,\" said Maysoun al-Damlouji, a spokeswoman for the Iraqiya bloc.</p><p>The comments are a veiled slap at al-Maliki, who is fighting to hold onto his job.</p><p>Most of the victims of abuse at the hands of Iraqi security were believed to be Sunnis, many of whom supported Iraqiya in the election in March against al-Maliki's Shia-dominated bloc.</p><p>A government spokesman declined to comment, saying he had not seen the documents.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>11.48am:</strong> Kristinn Hrafnsson of WikiLeaks said it would publish 15,000 more documents about the war in Afghanistan, in addition to those released in July.</p><p>She said the files, which had been held back because of their sensitive content, were fully vetted for release. They had been edited to conceal people's names and \"contain no information that could be harmful to individuals\".</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>11.52am:</strong> Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers told the press conference that there should be a public inquiry into allegations that British troops were responsible for civilian deaths during the Iraq war.</p><p>He cited one case in which he claimed a British rifleman had shot dead an eight-year-old girl who was playing in the street in Basra.</p><blockquote><p>\"For some reason the tank stopped at the end of the street, she's there in her yellow dress, a rifleman pops up and blows her away.\"</p></blockquote><p>He said tank units were in the habit of stopping while on patrol so soldiers could hand out sweets to youngsters as part of the battle for \"hearts and minds\".</p><p>Shiner added that it would be wrong to assume that the US military files \"had nothing to do with the UK\".</p><p>He said he was acting for many Iraqi civilians who were killed or tortured by UK forces.</p><p>\"Some have been killed by indiscriminate attacks on civilians or the unjustified use of lethal force. Others have been killed in custody by UK forces and no-one knows how many Iraqis lost their lives while held in British detention facilities.</p><p>\"If unjustified or unlawful force has been used, prosecutions for those responsible must follow, so we are bringing forward a new case seeking accountability for all unlawful deaths and we argue that there must be a judicial inquiry to fully investigate UK responsibility for civilian deaths in Iraq.\"</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Shiner told the press conference there was a huge and growing body of evidence about the killing, ill treatment and torture of Iraqis whilst in UK custody.</p><p>He said: \"There appear to be many cases other than that of Baha Mousa, where Iraqis died in UK custody and were then certified as dying from natural causes.</p><p>\"None of these deaths have been investigated, many of these Iraqis were hooded and abused and my law firm does not accept the Ministry of Defence's explanation that each and every one of these deaths has a innocent explanation.</p><p>\"If you look at what the British did in Iraq, it's savagery, these Iraqi men simply did not exist, they had been completely dehumanised.\"</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>1.08pm:</strong> John Sloboda, of <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\">Iraq Body Count</a>, told the press conference that the war logs revealed an unprecedented level of detail about the many civilian casualties of the conflict, including many names.</p><p>He said: \"The [15,000] new deaths [detailed in the new logs] are concentrated in small incidents, killing one or two people at a time, scattered all over Iraq, and occurring almost every day for the whole period.</p><p>\"These are the small but relentless tragedies of this war that these logs reveal in unprecedented detail.\"</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> We're wrapping up our coverage of the Wikileaks' press conference now. We'll continue to bring you updates on the news site - with all coverage collated in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq-war-logs\">special report</a>.</p><p>Among the highlights of our analysis of the files is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2010/aug/13/iraq-war-logs\">an interactive detailing - log by log, minute by minute - the hundreds of violent incidents on 17 October 2006</a>.

When he died, they let me and my other brother out. I later learned that another man we had met in prison, Khalid Hussein, had also died.\"</p><p>Torture and death seemed synonymous with the almost exclusively Shia unit, which was tasked with rooting out Sunni insurgents from post-Saddam Iraq. As security unravelled across the country, they were often seen alongside US forces, particularly in Baghdad and Mosul.</p><p>Earlier in 2005, they had swept into Mosul with the US army in support. Muataz Salah Ahmed, now 40, was working in the al-Mas hotel that January when the men in the distinctive red berets and balaclavas burst through the doors.</p><p>\"They arrested us all,\" he said. \"There was an Iranian officer, his name was Ali. Many other officers with him were proud to tell us that they were not police, but Wolf Brigade. They said they had come from Baghdad to arrest us because we supported Saddam and deserved to be executed.</p><p>\"One officer threatened to rape my wife. He tore at her dress and four of my colleagues were killed in front of my eyes. They drilled holes in my legs and arms and did all manner of things to me. They took me and around 1,500 other prisoners to a basement inside the police commander's headquarters.\"</p><p>The unit stayed in Mosul for five months. Ahmed remained in prison for eight months, before being released by a court without conviction.</p><p>\"I have many documents proving who they were and what they did to me,\" he said. \"Twelve families have complained against the general in charge of the unit; his name was Khalid. But they were the government, so what can be done about them?\"</p><p>The Wolf Brigade unit was formed in late 2004, drawing many recruits from the impoverished Shia slums of Sadr city. By late 2005, it was around 2,000-strong and roaming the country with impunity. The unit notionally answered to the then interior minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, who became prime minister in April 2005 for 12 months as sectarian carnage spiralled out of control.</p><p>When Nouri al-Maliki replaced Jafari as prime minister, he pledged to crack down on the Wolf Brigade and any other units seen to be carrying out sectarian agendas. By then, most of its leaders had fled or been killed.</p><p>Questions have endured in the ensuing five years about the extent of US co-operation with the unit and whether US forces knew of the scale of their abuses.</p><p>\"The Americans were there,\" said Shehab. \"They weren't just witnesses. They were part of the operation against us.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting: Enas Ibrahim</em></p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: 'The US was part of the Wolf Brigade operation against us'","trailText":"Omar Salem Shehab tells of torture at hands of notorious Iraqi police unit and says US forces were involved in his capture","newspaperPageNumber":"32","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kygh","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/28/1288277562590/Members-of-the-Wolf-Briga-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/28/1288277562590/Members-of-the-Wolf-Briga-002.jpg","wordcount":"722","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"368145014","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3968490","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Martin Chulov in Baghdad","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-29T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1472300","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-31T17:00:01Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/28/iraq-war-logs-iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/28/iraq-war-logs-iraq","tags":[{"id":"profile/martin-chulov","webTitle":"Martin Chulov","r2ContributorId":"29038","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290791972910/martin-chulov.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin Chulov covers the Middle East for the Guardian.

They waved their arms and flashed lights that were meant to indicate it should stop. When the car continued to advance the troops fired warning shots. They then raised their M249 squad automatic weapons, a light machine gun that sprays bullets at colossal speed. Each man fired as many as 100 rounds at the car.</p><p>The predictable result was that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/D7F53714-3766-43E8-ABF5-9A3E1F45913C\" title=\"\">the people in the front, a man and a woman, were killed</a>. In the back their nine- and six-year-old children were lucky to survive with injuries in the thighs and legs.</p><p>This Iraqi family's fate was by no means unique. The war logs, seen by the Guardian, contain a horrific dossier of cases where US troops killed innocent civilians at checkpoints, on Iraq's roads and during raids on people's homes. The victims include dozens of women and children. The US rarely admitted their deaths publicly.</p><p>In the secret logs the killings mainly figure as \"escalation of force incidents\". Commanders send in reports outlining how soldiers faithfully followed the rules of engagement: first signals, then warning shots, and as a last resort direct fire to disable a vehicle or its driver.</p><p>The relentless drumbeat of civilian deaths illustrates the nature of 21st century warfare and key differences from the way the Americans conducted themselves in their eight-year war in Vietnam.</p><p>Suicide attacks were unknown in America's last major foreign conflict before Iraq. There was no expectation that anything on wheels or indeed any pedestrian could be a moving bomb. The second difference is a change in western military doctrine, common to other Nato armies during counter-insurgencies.</p><p>Known since 2001 as force protection, it puts a high premium on minimising all conceivable risk by permitting troops to bypass traditional methods of detecting friend from foe in favour of extreme pre-emptive action.</p><p>It may be argued that drivers should be more careful to obey troops' orders, but in the dark civilians can be as jumpy as soldiers.  Unlike troops they have no training or prior experience. They may not be sure who the people with flashing lights are on the road ahead. If it is an unofficial roadblock manned by bandits or militias it may be safer to try to race past. They may think they are being ordered to prepare to stop when they reach the checkpoint, not slow down or halt immediately They may fear that if they do a U-turn or retreat this will be considered suspicious.</p><p>A month after the Musayyib killing troops from the 1st Battalion 64th Armour were manning a cordon and search checkpoint in Baghdad.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/EF2647CC-04DA-42FB-95C1-7692DF3156E1\" title=\"\">A civilian car approached in the dark and ignored shouts and flashing lights</a>. The troops fired a single warning shot, and when the vehicle failed to stop they fired 13 to 15 rounds from their 7.62mm rifles. The car contained a woman and three children. Two of the children were dead, the other child and the woman driver were injured.</p><p>One of the biggest death tolls in this kind of incident occurred on 14 June 2005. Troops from 1st Battalion 5th Marine Regiment were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/957DAC17-43AA-4D25-AB77-1C31DFB39EDF\" title=\"\">manning a checkpoint near Hurricane Point</a>, a US base near Ramadi.</p><p>A maroon four-door Opel disregarded hand signals and warning shots and accelerated, the log says. Humvees were parked in the centre of the road in front of it. Marines were positioned on each side. The car was still 150 yards away when troops fired at the car's engine block.</p><p>When it was 100 yards away troops fired again. The car carried on moving at between 40mph and 45mph. Now the marines fired at the driver. This time the car halted.</p><p>In the vehicle the marines found 11 civilians, of whom seven – two children and five adults – were dead. The intelligence report says \"the large number of civilian KIA [killed in action] resulted from the family having placed their children on the floorboards of the vehicle. The disabling shots aimed at the grill are believed to have travelled though the vehicle low to the floorboards\".</p><p>In another horrendous incident on the evening of 29 September 2004 a US marine convoy was travelling on a road near Saqlawiya, west of Baghdad, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/7EDD60AF-26CB-498F-97D0-1483FDFD2CA0\" title=\"\">a car came up close behind</a>, in spite of hand and other signals from the soldier in the rear Humvee to stay further back.</p><p>He fired at the engine and then into the windscreen. The vehicle swerved and plunged into a canal. A man managed to escape and was pulled from the water by a soldier.</p><p>The log does not say whether the marines left at this point but it records that they contacted the Iraqi police to take over the job of checking the car. \"Saqlawiyah IPS [Iraqi police service] responded to the scene and recovered (2) adult females, (3) children ages 5 to 8, and (1) infant from the vehicle. All (6) had drowned,\" the log concludes.</p><p>The victims of these road killings were not always in cars or vans. In Falluja on 26 March 2004 a cyclist approached a US Humvee with military police investigating a booby trap that had just been found.</p><p>According to the intelligence report he was riding \"very quickly\". \"The MPs went through the levels of escalation of force but the man on the bicycle would not slow down. A bag or package was in a basket on the front of the bicycle. Marines engaged [shot at] the male and report (1) IZ [Iraqi] male killed.\" The report adds: \"No explosives were found in the bag/package that was in the basket of the bike.\"</p><p>Raids on Iraqi homes also led to the deaths of innocents when intelligence was poor. Sneaking up to what a report describes as a \"suspicious\" house while conducting a \"cordon and search\" just after 5am in the western town of Rutba on 11 September 2005, marines discovered there was no one in it above the age of 10. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/67325BB7-1654-40F4-8018-157171CC0B45\" title=\"\">A 10-year-old girl and an infant boy were killed</a>. Three other children suffered blast wounds. The marines took one back to their base for treatment.</p><p>\"The children's parents were not at the premises at the time of the incident … No CF [coalition forces] casualties or damages reported,\" the logs record.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Civilians gunned down at checkpoints","trailText":"Fear of suicide bombers means troops have shot drivers and passengers who were simply too scared or confused to stop","newspaperPageNumber":"6","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2h8","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/21/1287680163061/Samar-Hassan-screams-afte-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/21/1287680163061/Samar-Hassan-screams-afte-002.jpg","wordcount":"1040","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367134508","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818662","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458467","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:30:48Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-checkpoint-killings-american-troops","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-checkpoint-killings-american-troops","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

On 24 April 2006 an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/E9513549-06F7-423B-B4EF-93A85B19445C\" title=\"\">American JLens balloon broke from its moorings</a> at the UK-run Shaiba logistics base south of Basra, according to an intelligence report in the Iraq war logs.</p><p>\"Strong gusting SW winds are likely to drive the balloon toward Iran. MTF [more to follow],\" said the report. JLens, which stands for joint land elevated netted sensor, is described by its manufacturer, Raytheon, as \"providing long endurance (up to 30 days on station), over-the-horizon detection and tracking capabilities required to defeat the proliferating cruise missile threat\". Since Iran has no cruise missiles but the US does, the benefits to Iran of the windfall of a JLens landing in its possession are obvious.</p><p>In spite of its \"more to follow\" promise no further information on the balloon's fate is reported in the war logs. What does follow is a second similar incident. On 5 May 2006 another JLens <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/88409B3E-0C40-47E7-A7B8-B1237D1A79C7\" title=\"\">broke from its moorings at Camp Abu Naji in Amara, also close to the Iranian border</a>. It drifted up towards the clouds and once again strong westerly winds blew it towards Iran. The crisis was serious enough for the intelligence report to say an F-18 fighter plane was tasked to try to shoot it down – \"NFDK\" [no further details known]. Again the balloon's fate remains unclear.</p><p>Worse was to come on 10 October 2006 when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/FB2356A5-C612-429D-AACD-53F946621ECB\" title=\"\">controllers in Basra lost a Predator drone, an unmanned surveillance plane,</a> when it was on a flight path that led to the Iranian border. \"Air traffic control tracked the UAV as it entered Iranian airspace for approx 8 mins to a depth of 5.5 miles,\" the report says. Three minutes later they regained control and steered it back to Iraq.</p><p>In April 2006 Britain had its security loss. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/56391EA8-2ECA-4A30-B1C1-733BBB2DB04C\" title=\"\">Documents fell out of a Puma helicopter that was flying over Baghdad</a> with the doors open, as is normal so that the machine-gunner could watch the city below.

For the Pentagon, they are devastating, documenting in fine detail the indifference with which Iraqi human life was viewed. For the British people, they ought to raise important questions as to what our forces knew.</p><p>Aside from questions of complicity, however, the logs also provide an opportunity to properly interrogate a more salient question: how did we treat the Iraqi man, woman and child?</p><p>The stomach-churning, systematic torture meted out by the Iraqi police and military is our problem as much as it is America's. In many of the 142 cases in which <a href=\"http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/\" title=\"Public Interest Lawyers\">Public Interest Lawyers</a> acts, UK forces are alleged to have handed over detainees to the Iraqi authorities. This was despite the clear indications that many Iraqi police stations were effectively torture chambers that the national authorities were free to run with impunity. Their cover was provided by Fragmented Order 242, which not only allowed but required coalition forces to turn a blind eye where their own forces were not \"responsible\".</p><p>The problem is that they were, and are, responsible. Across the spectrum of human rights, one freedom has always been accorded a special, peremptory status. The prohibition of torture is incapable of restriction. International law and UK domestic law have long buttressed this absolute prohibition by imposing upon the state an obligation to effectively investigate torture where there are clear indications that it may have taken place. Similarly, the state is precluded from transferring individuals to another state where there exists a substantial risk of torture.</p><p>And the war logs reveal that is precisely what happened to the prohibition in Iraq, where the only status it was ever accorded was that of routine. The same can be said of the freedom from arbitrary deprivation of life, whose regular violations were ignored.</p><p>But the search for truth must begin at home. Ten days from now, the high court in London will hear evidence of torture and unlawful killing of Iraqi civilians at the hands of British forces. The thousands of allegations presented by our clients point to systemic problems at the heart of the UK military system that necessitate a single judicial inquiry into British detention policy in Iraq. Extreme physical violence, hooding, the use of stress positions, and sleep deprivation were apparently standard operating procedure. Of particular concern are the many allegations of sexual abuse, even male rape. A judicial inquiry along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/baha-mousa\" title=\"Baha Mousa\">Baha Mousa</a> inquiry may be capable of unearthing the true extent of the UK's own abuses, and for that reason the British government is fighting its spectre every bit as aggressively as the Pentagon berates WikiLeaks.</p><p>And it does not end there. Aside from the abuses in UK custody, we act for the families of many Iraqis killed in the streets of south-east Iraq. Among them is Hanaan Salih Matrood, an eight-year-old girl who was inexplicably gunned down by a British tank in 2003 while playing in the street with friends. In the culture of impunity that Britain and America had created for themselves, the death of a little girl and the anguish of her family could be swept under the carpet, with the help of a few US dollars.</p><p>But the truth about Hanaan and the many other Iraqis tortured and killed indiscriminately will soon have to be addressed. By bringing the constant drip-drip of Iraqi suffering home to us in the way it has, WikiLeaks has underscored the importance of confronting that truth now so that lessons can be learned, justice done, and a bloody chapter in British and American history closed.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: The truth for Hanaan Hamood Matrood","trailText":"<p><strong>Jim Duffy:</strong> The stomach-churning

Wikileaks' Iraq war logs release has dumped some 391,000 records of the Iraq war into the public arena. We've had them for a few weeks - what have we found out?</p><p>This is in a different league to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jul/27/wikileaks-afghanistan-data-datajournalism\">Wikileaks Afghanistan</a> leak - there's a good case for saying the new release has made the war the most documented in history. Every minor detail is now there for us to analyse and breakdown but one factor stands out: the sheer volume of deaths, most of which are civilians.</p><p>Some key findings:</p><h2>Total deaths</h2><p>• The database records 109,032 deaths in total for the period<br />• The database records the following death counts: 66,081 civilians, 23,984 insurgents and 15,196 Iraqi security forces<br />• The worst place for deaths was Baghdad - 45,497, followed by MND north (which is the region that goes from Baghdad up to Kurdistan) where another 34,210 died. The quietest place was the north east with only 328 deaths</p><h2>Murders and escalation of force</h2><p>• 34,814 people were recorded as murdered in 24,840 incidents<br />• The worst month was December 2006 with 2,566 murders - and 2006 was the worst year with 16,870 murders<br />• The database records 12,578 escalation of force incidents (where someone is shot driving too fast at a checkpoint, for instance) - and these resulted in 778 recorded deaths</p><h2>Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)</h2><p>• There were 65,439 IED explosions over the period - with 31,780 deaths recorded on the database from those alone.<br />• There were another 44,620 IEDs found and cleared<br />• The worst month for IED explosions was May 2007 with 2,080 IED explosions</p><p>The Guardian has decided not to republish the entire database, largely because we can't be sure the summary field doesn't contain confidential details of informants and so on. But, so you have some data to work with, we have provided this <a href=\"#data\">spreadsheet</a>. It contains the records of every incident where someone dies, nearly 60,000 in all. We have removed the summary field so it's just the basic data: the military heading, numbers of deaths and the geographic breakdown. </p><p><a href=\"http://tables.googlelabs.com/Home\">Google Fusion tables</a> is fantastic for mapping out bulky datasets and they don't come much bulkier than this. We took all these incidents where someone had died and put it on the map above. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/interactive/2010/oct/23/wikileaks-iraq-deaths-map\">fullscreen version</a> is easier to use. A few of the datapoints aren't mapping correctly - but this may be a problem with the data.</p><p>You can download it below, plus we've broken down the deaths by cause and year in sortable tables.

The secret reports from the frontline that form the bulk of the leaked war logs routinely follow this policy, giving totals of EKIA (enemy killed in action) but providing no evidence of attempts to check whether the bodies are those of insurgents or unarmed civilians.</p><p>A rare exception was the large-scale offensive by 2,500 US marines, soldiers and sailors on the western Iraqi town of Husayba, close to the Syrian border, in November 2005. Codenamed Operation Steel Curtain, its aim was to prevent foreign fighters and weapons entering Iraq from Syria. It was touted as a successful assault when it ended after 17 days. An official statement said 139 insurgents were killed for the loss of 10 US marines. There was no mention of civilian casualties.</p><p>But the logs reveal that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/1036C6DC-C795-4D95-A4FA-FAC065AA08D8\" title=\"\">US authorities were well aware at least 25 civilians had been killed in their air strikes</a>. They report that US troops were present when local people took Iraqi security forces to three bombed-out houses in Husayba to dig out the remains of 11 children and 10 women who died \"in areas attacked by coalition aircraft on November 7\", as one log puts it. The dig took place four days after the air strikes. Neighbours identified the 21 women and children as well as three adult male bodies. A father identified a 12th child whose remains could not be recovered, the reports say.</p><p>Steel Curtain was one of a series of US offensives along the Euphrates valley in Anbar province, which became the main source of armed resistance by Sunnis in 2004 and 2005. A few western reporters were embedded with troops for the assault, which quickly featured in a video game, allowing players to act as though they were troops killing insurgents.</p><p>Marines went house to house through Husayba, calling on helicopters and planes to bomb suspected insurgent strongholds. Hundreds of civilians fled into the desert. The Guardian's Sean Smith was the only British photographer with the troops. \"Women and children came out carrying white flags. It was eerie seeing columns of people appearing through the smoke and explosions, with no one knowing which direction the shooting was coming from. I am sure we will hear of more casualties,\" he wrote on 25 November 2005.</p><p>Officially, little was revealed. US officers publicly acknowledged only one case where civilians died but they blamed insurgents. After recovering five bodies of civilians the marines told Kirk Semple of the New York Times on 8 November that according to a witness, insurgents had broken into a family home, killing two of its occupants, and locked the survivors in a room. Semple's report went on: \"'The insurgents then used the house as a base for attacks against American and Iraqi troops,' a Marine Corps statement said. 'Unaware that civilians were in the house, marines dropped a bomb on it on Monday, reducing it to rubble.'\"</p><p>Six weeks later the Washington Post's Ellen Knickmeyer attempted to reconstruct what happened in Husayba. \"Townspeople, tribal leaders, medical workers and accounts from witnesses at the sites of clashes, at hospitals and at graveyards indicated that scores of non-combatants were killed last month in fighting, including air strikes, in the opening stages of a 17-day US-Iraqi offensive.\"</p><p>She quoted Zahid Mohammed Rawi, a physician in Husayba, as saying that roughly one week into Steel Curtain medical workers had recorded 97 civilians killed. \"At least 38 insurgents were also killed in the offensive's early days,\" she continued. Colonel Michael Denning, the top air officer for the 2nd Marine Division, which was leading the fight in Anbar, told her \"insurgents will kill civilians and try to blame it on us\".</p><p>From the intelligence reports it is clear that by the time of Denning's interview US authorities already knew that more than two dozen women and children had been killed in areas bombed by US planes. The bodies dug up on 11 November were in addition to the ones mentioned in the New York Times report three days earlier.</p><p>In an attempt at mitigation the intelligence reports say insurgents were engaging coalition forces from all the locations where bodies were found and where close air support was called in. \"It was not known that civilians were present on targets during time of CAS [close air support] engagement,\" they say.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Operation Steel Curtain and its 25 ignored civilian casualties","trailText":"<p>Military trumpeted Husaybah campaign as victory over foreign fighters but didn't mention the innocents lying in the rubble</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"9","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2hc","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287753958650/US-soldiers-crouch-behind-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/22/1287753958650/US-soldiers-crouch-behind-002.jpg","wordcount":"738","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367134716","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818379","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458471","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-27T17:00:01Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/24/steel-curtain-air-strikes-husaybah","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/24/steel-curtain-air-strikes-husaybah","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

Fifty-two journalists have died in crossfire or other combat situations and 89 have been murdered. Almost all of the murdered journalists were Iraqis, usually as victims of the sectarian violence that began three years after the US invasion.</p><p>After decades of repression under Saddam Hussein, Iraqis initially felt free to travel anywhere and report as they saw fit. While western reporters retreated to guarded hotels and villas in Baghdad and Basra when kidnapping became a major risk in the summer of 2004, Iraqi journalists carried on working, often for western newspapers and TV stations that did not want to lose their own staff.</p><p>Covering US military activities was especially dangerous. US troops killed several Iraqi journalists at checkpoints or near US bases, in most cases without accepting responsibility. Often they promised to hold investigations but never released their findings.</p><p>One of the most notorious incidents was the killing of Asaad Kadhim and his driver, Hussein Saleh, who worked for the US-funded TV station al-Iraqiya. They were shot by US troops outside a base at Samarra, 80 miles north of Baghdad, on 20 April 2004. At a press conference Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, the deputy director of operations for coalition forces in Iraq, said there were signs banning filming or stopping near the base. US forces at the entrance warned the driver to stop by firing several shots. When they were ignored, Kimmitt said, forces fired at the car.</p><p>The war logs show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/4F17BE2A-DB4F-4E69-8006-A6456DA7FBBB\" title=\"\">the base housed US special forces and was therefore especially sensitive</a>, though the journalists may not have known this. An intelligence report says two Iraqi males were seen videotaping outside it. A soldier \"requested and received permission to fire warning shots … IZ [Iraqi] males fled into a white Toyota sedan and drove towards the USSF compound, then turned north. Soldier fired at the vehicle which stopped and backed up toward the USSF compound.\"</p><p>An independent observer might assume the journalists were approaching to explain who they were – or if one of them was injured, to get help. In early 2004 suicide bombings were rare and journalists could still approach most US bases in vehicles or on foot. There was no undue risk, although looking like an Iraqi probably made it more dangerous.</p><p>The secret intelligence report goes on: \"Soldiers fired again at the vehicle, stopping it outside the compound. A patrol investigated the vehicle and found two dead, one injured and one uninjured. The casualties were taken to the compound, treated, questioned and released. The casualties had documentation identifying them as members of the Iraqi media network.\" The report did not mention that the uninjured man was an Iraqi policeman whom the journalists had invited into their car. Angry Iraqi journalists questioned Brigadier General Kimmitt and the coalition's civilian spokesman, Dan Senor, the following day. Senor told them: \"Let me say this.

A US marine sergeant was watching and reported the incident, which was duly recorded and judged to be valid. The outcome: \"No investigation required.\"</p><p>That was a relatively minor assault. Another of the leaked Iraqi war logs records the case of a man who was arrested by police on suspicion of preparing a suicide bomb. In the station, an officer shot him in the leg and then, the log continues, this detainee \"suffered abuse which amounted to cracked ribs, multiple lacerations and welts and bruises from being whipped with a large rod and hose across his back\". This was all recorded and judged to amount to \"reasonable suspicion of abuse\". The outcome: \"No further investigation.\"</p><p>Other logs record not merely assaults but systematic torture. A man who was detained by Iraqi soldiers in an underground bunker reported that he had been subjected to the notoriously painful strappado position: with his hands tied behind his back, he was suspended from the ceiling by his wrists. The soldiers had then whipped him with plastic piping and used electric drills on him. The log records that the man was treated by US medics; the paperwork was sent through the necessary channels; but yet again, no investigation was required.</p><p>This is the impact of Frago 242. A frago is a \"fragmentary order\" which summarises a complex requirement. This one, issued in June 2004, about a year after the invasion of Iraq, orders coalition troops not to investigate any breach of the laws of armed conflict, such as the abuse of detainees, unless it directly involves members of the coalition. Where the alleged abuse is committed by Iraqi on Iraqi, \"only an initial report will be made … No further investigation will be required unless directed by HQ\".</p><p>Frago 242 appears to have been issued as part of the wider political effort to pass the management of security from the coalition to Iraqi hands. In effect, it means that the regime has been forced to change its political constitution but allowed to retain its use of torture.</p><p>The systematic viciousness of the old dictatorship when Saddam Hussein's security agencies enforced order without any regard for law continues, reinforced by the chaotic savagery of the new criminal, political and sectarian groups which have emerged since the invasion in 2003 and which have infiltrated some police and army units, using Iraq's detention cells for their private vendettas.</p><p>Hundreds of the leaked war logs reflect the fertile imagination of the torturer faced with the entirely helpless victim – bound, gagged, blindfolded and isolated – who is whipped by men in uniforms using wire cables, metal rods, rubber hoses, wooden stakes, TV antennae, plastic water pipes, engine fan belts or chains. At the torturer's whim, the logs reveal, the victim can be hung by his wrists or by his ankles; knotted up in stress positions; sexually molested or raped; tormented with hot peppers, cigarettes, acid, pliers or boiling water – and always with little fear of retribution since, far more often than not, if the Iraqi official is assaulting an Iraqi civilian, no further investigation will be required.</p><p>Most of the victims are young men, but there are also logs which record serious and sexual assaults on women; on young people, including a boy of 16 who was hung from the ceiling and beaten; the old and vulnerable, including a disabled man whose damaged leg was deliberately attacked. The logs identify perpetrators from every corner of the Iraqi security apparatus – soldiers, police officers, prison guards, border enforcement patrols.</p><p>There is no question of the coalition forces not knowing that their Iraqi comrades are doing this: the leaked war logs are the internal records of those forces.</p><p>There is no question of the allegations all being false. Some clearly are, but most are supported by medical evidence and some involve incidents that were witnessed directly by coalition forces.</p><p>The coalition's answer, laid out in Frago 242, is to find justice from the senior officers of the Iraqi security forces. It is to them that the coalition send their reports. But those reports suggest that senior officers frequently are part of the problem.</p><p>A police lieutenant whose men have been beating up three suspected drug dealers, is recorded as confiding to a US captain that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/05F55972-0F73-BDDA-C7F69F2EF408DFF1\">\"light beatings and the threat of beatings were often used to gain information from prisoners\"</a>. A chief of police in Riyadh is confronted with evidence that numerous detainees have been abused by his men and that bloodstains and \"suspected tools of torture\" have been found in his own office: \"He responded he was aware of the beatings and supported it as a method of conducting investigations.\"</p><p>In June 2009, coalition forces dealt with a prisoner who was bruised, shaken and tearful and who reported that a unit of Iraqi soldiers had beaten him on the soles of his feet and on his back and threatened him with sexual assault. The log continued: \"This is not the first time that this battalion have been accused of alleged detainee abuse. There have been at least three previous accusations.\"</p><p>They then noted that on the very afternoon this latest alleged assault had occurred their own senior officers had been meeting the Iraqi brigade commanders who were responsible for this battalion and who claimed to have heard nothing about any detainee being abused. \"Brigade has a duty to control their subordinate units; if they fail to do so, the alleged violence, if it is occurring at the battalion level, will undoubtedly continue.\"</p><p>And it does continue. With no effective constraint, the logs show, the use of violence has remained embedded in the everyday practice of Iraqi security, with recurrent incidents up to last December. Most often, the abuse is a standard operating procedure in search of a confession, whether true or false. One of the leaked logs has a detainee being beaten with chains, cables and fists and then confessing to involvement in killing six people because \"the torture was too much for him to handle\".</p><p>Sometimes, the abuse is simply rough justice. When police catch a suspected bomb maker, they beat him up and, according to the log, allow a crowd of local people to join them in doing so. When a group of 10 officers pick up three drunken lads who have been stealing bananas, they tie them up and batter them severely.</p><p>At other times, Iraqi security are clearly engaging in abuse to exact revenge. After an Iraqi soldier was killed in a firefight, his battalion went out and rounded up 32 people. Within 10 minutes, the log records, they had beaten up 18 of them, leaving 14 with visible injuries.</p><p>On another occasion, in Falluja, in January 2007, police who were investigating an attempt to assassinate one of their majors found their prime suspect in hospital with a gunshot wound in the leg: the logs record that they hauled him out, beat him up in the car park outside their base and then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/7B7ED79C-1143-D62E-D1E0C12C5434B916\">dumped him on the floor in an office, still bleeding from his gunshot wound</a>.</p><p>It is clear, too, that some Iraqi security units are themselves simply engaging in crime, whether for financial or political motives. The logs record a police officer who was torturing detainees in order to extort money from their families to pay him to stop; another who allowed outsiders into the police station to assault a particular prisoner. Sectarian faultlines run through the security agencies: Shia soldiers respond to a Sunni man, who reports an IED on the roof of his truck, by beating him with cables and a piece of wood; a police station near Baghdad is taken over by Shia militants from the Mahdi army, who imprison five opponents in a secret room where they are found coughing blood and showing signs of rape.</p><p>At their worst, the accounts seem unbelievable and yet they are made credible by records of injuries. Last July coalition forces discovered the case of a man who was said to have been tortured two years earlier, in June 2007, by three Iraqi army lieutenants who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/50A2284C-BF55-E1FD-BEA7B6AED9A0AD20\" title=\"\">\"tortured him by pouring chemicals on his hands, cut his fingers off\"</a>. They found he had been treated at Mosul general hospital at the end of June 2007, where the records confirmed that doctors had had to amputate his right leg below the knee as well as several toes on his left foot and several fingers on both hands. They also found extensive scars which they diagnosed as chemical/acid burns.</p><p>On that occasion, Mosul police became involved and issued a warrant for the three named lieutenants but, the log shows, two years later, no arrest had been made, and the victim had been released from hospital. \"His location is currently unknown.\"</p><p>Numerous logs show individual members of the coalition making genuine attempts to stop the abuse. Since 2006 the coalition has had military transition teams, known as Mitts, working alongside Iraqi military units; and police transition teams, PTTs, embedded with local police. These teams are recorded on multiple occasions making unannounced spot checks at Iraqi security bases and finding torture in progress. \"Captain Walker and 1st Lieutenant Ziemba … caught Captain Hassan and Sgt Alaa by surprise … In the office there was what appeared to be a battery with open ended wires … Before entering the office, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/EC3ED714-64C3-453B-B623-7CCFB4AFF59B\" title=\"\">Capt Walker and 1Lt Siemba heard what sounded like an individual being hit and moaning</a>. The detainee was sitting in the centre of the room sobbing. They stopped the suspected abuse.\"</p><p>Even then – unless HQ gives them special permission to investigate – all they can do is remonstrate. The logs record the excuses offered by Iraqi security personnel: two men are covered in bruises because \"they fell out of the armoured car on the way to the detention facility\"; a man with a dislocated shoulder \"fell off his chair\"; a man in a police headquarters who is covered in injuries and reports being beaten on the feet and legs, punched in the face, electrocuted in his feet and genitals and sodomised with a water bottle, is claimed simply to have fallen off his motorcycle.</p><p>The coalition has had some success. Some Iraqi officers have been suspended. Some have even been arrested. In September 2008, in Diyala, a police lieutenant, Sabah Mahdi Zayni, was arrested for killing three Sunni civilians and because, it was alleged, he \"was also responsible for abuse and rape of Sunni detainees in the Wajihiyah area\". There is no record in the logs of whether the officer was charged or released.</p><p>Numerous reports show Iraqi police and soldiers attempting to conceal their abuse from the coalition. A log last May records a detainee being electrocuted by Iraqi police who clamped a hand over his mouth and told him \"to keep quiet because the Americans might hear his screams\".</p><p>But, without the power to open a formal investigation, that success is limited. In June 2006, coalition personnel targeted the police station at Husayba: \"There is evidence of torture in a holding cell … and clear evidence that human rights violations are occurring … <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/5287A651-4E6C-4275-8374-61CF9FD33F62\" title=\"\">Large amounts of blood on the cell floor</a>, a wire used for electric shock and a rubber hose … The taped ends had the presence of blood.\"</p><p>According to the log, the police transition team spoke to Iraqi police commanders, counselled and retrained junior officers, organised unannounced visits to the station and physically stayed there overnight. And yet three years later, in February 2009, there was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/84A1A9AC-FAED-91C8-DDF6752E521ADDF9\" title=\"\">new evidence that Husayba police had set up a torture room in which they had abused some 33 victims</a>. A senior Iraqi officer was asked to investigate.</p><p>• To protect detainees who have made complaints, some names, identifying details and original documents have been withheld.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Secret order that let US ignore abuse","trailText":"<p>Mistreatment of helpless prisoners by Iraqi security forces included beatings, burning, electrocution and rape</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2hz","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281090902115/In-this-award-winning-pic-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281090902115/In-this-award-winning-pic-002.jpg","wordcount":"1965","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367135176","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818746","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Davies","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458483","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:30:22Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-detainee-abuse-torture-saddam","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-detainee-abuse-torture-saddam","tags":[{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/war-logs","webTitle":"The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/war-logs"},{"id":"world/us-military","webTitle":"US military","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-military"},{"id":"world/iraq-war-logs","webTitle":"Iraq: The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq-war-logs"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"profile/nickdavies","webTitle":"Nick Davies","rcsId":"GNL029211","r2ContributorId":"16177","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/28/nick_davies_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nick Davies is the bestselling author of Flat Earth News, on falsehood and distortion in the media, and a former Journalist of the Year</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickdavies","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nickdavies"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-367984672","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281090902115/In-this-award-winning-pic-002.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Guardian","photographer":"Sean Smith","altText":"In this award-winning picture, detainees are led away for questioning during Operation Steel Curtain","height":"84","credit":"Sean Smith/Guardian","caption":"In this award-winning picture, detainees are led away for questioning during Operation Steel Curtain.

The secret logs' main evidence for Iranian involvement in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003 consists of low-level arms smuggling and the detention of Iranian nationals entering Iraq illegally.</p><p>The logs are not the definitive compilation of intelligence available to the UK and British authorities but it is noteworthy that they rarely mention Iranian links to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used to kill British and American troops.</p><p>Among the more sensational reports is one on 31 October 2005 that says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/4C5B2DDD-D90F-42DD-8965-6DF61B1DFD20\" title=\"\">Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"directs Iranian-sponsored assassinations in Basra\"</a>. The IRGC is said to provide various militias with instructions on whom to kill and how. It specifies whether to use a handgun or rifle and \"what part of the target's body should be targeted, for example, the head, stomach, back or heart. If an order is given to assassinate multiple targets at the same time, the instructions for each target will be different in order to mislead investigators, news media and the public that it is a random act of violence\".</p><p>. The report goes on to say that the assassins are militia members who have been infiltrated into the Iraqi police, in particular its antiterrorism unit.</p><p>The intelligence report says its information comes from an IraqiAlthough some of his reporting has been corroborated by independent reporting, \"reliability has not been determined\".</p><p>A week later, on 7 November 2005, an intelligence report says the IRGC smuggled 12 boxes of ammunition and two boxes of rockets to unknown individuals in Amara, a city close to the border in south-east Iraq where Britain had the lead responsibility within the multinational coalition. The rockets are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/B8CEAEF3-0E19-4287-83DF-DF941BF21102\" title=\"\">possibly surface-to-air missiles, the report says</a>. But the source does not know the intended recipients of the munitions, the log admits, and does not make clear whether he saw the shipments or only heard about them.</p><p>Another case where no hard evidence is given relates to a plan to assassinate Ayad Allawi, the former Iraqi prime minister. Under the heading \"Threat of VBIED\" (vehicle-borne improvised explosive device), an intelligence report says a pink Hyundai Accent \"was allegedly brought into Iraq from Iran through northern Iraq<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/58572E86-02F8-4990-A8D4-7439B72027E9\" title=\"\"> for ultimate use\" against Allawi or one of his \"close political associates\"</a>.</p><p>On 17 January 2006 a report says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/D3127776-BF22-4583-81BD-4DB8CD7F9357\" title=\"\">a weapons smuggler in southern Iraq sold 50 82mm \"neuroparalytical\" projectiles to a local group</a>. The report does not identify the group and says it is difficult to make a proper threat assessment without knowing where the paralysing agent was obtained, what it consists of and how it would be included in the munitions. \"Even if the group attempted to include a neuroparalytical agent on or in a projectile it is unlikely that this would be successful. The explosion from the munitions alone would destroy the neuroparalytical agent.\"</p><p>A potential attack on the Green Zone in Baghdad is ascribed on 31 March 2006 to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/46B4233F-C0DA-4EFC-90C4-7F5AC06B4B6F\" title=\"\">\"unidentified former members of Saddam Hussein's former intelligence team\"</a>. They are said to be preparing to send a car bomb packed with rockets and missiles containing chemical gas. The car will be an armoured black GMC Suburban with tinted windows, in common use among US officials and contractors in the Green Zone.</p><p>As of 15 March the vehicle was in a village west of Baghdad, according to an intelligence report. \"The vehicles came from Syria or Iran. No further information,\" it says. The vehicles and rockets will be fired by people unknown to the car bomb organisers. The aim of the rockets is to distract attention at a checkpoint to allow the car bomb to detonate at the checkpoint and spread gas across the Green Zone.</p><p>The threat posed by this potential attack is somewhat undermined by highly sceptical comments added to the intelligence report by 41D EOD, the explosive ordnance disposal section of the US Fourth Infantry Division. They say: \"The VBIED described in this report is possible only if the VBIED constructor has extensive knowledge of explosives and the chemical applications of explosives. 4ID EOD also assessed that this configuration is not practical, but it is possible.\"</p><p>Iran is reported on 17 November 2006 to be offering new techniques to suicide bombers in Iraq. Instructors in Tehran explain how miniature cameras can be installed in a suicide vest to allow a controller to monitor the movements of the bomber towards the target. If the bomber fails to detonate his vest the observer can do it remotely. The intelligence report says Syria is engaged in the same process, sometimes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/C39190D3-0310-47E3-A50A-27B920C4A81B\" title=\"\">rigging surplus US military uniforms with the tiny cameras</a>. The report gives no source, nor does it say whether any such vests or coats have actually been found by western forces or officials.</p><p>Two weeks later an intelligence report says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/3A8340EA-C288-552B-947256C6EC9BC9B4\" title=\"\">a blue cargo truck is to transport mortar rounds and launchers</a> as well as IEDs hidden in furniture from al-Kut to Baghdad. Al-Kut is close to the Iranian border and the report says the explosives orginated in Iran, though it adds there are no details on the people organising the transport.</p><p>Harder evidence of Iranian involvement in destabilising Iraq surfaces mainly in the sighting or capture of arms and explosives. The reports assert that weapons come from Iran.</p><p>On 1 December 2006 a report says that a named commander from the Mahdi army of Moqtada al-Sadr, the main Shia leader of resistance to the occupation, met Iranian officials – reported to be from the Revolutionary Guard Corps – at an unofficial border crossing at al-Shib to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/3E4EB079-AE9B-DC0D-FD9B54400E123483\" title=\"\">pick up three shipments of rockets</a>. Each shipment had six crates with six rockets in each one. They were transferred into a Toyota Landcruiser and driven to his home.</p><p>The report's source describes the commander as a well-known arms merchant with a near monopoly on the black market for weapons and the main supplier of weapons from Iran for Mahdi army fighters in the south-eastern provinces of Maysan, Dhi Qar and Basra as well as Sadr City in Baghdad. During Saddam's rule the merchant lived for 28 years in exile in Iran, hence his good contacts.</p><p>The shipment is said to be aimed at firing 108 rockets at the Green Zone in Baghdad. The intelligence report ends by saying that such a large-scale attack is unlikely since it would produce a US military response in Sadr City. The more likely threat would be a series of five to 10 rounds growing more frequent during the hours of darkness. The report says \"the source is deemed as credible and the attack as plausible therefore this threat is assessed as very high\". During 2008 the reports describe a number of raids on key figures believed to be involved in arms smuggling. On 20 January the logs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/9747DB85-9E58-4E7C-251EDE3D8D925F7B\" title=\"\">include a graphic report of a raid as it is under way</a>, complete with multiple acronyms, slang and exact timing: \"3/B/1-2 reports they have bingo and are entering target building 1 to search 1337: 3/B/1-2 is entering a second target building 1405: 3/B/1-2 reports they have lost bingo 1440: 3/B/1-2 reports they have touchdown on rabbit 1455: 3/B/1-2 reports they have keys to the TGT's [target's] vehicle and 1 x UE [unidentified enemy] who is possible jackpot 1530: 3/B/1-2 is complete on site and is RTB ATT [returning to base after the targeting] with 1 x LN [local national's] vehicle and 1 x detainee.\"</p><p>It says the target is a Mahdi army member associated with the intimidation of Sunnis and attacks on coalition forces and Sunni neighbourhoods: \"He is also directly involved with weapons trafficking from Iran to Baghdad and Nasiriya. His detention will significantly impact the flow of Iranian weapons to Baghdad in addition to reducing IDF [indirect fire] attacks against Sunnis and coalition forces.\" In early 2007 US and British officials began to accuse Iran of supplying anti-occupation fighters with advanced IEDs, known as \"explosively formed penetrators\". They said attacks using the powerful new type of roadside bomb against US forces had doubled during 2006. The war logs make few references to the devices. The only one that links to Iran appears on 29 December 2006 when the joint operations centre of multinational forces in Iraq says a named Iranian intelligence officer who is an Iraqi citizen has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/CB5DE853-C212-BE1F-0B027B8587B57799\" title=\"\">\"ordered members of his improvised explosive device (IED) and explosively formed penetrator (EFP) network to attack the main British base in Basra\"</a>.</p><p>The attack is to occur on the night of 31 December 2006, taking advantage of new year celebrations, and consist of rocket attacks. He has ordered his people to attack a US base near Habbaniya, west of Baghdad. British military authorities made no report of any such attack on their Basra base that night.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Iran accused of plotting attack on Green Zone","trailText":"Audacious strike in Baghdad among allegations against Tehran of everything from gun running to training insurgents","newspaperPageNumber":"8","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2ha","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/21/1287680889326/An-insurgent-from-the-Mah-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/21/1287680889326/An-insurgent-from-the-Mah-002.jpg","wordcount":"1537","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367134703","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818423","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458469","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:31:11Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iran-role-iraq-war-ieds","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iran-role-iraq-war-ieds","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

A leading military law expert consulted by the Guardian has questioned this legal advice.</p><p>The Guardian can also reveal that the helicopter involved in the incident in 2007 had the same call sign – Crazyhorse 18 – as the Apache whose crew later mistakenly killed two Reuters journalists and injured two children in a notorious shooting in urban Baghdad. The killings drew worldwide condemnation in April this year when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks obtained video footage taken from the helicopter's gun camera</a> and released it on the internet.</p><p>It has not been possible to establish whether the same personnel were involved in both attacks.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/E8DE9B9F-E468-B587-E4B332C09FF48BE2\" title=\"\">account of the earlier incident</a> in the leaked logs, the insurgents had jumped out of their truck after it came under fire from the Apache. \"They came out wanting to surrender,\" Crazyhorse 18 signalled.</p><p>Clearance to kill came back from an unnamed lawyer at the nearby Taji airbase. \"Lawyer states they can not surrender to aircraft and are still valid targets,\" the log entry says.</p><p>After receiving the lawyer's advice, the pilots reported that the men had by now got back into their truck and were attempting to drive on. The gunship made two attempts to kill the fleeing men, launching a Hellfire missile at the truck.</p><p>At first the fresh attack failed. \"Individuals have run into another shack,\" the crew signalled. As the Apache hovered high in the sky, a few miles north of Baghdad, the pilots viewed a zoomed-in image of the fleeing pair on their video screen.</p><p>The crew then received a further specific top-level kill instruction from brigade HQ and made another strafing run, firing bursts from long distance at 300 rounds a minute from the Apache's 30mm cannon. This time, the gunner succeeded in killing both men.</p><p>At 1.03pm on 22 February, just 24 minutes after receiving legal clearance, the crew filed a log entry: \"Crazyhorse 18 reports engaged and destroyed shack with 2X AIF [anti-Iraq forces]. Battle damage assessment is shack/dump truck destroyed.\"</p><p>Crazyhorse 18 was part of the US army's 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, normally based at Fort Hood, Texas. Five months after this incident, on 12 July 2007, the crew of an Apache with the same call sign mistakenly killed 22-year-old Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen and his driver, Saeed Chmagh, after opening fire on a group of eight men they believed to be insurgents armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK47 rifles in a Baghdad suburb.</p><p>Two children were badly injured and their father killed when the Apache crew fired armour-piercing shells at a van which arrived on the scene.</p><p>The account of the February incident recorded in the classified log suggests the Crazyhorse 18 crew were not trigger-happy, but sought immediate advice from their superiors at all stages of the attack.</p><p>Under the 1907 Hague regulations, it is forbidden \"to kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his arms, or having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at discretion\".</p><p>Britain's own official Ministry of Defence publication, the Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, says there are practical difficulties around surrenders to aircraft, but adds: \"With the advent of close-support and ground-attack helicopter units, the surrender of ground troops … has become a more practical proposition.\"</p><p>One of Britain's foremost experts on the subject, Professor Sir Adam Roberts, cast doubt on the legal advice given to the Crazyhorse 18 crew. \"Surrender is  not always a simple matter,\" Roberts, emeritus professor of international relations at Oxford University and joint editor of Documents on the Laws of War, told the Guardian. But the reasoning given  by the US military lawyer was \"dogmatic and wrong\".</p><p>\"The issue is not that ground forces simply cannot surrender to aircraft,\" he said. \"The issue is that ground forces in such circumstances need to surrender in ways that are clear and unequivocal.\"</p><p>However, he added: \"If the insurgents did indeed get back into the truck and drove off in the same direction as previously, then they probably acted unwisely, in a way that called into question their act of surrender … The US airmen might legitimately reckon that the truck contained weapons and that the men could be intending to rejoin the fight sooner or later.\"</p><p>The detailed account of events on that February morning begins with a common occurrence: insurgents near the huge Taji airbase start lobbing rockets and mortar shells, in the hope of killing Americans. US troops return the shelling, and Crazyhorse 18 is dispatched on a mission to see whether the retaliation has had any effect. At 11.34am, three minutes after takeoff, the crew spot the insurgents fleeing their launch site with a mortar and tripod on the back of a Bongo – a light truck manufactured by Kia.</p><p>The crew confirm a \"positive identification\" of the enemy. But it is 13 minutes before the pilots are officially \"cleared to engage\" with automatic cannonfire by their headquarters.</p><p>The Apache opens fire, and two Iraqis fling themselves out of the Bongo as the heavy shells blast the truck and cause its stock of mortar ammunition to \"cook off\".</p><p>The enemy gunners try to make their escape in a dumper truck, driving northwards. At 12.33pm, the Apache reports that it has fired on the truck, \"and then they came out wanting to surrender\".</p><p>Two minutes later, \"Crazyhorse 18 reports they got back into truck and are heading north\". Four minutes after that: \"Crazyhorse 18 cleared to engage dumptruck. 1/227 [1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment] lawyer states they cannot surrender to aircraft and are still valid targets.\"</p><p>The two Iraqis try to take refuge in a shack. After a 13-minute delay, another instruction appears to come from a remarkably high level: the office of the commander [IH6] of the Ironhorse brigade at Camp Taji.</p><p>The signal reads: \"IH6 approves Crazyhorse 18 to engage shack.\"</p><p>After the killing, the helicopter pilots summarise what for them and their superiors has apparently been a successful chase: \"Ix engagement with 30mm. 2x AIF killed in action. 1x mortar system destroyed. 1x Bongo truck destroyed with many secondary explosions. 1x dumptruck destroyed. 1x shack destroyed.\"</p><p>At 1.25pm, their gunship heads home to Taji to refuel and reload with ammunition.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Apache crew killed insurgents who tried to surrender","trailText":"US military legal adviser told helicopter crew that Iraqi men were valid targets as they could not surrender to aircraft","newspaperPageNumber":"4","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2kt45","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/22/1287778394944/A-US-military-Apache-heli-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/22/1287778394944/A-US-military-Apache-heli-002.jpg","wordcount":"1069","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367957389","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3886912","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"David Leigh","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1469777","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:31:40Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-apache-insurgents-surrender","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-apache-insurgents-surrender","tags":[{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/war-logs","webTitle":"The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/war-logs"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq"},{"id":"world/us-military","webTitle":"US military","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-military"},{"id":"profile/davidleigh","webTitle":"David Leigh","rcsId":"GNL041963","r2ContributorId":"15562","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/david_leigh_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>David Leigh is the Guardian's investigations executive editor, whose work was behind the jailing of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/aitken\">Jonathan Aitken</a> and the exposure of secret payments by arms company BAE</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidleigh","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/davidleigh"},{"id":"world/iraq-war-logs","webTitle":"Iraq: The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq-war-logs"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/world"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-367975198","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/22/1287778398514/A-US-military-Apache-heli-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"Marko Drobnjakovic","altText":"A US military Apache helicopter","height":"276","credit":"Marko Drobnjakovic/AP","caption":"A US military Apache helicopter releases an anti missile decoy flair as it files over Baghdad, Iraq.

Five men were injured and another, Staff Sergeant Joseph Fegler, 24, was killed. Two hours after the engagement it emerged that the damage had been done by the rear gunner of another US convoy up ahead. The first shots the victims heard had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/CCBAE5C2-3EEE-48F6-9B7E-358E7DC33289\" title=\"\">warning shots fired to get them to keep their distance</a>.</p><p>Three weeks later a patrol from another company of the same regiment, moving on foot through farmland south-west of Baghdad, came under heavy fire from insurgents. Some of the platoon were wounded and the senior sergeant commandeered a civilian car to take them back to the company vehicles. As it raced back another part of their company, drawn by the sound of shooting, headed their way. They saw a civilian car filled with armed men moving towards them at high speed, and opened fire, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/965CB04B-EBFF-488E-8E1F-E8CB33562622\" title=\"\">killing two of their comrades, Sergeant Aram Bass and Sergeant William Meeuwsen, and injuring four others, including a civilian interpreter</a>.</p><p>When the dead were named the Pentagon said the circumstances were being investigated as possible friendly fire incidents. There was less clarity in the case of Sergeant David Hart, Private Ivan Merlo and Private Phillip Pannier of the 327th Infantry Regiment, who died in January 2008, south-west of Samarra. It was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/583F41FA-423D-4561-557AD9CE64D38C01\" title=\"\">merely stated that \"the incident is under investigation\"</a>, although families do appear to have been told that friendly fire was suspected.</p><p>The war logs describe a day that began promisingly as a company of the 327th searched buildings. They found bomb shops: nearly a tonne of high explosives, bomb-making guides, an IED ready to be triggered and a disassembled suicide vest. A smouldering fire suggested the bomb makers weren't far away. A helicopter with the call sign Carnage 3 alerted the company to some camouflaged vehicles nearby. A squad of soldiers sent to investigate found more explosives and a mortar.</p><p>Guided by the helicopter to a nearby field of reeds, the squad came across a group of insurgents dug into trenches and tunnels and a firefight broke out. Three American soldiers were wounded, including, it appears, Hart, who died of his injuries later. The war log reports that Carnage 3 fired nine rockets and 250 rounds from a heavy calibre machine gun at the Iraqi position; a few minutes later the American casualties were airlifted away.</p><p>As the log entries continue it emerges that events were not so straightforward. Two of the squad's soldiers, Merlo and Pannier, were missing. Another helicopter, Carnage 16, spotted their bodies and their comrades found them on the ground soon afterwards, alongside the bodies of three dead Iraqis. But who killed them?</p><p>The log switches to the testimony of the helicopter unit. The log isn't explicit but it is clear the helicopter crews are defending themselves against an accusation that their weapons killed their comrades. The crews didn't see any US soldiers in the area they fired at, they say. Air controllers on the ground were telling them there were no friendly troops in the area, and asking them to shoot at the enemy. In the confusion of battle did they end up shooting two or three of their friends? \"The investigation,\" reports the log, was \"ongoing.\"</p><p>Two other <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/61EF122E-AA47-4099-BEDDB817BFE5C64D\" title=\"\">US friendly fire fatalities are detailed in the logs</a>: Corporal Ryan Collins of the 501st Parachute Regiment, who died from a gunshot wound; and Private Shawn Hensel, who appears to have been among a group of 23rd Infantry soldiers hit by a burst of heavy calibre machine gun fire from a US Stryker armoured vehicle.</p><h2>Overtake at your peril</h2>The logs also show that British forces were mistakenly attacked by US and other coalition units at least 11 times. In one previously unreported incident a group of US military police trying to repair a broken-down vehicle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/B8C49637-F0B4-4FAE-94CF-B745B8E6EBCF\" title=\"\">shot at two Royal Marine Land Rovers</a>, injuring one commando on 20 October 2004.</p><p></p><p>Approaching US convoys was a particularly risky endeavour for the British. On 27 February 2004 three British vehicles overtook a Czech convoy north of Safwan, close to the Kuwait border. That brought them directly behind an American convoy, lumbering along at 30mph, prompting a US soldier to threaten them with his .50 calibre machine gun.</p><p>An intelligence report written by the British but passed to the Americans emphasised: \"There was sufficient daylight for the US convoy to clearly see the British military number plates on the vehicles.\" It went on: \"The British convoy attempted to get close to and pass the US convoy a total of three times and was threatened in the same way each time.\"</p><p>Five months later, on 20 July, a US convoy opened fire on British vehicles trying to overtake in the same area.

His fundamentalist Sunni supporters were behind some of the worst atrocities aimed at Iraq's Shia majority population as well as countless attacks on US and Iraqi government forces. Their bombing of a sacred golden-domed Shia shrine in Samarra in February 2006 led to a wave of revenge killings that lasted for a year and a half.</p><p>He was eventually located by the Americans in a house north of Baghdad in June 2006 and killed with his family by a US air strike.</p><p>His narrow escape from British troops and a unit of British special forces emerges from the secret military intelligence logs examined by the Guardian. They report that on 17 March 2005 the G3 cell of army intelligence at British brigade headquarters in Basra heard that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/2A5BB8F4-A335-4E2F-BF6C-28E46D842B83\" title=\"\">Zarqawi was travelling south on route 6 from Amarah to Basra</a>. They informed Danish forces at 2.15pm. The Danes played a junior role in the coalition under overall British command in south-eastern Iraq.</p><p>Half an hour later, the report says, a Lynx helicopter spotted a suspicious car that had stopped 7.5 miles (12km) south of al-Qurna and about 60 miles north of Basra. Al-Qurna is a dusty flyblown Mesopotamian town that is claimed, inappropriately in view of its present condition, as the site of the biblical Garden of Eden.</p><p>US forces in Iraq invariably sent helicopters in pairs. The report says the helicopter maintained \"top cover\" for 15minutes but then had to return to the UK-run Shaiba logistics base to refuel.</p><p>\"As a result the area of interest was unobserved for between 20 and 30 min,\" the report adds. By then British troops from Corunna company of 1st Battalion the Duke of Wellington's Regiment had rushed in and set up an inner and outer cordon around the area. British special forces and an American \"arresting officer\" were brought in.</p><p>Having lost their helicopter cover the forces were reduced to random searching. A Shia mosque was raided but Iraqi civilians were the only people in it. A second building was searched but also only contained civilians. The report ends with: \"At 22.14 the search was concluded.\"</p><p>Unlike many other reports in the logs, this one makes no comment on the source of the intelligence and its reliability. The British may have doubted it since Amara is in an overwhelmingly Shia area and perhaps an unlikely place for Zarqawi to be. Perhaps they suspected the Americans were inflating his importance. Regardless, the British did take the report seriously enough to send dozens of troops to capture the suspect.</p><p>The near-miss was hugely expensive, if Zarqawi was indeed in the suspicious car. He had first come to international attention when his gunmen kidnapped Ken Bigley, a British contractor working on reconstruction projects, and two American colleagues in Baghdad in September 2004. They were shown on their knees in videos and beheaded two days later after the authorities refused to negotiate their release.</p><p>This was a minor atrocity compared to what al-Qaida was to do in Iraq in 2005 and 2006. Led by Osama bin Laden, the movement was not active in Iraq before the US-led invasion in March 2003, even though the Bush administration rejected CIA intelligence to that effect and publicly insisted Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were linked.</p><p>Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of Britain's MI5 at the time, told the Iraq inquiry last month that by toppling Saddam, George Bush and Tony Blair opened the door to al-Qaida. \"Arguably we gave Osama bin Laden his Iraqi jihad so that he was able to move into Iraq in a way that he wasn't before,\" she said.</p><p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi became friends with Bin Laden when they were both resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the late 1980s . Arrested in his native Jordan in 1992, Zarqawi was convicted of trying to overhrew the monarchy and establish an Islamic caliphate. On release from a five-year prison term he went back to political insurgency, setting up his own movement called al-Tawhid wal Jihad. After the US-led invasion of Iraq he aligned himself with al-Qaida and was recognised as its leader in Iraq with the title \"emir of al-Qaida in the country of two rivers\".</p><p>The war logs suggest he made a slow start. Secular Iraqi Sunni nationalists had started their resistance to the Americans within weeks of Saddam Hussein being toppled, and Zarqawi moved in several months afterwards.</p><p>In February 2004 the logs report the Italians as having information about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/39FA991D-40AC-4B51-A1F3-186DF0BBF892\" title=\"\">plans for a suicide attack in Nasiriya</a> by \"possibly an al-Qaida cell\" of two men, one Saudi and the other Lebanese wuth false documents. In August 2004 there is a report of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/AD14EB73-97AD-4B58-95DD-3FEC5C3894D1\" title=\"\">possible al-Qaida safe house in Ramadi </a>, and in December in Baghdad the Americans mounted an unsuccessful raid to capture a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/73017650-059C-449A-B27C-7D55FE9DD540\" title=\"\">\"suspected Wahhabi supporter of al-Qaida\"</a>.</p><p>In July 2005 the logs contain a chilling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/83E4A7A5-2508-480E-B67C-49EF4114D152\" title=\"\">letter of warning to all Iraqis working for the Americans</a>. Addressed to \"the traitors\", it says: \"The tawheed and jehad movement is warning you, if you do not stop your work with the American forces you will be dead and this is a final warning to you from the leader of al-Qaida in Mesopotamia. If you will ever enter an American base or work with them any more, you and all with you will be killed. God is the Greatest, signed by Abo Mosa'ab al-Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaida in Mesopotamia.\"</p><p></p><p>After the British fiasco in al-Qurnah the first menton of Zarqawi's potential whereabouts in the logs comes on 22 September 2005 when he is reported to be moving between two Sunni villages in the al-Jazira area north of Ramadi. An intelligence report claims there are 600 foreign fighters loyal to al-Qaida in the area with plans to attack the US base in Ramadi, known as Camp Blue Diamond.</p><p>In February 2006 Zarqawi mounted his biggest coup. Armed men blew up the golden dome of the al-Askari mosque, sacred to Shias, in the largely Sunni town of Samarra. The attacks enraged Shias across Iraq, set off a wave of reprisal attacks on Sunnis and Sunni buidings. Sectarian killings that lasted almost a year and a half forced hundreds of thousands of Iraqis to abandon their homes, with many fleeing abroad.</p><p>No group took responsibility but the Americans accused al-Qaida and Zarqawi. They redoubled their efforts to find him and on June 7 located him in a house near Baquba. Air strikes were called in and the house was flattened.</p><p>The logs are full of \"threat reports\" about possible attacks on the Green Zone in Baghdad and other US targets to avenge his death. In the event, though, the assassination passed off without a major response.</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: British blunder may have let al-Qaida kingpin Zarqawi go free","trailText":"Helicopter ran out of fuel, allowing Bin Laden's Iraq chief to evade capture for further 15 months, secret military logs suggest","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2tpk7","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281092010948/Abu-Musab-al-Zarqawi-in-a-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281092010948/Abu-Musab-al-Zarqawi-in-a-002.jpg","wordcount":"1185","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"365508046","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3618454","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1435948","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-26T21:00:00Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/23/iraq-zarqawi-alqaida-british-blunder","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/23/iraq-zarqawi-alqaida-british-blunder","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

Newspapers and television networks have focused heavily on the claim that prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, directed a counter-terrorism unit answerable only to him, which targeted predominantly Sunni areas. They have also examined disclosures that the numbers of civilian deaths throughout the eight-year war are 15,000 higher than previously stated.</p><p>The Iraqi News Network was typical of the tone: \"The WikiLeaks documents revealed very important secrets,\" it said. \"But the most painful among them are not those that focus on the occupier, but those that reveal what the Iraqi forces, Iraqi government and politicians did against their citizens. Those leaders who returned to remove Iraq from oppression toppled the dictator but then carried out acts that were worse than Saddam himself.</p><p>\"If these documents make the US apologise to Iraqis, they should compel Mr Maliki to leave the political arena altogether and apologise to everyone.\"</p><p>The revelations have led to an uncomfortable week for Maliki, who has been battling to cobble together a coalition government that would allow him to lead the country for a second term. Members of Maliki's coalition have taken to the airwaves in an attempt to defuse fears that the leaked documents would make it harder for him to win cross-sectarian support.</p><p>The government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh has been prominent, on largely government-friendly channels, in defending the would-be leader's position. So too have other loyalists, including key henchmen Haider al-Abadi and Abbas al-Biyati, who have tried to convince viewers that the assertions have been overstated.</p><p>Dabbagh has not been so keen to speak to western networks this week, telling at least one network that he would not agree to appear on air if the WikiLeaks revelations were up for discussion. Other Maliki backers have suggested the leaks were part of an orchestrated conspiracy designed to cripple his chances of being returned as leader. His office on Monday released a statement to that effect, but did not suggest who may have been behind any plot.</p><p>The sharp rise in the stated numbers of deaths throughout the war – 105,000, including 66,000 civilians – has also created ripples. The number is around 30,000 higher than an official US government tally released last month, which was collated between January 2004 and August 2008. The numbers killed during the tumultuous years since the invasion have been a point of contention between the US and Iraqi governments and NGOs. So too have claims that the US had been complicit in acts of torture carried out by arms of the Iraqi security forces.</p><p>These revelations, which featured prominently in the Wikileaks documents, have not played as strongly as anticipated in the Iraqi press.</p><p>Iraq's human rights minister has threatened to sue any organisation found culpable of torture. Maliki has ordered an investigation into the claims.</p><h2><strong>United States</strong></h2><p>The main American newspapers latched on to three core elements of the WikiLeaks Iraq documents: the abuse of detainees in Iraqi custody, Iran's involvement in the war and the role of private US contractors in the widespread killings of civilians.</p><p>But the New York Times, Washington Post and other papers were accused by web publications and some bloggers of downplaying the extent to which the documents revealed US complicity in torture and provided evidence that politicians in Washington \"lied\" about the failures of the US military mission.</p><p>Under the headline \"Detainees Suffered Most In Iraqi Custody, U.S. Logs Say\", the NYT detailed the revelations of torture and other abuses by the Iraqi security forces, sometimes with the connivance of the US military and other officials.</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24contractors.html\" title=\"\">the paper gave greater emphasis</a> than foreign newspapers to what the documents revealed about the role of private military contractors in Iraq, still a sensitive issue in the US, where the trial of several Blackwater employees over the killings of civilians appears to be collapsing. The NYT said the war logs showed that the wide use of military contractors added to the chaos of the war.</p><p>\"The documents sketch, in vivid detail, a critical change in the way America wages war: the early days of the Iraq war, with all its Wild West chaos, ushered in the era of the private contractor, wearing no uniform but fighting and dying in battle, gathering and disseminating intelligence and killing presumed insurgents,\" the paper said.</p><p>\"The archive, which describes many episodes never made public in such detail, shows the multitude of shortcomings with this new system: how a failure to co-ordinate among contractors, coalition forces and Iraqi troops, as well as a failure to enforce rules of engagement that bind the military, endangered civilians as well as the contractors themselves. The military was often outright hostile to contractors, for being amateurish, overpaid and, often, trigger-happy.\"</p><p>Much of the US press also focused on the claim that the WikiLeaks papers supported the former president George Bush's claim that the war in Iraq was severely complicated by Iran's covert role.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/24/wikileaks-back-bush-claims-iran-role-iraq-war/\" title=\"\">Washington Times said</a> the leaked documents showed \"Iran was orchestrating one side of the Iraqi insurgency\".</p><p>\"Field reports made public by the website WikiLeaks ... show that US military intelligence agencies had many strands of evidence revealing that Iran provided paramilitary training to Shiite Muslim insurgents at the height of the civil war in Iraq,\" it said. But the same paper, a strong supporter of the Bush administration, played down the extensive disclosures of human rights abuses and killings by Iraqi security forces.</p><p>The NYT also came in for criticism from some respected bloggers who accused it of underplaying the significance of revelations about the failures of the American military.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/media\\_criticism/%E2%80%99story=/opinion/greenwald/2010/10/25/nyt\" title=\"\">Glenn Greenwald of Salon</a>  accused the paper of glossing over the fact that the US was actively complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees in part by handing them over to known Iraqi torture squads.</p><p>\"Media outlets around the world prominently highlighted this revelation, but not The New York Times,\" he wrote. Instead, Greenwald said, the New York Times framed the revelations as suggesting that the Americans were not so bad in their treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib because they fared worse in Iraqi hands.</p><p>Greenwald contrasted the paper's take with that of Politico, which began an article on the WikiLeaks documents by saying: \"Newly released Iraq war documents paint a devastating portrait of apparent US indifference to a pattern of murder and torture by the Iraqi army, raising new questions about the Obama administration's plans to transfer the nation's security operations to Iraqi units.\"</p><p>Other publications were equally forthright. The Washington Post's former Baghdad reporter during the war, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-25/wikileaks-shows-rumsfeld-and-casey-lied-about-the-iraq-war/\" title=\"\">Ellen Knickmeyer, wrote in the Daily Beast</a> that the documents demonstrated the extent of the \"lies\" of US leaders.</p><p>\"Thanks to Wikileaks, though, I now know the extent to which top American leaders lied, knowingly, to the American public, to American troops, and to the world, as the Iraq mission exploded,\" she wrote, specifically naming the former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld.</p><h2><strong>Denmark</strong></h2><p>Iraqi interpreters working for coalition forces during the war were systematically tortured and killed by insurgents, according to <a href=\"http://www.information.dk/databloggen/248616\" title=\"\">a Danish investigation of the leaked Pentagon files</a>. The newspaper <a href=\"http://www.information.dk/248544\" title=\"\">Dagbladet Information reported that at least 60 Iraqi interpreters were executed</a> between January 2004, when the first of the secret reports date from, and the summer of 2007, when Danish forces left the country.</p><p>Up until shortly before the Danish pullout from Iraq, interpreters were not allowed to stay overnight in the Danish camp if they were not on duty. \"We were living targets when we were not working,\" one of the translators told Information. \"The insurgents considered us traitors and believed we carried information they could use. They were constantly on the hunt for us.\"</p><p>The newspaper is one of a small number of media organisations, including the Guardian, which were given access to almost 400,000 secret US army reports released by the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.</p><p>The Iraqi translators' security became a high-profile political issue in Denmark in 2007, when the ministry of defence initially refused to allow them asylum. The government reversed its decision following intense media pressure after the killings of two translators employed by Danish forces came to light.</p><p>The study of the Iraq war files has revealed how Danish troops were involved in handing over detainees to Iraqi authorities, despite warnings of torture in police stations. The investigation by Information also showed that Danish forces increasingly used British troops to handle the arrests of Iraqis, after a report surfaced in the summer of 2004 of prisoners being mistreated in Danish custody.</p><p>A legal adviser to the Danish defence command told the paper that there was a clear strategy to let British troops handle the capture of prisoners. \"It was common practice to assemble the operations so that there were British troops, who would carry out any potential capture,\" said Jes Rynkeby Knudsen.</p><p>A lawyer from the Danish Institute of Human Rights, Peter Vedel Kessing, said: \"If the Danes are in charge of an operation but simply arrange for other nationals to apprehend the prisoners in order to dodge further responsibility, then this would seem to amount to circumvention of the Geneva convention.\"</p><p></p><h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2><p>Italian journalists scouring through the Iraq war logs have found two reports that appear to contradict soldiers' accounts of Italy's military mission in southern Iraq.</p><p>Italian soldiers who fired upon a vehicle in Nassiryah in August 2004 reported at the time that they were responding to insurgents firing at them from the vehicle, Corriere della Sera reported.

Even in military circles, the latest thinking accepts this view, for a variety of reasons that include its own best interests. We argued exactly this point <a href=\"http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/publications/reports/everyone%E2%80%99s_interest_recording_all_dead_not_just_our_own\" title=\"\">in a recent article in the British Army Review</a>, co-authored with a British Army colonel.</p><p>The Iraq war logs contain information on civilian and other casualties that has been kept hidden for more than six years. Also concealed has been the fact that these logs record the names of thousands of Iraqi civilian victims. Whether or not this data is \"stolen\" from the US military, as a spokesman has asserted, is beside the point. The pertinent fact is that the data on casualties contained within these logs is information about the public (mainly, the Iraqi public) that was unjustifiably withheld by the US government from the public, for reasons that remain unstated.</p><p>Since the 2003 invasion, <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\" title=\"Iraq Body Count\">Iraq Body Count</a> (IBC) has systematically recorded not just the mounting number of civilians killed in Iraq, but many of the connected details. These have included the time, place and other circumstances of each death and, whenever possible, the name and demographics such as the age, sex and occupation of the dead. Consequently every record in IBC's public database is open to scrutiny, correction (where necessary) and verification. Most importantly, in the context of the Iraq war logs, this detailed level of recording allows IBC's information to be compared and reconciled with new data as it emerges.</p><p>Our <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\" title=\"\">detailed, incident-level analysis</a> indicates that the Iraq war logs are likely to add some 15,000 previously unreported deaths of civilians and police to public knowledge. This is despite the fact that the logs contain a lower total number of civilian deaths than those in IBC's count for the same period of the conflict. This is because the logs miss many deaths that IBC has recorded.</p><p>Discovering such previously undocumented deaths would have been impossible if the deaths contained in the logs had been presented as simple totals, as is the norm for official announcements or publications of casualty data. Without sight of the incident-level and victim-level details in the logs there is simply no way to establish how such data truly compares to existing sources.</p><p>From our systematic evaluation of 760 of the logs (including all of those listing more than 20 victims, together with a stratified sample of the many more logs describing smaller incidents), we have already found 113 hitherto unreported victim names, as well as new demographic data for 298 victims. Most victim names appear to be attached to the smaller incidents where one or two people were killed, and which form by far the largest proportion of logs containing casualty data. Retrieving all of the victim names that may be present in all 390,000 logs will require much more work.</p><p>But like the other casualty details in the Iraq war logs, these names too belong in the public domain – as a memorial to the dead, and public recognition of the loss suffered by their families. Only a list of named individuals, visible to all including those who knew them in life, can ever provide full verification, without omissions or duplication, of the death toll of this war.</p><p>It is time for governments to realise that the early, voluntary release of casualty information in the conflicts they are embroiled in is the correct thing to do, both from a moral and a pragmatic standpoint. Whatever is holding them back is surely a minor concern when set against the public's right to know the immediate human consequences of war.</p>","headline":"WikiLeaks Iraq war logs: Why Iraq has the right to know the full death toll","trailText":"<p><strong>Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda:</strong> The Iraq war logs show the US withheld details of thousands of civilian deaths.

Posted on YouTube, the 39-minute cockpit video shows three incidents in which people were targeted as they walked along Baghdad streets, sat in a van or went into a building, unaware that gunships were aiming to destroy them. Because the dead included two Iraqi journalists working for Reuters TV the US authorities mounted a rare investigation.</p><p>War logs examined by the Guardian reveal that a bigger incident with a greater number of casualties occurred in a neighbouring part of Baghdad four days later on 16 July 2007. This time the Apaches were aided by unmanned surveillance drones and two F-16 fighter-bombers as US ground troops stepped up operations in densely populated eastern Baghdad against militants loyal to the anti-occupation cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. When it was over a local Iraqi informer told a US army interpreter that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/D1B9DF91-B9EA-1B93-2DA80B02B6F9F5CE\" title=\"\">14 civilians were dead, according to a military intelligence report</a>.</p><p>The bloody incident begins after two foot patrols from A Company of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment come under small arms fire. One patrol \"clears\" the nearby Islamic Bank and then comes under fire again from a building belonging to the electricity ministry. Ten minutes later the other patrol reports fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Two Apache helicopters are called in, known in US military jargon as Crazyhorse elements 20 and 21, and both \"engage the AIF\" (anti-Iraqi forces). (The helicopter involved in the shooting four days earlier was Crazyhorse 18.)</p><p>Ten minutes later one of the helicopters fires at two more AIF targets and reports it is being shot back at. An Iraqi army patrol arrives with a US training team. A US foot patrol from A Company reports that a nearby mosque is calling insurgents out to attack the Americans. No source is given, but the patrol may have an Iraqi interpreter who can understand the voice from the minaret.</p><p>The helicopter pilots spot a crowd gathering who are described as \"possible AIF\". The second helicopter, Crazyhorse 21, \"conducts final gun run\" to strafe unnamed targets that the intelligence report does not specify. By now two F-16 fighter-bombers are on station along with an unnamed drone that is filming the scene. Four Bradley armoured vehicles full of US ground troops are at the ready nearby.</p><p>But there is no more firing from the Iraqis and the drone's video footage, which is being monitored by US controllers, shows people coming out of the mosque and dispersing. \"No weapons were seen.\" US troops remain on the scene for another 50 minutes before returning to base.</p><p>It is not their practice to remove or identify bodies. If done at all it is usually left to Iraqis. In this case the war log on the incident ends with what are described as unconfirmed reports of casualties. An Iraqi colonel says 12 AIF are dead. A named Iraqi informer on the ground rings the Parachute Infantry Regiment's interpreter and tells him 14 civilians are dead.</p><p>It is not clear whether both men are referring to one group of dead with differing estimates of whether they were insurgents or civilians, or whether there were separate groups totalling 26.</p><p>The terseness of the war log, which was compiled some time after the event, conveys little drama – which is why the cockpit video released by WikiLeaks in April is so important. It shows the true face of war as pilots treat a small densely populated corner of a foreign city as a battle space in which any adult male they spot is suspected of being a gunman.</p><p>Even so they are not supposed to kill unless they or any ground troops they are assisting have come under fire, or they are sure a person seen to be carrying a gun is about to fire at US troops.</p><p>If rules of engagement are broken the war logs usually conceal it. This appears to have happened with the killings illustrated in the leaked cockpit video. The Guardian has examined the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/B9817BE2-FDDC-102D-60B34786952A5C90\" title=\"\">secret intelligence reports for 12 July 2007</a> and compared them with the recorded words of the pilots and ground commanders. Parts of the video recording already showed the helicopter pilot and gunner giving false information to their commanders in order to get permission to fire. The logs show clear evidence of a cover-up after the event.</p><p>Take the second round of shooting in the 38-minute sequence. It revolves around a dark-coloured minivan that approaches a wounded man lying by the pavement and trying to drag himself to his feet. Two men jump out and go to his aid. Neither is carrying a weapon. They pay no attention to the bodies lying several yards away. Yet the cockpit recording has their commander saying \"they have individuals going to the scene, looks like possibly uh picking up bodies and weapons\". The helicopters get permission to blast the van regardless, even though firing on people who are aiding casualties violates US rules of engagement and international law.</p><p>The intelligence report of the incident says Crazyhorse \"engaged AIF\". In fact there is nothing seen by the helicopter pilots to show the men are insurgents. Indeed, when US ground troops reach the shot-up van a few minutes later they discover its passengers include two small girls who have been wounded, suggesting it was an innocent civilian vehicle that had rushed to help the wounded victim because it was the nearest transport available.</p><p>The third bout of gunfire from the helicopters comes when they destroy a large building on a street corner with three Hellfire missiles. Before firing the first one the pilot says: \"There are at least six individuals in that building with weapons.\" The cockpit video has shown only one man going into the building, carrying something that might be a weapon. Two clearly unarmed men then go in and another unarmed man walks past the entrance seconds before the gunner launches his missile. Over the next few minutes the helicopters fire two more missiles in order to destroy the building completely.</p><p>As untrue as the helicopter pilots' live reporting was, the intelligence summary they filed later compounds the lies. Now the alleged gunmen are said to have been running into the building – clearly more suspicious behaviour than walking.</p><p>In the report's own laconic language: \"1125: Crazyhorse engaged with 3xMissle 6XAIF with wepons that ran into a building at Grid MB 5514 8626. Building destroyed 6x AIF KIA\".</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Apache helicopters kill 14 civilians in hunt for insurgents","trailText":"<p>'Gun runs' over Baghdad saw pilots blasting vehicles and buildings on the slightest suspicion</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2h9","wordcount":"1121","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367134651","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818372","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Jonathan Steele","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458468","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:34:01Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/apache-helicopters-kill-iraqi-civilians","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/apache-helicopters-kill-iraqi-civilians","tags":[{"id":"profile/jonathansteele","webTitle":"Jonathan Steele","rcsId":"GNL004679","r2ContributorId":"15908","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/jonathan_steele_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jonathan Steele is a Guardian columnist, roving foreign correspondent and author.

Two reports dated 23 June 2008 record two Shia men who described being punched and kicked by unidentified British troops. Both men had injuries that were consistent with their stories. There is no record of any formal investigation.</p><p>Another log, dated 2 September 2008, records that a civilian interrogator working with the Americans reported that British soldiers had dragged him through his house and repeatedly dunked his head into a bowl of water and threatened him with a pistol. The log claims that his story was undermined by inconsistencies and an absence of injuries.</p><p>In relation to US troops the logs reveal numerous claims of assaults on detainees, particularly by marines. A woman reports being pulled by the hair and kicked in the face and displays injuries that tend to confirm her story; a man who was detained claims a US soldier kicked his legs and punched his chest and arms, and he is found to have multiple contusions and abrasions on his legs, arms, chest and face.</p><p>On several occasions US soldiers report their colleagues. One reveals that the driver of his Stryker armoured vehicle habitually calls out an English-language warning to soldiers in the rear and then brakes heavily to send detainees flying forward, and that those in the back take it in turns to hit their prisoners. Another describes a fellow soldier choking a detainee before pointing an unloaded shotgun at his belly and pulling the trigger.</p><p>Some incidents are minor cruelties. A US soldier at Habbaniya is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq/warlogs/00BF81DD-6DD1-4D7E-8C54-ED9BE66F8ADB\" title=\"\">stood down after writing \"pussy\" on the forehead of a prisoner</a> who was crying. Other incidents are fuelled by fear and anger. When a 26-year-old Iraqi throws a satchel bomb at a US convoy, American soldiers chase him into his house and beat him, leaving him with multiple cuts and bruises.</p><p>The logs record no incident of systematic torture or assault by coalition troops as serious as those attributed to Iraqi personnel. In one case, in February 2009, a detainee who endured three days of torture by Iraqi security forces says he was handed over to them by coalition soldiers because he refused to answer their questions. In all cases involving coalition troops there is a policy to hold formal inquiries, although preliminary reports frequently show signs of deliberate scepticism towards the claims of detainees.</p><p>One report considers allegations of assault made by 16 Iraqis who were arrested in a joint patrol by American and Iraqi forces. The report undermines every single claim and repeatedly concludes that \"the signs of physical trauma are the result of legitimate use of force as documented in Sgt Tim M and Sgt Leonard C's sworn statements\".</p>","headline":"Iraq war logs: Detainees abused by coalition troops","trailText":"US and Iraqi troops blamed for broken bones, cuts, bruises and humiliation tactics in catalogue of everyday abuses","newspaperPageNumber":"3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2k2hy","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281091169757/Iraqi-soldiers-guard-a-bl-002.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281091169757/Iraqi-soldiers-guard-a-bl-002.jpg","wordcount":"486","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"367135064","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3818763","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Davies","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1458480","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-10-25T20:30:38Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-prisoner-abuse-cases","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-prisoner-abuse-cases","tags":[{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/war-logs","webTitle":"The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/war-logs"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq"},{"id":"world/us-military","webTitle":"US military","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/us-military"},{"id":"world/iraq-war-logs","webTitle":"Iraq: The war logs","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq-war-logs"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/world"},{"id":"profile/nickdavies","webTitle":"Nick Davies","rcsId":"GNL029211","r2ContributorId":"16177","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/28/nick_davies_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nick Davies is the bestselling author of Flat Earth News, on falsehood and distortion in the media, and a former Journalist of the Year</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickdavies","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/nickdavies"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-367135077","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281091173368/Iraqi-soldiers-guard-a-bl-006.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Iraqi soldiers guard a blindfolded detainee during an operation outside Baquba, north of Baghdad","height":"276","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Iraqi soldiers guard a blindfolded detainee during an operation outside Baquba, north of Baghdad.
