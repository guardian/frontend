        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya\">Surabaya</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/antananarivo\">Antantanarivo</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quelimane\">Quelimane</a> – exotic places with names evoking mystique and a sense of adventure. How about <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/\">Kakadu</a> – or Gaagudju as it was known before white settlement?</p> <p>It’s a name which conjures images of wilderness where time is oblivious to the protocols of place names or designations such as World Heritage Site. It is, nonetheless, a domain sensitive to the effects of too much love or too little respect. The nearby monolith, Uluru has also been classified a globally significant site where ancient culture now amazes and provokes visitors from around the world.</p> <p>This new four-part series (<strong>ABC1, Sundays 7.30pm</strong>), narrated by Tom E Lewis and superbly photographed by Luke Petersen and Nick Robinson, offers an intensely personal view of the area through the activities of people entrusted with maintaining its integrity while simultaneously providing access to its wonders.</p> <p>The first thing to become obvious as the exploration unfolds, is that those who manage and protect the land are superbly attuned to the physical and the spiritual concerns of the work. This is stewardship of a natural resource upheld with unswerving belief and sensitivity for the balance between careful exploitation and preservation for the future.</p> <p>“Our land is our life, we have to protect it forever” says one savvy ranger. “Money doesn’t mean anything to me” says Jeffery Lee, a traditional owner. &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”</p> <p>Fair enough. Tourists, while generating income, are essentially the most vulnerable and least necessary element in a complex eco-structure involving insects, microscopic creatures, plants, animals, reptiles, birds and aquatic animals such as the formidable saltwater crocodiles which have survived the searing heat and flooding rains of the region for millions of years.</p> <p>World Heritage listing of Kakadu, which is one third the size of Tasmania and half the size of Switzerland, began in 1981 and was formally completed in 1992.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f498b12-8245-46a7-9a98-1f6fd23f0190\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381034430611/9adc0f26-ce3f-4949-b2a0-c982c0a7e08c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jeff Lee Kakadu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jeffrey Lee: &quot;Money cars and jobs, they come and go. The land doesn’t go anywhere…”&nbsp;Photograph: /ABC</figcaption> </figure> <p>About 500 people live within its borders but upwards of 250,000 visitors come to the region annually and their safety is a key thread through the series - seen through the work of wildlife officers charged with ensuring crystal clear escarpment rivers and murky billabongs aren’t reservoirs of disasters for the unwary or outright foolish that are arrogant enough to turn a blind eye to the bleeding obvious. They occasionally end up&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the bleeding obvious.</p> <p>Traditional owners such as Jeffery Lee can see beyond these clear and present dangers to the long-term peril of permitting insensitive and greedy operators to ruin the place. How uranium mines can be condoned inside Kakadu is as much a cause for bewilderment as the natural wonders which constitute the real wealth of the park.</p> <p>Viewers join cheerful botanists, environmental scientists, anthropolgists and rangers – not your standard Steve Irwin model – and naturalists such as Anne O’Dea and Ian Morris as they patrol.</p> <p>Fire is one of the elements that defines Kakadu. It can serve man and, equally, place him in grave jeopardy – as illustrated during an encounter with Steve Anderson, Jabiru’s fire officer and his band of “Angels”.</p> <p>They tackle a potentially lethal&nbsp;blaze – probably started by an unextinguished campfire – threatening their community. The stewards of Kakadu also have to deal with man-made disasters such as the devastation created by the misguided introduction of cane toads into Queensland in 1935. As a consequence no king brown snakes or giant spotted goannas, previously prolific, can be seen in 200 X 100 km park. Other species at risk, like the Northern Quoll, are being trained to avoid the toads and their toxic venom.</p> <p>It’s a salutary example of the balance of Nature being upset. Humans can at least be steered into compliance or obedience, and recreational anglers coming to fish for Barramundi or crabs find the law is enforced rigorously – a little too decently you might think after a confrontation between rangers Garry Lindner, his offsider, Andrew Wellings, and a boofheaded poacher.</p> <p>There are moments when the series veers into the style of reality documentary where actuality is accentuated and over-dramatised but by and large, the overwhelming reality of the place defines an eminently watchable series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419167641|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|ce94cea6534eca10410618a38bef60a8bdd2e9af -->",

        "headline":"Michael J Fox: 'Nobody pities me and that's great. I couldn't stand it'",
        "body":"<p>When Michael J Fox walks into the reception of his office in New York, he arrives like a bantam-weight boxer ready for a fight. It is not so much the way he moves, although that is partly why he gives that impression, his weight shifting restlessly from foot to foot. \"I feel like I'm dangling from a coat hanger, with my toes scraping and kicking at the ground,\" he writes in his excellent autobiography, Lucky Man, describing the effects of Parkinson's disease, which for more than two decades now has racked his body.</p><p>What really gives him the appearance of a readying boxer is the look in his eyes. Whenever Fox meets someone for the first time, he slips on this look as instinctively as others shuck on a jacket when they leave the house. It is&nbsp;a&nbsp;proud and confrontational look, honed from 20 years of dealing with people's initial reaction to him, stricken at what has happened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/aug/31/the-10-best-time-travellers\" title=\"\">Marty McFly</a>, who once moved with such grace on a skateboard.</p><p>\"Hi, thanks so much for coming,\" he murmurs, his right arm swinging out to grab my hand. We are exactly the same height – 5ft 4in (1.63 metres) – and he looks me straight in the eye for a few seconds before leading me into his office, which is decorated with Emmy awards, classic guitars (Johnny B Goode!) and photos of him and his wife Tracy Pollan and their four children.</p><p>\"Is the chair OK? Right, so …\" he says, sitting on the sofa and looking up,&nbsp;ready.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107805'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904961767/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the comedy Spin City, which he left in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue.</figcaption></figure><p>The reason Fox has agreed to endure this journalist's reaction to him is because he is promoting his new sitcom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/28/michael-j-fox-parkinsons-disease-sitcom\" title=\"\">The Michael J Fox Show</a>. It is his first since he left the highly lauded Spin City in 2000 when his Parkinson's made it too complicated to continue. Although Fox is best known internationally for his films – Back to the Future, Teen Wolf, Doc Hollywood – he&nbsp;has always been TV gold in America. He was launched to fame on the hugely successful 1980s sitcom Family Ties as Alex P Keaton, the Republican son of hippie parents. Since leaving Spin City, Fox has appeared in several TV shows to great acclaim, including his friend Denis Leary's show Rescue Me (for which he won an Emmy), The Good Wife, Boston Legal, Scrubs and, most amusingly, as himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm, in which Larry David accuses him of exaggerating his Parkinson's symptoms to annoy him (\"I thought I was the sickest guy on this block but you're the new champ,\" Fox replies.) American networks vied fiercely for Fox's new show and it is difficult to walk for more than two blocks in New York without seeing a giant advert for the 22-episode series. It is an extraordinary achievement for a&nbsp;52-year-old man who was told when he was 30 that he would be lucky if he could still work when he was 40. He takes special pride in having defied the doctors' prognosis, just as he would once defy school sports coaches who would look at his slight build and pick him last for a team: \"If you pick me last, I will do everything I can to make you look like a fool,\" he says.</p><p>The show tells the story of Mike&nbsp;Henry, a news anchor who retired five years previously because of Parkinson's and has now decided to return to work. It is an avowedly traditional sitcom and, judging from the pilot, it hasn't quite figured out how to let Fox display the sparkiness and bite in which he always excelled as a comic actor. But for those of us who grew up watching Fox, it is a&nbsp;joy to see him working again, and it is a sentiment he echoes.</p><p>\"Denis [Leary] told me after I did Curb that I should get back to work, and I&nbsp;wanted to, to create a world and entertain people. There is also a satisfaction in knowing that maybe you're doing something bigger, but that's not for me to ponder. However, if&nbsp;the show does cure humanity's ills, that's cool,\" he says drily.</p><p>But Fox clearly set out to make some points about Parkinson's through the show (as well as being the star, he is the executive producer.) It is repeatedly emphasised that, while the public sees&nbsp;his character Mike purely as a man with Parkinson's, applauding whenever he enters a room, Mike's family does not. They make no allowances for him, grabbing food from under his nose that he is too slow to eat, and that is just what he wants.</p><p>\"A lot of times, people who are in a health situation become the observed patient and other people project their own feelings on to them: 'No, you're too tired to go there,' 'No, you don't want that.' But I don't want to make my&nbsp;life more complicated by accepting other people's projections of me, or making my own projections about how they should deal with me,\" he says, reaching for a water bottle, which he wrestles with studied practice towards his mouth.</p><p>His children have never known him without Parkinson's: his son was born in 1989, two years before his diagnosis, his twin daughters were born in 1995 and his youngest daughter was born in 2001. \"So for them, it's just part of the household. If you asked my kids to describe me, they'd go through a whole list of words before even thinking about Parkinson's. And honestly, I&nbsp;don't think about it that much either. I talk about it because it's there, but it's not my totality,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107806'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380905081768/Michael-J-Fox-008.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>With his wife, actor Tracy Pollan, last month. Photograph: Jeff Vespa/WireImage</figcaption></figure><p>The pilot also stresses that Mike and his wife have a&nbsp;very happy physical relationship, showing them scampering into the bedroom and frequently touching one another. Was this a point Fox wanted to&nbsp;make clear to the public?</p><p>\"Yeah, it's important. When people ask me about my relationship with my wife, I say that it all depends who's the agent of motion at that time. But other than that it's all good,\" he replies, and although his face can't quite make the smile, the grin is in his voice.</p><p>Fox is still as boyishly handsome as he was when he appeared in Back to the Future at the age of 24, and the voice is the same one that once begged Doc Brown to return him to 1985. Born and raised in Canada in a military family where money wasn't plentiful, Fox started acting in his teens, partly for fun and partly for the cash. He has not needed the money in a long time, and he writes in his book about how much luckier he has been than most early-onset Parkinson's patients, who suffer crippling financial problems when they are forced out of work.</p><p>The&nbsp;first 20 minutes or so when we sit&nbsp;down are when he is at his most unsteady, and twitches and cramps roll&nbsp;through his body like water rolling over a rocky riverbed. After he was diagnosed with Parkinson's, he hid his&nbsp;illness from the public for years and he still sometimes tries to incorporate his tremors into seemingly deliberate gestures: an arm in sudden spasm will be forced upwards as though he simply meant to smooth his hair. Yet he never loses his strand of thought, and even if he struggles to find a word occasionally, he always gets it in the end.</p><p>His mental alertness is so vivid that I&nbsp;soon don't notice the physical shifts, which eventually calm from waves to&nbsp;small ripples anyway. He is also extremely funny and, as Fox says himself, the best way to overturn pity is to find the humour. When I ask him whether the secret to his and his wife's happy 25-year marriage is love or friendship, he replies without missing a beat: \"Regular animal sacrifices.\" When I later tell him that he looks in great shape, he replies with an audible wink: \"I move around a lot, you know.\"</p><p>Although Fox insists, \"I never set out to be heroic\", he knows that he is,&nbsp;nonetheless, the public face of Parkinson's. In the past, some people with the condition have criticised him&nbsp;for appearing on talkshows after taking his medication, thereby not showing the true effects of the illness. At the other extreme, radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh displayed the ignorance and cruelty for which he is so handsomely paid when he mocked Fox in 2006 for \"exaggerating the effects of the disease\" when he appeared in a political advert unmedicated. Does he feel conflicted about how best to present the disease to the public?</p><p>\"No, not at all. I take the medication for myself so I can transact, not for anyone else. But I am aware that it is empowering for people to see what I&nbsp;do and, for the most part, people in the Parkinson's community are just really happy that Parkinson's is getting mentioned, and not in a pitying way,\" he replies.</p><p>Fox has an absolute horror of being pitied and that is almost certainly another factor in his return to work.</p><p>\"Because of all the things I've done, nobody pities me, and that's great. I&nbsp;couldn't stand it,\" he says.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107807'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904795095/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='200' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>As Marty McFly in the 1985 film Back to the Future. Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>Some people might have wanted a bit of pity if they were diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 30 with a young family, I say. He shakes his head sharply: \"Pity is just another form of abuse.\"</p><p>This determination to control the reaction to his illness also lies behind his well-known optimism. As the title to his autobiography makes clear, he considers getting Parkinson's \"a gift\", albeit \"one that keeps on taking\", and he has been an unflappable advocate in&nbsp;finding a cure. His eponymous foundation has raised more than $350m to fund research into Parkinson's and despite facing hurdles that would fell many – the Bush administration's opposition to stem cell research, for example – he has continued with determined equanimity. It took a few years to find this optimism and when he was first diagnosed he used to \"punch and pummel\" his arm when it started twitching. But these days, he is full of epigrams about looking on the bright side and some of his phrases feel as worn down as an ocean-tossed pebble, smoothed through years of repetition to reporters, his family, himself: \"You get what you get and you don't get upset\", \"It is what it is.\" He knows that some people might doubt the veracity of his attitude: \"But all my happy talk and rah-rah cheering, that's as real as someone else's anger. I chose not to choose anger,\" he says.</p><p>It was really his wife who helped him to make that choice. Fox and Pollan met when she played his girlfriend on Family Ties and he was helplessly smitten when she told him off one day for being rude. They got married in 1988.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tracy, I don't doubt that. People picture Tracy as this paragon of stoicism, this long-suffering wife, and that's all bullshit. This is my situation and she deals with it, and I never feel like, 'I'm sorry you have to put up with this' – it's nothing like that. When I told her about the Parkinson's I said to her, 'Are you in for this?' and she said, 'I'm in for it.' And that was it. It was still a struggle but that was a really great moment. She is so funny and she puts up with my happy idiot persona.\" Also, he adds with a look of delight, \"She is so HOT! Sometimes I look at her and I&nbsp;just can't believe it!\"</p><p>Fox has the tendency of those who have been through therapy to look at his past and see patterns and answers. As a celebrity, he grew used to the staring, the whispering, the sense of a&nbsp;loss of a control. When, in the late 80s, his drinking was getting out of hand (\"I&nbsp;come from a Canadian background: you drink to the point of saturation\"), he employed the same tools to dry up that he would later use to cope with Parkinson's: \"Accepting your powerlessness with grace.\"</p><p>So fame and alcoholism helped prepare him for Parkinson's?</p><p>\"Exactly. It was perfect.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419107808'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/4/1380904631733/Michael-J-Fox-001.jpg' alt='Michael J Fox' width='460' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>In the 1985 film Teen Wolf. Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</figcaption></figure><p>When Fox was first diagnosed with Parkinson's, after noticing his little finger twitching during the filming of Doc Hollywood, he was at a tricky point in his career. Family Ties and the Back to the Future franchise had ended and he, along with many other 80s teen idols, was realising that audiences were not so sure if they wanted to see him play a grownup. He grabbed any role he could, appearing in the underrated The Hard Way and the more successful but less smart Doc Hollywood. When he was diagnosed he decided to appear only in things he actually liked, starting with a return to TV in Spin City and doing the voiceover in Stuart Little. Would he have been able to step back if he hadn't become ill?</p><p>\"I don't think so – there was too much ego going on. I also don't think I&nbsp;could have curtailed my drinking without [the diagnosis], and maybe my wife and I would have drifted apart because of that. I don't know.\" This is why he believes getting Parkinson's was a gift. But while he no longer resents getting the disease, he definitely wants to find the cure.</p><p>Fox has spoken in the past with moving certainty about the likelihood of a cure being found imminently and how he plans to \"dance at my children's weddings\". Does he still think about&nbsp;it?</p><p>\"Finding a cure? I don't view that as&nbsp;something that will happen in my lifetime,\" he says.</p><p>I'm astonished at this crack in the optimism. Really?</p><p>He looks, for the first time, a little sad: \"That's – that's not my purpose, to find a cure for myself, and that's not noble of me, that's just the way it goes. But I know somebody will one day figure it out,\" he says, and he takes another drink of water.</p><p>Fox's office is on the ground floor of the Upper East Side apartment building where he lives with his family. It is&nbsp;a rarefied, leafy neighbourhood, peppered with museums and private schools, just two blocks from where his wife lived as a child, and he clearly loves being a part of her world, which is so far from the one in which he grew up. When he talks about his wife's childhood, I mention that I, too, grew up a few blocks away.</p><p>\"What school did you go to?\" he immediately asks, like the New York dad he is.</p><p>I mention a nearby school and his eyes pop happily: \"That's where my girls went!\" I try to return to asking questions about him, but he's not having any of it: \"So you're one of those girls! Now I get it. Wow!\" he grins and looks at me in an almost paternal way. He proceeds to reel off the names of teachers I'd long forgotten: \"Did you have her? She was quite imperious and frightening.\"</p><p>At the end of our time together, I ask him for something that I have never before asked of an interviewee: a photo. He cheerfully agrees and slings an arm over my shoulders as I fumble with my phone. Afterwards he forces his arms around my body, cradling me with fatherly care. Back outside I&nbsp;look down at my phone. In each of the pictures, his face is&nbsp;slightly blurred due to the tremors. But his gaze never wavers and his eyes stare straight back at the viewer, hard and clear and bright.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419099563|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|c26faa9a024db4f5843e25d8caacae765a8e1c54 -->",

        "headline":"On my radar: Ayub Khan-Din's cultural highlights",
        "body":"<p>Ayub Khan-Din began his career as an actor, starring in the 1987 film <em>Sammy and Rosie Get Laid</em>, and making small screen appearances in soaps such as <em>Coronation Street </em>during the 1990s. Born in Salford, his experience of growing up in a British-Pakistani family inspired his first stage play, <em>East Is East</em>, which was nominated for a Laurence Olivier award in 1998. The following year saw the release of the critically acclaimed film adaptation, with a sequel, <em>West is West,</em> in 2010.  His latest adaptation brings ER Braithwaite's novel, <em>To Sir, With Love</em>, to the stage and is touring the UK.</p><h2><strong>Qawwali Flamenco by Faiz Ali Faiz, Duquende, Miguel Poveda and Chicuelo</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096167'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883894394/Faiz-Ali-Faiz.-001.jpg' alt='Faiz Ali Faiz.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Faiz Ali Faiz. Photograph: Stephanie Paschal/Rex</figcaption></figure><p>I love the passion in flamenco and qawwali music. There are many similarities between the two. I've seen both [genres] played live individually, but never on the same stage. I listen to music all the time, especially when I am working.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/fiction.features2\">Family Matters by Rohinton Mistry</a></strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096168'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883924919/Rohinton-Mistry.-001.jpg' alt='Rohinton Mistry.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rohinton Mistry. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I love this book because it gives you a real taste of life within the Parsi community of Mumbai. I lived for about five months in Mumbai and the book is written about the period which I was there, so it brings back lots of memories. I love Indian writers because they all have such a strong influence on the areas of India that they come from and for me, as a writer, it's almost like a shorthand to be able to revisit those places. Rohinton Mistry writes fantastic dialogue as well, so you really get a sense of the personalities on the page.</p><h2><strong>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096169'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380885111581/The-Metropolitan-Museum-o-001.jpg' alt='The Metropolitan Museum of Art.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Photograph: Brooks Walker</figcaption></figure><p>I had a musical on Broadway in which I had to take over the lead part because, after the second performance, my leading actor fell down some steps, damaged his arm and couldn't go on. Either the show folded and lost over a million dollars or I took over. I ended up taking over for the whole run, so I was in New York for three or four months. I went to the Metropolitan Museum, which I thought was absolutely amazing. You could spend weeks going around the exhibits there. They've got this whole Egyptian temple (the Temple of Dendur) that they managed to save when the Aswan Dam was built, which I thought might be dull but they've done it so well.</p><h2><strong>Granada, Spain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096170'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380883955970/The-Alhambra-in-Granada-S-001.jpg' alt='The Alhambra in Granada, Spain.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Photograph: Miguel Angel Molina/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>This is my local city. It's a stunning place to visit – I'd recommend it to anybody. They have the Alhambra, within which there's another palace where they have open-air concerts right through the year. We went to see a Spanish guitarist play there. Below the Alhambra there's the old Moorish town, a place called Albayzín, which is a maze of streets like you'd find in a North African souk.</p><h2><strong>Pippin at the Music Box Theatre, New York</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096171'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884186784/The-cast-of-Broadways-Pip-001.jpg' alt='The cast of Broadway's Pippin.' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The cast of Broadway's Pippin. Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Pippin is an old musical which was on in the 1970s, but they've just redone it. The producer who worked on my musical (Bunty Berman Presents) produced this one as well. They've updated it and Cirque du Soleil play a major part in it. We took our kids along and it just blew their minds. I was never liked musicals at drama school, and when I told my friends I'd written one which was going on Broadway they laughed their heads off.</p><h2><strong>Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life, Tate Britain</strong><br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419096172'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/10/4/1380884069042/The-Fever-Van-1935-by-LS--001.jpg' alt='The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry.' width='220' height='178' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Fever Van, 1935, by LS Lowry. Photograph: Walker Art Gallery/Tate</figcaption></figure><p>I grew up in Salford, [home of the] original gallery where most of the paintings were kept. It was a big old Victorian gallery with peeling paint. As young as 11 or 12, I used to go there and spend hours looking at the paintings, so it was great to see them in this exhibition, with a new appreciation of his work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419005195|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|31891dbeac36051d312f85d7aa52855d28a0a9ac -->",

        "body":"<p>It hadn't occurred to me that there might be any issues attached to this Royal Exchange co-production with the black-led theatre company <a href=\"http://www.talawa.com/\" title=\"\">Talawa </a> of American playwright Arthur Miller's 1947 play. Then I read the correspondence on <a href=\"http://www.royalexchange.co.uk/event.aspx?id=717\" title=\"\">the Exchange's website</a>. People wondered whether the play would have to be directorially adjusted to accommodate a non-white cast. As far as I could see, Michael Buffong (who directed the award-winning production of Lorraine Hansberry's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/14/raisin-in-the-sun-hansberry\" title=\"\"><em>A Raisin in the Sun</em></a> for the Exchange in 2010) has made no changes to the text, nor were any necessary: skin colour is not Miller's theme; ideological orientation is.</p><p>A small businessman discovers that, to be fully human, he must look beyond the narrow limits of making money for his immediate family. In Miller's work, there is such a thing as society and we are all answerable to it. (I wonder: how many of the supposedly arts-loving Conservative party thronging the city visited the theatre during their conference visit?)When Don Warrington's Joe is finally forced to acknowledge that the strangers destroyed by his self-protective self-interest are \"all my sons\", the production reaches an intensity that fuses his statement into a declaration that is both emotionally wrenching and rationally convincing. Warrington is tremendous in this last act. So are Doña Croll, his ghost-haunted wife, and Chiké Okonkwo, his upright but blinkered surviving son. Each shatters the accretions of lies that have carapaced their characters with devastating precision.</p><p>On press night, the first two acts were less assured. Ellen Carins's set looks good, with its clapboard porch, garden benches and fallen apple tree (symbolically hinting at the lies that thread the play). But the dappled green lawn of the yard seemed too big for the actors, who fidgeted about trying to hit a collective rhythm. In a cast of 10, eight were making a first appearance at this demanding theatre in the round. It felt as if, as a company, they hadn't yet quite mastered the space. Hence, three stars on our new rating system. Given the quality of individual performances, though, I would expect that, by the time this review is published, it will be four (or more?).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983312|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|71b3cf55c26f594a4c9250e2b2069159d02ce96e -->",

It’s 1997 and New York’s Manhattan Island has been converted into a maximum-security stockade surrounded by a 50ft “containment wall”. When Air Force One crash-lands and the president is captured by prisoners, special forces soldier-turned-bank-robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to get him out. Russell’s dry-witted, one-eyed antihero is the role of a lifetime, while the film’s look – high-tech police state outside, semi-destroyed cityscape inside – was partly created by a young James Cameron, then a special-effects artist, and proved hugely influential.",

Other homegrown highlights include Cath Staincliffe poking around Manchester's criminal underbelly, meanwhile, among the visiting names there is Neil Gaiman on his pirates-and-dinosaurs kids' adventure, and other highlights are ballet dancer-turned-writer Carlos Acosta, and Lionel Shriver who authors this year's Manchester Sermon.</p><p><strong><em>Various venues, Mon to 20 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>AB</em></p><h2>Yam Yam!, London</h2><p>Mixing food with theatre isn't for everyone, and those who tut at the unwrapping of a humbug probably won't have much fun here. But the combination makes perfect sense when trying to engage with audiences beyond the stage door and this festival uses creative imagination to do just that. There is a history of fried chicken to peruse, as well as cooking workshops that take in cuisine from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Plus, Jan Blake presents his stories about Mali, which should make for a delicious literary treat.</p><p><strong><em>The Albany, SE8, Sun to 16 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>FlipSide festival, Snape</h2><p>Rural Suffolk may not be the most obvious location for a festival of Brazilian literature, but that makes this weekend event all the more intriguing and appealing. Born out of a small Brazilian literary gathering called FLIP, this intimate festival presents Adriana Calcanhotto in concert tonight, preluded by Will Self in conversation with Bernardo Carvalho. British novelist Ian McEwan also talks with Milton Hatoum about his love of Brazil, his work and his inspirations.</p><p><strong><em>Snape Maltings, Sat &amp; Sun</em></strong></p><p><em>IA</em></p><h2>Out &amp; about</h2><p><a href=\"http://powderhamfoodfestival.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Powderham food festival</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Devon foodies are joined by TVs Incredible Spice Men, Tony Singh and Cyrus Todiwala, who can tell their bhunas from their bhajis.</p><p><em>Powderham Castle, Saturday</em></p><p><a href=\"http://london.vegfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Veg Fest UK</strong></a><strong>, London, Saturday &amp; Sunday</strong></p><p>London leg of the huge herbivore gathering which features food (duh) plus comedy sets from Dave Spikey and the excellent Andrew O'Neill.</p><p><em>Olympia, W14</em></p><p><a href=\"http://cupararts.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cupar arts festival</strong></a><strong>, Saturday to 17 Oct</strong></p><p>Annual arts shindig in the Scottish market town; including art inspired by porridge oats.

        "body":"<p>Over-exposure has been a hot topic in pop discourse of late. Anyone holding Haim's current media ubiquity against them, though, might do well to contemplate the stranglehold on tittle-tattle and moral outrage exercised by one singer from Tennessee. She is currently embroiled in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\">ugly exchange with Sinéad O'Connor</a> over her raunchy image. Those easily shocked by calculation in pop should look away now.</p><p>Last spring, Miley Cyrus dropped a song called We Can't Stop. In tandem with its <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/miley-cyrus/we-cant-stop-music-video/1923501/\" title=\"\">ribald video</a>, it did unspeakable things to the memory of Hannah Montana, the tween star once played by Cyrus. A party anthem, this album's lead single endorses ecstasy (\"dancing with Molly\") and twerking, essentially the 21st-century US urban version of \"slack\" Jamaican dancehall moves. If the song sounds like a Rihanna number, <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1566461/miley-cyrus-we-cant-stop-originally-intended-for-rihanna\" title=\"\">that's because it nearly was</a>. When Cyrus twerked at MTV's Video Music awards back in August, <a href=\"http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125139/Miley-Cyrus-Raunchy-VMAs-Performance-Helps-Star-Gain-213104-Twitter-Followers-And-Sell-90000-Downloads\" title=\"\">her social media profile increased 112%</a>, according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine. Then there was the video for Wrecking Ball, a power-ballad turbo-charged by the fact that Cyrus is starkers for much of the video, sometimes licking a mallet.</p><p>To coincide with the release of <em>Bangerz</em>, her fourth album, MTV US screened a documentary, <em>Miley Cyrus: The Movement</em>, that purported to show how <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/articles/mtv-miley-cyrus-the-movement-documentary/\" title=\"\">this brouhaha has been gleefully choreographed by a stage brat-turned-wild child</a>, one with a gimlet eye on the big time, whose last album – 2010's <em>Can't Be Tamed</em> – pretty much flopped. When it's not an almighty attention-seeking device, <em>Bangerz</em> is an album about very public heartbreak. In an announcement that chimed fortuitously with the build-up to <em>Bangerz</em>'s release, it was recently confirmed that Cyrus's four-year relationship with actor Liam Hemsworth is no more.</p><p>Against big odds, this craven album actually begins with the calm musical resolution of Adore You, a bid for the listener's sympathy, and one of its least showy and most successful cuts. Here are unhurried beats, a few chords and Cyrus's languorous vocal, \"ah\"-ing and \"hey\"-ing into a song about power imbalance in love.</p><p>As the title suggests, another heartbreak track, FU, is less resolved, but just as interesting. Here, Cyrus liberates her inner Christina Aguilera in the company of rapper French Montana, blending old-time jazzy balladry, I Put a Spell on You, romantic righteousness and dubstep sub-bass. Including recent US No 1 Wrecking Ball, the heartbreak section of <em>Bangerz</em> mostly repays your attention. More intriguing genre experiments follow – not least My Darlin', essentially a pimped-up version of Ben E King's Stand By Me.</p><p>But for all the mash-ups, <em>Bangerz</em> feels stitched together in the dark, and the attention-seeking begins to grate. Setting aside the sexual content of Cyrus's recent oeuvre, the crux of the internet chat has been her new fetish for R&amp;B and southern hip-hop. This really is not the first time a Southern white singer has appropriated poses first developed in African-American contexts (Elvis, Justin Timblerlake), or, indeed, the first time a former teen pop starlet has turned to R&amp;B for a raunchy style reboot (Aguilera, Britney Spears). Pharrell Williams, who mentored Cyrus through the project, is sympathetic (\"Why is she twerking?… She's a product of America,\" he says), but others feel uncomfortable with the <a href=\"http://www.waywordradio.org/ghetto_pass/\" title=\"\">\"ghetto pass\"</a> Cyrus has issued herself, like so much fake ID.</p><p>It might be a different story if many of the hip-hop- and R&amp;B-inspired cuts were better. SMS (Bangerz) is a bad rip-off of Salt-N-Pepa's Push It, with a phoned-in Britney guest spot. Love Money Party, meanwhile, finds Cyrus rapping a series of non-sequitur buzzwords, gibberish loosely connected by a bit of production, driven by the inescapable purpose of <em>Bangerz</em>: a desire to wind people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418843838|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|1f929e1460db89c9886c3e9959f68202aa838e4c -->",

        "body":"<p>Around the dinner table are three couples in their 30s and 40s. They are treechangers, quite possibly – we're in Healesville, after all, the Yarra Valley beauty spot that has leached artists, food lovers, wine makers, artisans, organic gardeners and young families from Melbourne's suburbs.</p><p>Tonight's dinner will come from a whole cow, purchased by one family and shared with others who might appreciate the journey it has taken from pasture to plate. The cow was to be slaughtered and butchered in front of the group but the mobile butcher has stuck his knife into the carcass, only to messily slice his hand open. Finally he returns from the emergency department. &quot;My God,&quot; one guest quakes. &quot;What would we have done if he hadn't come back?&quot;</p><p>This is the premise of The Beast, <a href=\"http://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/2013-mainstage/the-beast/\">Eddie Perfect's new play for the Melbourne Theatre Company</a>. Having been a guest at that very dinner party (&quot;a great dinner party, I hasten to add&quot;) the idea of the beautiful life and death planned for the animal being botched at the final moment – appealed greatly to his impish gene. &quot;What chain reaction would that set off in the lives of these middle-class people, when the best of intentions go astray?&quot; he wonders.</p><p>Perfect is skilled at taking an element of Australia's social status quo and overhauling it just brutally enough to make audiences squirm. From his stand-up career, to the much-lauded Shane Warne the Musical and the recent album and tour <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8crVin5mC4 \">with musical comedy act Tripod</a>, he wears his love of satire on his sleeve.</p><p>And the stand-up, musician and actor seems decidedly unworried by dumping on his own doorstep. Not only might his friends in Healesville take umbrage – not least because none of the fictional guests have any redeemable features – but the Beast pillories a fair slice of MTC attendees (and Guardian readers), who are his very audience. &quot;But that's me, too,&quot; he protests. &quot;I treechanged and a lot of my life is in this play – it was quite cathartic, really.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-418800361\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380615137478/Eddie-Perfect-008.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Perfect\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Eddie Perfect as Mick Holland with Kat Stewart as Billie in Ten's Offspring. Photograph: Network Ten</figcaption></figure><p>Growing up in the blandly white Melbourne beach suburb of Mentone, the son of two high school teachers, resulted in Perfect's morbid fascination with being middle class. &quot;With my generation it's not just about money any more,&quot; he philosophises. &quot;Currency can be about creating things or being an entrepreneur. The coding of what it takes to belong and climb to the next rung is very complicated.&quot;</p><p>He says he's intrigued with what brings friends together. &quot;Sometimes it's because there's history and there's nothing you can do about it; sometimes it's because it's advantageous to your career; or because they've got drugs; or because they can get you a job; or because they're your wife's friends; or they've got kids – that's a new one for me.&quot;</p><p>Perfect and his wife, Lucy, have two young daughters, Kitty and Lottie Lux – although his role as struggling musician Mick Holland in Ten's Offspring has also brought with it a number of fans who might wish he was less happily settled. Is the Green Room, Helpmann and Melbourne International Comedy Festival award-winner concerned that Mick might become <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfDI2ZjXwK8 \">his Khe Sanh</a>?</p><p>&quot;Khe Sanh would be better – you'd get royalties out of it,&quot; he notes. &quot;It's been really, really good doing Offspring, for a raft of reasons, but I've never really heard anyone say, 'Hey, Mick.' Playing Warnie seems to have been more of a signifier.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OoOtbBQw5E \">Shane Warne the Musical</a>, the production he wrote, composed and starred in, debuted in 2008, toured the country and returned, updated, with a full orchestra in 2013. Perfect picked the cricketer as a subject because he polarises opinion and agitates the tabloids.</p><p>&quot;I really wanted to take care of Shane,&quot; he says. &quot;I was never interested in tearing somebody down. That would be a very negative reality to live in – I was writing the show for three years.&quot;</p><p>Perfect's aim was to allow people to get behind the headlines and see the human side to a tabloid caricature. &quot;Then people can't help but identify with him. He represents everything that's exciting and inspiring about Australia, as well as everything that's embarrassing and cringeworthy.</p><p>&quot;Australians have a real hero system where success isn't the important part – it's more about giving it a go. Everything from Ned Kelly to Gallipoli is about epic failure done with a lot of spunk. The person dies but the subversive spirit lives on.&quot;</p><p>Having borne the brunt of his own media backlash with a song about <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/show-mocks-irwins-death/story-e6freoof-1111112470625 \">Steve Irwin in Babes in the Wood</a> at the Malthouse in 2006 (he points out that 'Die What You Love Doing' was a dig at press headlines, not at Irwin), he's all too aware that people can interpret his work differently.</p><p>The Beast, which stars Tom Budge, Travis Cotton and Virginia Gay, doesn't target people wanting to do good, but those who use causes to boost their social status. He cites armchair activists clicking &quot;Like&quot; on Facebook campaigns and hitting a button on online petitions. &quot;It's tokenism that makes people feel that they are active in the world. But are they? Being able to think in these ways at all is a luxury that we have because of our wealth. We're all complicit in having this huge amount of wealth when most of the world lives in abject poverty.&quot;</p><p>Outside of work, Perfect swears he's not the sort to play devil's advocate. &quot;I'm interested in all different perspectives. Like most people I have a gut reaction to stuff and it takes me a while to work out why. I'm not a big arguer. When I'm emotional I tend to close down because if I spoke it would not be articulate, because I haven't processed why I'm having a reaction.&quot;</p><p>What it all comes down to, he concludes, is this: &quot;Can the ethical things we choose to do ever come close to wiping away the sin of inequality that we live with every day?&quot; And since it's a quandary that continues to make Perfect feel uncomfortable, it's a good bet that The Beast will get under its audience's skin, too.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/2013-mainstage/the-beast/\">• The Beast plays at MTC from October 3 to November 9.</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418798800|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|9e202874161ed17673efc024c8f0a0656d8db1a9 -->",

        "headline":"Funny, crafty women make a serious point about our expectations of art",
        "body":"<p>Adrienne Doig&rsquo;s work is pretty damn funny. Her <a href=\"http://www.martinbrownecontemporary.com/doig13.html\">exhibition</a> Splendid at Martin Browne Contemporary in Sydney is a show of self-portraits: at times the artist appears with her back turned, or just her smart red shoes visible; at others she holds up signs in the manner of Wile E Coyote from those old Warner Bros. cartoons: SPLENDID, GOOD ENOUGH and VERY INTERESTING. In one, the most telling perhaps, Doig carries a placard that reads FEMINIST CLICHE.</p> <p>Doig&rsquo;s chosen medium is fabric, and her techniques include applique, patchwork and embroidery. Having sourced unfinished patchwork projects from eBay that dated to the 1930s and 40s, she uses them as her base, overlaying images of herself, often in full figure, posing against the intense patterns, her eyes affixed defiantly at the viewer, or away at something more interesting. The feminist cliche bit is presumably Doig&rsquo;s acknowledgement that a focus on handicrafts and other &ldquo;women&rsquo;s work&rdquo; folk arts has long been a way for female artists to make a statement about the cultural prejudices held against &ldquo;arts and crafts&rdquo;.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s a good humour in Doig&rsquo;s work that defuses polemic into something more approachable and kind-hearted. Yet that feminist philosophy remains. Even if they have a degree of irony, these are still works that many would consider to be more craft than art and given the long history of artists who have defied that categorisation, it&rsquo;s interesting that it is the decorative quality of the work which is seen to define it as &ldquo;not serious&rdquo;.</p> <p>When Del Kathryn Barton <a href=\"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2013/\">won the 2013 Archibald prize</a> this year for hugo, a portrait of Hugo Weaving, a common refrain echoing across social media was that the work was &ldquo;decorative&rdquo; and thus not worthy of serious consideration. Whether the work is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is a whole other issue &ndash; but the response was a reminder of the antiquated values that are placed on the techniques and styles of contemporary art making. Serious art can be many things, but not decorative.</p> <p>&ldquo;Decorative&rdquo; is a poorly defined term, but it is usually equated with work that displays conspicuous craft skill, has probably taken many hours to complete, and it has distinctive and obvious attractive qualities. Both Barton and Doig&rsquo;s work have exactly those qualities. In addition, when Barton first won the Archibald prize in 2008, it was also with a <a href=\"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2008/\">self-portrait</a>, which included her two children. And when it comes to serious art, mothers and their kids won&rsquo;t do.</p> <p>Doig&rsquo;s show coincides with <a href=\"http://www.brendamaygallery.com.au/details.php?exhibitionID=196\">Sugar Sugar</a>, a group show at Brenda May Gallery also in Sydney. Curated by Megan Fizell, this is a 10-woman show where all the works are created using sugar, many taking the shape of other &ldquo;non-serious&rdquo; art forms &ndash; cakes, jewellery, flower-arranging and cameos. The works themselves are mostly conceptual pieces that play on the idea of transience, value and permanence, given their limited shelf life.</p> <p>Among the pieces are Matina Bourmas&rsquo;s performance <a href=\"http://www.brendamaygallery.com.au/enlarge_ex.php?workID=36547&amp;exhibitionID=196\">Gifting</a> where the artist, using cake icing, applies delicate doily-like patterns to the gallery walls (daily 2.30-3pm) and Stephanie Jones&rsquo;s series The Traceries, that uses royal icing in petri dishes to create minutely patterned cameos. Janet Tavener has made <a href=\"http://www.feastingonart.com/2013/09/janet-tavener-asparagus-pie.html\">fake cakes</a> using sugar paste and food colouring and Claire McArdle presents jewellery made from gold and chocolate. Judith Klausner&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.brendamaygallery.com.au/enlarge_ex.php?workID=36277&amp;exhibitionID=196\">Oreo Cameo</a>&nbsp;series presents classic cameos carved from the chocolate cookies, the classicism of their style ironically undercut by their ephemeral nature.</p> <p>The work in both Sugar Sugar and in Doig&rsquo;s exhibition knowingly play with values and expectations, putting these traditionally female craft skills into the context of a contemporary art exhibition. It may not do much to alter the deeply ingrained prejudices of apparently open-minded viewers of art but it&rsquo;s nice to be reminded of how arbitrary our value system is.</p> <p>The heretical notion that even those highest of high art forms such as photography, minimalist painting and sculpture could be just as easily considered decor as brainy and high falutin&rsquo; intellectualism, pretty much neutralises the non-serious tag for decorative work. A <a href=\"http://www.55sydenhamrd.com/marilyn-schneider\">show</a> by Marilyn Schneider looked for all the world like a very serious investigation of abstract sculpture &ndash; and while it was that, it was also a canny piece of appropriation. Schneider&rsquo;s work had taken the look and feel of corporate signage used at trade fairs and, out of context, she had created an elegant but ambiguous object that was neither art nor craft. If corporate signage isn&rsquo;t the ultimate example of the decorative, then what is?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418602729|2013-10-07T10:21:29Z|3944280cb38d13f4d87d98061c8b26e72de882d3 -->",
