It is difficult to make an exact comparison between the two years because all seats in the London boroughs, where Ukip struggles, were up for election.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, was fighting off a challenge to his leadership from the left of his party as Labour and the Tories moved to win back Ukip voters. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, said he aimed to halve the amount of time for which EU migrants can claim benefits.</p><p>The former shadow home secretary David Davis called on the prime minister to bring forward the date of his planned EU referendum by a year to 2016.</p><p>Frank Field, the Labour former welfare reform minister, warned his party would suffer permanent damage unless it acknowledged the concerns of voters on immigration as he said that Ukip could lead to a \"permanent balkanisation of the old two-party system\".</p><p>Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, will move to show he acknowledges the threat posed by Ukip on Tuesday when he visits the marginal constituency of Thurrock, where his party lost control of the council after a strong showing by Farage's party. Douglas Alexander, the Labour election co-ordinator, has faced criticism for playing down the Ukip threat on the grounds that a strong showing by the party would disadvantage the Tories.</p><p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, underlined the irritation in the shadow cabinet that the Labour leadership had failed to campaign on immigration early enough when he said the party needed to speak more loudly on the issue.</p><p>Field warned Labour could suffer permanent damage unless it reached out to voters attracted by Ukip's message on immigration.</p><p>He said: \"Ukip's success is a major signpost on the road to the permanent balkanisation of the old two-party system … We have yet to notice that Ukip has transformed itself in the last few months from being an anti-EU party to one opposed to the current scale of immigration. Labour has yet to convince its core vote or ex-core vote that it has an answer on this score.</p><p>\"Our [policy] review needs to present key policies that give us a new narrative that the centre-left voter wants to hear as opposed to what we want to tell them. If this chance is lost, to realign what Labour stands for, the outlook is grim. We will open up the possibility of a clear Tory win next year.\"</p><p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News on Sunday: \"We've got to do more to explain our policies and show them [voters] that we are on their side. And that is work in progress, more to do before the next election, but we are clearly moving in the right direction.\"</p><p>As part of the Tory response on immigration, Duncan Smith said he would halve – from six to three months – the amount time that EU migrants can claim benefits. He <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1414862.ece\" title=\"\">told the Sunday Times</a>: \"Before this year is out I intend to have reduced that six months to a three-month period of claim. That means you'll have to wait three months and you'll only be able to claim for three months. Then it's bye-bye. That's quite a significant tightening up.\"</p><p>But Theresa May, the home secretary, indicated on Sunday that the Tories had failed to win the agreement of their Lib Dem coalition partners, as she spoke of \"heated\" exchanges on immigration.</p><p>She told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: \"We're looking at a number of measures and it's no surprise to anybody that there have been some longstanding, possibly heated at times, discussions among the coalition on some of these issues on immigration.\"</p><p>The home secretary watered down the Tory commitment to bring down net migration to the tens of thousands by the general election, saying the proposal was now a long-term \"aim\".</p><p>May insisted progress had been made on reducing immigration, saying that 70,000 fewer people had emigrated to the UK last year than in 2010, when the coalition was formed. But she said the government was highly unlikely to meet the Tory target of cutting net migration by the time of the next general election because immigration had increased from within the EU.</p><p>\"We still have that aim of the tens of thousands, but of course it has become more difficult. Net migration is too high,\" said May. \"That is why I want to continue working to bring it down. What we see is in those areas which we can control, that is immigration from outside the EU, everything we have done as a government has been having an impact. And so we see that net migration from outside the EU is down to its lowest level since the late 1990s.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9086713","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-26T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098659","internalContentCode":"437775260","publication":"The

But as celebrations begin, their strategists should be feeling much less optimistic. Triumph in one battle will not end their war with Ukip. In Newark, the Conservatives launched a major ground offensive that involved every available minister. This is possible in a byelection but it will not be feasible at the general election where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-hitlist-20-seats-commons\" title=\"\">Ukip plans to target 20-30 seats</a>. Tory hopes of returning to power also hinge on Ukip's share of the national vote falling to less than 7%. Anything above this threatens indispensable marginal seats.</p><p>Here is the reality check for Conservatives: Ukip \"lost\" in Newark but is currently averaging twice that figure in Westminster polls (14%). Those who think one byelection has neutralised Ukip do not understand the realities of our system. So, with less than a year until the general election, what options do the Tories have to win the war?</p><p></p><h2>Option 1: continue with condemnation</h2><p>The default Conservative response to Ukip has been reflected in a tsunami of negative attacks. The exposure of unsavoury candidates, allegations of racism and attempts at character assassination of Nigel Farage can be traced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lynton-crosby\" title=\"\">Lynton Crosby</a>, the architect of Conservative strategy who is a veteran of battles with the far-right Pauline Hanson in Australia. Ukip members complain that Crosby is hell-bent on going for the party's jugular, and there are even rumours he has met leftwing anti-fascists who share his desire to discredit Ukip.</p><p>Critics of the strategy point to the fact that it failed to stop Ukip from winning the European elections and building local strongholds in key marginal seats. They also argue that the aggressive approach has merely entrenched Farage's image as a populist outsider, and tightened his bond with the 30% of voters who instinctively agree with Ukip. But others argue this misunderstands the strategy. It was never about winning back the 30% but was designed to build a barrier between Ukip and other voters who might have switched.</p><p>An early fear was that Farage might build a broader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a>-style anti-establishment rebellion, recruiting not just the left behind but disillusioned middle-class voters and disaffected youth who feel angry over capitalist excess and ignored by Westminster and Brussels. Imposing a lower ceiling on Ukip's potential was a priority: dampen its anti-system appeal, and frame Farage as an irresponsible xenophobe who lacks credible ideas, or as a hypocritical and expense-grabbing politician \"just like the rest of us\". At least that is the idea.</p><p></p><h2>Option 2: co-opt the message</h2><p>The obvious problem with option one is that it does little to reach Ukip's core voters who are more deprived and feel angry over immigration. If anything, it risks fuelling their anger. One popular idea for reconnecting with these voters is to co-opt Ukip's strident rhetoric on immigration – talk even tougher and promise more action. Some strategists are more nuanced, advocating a cultural (not just economic) response to anxieties over immigration. But either way, this option is risky on two fronts.</p><p>First, for Conservatives, it means trying to win back voters who they just spent months dismissing as racist bigots. This is one reason why most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/ukip-voters-loyal-nigel-farage-2015-labour-tory\" title=\"\">Ukip voters at the European elections intend to stay loyal in 2015</a>. Second, while Ukip's wavering voters are more concerned about the economy, its core voters are driven by immigration. By further turning up the volume on the latter issue, Tories risk strengthening the bond between Farage and his core base. The obvious way to go is to accept you might never win back Ukip's loyal voters and try to win over the wavering Ukippers by focusing on the economy. But few Conservatives seem interested in this approach.</p><p></p><h2>Option 3: resort to a tactical campaign </h2><p>The problems outlined above help explain why many are now resorting to a tactical response. One version is the \"vote Ukip get Miliband\" approach, which hopes that by raising the prospect of no EU referendum and more Labour-led immigration, Ukip voters will rally behind David Cameron. The other is to frame Ukip as a \"wasted vote\"; a party that can do nothing under the first-past-the-post voting system.

He said: \"When people see the comments I made, they will see that they're perfectly reasonable. I said I deprecated Russian actions in Ukraine and also its human rights record. I pointed out that the western press underestimated Putin and that's obviously true.\"</p><p>Salmond encountered a storm of protest after stating he admired \"certain aspects\" of Putin's politics and his restoration \"of a substantial part of Russian pride\" in an interview conducted on 14 March for the May edition of the men's magazine GQ with Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor.</p><p>Michael Ostapko, the Scottish chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said Ukrainians had made \"overwhelming comments [of] hurt, disgust, betrayal and astonishment\" and called for Salmond to retract his comments. In the Commons, his remarks were described as a \"gross error of judgment\" by William Hague, the foreign secretary, and as a \"dreadful blunder\" by Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616722/Now-Kremlin-expresses-delight-Salmonds-praise-Putin-Ukrainian-families-speak-disgust-betrayal.html\" title=\"\">Mail Online website</a> quoted Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, saying he \"agrees with the viewpoint of the Scottish first minister\".</p><p>Salmond said: \"When I was talking about the pride issue, it was in the aftermath of the Sochi [winter] Olympics, which was obviously a restoration of Russian pride. Those are reasonably balanced remarks.\"</p><p>He would reply to Ostapko in detail, he said, \"showing the comments were made specifically on Russia and Ukraine, which were comprehensive and unambiguous\".</p><p>The transcript of the Campbell-Salmond interview released in advance by GQ's publisher Conde Nast shows no mention of Ukraine or the Sochi Olympics, nor does the full text of the interview being published on Thursday.</p><p>In the days before the interview, pro-Russian paramilitaries seized key Ukrainian buildings in Crimea and work on the Crimean referendum had started. Nato had warned about a serious threat to European stability from Russia's actions.</p><p></p><p>In his GQ interview, Campbell sought to establish Salmond's view of the Russian president by asking: \"Putin?.\" Salmond replied: \"Well, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but he is more effective than the press he gets and you can see why he carries support in Russia.\"</p><p>\"Admire him?‚\" asked Campbell. Salmond replied: \"Certain aspects. There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the intermesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing. Russians are fantastic people, incidentally; they are lovely people.\"</p><p>Asked on Wednesday whether he would give a different answer now, Salmond replied: \"If I was asked the same question today, I would go into detail on the annexation of Crimea, but that wasn't possible and indeed, of course, I have done that subsequent to it; it wasn't possible before it happened. My view is that the interview was perfectly balanced and people, when they see it in context, would think that as well.\"</p><p>The SNP are leading the European election polls in Scotland with a series of recent surveys suggesting the party could hit their target of matching or beating their highest European election result of 34% in 1989.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the long-running Scottish independence referendum campaign could improve or dilute the low turnout in previous European elections, which stood at 28.5% in 2009.</p><p>While some polls suggest the SNP could get closer to 40% on 22 May, SNP strategists are uncertain whether that will translate into the party winning three out of Scotland's six European parliament seats. The SNP holds two seats but could win an extra seat under the complex proportional voting system used for European parliament votes, if the Eurosceptic Ukip vote increases and the Lib Dem vote collapses.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8986511","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2085013","internalContentCode":"435719281","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Scotland's first minister clarifies views about Russian president given to Alastair Campbell in GQ interview","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Alex Salmond defends Vladimir Putin remarks","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Severin Carrell, Scotland correspondent","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/30/1398879616442/Alex-Salmond-002.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"23","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-03T17:41:26Z","standfirst":"Scotland's first minister clarifies views about Russian president given to Alastair Campbell in GQ interview","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T00:11:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/30/alex-salmond-vladimir-putin-remarks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/apr/30/alex-salmond-vladimir-putin-remarks","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/alexsalmond","webTitle":"Alex Salmond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/alexsalmond","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/snp","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/scotland","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/scotland","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/european-elections","webTitle":"European elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/european-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/severincarrell","webTitle":"Severin Carrell","r2ContributorId":"19388","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/severin_carrell_140x140.jpg","firstName":"severin","lastName":"carrell","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Severin Carrell is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scotland\">Scotland</a> editor for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian\">Guardian</a>.

Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, he said he respected Nigel Farage, but said the Ukip leader did not have \"answers to the country's future\".</p><p>\"We take very seriously the fact that people voted Ukip; we respect that fact. We have to listen to people who voted Ukip. We have to listen to their anger and anxiety. We need to respond to that anger and anxiety with answers.\"</p><p>But he warned that Ukip voters would \"live with the consequences for years\" if they do not switch their support to the Tories. \"The job of myself and the Conservative party over the coming year is to really focus people's minds on that choice,\" he said. \"We have to make sure people are clear about the choice at a general election, clear that only two people [the leaders of the  two main parties] can be prime minister.\"</p><p>Commenting on the poll, which was published on the ConservativeHome website, Ashcroft said the Tories should \"reconnect with these supporters\".</p><p>\"This will probably mean a swallowing of pride with a sincere apology for the way gay marriage was introduced and, perhaps, an admission that HS2 is not the right policy, and immigration is not under control,\" he said.</p><p>Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher told Today that Labour had to \"fight much harder\" to tackle Ukip in the north of England. But he said the party had made \"extremely good progress\" and remained \"on course for a majority\" in the Commons.</p><p>\"We are winning in the areas we need to win,\" he said.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9084097","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098377","internalContentCode":"437700979","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Poll also suggests support for Nigel Farage may not last until general election, with only 51% of Ukip voters likely to do so again in 2015","allowUgc":"false","headline":"More than half of Ukip voters were disenchanted Tories, Ashcroft poll finds","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Williams","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/24/1400929391604/Ukip-rosette-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"73110","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-27T11:04:08Z","standfirst":"Poll also suggests support for Nigel Farage may not last until general election, with only 51% of Ukip voters likely to do so again in 2015","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:11Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/more-than-half-ukip-voters-disenchanted-tories-ashcroft-poll","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/24/more-than-half-ukip-voters-disenchanted-tories-ashcroft-poll","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/lord-ashcroft","webTitle":"Lord Ashcroft","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lord-ashcroft","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/lord-ashcroft","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/polls","webTitle":"Opinion polls","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/polls","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/european-elections","webTitle":"European elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/european-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/martin-williams","webTitle":"Martin Williams","r2ContributorId":"48256","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/site_furniture/2013/12/12/1386852267141/MW-002.jpg","firstName":"martin","lastName":"williams","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Martin is a freelance journalist.

We have more to do if we are going to really win the argument. Whether on Europe or immigration or on the economy, Labour has got more to do to show we can deliver the real fair change people want to see.\"</p><p>As part of the fallout, some shadow cabinet members say they were crowded out of a campaign that failed to project Labour as a team that includes strong women such as Harriet Harman and Yvette Cooper. There is also anger that Miliband focused too much on policy rather than projecting an empathy with voters' sense of alienation from the political class.</p><p>Harman said: \"People need more than policies. They need to be able to have confidence in their local and national politicians. We've got more to do.\"</p><p>The Labour inquest was taking place as the final results showed a mixed picture for all the parties. Ukip, long regarded as on the march, actually saw its projected share of the vote fall by six points compared with last year, from 23% to 17%, according to BBC calculations. Experts identified Ukip polling 20% in most of the country but just 7% in London.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat vote fell by one point to 13% while David Cameron's leadership was stabilised as the Tory vote increased by four points to 29%.</p><p>It was estimated that this would translate into 322 seats for Labour at a general election, 255 for the Conservatives, 45 for the Lib Dems and other parties, including Ukip, 28 seats.</p><p>Labour achieved nearly 300 council seat gains – well above its forecast of 200 – as it secured important victories by winning control of Hammersmith and Fulham, Croydon, Harrow and Amber Valley from the Tories. But the gain in seats was well behind the 490 identified by the psephologists Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings as the number required to show that it is a potentially winning force.</p><p>The Tories lost nearly 200 seats but managed to wrest control of Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems.</p><p>Nick Clegg faced a challenge to his authority when an e-petition was launched last night by grassroots Liberal Democrats urging him to resign \"so the party may once again get a fair hearing\". The petition is supported by the former Lib Dem MP for Romsey, Sandra Gidley and Bill le Breton, the former chair of the Association of Lib Dem Councillors.</p><p>A Guardian analysis showed that the Lib Dems are on course to lose 20 of their parliamentary seats – nearly a third of the total – in what would be a blow to the authority of the deputy prime minister. But it would avoid what is being described as the \"nuclear wasteland\" in which the party would lose two thirds of its seats to take it down to the 20 seats it won in 1992.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats were undertaking a damage limitation exercise arguing the  local election results showed the party could hold on in many of the parliamentary constituencies it currently holds.  But the figures for England also showed it was going to lose a  large  number of its seats where Labour is the challenger. The results due on Sunday may show how badly it is doing in Scotland and Wales.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats were likely to lose as many as 300 seats.</p><p>A Liberal Democrat source said: \"The results were a tale two elections. They are remarkably good against the Tories, but very bad against Labour especially in London.\" The source added \"the bottom line is that a hung parliament is still the most likely outcome\".</p><p>John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the surprise was Ukip's less than inspiring performance. Curtice said: \"They did pretty well but we shouldn't exaggerate it. Actually the performance is not quite as good as last year's stupendous performance. Given that these elections were taking place at the same time as Euro elections, which we know from previous experience tends to help Ukip to win votes at local elections, one might say: good but not brilliant.</p><p>\"There was one big lacuna in this performance and that was London. London, with its much younger, more highly educated and much more ethnically diverse population, very clearly illustrated the limits of Ukip's appeal which is primarily to older, white, working-class people.\"</p><p>Nigel Farage declared that Ukip had broken the political mould and was on course to win seats in parliament next year. \"The Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house. There are areas of the country where now we have got an imprint in local government. Under the first-past-the-post system we are serious players.\"</p><p>Cameron said he understood the message from the voters, who he said wanted the government to work harder on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. \"We will be working flat out to demonstrate that we do have the answers for hardworking people,\" he said.</p><p>The prime minister rejected calls from Eurosceptic Tories to form a pact with Ukip before next year's general election. He told Sky News: \"We are the Conservative party. We don't do pacts and deals. We are fighting all-out for an all-out win at the next election.\"</p><p>But the greatest soul-searching was in the Labour party. John Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, condemned what he called Labour's \"so-called strategists\" for failing to exploit Farage's admiration for Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>Mann told the Guardian: \"It was a tremendously ill-judged campaign, in particular the deliberate decision made not to attack Ukip.</p><p>\"Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron. Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9083050","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098308","internalContentCode":"437677548","publication":"The

We hope the party leadership reviews these comments as a matter of urgency.\"</p><p>A Ukip spokesman said the party's national executive committee would look into the posts and decide what action to take. Similar offences in the past have seen members kicked out of the party.</p><p>The spokesman said: \"All Ukip members and councillors are expected to uphold the values of the party. Where there are allegations that that has not been the case, there is an established disciplinary procedure, which is under the auspices of the national executive committee. We will certainly look at this case.\"</p><p>The spokesman added that there were already \"quite a few cases pending\".</p><p>Small's Ukip colleague Stuart Cross, who represents Redditch South on Worcester county council, said Small was \"not wanted\" and should resign over the comments. He tweeted: \"If the new cllr has said that. Then he gets no support from me. He should resign without hesitation as those views are disgraceful.\"</p><p>In a post on his Facebook account last June entitled Britain used to be for the British, Small wrote: \"Our once great country has become the dust bin for all the world wide money grabbing scum.\"</p><p>He added: \"Why on earth is this useless Goverment pandering to Puffs? I refuse to call them gays, as what has gay to do with Perverts like Elton John and Clair Balding who get their jollies in such disgusting ways. to sum up, they should not allowed to be married, they should go back to the closet.\"</p><p>In February 2013, he referred to gay people as \"perverts\" and expressed opposition to \"poofs and dykes\" being allowed to marry. And he predicted that \"thousends mor scroungers\" would soon arrive in the UK from Mali as a result of a range of coalition government policies.</p><p>Small also complained in a November 2012 post that he was not allowed to use the term \"Paki\". And, in June that year, he wrote: \"I visiting the city of Birmingham recently and felt like a foreigner in the city of my birth, all around me I could hear the sound of jabbering in an alien voice&nbsp;… we also have the Pakistani' and the Somali's. Tell me Mr Cameron Why? the men wear their Pyjamas.\"</p><p>His comments are just the latest to cause problems for Farage. In February this year, Ukip councillor David Silvester was kicked out of the party for saying that gay marriage was to blame for the storms that lashed Britain last winter.</p><p>Farage himself faced criticism after insisting that people would be justified in worrying about Romanians moving in next door. And, in April, Ukip donor Demetri Marchessini told Channel 4 News that a man could never rape his wife because \"once a woman accepts, she accepts\".</p><p>Last week, BBC News' Jasmine Lawrence was removed from the corporation's election coverage after tweeting a derogatory comment about Ukip as the country was about to go to the polls.</p><p>The party made gains in the local elections, prompting Farage to claim that the \"Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house\". But the BBC's projected national share figure showed Ukip got less than the 23% it had in council elections last year. Moreover, the party does not control any local authorities.</p><p>Anti-Ukip campaigers Still Laughing at the UK Independence Party said Dave Small was \"another example in a long list of Ukip candidates who, having just been elected as a councillor, reveals himself on Facebook as a racist and a homophobe\".</p><p>Small did not respond to a request for comment.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9084484","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098398","internalContentCode":"437704264","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Newly elected Redditch councillor Dave Small referred to gay people as perverts and African immigrants as scroungers","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Ukip councillor under investigation over racist and homophobic comments","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Kevin Rawlinson","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/24/1400936090544/A-man-wearing-a-Ukip-badg-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"84211","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-27T12:56:18Z","standfirst":"Newly elected Redditch councillor Dave Small referred to gay people as perverts and African immigrants as scroungers","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:11Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-councillor-investigation-racist-homophobic-facebook-comments","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/24/ukip-councillor-investigation-racist-homophobic-facebook-comments","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/nigel-farage","webTitle":"Nigel Farage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/nigel-farage","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/kevin-rawlinson","webTitle":"Kevin Rawlinson","r2ContributorId":"58554","firstName":"kevin","lastName":"rawlinson","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Kevin Rawlinson is a freelance reporter who writes for the Guardian and other publications.

(An average poll features around 1,000 voters.) He found Labour had a 10-point lead, or a 12-point lead when voters were asked about their particular constituency. The 6.5% swing to Labour was larger than the 5.5% swing it currently enjoys in national polls. Ashcroft said that, if people voted on this basis at the general election, Labour would gain 83 seats. These results could give Labour a majority of around 70. But he also pointed out that, despite voters backing Labour, only 29% of those surveyed preferred the idea of Ed Miliband as prime minster to David Cameron. The result of the election would depend partly on how willing people were to compromise on their preferred choice of prime minister, he said.</p> <p><b>• Douglas Alexander, Labour&apos;s general election strategy chair, has welcomed the Ashcroft findings.</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Ashcroft’s poll confirms that we are making real progress in seats where we need to do well and that Labour can win next year’s general glection.</p> <p>In the year ahead we will continue to show how we can make a difference to people’s lives and engage directly with voters conversation by conversation, doorstep by doorstep.</p> </blockquote> <p>That&apos;s all from me for today.<br /></p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T15:08:18.372+01:00\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53809e59e4b0ca621b5b263e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T14:40:40.670+01:00\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some of the most interesting Twitter comment on the Ashcroft poll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/statuses/470183320375263232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordAshcroft\">@lordashcroft</a> mega marginal poll shd steady Lab nerves - Lab comfortably ahead, much as in autumn <a href=\"http://t.co/1P81d5Z171\">http://t.co/1P81d5Z171</a></p>&mdash; Tom Clark (@guardian_clark) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/statuses/470183320375263232\">May 24, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ProfTimBale/statuses/470185359721390080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordAshcroft\">@LordAshcroft</a> marginal poll suggests 83 gains for Labour - if an election were held tomorrow.

Collectively the vote in these seats was CON 37%, LAB 37%, LDEM 18%, UKIP 3% at the last general election. In today’s poll ComRes found current support of CON 33%(-4), LAB 35%(-2), LDEM 8%(-10), UKIP 17%(+14). That’s a swing from Conservative to Labour of just one point, far lower than the swing shown in ComRes’s GB polls (it would be the equivalent of a national poll showing a Conservative lead of five points) suggesting Labour are doing worse in key marginals than in the country as a whole.</p> <p>ComRes also break down the figures for the Conservative held and Labour held seats (though given the sample was only 1000 to begin with, caveats about sample size obviously kick in here). In the Tory held seats the Conservatives have a lead of 2 points (no change since the election), in the Labour held seats Labour have an 8 point lead (up 6 since the election). What that means is if these figures were repeated at the general election none of these Con/Lab seats would change hands at all – the Tories would hold theirs, Labour would hold theirs. In practice it wouldn’t work like that of course, there isn’t a uniform swing and some seats would probably switch in both directions, but it’s a suggestion that there isn’t really a swing to either Lab or Con in the key marginals.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53807d44e4b0be668b586bff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T12:56:28.004+01:00\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>• George Osborne has said Labour is vulnerable in the north of England and that this presented an &quot;opportunity&quot; that the Conservatives should exploit.</b> For years the Conservatives have polled very badly in northern urban areas (they do better in northern rural areas), and some Tories tend to write off the party&apos;s prospects on this battleground. But Osborne (MP for Tatton in the north west) told the ConservativeHome conference in London that there were opportunities that the Tories should exploit.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fourth lesson we should learn after these results is that the public are looking for a voice in the north against Labour.</p> <p>We did well in the last general election to win seats in Lancashire and West Yorkshire – but not well enough. We want to win more.</p> <p>Our success in holding councils like Trafford in Greater Manchester – the council seats we won in Pendle, Calder Valley and Cheadle on Thursday – show that when the Conservatives are on the ground delivering for northern communities, we can succeed.</p> <p>But there remain too many places where we are not on the ground – and what’s clear from the results in places from Rotheram to Sunderland is that local people feel ignored by local Labour parties who have taken their support for granted.</p> <p>That’s an opportunity for us. We need to develop a convincing economic answer to the disparities between north and south in our country. Our economic plan must deliver for all.</p> <p>But the chink in the armour of the northern Labour fiefdoms has been exposed. The public want something better. We should set ourselves the long term goal of being that alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He has said that public opposition to the idea of Ed Miliband becoming prime minister increased during the local and European election campaign.</b> He made this claim as he said the Tories would try to turn the 2015 election into a straight choice between having Miliband or David Cameron as prime minister.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you want a Conservative government, you have to vote Conservative. And that is the message we have to make clear to people over the next year. There are only two people who can become prime minister after the next election, David Cameron or Ed Miliband. If you don&apos;t want Ed Miliband, then you have to vote Conservative. That is an incredibly clear message. It&apos;s a message [the public] understand. And, by the way, I think after the last few week&apos;s they are even less convinced that Ed Miliband is the right answer. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He has said the Tories will never belittle people who voted Ukip.</b> Instead the Conservatives would instead respond to the rise in the Ukip vote with a strategy of &quot;listen, respond and deliver&quot;, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The modern Conservative Party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent.</p> <p>We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too those who cast their vote for another party. That includes those who voted for UKIP on Thursday.</p> <p>This is how we will respond to the vote.</p> <p>We’re going to do what I believe the public wants us to do – listen, respond, and deliver.</p> <p>Listen to the legitimate concerns people have about our economy, about immigration and welfare, about our schools and about Europe.</p> <p>Respond to the anger justifiably felt with answers.</p> <p>And then deliver with an economic plan that provides the security that families crave.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He has said the local election results were &quot;miserable&quot; for Labour.</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We note that our Labour opponents lost seats to us in Birmingham, failed to take from us Trafford, Tamworth, Gloucester, Swindon – the battlegrounds of the general election. On Thursday’s result we would have taken Southampton Itchen from Labour.</p> <p>And they lost control of Thurrock – their number 2 target seat in the country, the council they won two years ago – the place Ed Miliband especially went to to say that here was proof Labour was “winning back people’s trust and re-gaining ground”.</p> <p>Labour got 31 per cent of the vote – 8 per cent less than two years ago. For an opposition aspiring to win the election next year, Labour had a miserable set of results.</p> <p>Not just because their leader does not appeal; not just because their campaign was poorly run; but because what they are offering the British people is a return to more borrowing, more spending, more debt that plunged Britain into economic crisis – and the British people don’t want that; they don’t want to go back to square one.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>• Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, has said that the Tories should become a party of &quot;social justice&quot;. </b>This is what he said in a speech opening the ConservativeHome conference.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Redistribution, the minimum wage, [tackling] low pay, supporting trade unionism, affordable housing, none of these things we should be against. In fact, we should be positively working towards, because if we are ever to win a general election with a proper majority, we need to convince working people on low incomes that we are on their side and that we are a party of social justice. None of this means that I&apos;m leftwing. What it does mean is that we are prepared to understand the issues that people on low incomes face in their daily lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said he admired Labour because everyone knew the party had a moral mission. The Tories should be clear that they had one too, he said. It was promoting aspiration. To show that, the party should adopt a ladder as its emblem.</p> <p><b>• Michael Dugher, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, has said that &quot;Farage-mania on the telly every night&quot; was party responsible for Ukip doing well in the local elections. </b>Speaking on the Today programme, he said that Labour had to &quot;fight much harder&quot; to tackle the Ukip threat in traditional northern heartlands. But he said Labour had made &quot;extremely good progress&quot; and remained &quot;on course for a majority&quot; in the Commons.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In many parts of the country, Labour spoke to that anger and we were the party of change and we did win those elections. In other parts of country we didn&apos;t, which means we do have more work to do and that&apos;s what we are going to be doing every week for the next 11 months.</p> </blockquote> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/lutfur-rahman-wins-knifeedge-vote-and-is-reelected-as-mayor-of-tower-hamlets-9430118.html\">• Lutfur Rahman has been relected as independent mayor for Tower Hamlets.</a></b></p> <p><b>• The Democratic Unionist party is ahead in Northern Ireland, where the votes from the local elections are still being counted. </b>My colleague Henry McDonald has sent me this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In Northern Ireland&apos;s local elections the Democratic Unionist Party this morning still have their noses out in front in the race to be the biggest political force in the region.

However, due to the quirks of the electoral system at present the Ulster Unionists Party has 61 seats compared to Sinn Fein&apos;s 58.

Two thirds of Thursday’s Ukip voters think David Cameron is the best available Prime Minister, compared to a quarter for Ed Miliband. And nearly seven in ten trust Cameron and Osborne more than Miliband and Balls when it comes to running the economy. (Indeed, one in ten Labour voters trust the Tory duo more than their own two Eds).</p> <p>Just over half of Ukip Euro voters supported the Tories at the 2010 election. One in seven voted Labour, and a fifth were Lib Dems. As for next May, only half of them expect to stay with Ukip. One fifth already say they will go back to the Tories, one in ten will vote Labour, and 14 per cent say they don’t know what they will do.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53805484e4b0be668b586be7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-24T10:26:16.553+01:00\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Conservatives are meeting in London today, with one set of election results now finally in, and the European election results coming tomorrow.

Parties can win an election without winning. </b>On paper, Labour clearly won. They have gained more than 250 seats (the BBC figures have been ahead of the ones on our result chart, but that&apos;s because our figures only get updated when full council results come in), and they are easily ahead on projected national share. If Britons voted like this in a general election, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. But it hasn&apos;t felt like a victory for them. If you want to know who feels as if they&apos;ve won an election, ignore what politicians say, turn the volume down and look at their faces on TV. Who&apos;s happiest? It&apos;s definitely Ukip first, then probably the Conservatives, then Labour, then Ukip. That&apos;s because, given the likelihood of the gap between Labour and the Conservatives closing between now and 2015, Labour know this isn&apos;t good enough to offer a strong chance of victory.</p> <p><b>2. Ukip&apos;s chances of winning the European elections don&apos;t look as good as they did this time yesterday. </b>Their national vote share is down six points compared to last year, and, although there must be some people who voted Ukip in the Euros and for another party in the locals, there must be a chance that the polls saying Ukip would win have got it wrong.</p> <p><b>3. Labour now fully realise that Ukip presents them with a serious electoral threat. </b>This shouldn&apos;t be a surprise. Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin have written a very good book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/09/nigel-farage-hosts-phone-in-on-lbc-politics-live-blog#block-536c83c6e4b012a5c554bc6a\">(which I keep plugging) </a>making this very case. But it has taken a while for the message to get through.</p> <p><b>4. Labour&apos;s post-election inquest will probably be more serious than the Conservatives&apos;.</b> Journalists expected these elections to trigger a mini crisis in the Conservative party. But there has been no evidence of that at all. A few Eurosceptics have renewed their call for a pact with Ukip, but this is an absolute non-starter, and they know it. Generally, the Eurosceptics have decided not to cause trouble. But the public comments from Labour figures suggest the party is going to conduct a proper post-mortem, not into Ed Miliband&apos;s leadership (they are stuck with him, for better or worse), but into whether their Ukip strategy is correct. And that&apos;s because ...</p> <p><b>5. None of the parties have a clue what to do about Ukip.</b> Politicians from all the main parties have been saying much the same thing: that voters have sent them a message, and that they must listen. But there is no real agreement what the message is, or what they should do about it.</p> <p><b>6. A second hung parliament looks increasingly inevitable.</b> Four-party politics is increasingly entrenched in English politics (as in Scottish and Welsh politics, only they have a different four parties), and that makes it harder for any of them to win outright.</p> <p><b>7. The Lib Dems are vulnerable even in their strongholds. </b>Last year they thought they had hit rock bottom in the local elections. They hadn&apos;t. Although they are holding on in some Lib Dem areas, in others they are losing seats. The BBC say even Vince Cable would lose his seat on the basis of today&apos;s results.</p> <p><b>8. London really is a different from the rest of the country electorally.</b> It seems to be the only place in England impervious to Ukip&apos;s charms. Like Scotland. (Perhaps if Scotland goes independent we Londoners could join up with them, share the pound, and leave the rest of England with something Ukip-ish, like the groat?)</p> <p>That&apos;s all from me. Ben Quinn is now taking the controls.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T18:50:46.975+01:00\">at 6.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-537f7e4ee4b0be668b586bc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T18:01:50.622+01:00\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lib Dems could be on course for a wipeout in Islington, according to the Mirror&apos;s James Lyons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MirrorJames/statuses/469880423078965248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Lib Dems heading for wipeout in Islington?

Mostly they are unhappy because they want a Conservative/Ukip pact, which David Cameron </p> <p>From <b>Jackie Doyle-Price</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’re doing well with the economy we’ve got a good set of messages but they’re all about your head and what people are worried about here [in Thurrock, where Doyle-Price is MP], you’ll hear people talking about immigration, they say to us we’ve not done enough about immigration, we’ve not done enough about welfare, actually we’ve done a lot, but what we need to do is talk in a narrative that people understand and can engage with because too often our political debate looks managerial and bland and that’s why people here don’t think that politicians speak for them.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <b>Douglas Carswell</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Two years ago, Mr Cameron talked about serious changes to our relation with Europe, including changes to social and employment regulation. Even last year he was suggesting treaty changes and an intergovernmental conference. His latest foray in a piece for the Sunday Times seemed a little bit less ambitious.</p> <p> Our Bloomberg proposition might seem a little more persuasive if we did not water it down. And having one or two officials in Number 10 considering renegotiation who actually believe in the need for substantial change might help, too ...</p> <p>If David Cameron is as serious about an In/Out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel Farage is as serious about Brexit as he claims, the two of them need to do a deal. The law already allows joint candidates. We have a list of MPs on both sides of the House who in October 2011 showed that they are serious about securing an EU referendum ...</p> <p>The Sunday papers will be thick with column inches from pundits, many of whom will now be overnight experts on why people vote Ukip. “Carry on” many will say. “Let’s just carry on like before”. Those in charge of sales at HMV music probably once felt the same way when they heard that some folk had started to buy music online. Some things we have to carry on. But some things we need to change.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <b>Jacob Rees-Mogg</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the promise of the referendum the Conservative Party and Ukip are moving in exactly the same direction that is offering the British people a final decision on whether we have continued membership of the European Union and that surely pushes towards a coupon of some kind.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <b>Peter Bone</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we mustn&apos;t do [is] have the right-of-centre vote poll more than fifty per cent at the general election and and let Miliband and Co in - that would be a disaster.

If Allister was to unseat either of the two main unionist candidates it would be the Ulster equivalent of the UKIP political earthquake across the Irish Sea.<br /></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537f6ccfe4b0cd858b85b443\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T16:45:17.342+01:00\">4.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2014/may/23/politics-weekly-podcast-ukip-council-elections\">Here&apos;s the Guardian&apos;s Politics Weekly podcast.</a></p> <p>It features Michael White, James Ball, Stephen Tall and Tom Clark talking about the election results.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537f6a4fe4b0f102cc661932\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T16:43:09.927+01:00\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Tories have helpfully sent me a list of Labour figures criticising the leadership today. </p> <p>Most of them have featured in the blog already, but here are a few I&apos;ve missed.</p> <p>From <b>John Mann</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Labour’s results are] the fault of Ed Miliband and all the people at the top of the Labour party ...</p> <p>We need to address issues, people want action and clear policies.

And they will become our target seats in 2015 for the general election and I should have thought this particular seat would be quite high on the list.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ukip have gained almost 100 seats so far - already exceeding one prediction made by election experts - and they seem to have gained almost a quarter of the projected national share of the vote. On TV Ukip figures are the only ones who seem genuinely pleased with their performance. But it is not clear that they will beat the 139 net gains they made in local elections last year, when only 2,363 seats were up for election (this year it&apos;s 4,216) and their share of the vote seems to be about the same, even though having local elections coincide with European elections this year should have provided them with a boost. <b>John Curtice</b>, the BBC&apos;s psephologist, told the World at One just now: &quot;It&apos;s probably the case that actually the performance is not quite as good as in last year&apos;s stupendous performance.&quot; </p> <p><b>• Politicians from the three main parties have all accepted that Ukip&apos;s success shows that politicians need to listen more to the concerns of the electorate.</b> But, beyond that, there seems to be little agreement as to what lessons they should be learning.</p> <p><b>• Labour has won control of six councils so far, and gained more than 150 seats. </b>But it&apos;s also been losing seats to Ukip, and it is not clear that the result would deliver Labour a majority at the general election. Some figures have already started to publicly criticise the quality of the party&apos;s campaign. There have been some barbed remarks about Ed Miliband&apos;s leadership, but the more important debate seems to be about how the party tackles Ukip. Douglas Alexander has suggested that Ukip&apos;s rise could help the party beat the Tories, but some in the party think this approach is complacent. John Curtice said the results &quot;do not provide Labour with much comfort&quot;. He said Labour&apos;s share of the vote (the projected national share, or PNS) was only three or four points up on 2010, which suggests they are on 30% or 31%.</p> <p><b>• The Lib Dems have already lost more than 130 seats and, according to the John Curtice, they may be heading for &quot;their worst set of results yet this parliament&quot;.</b> He told the World at One just now that they were 13 points below their vote in the 2010 local elections, which suggests that they are heading for a projected national share of 13%. </p> <p><b>• David Cameron has again ruled out a pact with Ukip following the Conservatives&apos; disappointing performance.</b> They have lost more than 130 seats, and some Eurosceptics have been renewing their call for an electoral pact with Ukip. Cameron said that was unacceptable (although he did not rule out the Tories working with Ukip at local council level). However, the only MPs speaking out are relatively marginal figures, and no one is publicly attacking Cameron&apos;s leadership. John Curtice said they were three points below their performance in 2012, suggesting they are on course for a PNS of 28%.</p> <p><b>• The Greens are on course for getting 10% of the vote, according to Curtice. </b></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537f3650e4b020b0f5edac8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-23T12:56:41.876+01:00\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Nigel Farage</b> has been visiting Thurrock, where Ukip gained five seats. </p> <p>But he ruled out standing as a candidate in Essex himself at the general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, that&apos;s not for me to do.

Since then, however, the grip has loosened a little, with one member becoming independent after falling out with the party over plans to build on green spaces and the Tories pinching a seat in a by-election. </p> <p>This time round, half the seats are up for grabs with the Lib Dems defending 12 of them. And the Ukip factor will play a bigger part than ever before. Nigel Farage&apos;s party won three Gloucestershire county council seats last year and is fielding 11 candidates in these local elections – more than Labour. </p> <p>But the Lib Dems in regency Cheltenham are experienced, clever campaigners. They have worked very hard here not just to make sure they hang on to control of the council but so they will be battle-ready for next year&apos;s general election when it will probably be a straight fight between the Lib Dems and the Tories. </p> <p>From a standing start it looks as if Ukip has done well.

As I write the BBC suggest they are getting about 25% of the vote in wards they contest (though much worse in London) and have gained about 100 councillors. Two things to put this in context though – the first is that this is roughly the same level of support as they got at the local elections last year. I don’t really know if that’s good or bad for them. At one level they’ve sustained last year’s advance, it’s not a flash in the pan and they are more firmly establishing themselves as a major force. On the other hand, these are local elections <i>on the same day as the European election</i>… shouldn’t they be improving on last year? Second caveat, their vote is still very evenly spread. They are getting many more votes than the Lib Dems, but far fewer councillors. As was the case last year, UKIP are doing fantastically well at coming second in many places and that doesn’t build the council base they need to build support in target seats for the general election.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/ukip-success-local-elections-two-party-system-crisis\">• John Harris at Comment is free says we should stop sneering at Ukip.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\">local election results come in and Ukip&apos;s numbers continue to look remarkable</a>, the rest of us should maybe pause for thought and realise that something rather sobering is afoot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/04/ukip-farage-local-election-results\">as happened in the 2012 county council elections</a>, only more so. If a party is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/22/local-election-results-2014-live\">averaging 47% of the vote in a Labour stronghold</a> such as Rotherham,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27533313\">toppling Tories from their perches in crucial Conservative territory</a> and apparently heading towards first place in the European contest, something important is obviously afoot. Moreover, if people are supporting Ukip in such large numbers – even after the media&apos;s massed guns have been rattling at it for weeks – it is probably time to drop all the sneering and think about why.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jameskirkup/100272837/local-elections-six-things-you-need-to-know-about-ukip-labour-and-the-tories/\">• James Kirkup at the Telegraph lists six lessons from the elections.</a><br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/05/local-elections\">• Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says David Cameron will be &quot;quietly pleased&quot; with the result.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour did well to take Cambridge, Croydon, Redbridge and, in particular, Hammersmith and Fulham (where the socio-economic and demographic tide has been working against the party over past years). Still, it is hard to avoid the impression that the party’s success was limited to metropolitan pockets, while it did much worse in more blue-collar areas. Its loss of control in Thurrock, a typical example of these, will particularly smart as the seat holds second place on the party’s ranking of its 106 general election targets.</p> <p>The best that can be said about the Lib Dems’ dismal performance is that it was largely expected. At the time of writing the party had lost 64 seats. More damaging to the party’s morale, however, will be its results in leafy areas like Cambridge (where it was previously the largest party), Kingston and across south-west London in general. Lib Dems are resigned to losing parliamentary seats in less prosperous parts of the country, where the spending cuts of the past years have hit hardest, but had hoped to hold the line in wealthier places where their coalition with the Conservatives is less controversial. Not so, it seems.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://hopisen.com/?p=6277\">• Hopi Sen on his blog says you should listen to what the parties have not been saying about their results, not what they have been saying.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2014/05/23/the-story-from-the-local-elections-isnt-that-ukip-is-popular-its-that-labour-is-not/#more-18320\">• Atul Hatwal at Labour Uncut says Labour faces a fundmental crisis.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, Labour got its vote out, but the story from too many wards across London is not of wholesale switching from the Tories to Labour but of Ukip cutting into the Tories’ vote and allowing Labour through.</p> <p>Politics can be a strangely delusional business. If a Labour party supporter with a passing knowledge of past elections had been transported to another dimension immediately after the result in 2010, and then returned to these shores today, there would be no doubt in their assessment: Labour is not doing well enough to win next year.</p> <p>With the polls already virtually tied, Ukip set to beat Labour into second in the European vote and Labour lagging the Tories by double digits on the economy and leadership, it is almost beyond obvious that the party faces a fundamental crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/robin-lustig/nigel-farage-ukip_b_5377433.html\">• Robin Lustig at Huffington Post says he thinks the Ukip vote is a one-night stand.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My prediction? After next year&apos;s general election, Ukip will end up with not a single parliamentary seat at Westminster and a share of the vote much reduced from their share this week. On local councils where they have won seats this time round, the - how shall I put this? - somewhat variable quality of their candidates will soon become even more embarrassingly evident. </p> <p>That&apos;s the thing about small parties led by a single dominant, charismatic figure. The internal tensions quickly lead to fatal fractures, and that&apos;s as true on the right as on the left of the political spectrum.

Under no circumstances must we pander to them and, actually, there’s a strong reason for Labour to lose their ambivalence and get out there and fight them properly.</p> <p>It’s a very mixed bag of results for the Liberal Democrats in seats we hold. Good news in Eastleigh, Birmingham and Colchester but worrying in Cambridge and Portsmouth. Oh, and we really need to look at how they did it in Eastleigh.</p> <p>This is never a set of elections that we do particularly well in. Four years ago we lost over 100 seats while Labour gained 500 on the day they took a drubbing in the General Election. Eight years ago, when we were doing pretty well post Iraq and 3 months after we won an historic by-election in Gordon Brown’s back yard, we had a whopping gain of…..2 seats across the country.

Here are the key points.</p> <p><b>• Curtice said that Labour were doing worse than they were two years ago.</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to local elections, we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve because we basically say, if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections, even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months&apos; time. The truth is, by that test at least, Labour have not done well enough.</p> <p>Most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election. And if you compare Labour&apos;s performance vote for vote with 2010, the advance is just 3% point - 3% on what was the day in which Labour recorded its second worst result. And if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago, which we can also compare most of these places with, Labour&apos;s vote is clearly well down, something like nine points.</p> <p>So the truth is, modest progress, Labour not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament, and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the British electorate regard Labour as a clear alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He said Ukip were doing much better than expected.</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Certainly what these local elections demonstrate is that anybody who thought that the Ukip bubble was going to be easily deflated should now be disabused of that notion. They have managed to maintain most of the support they have had over the last 12 months and repeated it at these local elections. To that extent at least they have done remarkably well.</p> <p>We have already found Ukip gaining over 80 seats. That was as much as anybody expected them to make [see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live#block-537ed4cde4b0e732c16db8a8\">6.01am],</a> even if they did well, and we&apos;ve only had a third or so of the results actually in yet.

The Conservatives and the Lib Dems were saying earlier this week that they expected to lose seats, and Labour claimed they were only expecting to gain around 150 seats. But polling experts do produce more objective figures, based on how well the parties are doing in the polls, and I&apos;m aware of two different “forecasts”.</p> <h2>Rallings/Thrasher</h2> <p>Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher are professors of politics at University of Plymouth who specialise in studying local elections.<a href=\"https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/PSA%202014%20Local%20Elections%20Media%20Briefings%20-%20Slides%2029-04-14jl.pdf\"> In a briefing for the Political Studies Association last month</a>, they produced some figures for the number of seats they expect the main parties to win in these local elections based on how well they have been performing over the last three months in local council byelections.<br /></p> <p>According to Rawlings and Thrasher, those byelections suggest produce following national equivalent vote (NEV). NEV is what the national vote share would be if the results in places that did vote were replicated in wards all over the country.</p> <p>Labour: 33%<br /></p> <p>Conservatives: 30%<br /></p> <p>Ukip: 16%<br /></p> <p>Lib Dems: 14%<br /></p> <p>According to Rallings and Thrasher, a strict application of this NEV would see Labour gain 500 seats, the Lib Dems lose 340, and the Conservatives lose 160. And Ukip would not win a single seat. But they recognise that it is hard to assess Ukip, because they are a relatively new party that has only started winning council seats, and so they revised their figures to take into account the likelihood they would win some seats. Here are the figures they presented to the PSA.<br /></p> <p>Labour: +490 seats<br /></p> <p>Ukip: +80<br /></p> <p>Conservatives: -220<br /></p> <p>Lib Dems: -350<br /></p> <p>As I write, Ukip has already hit 80 seats - and around half the results are yet to come in.</p> <h2>Fisher</h2> <p>Steve Fisher is an associate politics professor at Oxford.

Scotland is another country, that's the theme of the dominant political battle of the year. But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-election-ukip-nigel-farage-labour-tories-lib-dems\" title=\"\">results of Thursday's elections</a> make you wonder: is London another country too?</p><p>Even to ask the question prompts embarrassment. It plays to the very case Ukip has long been making, that the media is part of an out-of-touch metropolitan elite concerned chiefly with itself. But the figures speak for themselves. The UK Independence party surged across England, grabbing 23% of the vote – a figure that may well rise with Sunday's European results. Only in one part of England did Ukip tank, shrugged off like a no-hoper fringe party  rather than the coming force in British politics. And that place was London.</p><p>In the capital Ukip scarcely reached double figures. That was never going to be the lead headline on a night that brought delight to Nigel Farage, muted disappointment to Ed Miliband, relative relief to David Cameron, and further kicks to the groin of Nick Clegg. But that London difference is significant all the same – for what it says not only about the political landscape, where it poses a dilemma for both Tories and Labour, but about the changing face of these islands.</p><p>Asked to explain the party's failure in London, Ukip's Suzanne Evans was asked if she agreed with the Kipper who had said the problem was that the capital was too full of the \"cultured, educated and young\". She did not dismiss that view, conceding that, yes, there was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite\" title=\"\">\"more media-savvy, well-educated population in London\"</a> who were more likely to have swallowed press lies about the Faragistes.</p><p>Put aside the fact that if they're so media-savvy, Londoners should have been less, not more, susceptible to a conspiracy of disinformation. It was an arresting admission, but it was incomplete. For the stats say that Ukip voters are indeed less likely to be graduates than others, but they are also older and whiter. Londoners are, by contrast, more likely to be graduates, younger and less white.</p><p>No wonder Ukip couldn't succeed in the capital. London is the place that Ukip warns about, the realisation of its worst nightmares. As the 2011 census revealed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/21/flight-minorities-london-suburbs-white-flight\" title=\"\">white Britons are now a minority in London</a>, accounting for only 45% of the city's population. More than 40% of Londoners were born overseas. Christians form the largest religious group, but they are no longer a majority. The highest proportion of Muslims (and every other religion) in Britain is to be found in London, where (often African) churches, mosques, temples and synagogues thrive.</p><p>It's not just that the capital is uncongenial for someone who, like Farage, feels uncomfortable hearing languages other than English. It also undermines Ukip's entire argument about immigration and modernity. For if Ukip's core message is that Britons cannot take too much diversity, London stands as a rebuttal. It is the most mixed, diverse place in Britain – but it is also the place apparently least troubled by that variety, a sentiment eloquently expressed in its collective rejection of Ukip.</p><p>What to make of this difference? For some Londoners, it's grounds for smug superiority, as if the capital and its citizens have reached a higher level of sophistication than the neanderthals in the rest of the country. Such thinking might work on Twitter, but it's a political dead end. For the London difference poses the three main political parties a serious problem. If the capital and its attitudes are at such variance with the rest of the country, then the three established political parties are literally in the wrong place. Headquartered in London, they cannot help but be identified with a metropolitan class out of step with everyone else.</p><p>Some in Labour see opportunity here. Town hall gains in the London suburbs of Merton, Redbridge and Croydon suggest that, as an area becomes home to younger voters and more people of colour, the Labour vote rises. For the party's optimists, that's a trend that can only get bigger. For surely the entire country, not just London, is heading in that direction. Look at that 2011 census again, which showed a five-point fall in the proportion of white people in Britain since 2001, or at this month's Policy Exchange report – which estimated that between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/06/ethnic-minority-voters-identity-politics\" title=\"\">20% and 30% of Britons will be black or minority ethnic</a> (BME) by mid-century.</p><p>If the pattern shown this week is repeated, cheerful Labour folk conclude, then the party's base is set to expand in coming decades. They cite the changing US electorate, which has left Republicans relying on an ever-shrinking white vote while Democrats are boosted by expanding minority communities as well as younger, educated Americans who like, rather than lament, their country's changing face. Were that dynamic to be repeated here, and Birmingham or Manchester go the way of London, then the future is Labour's.</p><p>That leaves the Conservatives with a serious strategic dilemma. To woo the urban – and now suburban – vote from Labour, they would have to modernise further. Equal marriage would have to be more than a one-off: it would have to be typical Tory policy. Yet Conservatives are itching to go in the opposite direction, to chase those voters they're losing to Ukip by promising ever redder meat on welfare and immigration. The party needs to head left and right at the same time – a feat that is near impossible.</p><p></p><p>The sharpness of this dilemma helps one Tory, though. Boris Johnson's 2012 win in London looks like an even greater achievement now than it did then. He managed to assemble a winning majority from both diverse, right-on London and its more homogeneous, whiter outer boroughs. His maverick persona – however confected it might be – seems to appeal to Ukip types. Expect several rattled Tories to insist that if these elections have posed a question, Boris is the answer.</p><p>But the conundrum presses in on Labour too. Glad though it will be to have the votes of what the LSE's London guru <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tonytravers\" title=\"\">Tony Travers</a> calls \"Shoreditch hipsters\" and BME suburbanites, they're not plentiful enough to win a general election. Travers notes that Ukip's base – older, whiter and non-graduate – used to be Labour's core vote. In Rotherham and elsewhere, Ukip made serious inroads. Labour needs to win back that traditional base; yet the more it appeals to its new metropolitan backers, the more it risks alienating the old-time heartlands.</p><p>So Ukip has driven a wedge into both established parties, dividing their coalitions down the middle. As London drifts apart from the rest of the country, as Scotland considers breaking away, and as Labour and Tories alike find themselves torn in two, Britain stands as a country pulled in radically different directions – wondering when we will <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\" title=\"\">follow the poet and conclude that the centre cannot hold</a>.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a

fox, said Nigel Farage, is in the Westminster henhouse. The canary may even be asphyxiated in the coal mine. Whatever the chosen metaphor, four-party politics has arrived in Britain, and the only question is whether it will ever go away.</p><p>Labour can fairly claim that as Friday dragged on, it did better than the first local election results had indicated on Thursday night. But Farage can also reasonably say that Ukip now has an imprint in local government under a first-past-the-post system. And the Ukip leader is promising that the imprint will deepen, and provide the basis to win constituency seats in a general election.</p><p>Thursday's elections, concentrated in Labour areas, have also confirmed, if confirmation was needed, that Ukip can damage Labour as much as it can the Conservatives, meaning both main parties need to throw out the old methods to project swings and to forecast the marginal seats they can gain.</p><p>In Rotherham, a Labour heartland, Ukip came first in 10 and second in 11 of the 21 seats it fought. But in such cases the Ukip insurgency does not yet look powerful enough to threaten Labour seats in 2015.</p><p>More worryingly, in some target seats in the north-west and the West Midlands, a strong Ukip performance has meant Labour has not made the gains for which it had hoped, for instance in Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall. \"Worcester man\" has also not gone&nbsp;Labour.</p><p>But that is not the whole picture. The most obvious exception seems to be London. The capital has its own house prices, a multicultural population and now, almost, its own political cycle.</p><p>The city that spawned the recession seems to be the part of the country least hit by its consequences, and most willing to back Labour. Even in Barking, Labour held every seat. There were many gains, too: an impressive achievement that reflects the strength of the activist base in the capital where its \"get out the vote\" operation had some successes. In Hornsey and Wood Green, the party is 1,500 strong.</p><p>One Labour strategist, speaking as the second wave of results emerged, said: \"I would rather be where we are this morning than where [Conservative party campaign consultant] Lynton Crosby is. There is a massive wave sweeping over politics called four-party politics. But there is also a strong current to Labour. We think we will make over 250 gains.\"</p><p>Labour with growing credibility insisted it was winning in the marginals where it mattered and pointed to victories outside London, in Cambridge, Lincoln, Amber Valley, Ipswich, Peterborough and Carlisle.</p><p>But there is also an acknowledgement that it did not do as well as it hoped, with disappointment in Trafford.</p><p>By the time of the general election next year, senior Labour strategists accept the Ukip vote will not shrink back to the 3% it polled in the 2010 general election, but still believe the bulk of the Ukip damage then will be inflicted on the Conservatives.</p><p>Still, there will be an inquest into the Labour campaign, and why it has been as much the victim of the anti-politics mood as the governing parties.</p><p>Some Labour MPs, such as John Spellar, John Healey, Peter Hain and John Mann, have long been arguing for the party to go on the front foot against Ukip, exposing them as modern-day Thatcherites bent on flat taxes and NHS privatisation. It has been said that Douglas Alexander, the party's chief election strategist, rejected pleas, including from his MEPs,  to put an attack on Ukip centre-stage.</p><p>But he did sanction market-tested literature attacking Ukip, and has a clear analysis of what is driving Ukip support. He has argued that Ukip is not fuelled by dislike of Europe, but by a hatred of the political class. In some alienated communities, there is a sense that people have been ignored by Westminster, and simply cannot see their place in the future. Alexander has argued this predates George Osborne's 2010 budget, and even the financial crash in 2007.</p><p>Coming from Scotland, Alexander is unlikely to underestimate the importance of four-party politics.</p><p>Miliband also insists he understands the discontent that led people to vote Ukip, and his choice is to patiently offer practical policies to address the anger with politics. It is the approach Barack Obama took with the Tea Party in the US. It means no name-calling, but instead addressing the causes of the discontent.</p><p>Many MPs close to their working class communities bluntly disagree with this analysis and think it is time to do more to call Ukip out, rather than spending time attacking the self-immolating Liberal Democrats. They argue that Miliband put out a lot of policy in this campaign designed to appeal to potential Ukip supporters, but it was drowned out by immigration, welfare and Farage.</p><p>But the doorstep issue of Miliband himself does exist. Parts of the campaign malfunctioned: if you are planning to take Swindon council, you need to know the name of the Labour leader on said council; if you are campaigning on the cost of living, you need to know the cost of living. Miliband struggled to credibly estimate his weekly shopping bill, reckoning it at very modest£70 to £80 a week.</p><p>But Labour says the campaign was deliberately intensive and a dry run for the 2015 general election. Better to mess up now and fine tune, rather than mess up in 2015, they argue.</p><p>Labour insists Ukip supporters are more likely to be won over by the Miliband message in the next year, than by David Cameron's claims that the economy has recovered. It means the test for the Alexander team now is how far they can deflate the Ukip bubble. It hopes these Labour sympathisers will recoil at the thought of a second term for Cameron, and Ukip's appeal to older, white, working-class men will wane.</p><p>Cameron, by contrast, thinks he has two decisive weapons – a rapidly improving economy, and Miliband. The next year will reveal the truth.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9082776","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098282","internalContentCode":"437673936","publication":"The

But its polling was at 7% in London, where Labour gains were dominant and turned four of the outer suburbs red.</p><p>Nigel Farage declared he had unleashed a \"Ukip fox in the Westminster henhouse\" and continued to predict a victory in the European elections, the results of which are due on Sunday. However, the party's poor showing in the capital may have helped push the party's overall share of the vote below 17%, significantly lower than its 23% share in local elections last year and well below both Labour and the Conservatives.</p><p>One prominent Ukip candidate, Suzanne Evans, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite\" title=\"\">attributed Ukip's failure to gain ground in London to its \"more media-savvy and educated\" population</a>, in contrast to the rest of the country.</p><p>The former Tory Merton councillor who defected to Ukip but lost her seat, told the BBC: \"[In London, voters] are more likely, I think, to have read some of the negative press that's been about us, and I think they'd be more likely to believe it, whereas people outside of London have, I think, been fairly cynical about the media campaign and the campaign that the other parties have waged against us.\"</p><p>She suggested the \"educated, cultured and young\" in the capital were less likely to vote for Ukip and claimed the party was unlike the \"metropolitan elite\" in being able to understand the \"heartache\" felt by the rest of the country.</p><p>Professor John Curtice, a psephologist at Strathclyde University, said the results showed the share of the vote going to Farage's party had dropped since last year, but \"anybody who thought that the Ukip bubble was going to be easily deflated should now be disabused of that notion\".</p><p>\"They have managed to maintain most of the support they have had over the last 12 months and repeated it at these local elections. To that extent at least they have done remarkably well,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>In London, Ukip did not pick up a single councillor in Redbridge, Merton, Richmond, Sutton, Enfield, Haringey or Wandsworth, with only a couple of seats in Bexley. However, its decision to field candidates across London boroughs may have helped Labour to victory by splitting the rightwing vote in places such as Croydon, which Miliband's party took off the Conservatives.</p><p>Mike Fisher, Croydon borough's ousted Tory leader of eight years blamed Ukip for the loss. Although Labour increased its vote in key wards and delivered turnouts of close to 50% in some cases, Ukip consistently came second and third in many wards.</p><p>\"When we were canvassing nobody was saying they were for Ukip because it's still a guilty secret,\" Fisher said. \"But the level of support has come out today. Voters are using this as an opportunity to rebel and I hope that when it comes to the general election people will look at the policies of the main parties. The annoying thing here is that Ukip have lots of votes but no seats. Many of those Ukip voters are Conservatives and they will be horrified to wake up this morning to a Labour council.\"</p><p>In the rest of the country, a stronger picture emerged for Farage's party with 28 new Ukip councillors helping to topple the Tories in Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Maidstone, Peterborough and Castle Point. Malcolm Buckley, the former leader of Basildon council who was ousted by Ukip, criticised David Cameron for \"not getting it\" on the issues of immigration and the European Union.</p><p>Ukip's gain of six new councillors in Portsmouth meant the Liberal Democrats lost control of the authority, ejecting their longstanding councillor and MP Mike Hancock who was suspended by the party in January following a leaked report into claims of sexual misconduct, which he denies, towards a female constituent. However, Farage's party failed to replicate this success in nearby Eastleigh, where it nearly won a byelection in 2010. Instead, the Lib Dems increased their dominance by one seat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Labour lost its majorities in Great Yarmouth, because of 10 new Ukip councillors; Thurrock, due to five new Ukip councillors; and North East Lincolnshire, because of another five Ukip gains. However, two of these areas have Conservative MPs with very small majorities – Brandon Lewis in Great Yarmouth and Jackie Doyle-Price in Thurrock – suggesting the rise of Ukip in these areas actually poses just as much of a threat to the Conservatives at the general election. In Lincolnshire's Great Grimbsy, the Labour seat of retiring MP Austin Mitchell, Curtice predicted there could be a Ukip win at the general election.</p><p>Labour held on in Rotherham by a large majority, but Ukip became the official opposition after winning seven seats from Labour, two from the Conservatives, and holding the one seat it won in a byelection last year. It also scooped up votes from the disintegrating British National party, which had two councillors at its peak in 2008.</p><p>Rotherham council's deputy leader, Jahangir Akhtar, who was first elected in 2000, was one of those who lost his seat after being embroiled in Rotherham's child sex-grooming scandal. He was accused of covering up abuse by his cousin – a charge he has always denied. He stepped down for several months while police investigated the case and was reinstated late year when detectives decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute.</p><p>Dr Matthew Goodwin, a political expert at the University of Nottingham, said the results showed Ukip could damage Labour as much as the Conservatives.</p><p>He said Ukip grew up largely in the south-west and south-east, where it is strong in Essex and Kent, but it was now performing well in areas of the north, such as the Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber.</p><p>The party's success outside London illustrated Britain's social divide between those at ease with a metropolitan, cosmopolitan society and those who felt left behind, Goodwin said.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9081834","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098233","internalContentCode":"437666170","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Experts estimate Ukip has polled just 7% in the capital, compared with more than 20% in the rest of the country","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Ukip results reveal divide between London and rest of England","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason, Helen Pidd and Robert Booth","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400865512445/Nigel-Farage-celebrates-w-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"9","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T17:20:02Z","standfirst":"Experts estimate Ukip has polled just 7% in the capital, compared with more than 20% in the rest of the country","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-08-20T15:50:53Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-results-divide-london-rest-england","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-results-divide-london-rest-england","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rowena-mason","webTitle":"Rowena Mason","r2ContributorId":"58040","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899384228/Rowena-Mason.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png","firstName":"rowena","lastName":"mason","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rowena Mason is a political correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowena-mason","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422363522583/Helen-Pidd.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422363539931/Helen-Pidd-R.png","firstName":"helen","lastName":"pidd","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

It also has the support of a number of younger party activists, but it is not clear if it will sway the minds of instinctively loyal Lib Dem MPs.</p><p>The Lib Dems lost nearly 300 council seats and took a terrible pasting in London, Manchester and Liverpool.</p><p>Overall the BBC had the Lib Dem share of the vote at 13%. Some of the projections based on the local elections suggest a slew of Lib Dem MPs would lose their seats, including the business secretary, Vince Cable, Cambridge MP Julian Huppert and the justice minister, Simon Hughes.</p><p>The fate of the party in its Scottish and Welsh seats will only be clear when the European election results are announced on Sunday.</p><p>Clegg's aides say the local election results represent a tale of two elections: one in which the party did relatively well against the Conservatives, such as in Eastleigh, and one in which it did very badly when competing against Labour, especially in London.</p><p>They say a second hung parliament still looks the most likely result in 2015.</p><p>The petition states: \"The devastating results on Friday have made it clear that even the best Liberal Democrat candidates, councillors and councils have come up against a brick wall. It is simply impossible for the party to make any headway so long as it is led by Nick Clegg.</p><p>\"There is a serious trust deficit – rightly or wrongly. Nothing Clegg says can be taken seriously by the electorate. Even when he was articulately expounding the case for Europe against Nigel Farage no one believed him.\"</p><p>Last week's ComRes poll gave Clegg an approval rating of 56% – exactly the same score as the very worst rating of Michael Foot when he was the leader of Labour, who was himself the least popular party leader since polling began.</p><p>\"Clegg has alienated almost two-thirds of the party's former voters, many of them drawn from its core support,\" the petition continues.</p><p>\"These elections represent our last chance to take stock and make the right decision in renewing the party to present a robust platform in 2015.\"</p><p>The petition will at least serve the purpose of resolving his leadership. A loss of 20 seats, which would cut the number of Lib Dem MPs by more than a third from the 57 elected in 2010, would be a blow to Clegg's authority. It would take the party well below the 46 seats won at the 1997 general election – the year of Paddy Ashdown's breakthrough.</p><p>Both Cable and the party president, Tim Farron, the two most likely candidates to replace Clegg, went out of their way to express their loyalty to him.</p><p>The local election results suggest that in Sheffield Hallam, Clegg's constituency, the party leader would have been re-elected, taking 53% of the vote, up 3.7%, with Labour on 32% and the Conservatives on 14.7%. But t The Lib Dems also said they won Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Eastleigh – scene of a Lib Dem byelection win in February last year when Mike Thornton held the seat, stabilising Clegg's leadership.</p><p>But the projections show the party will face a battle to hold on to vulnerable seats such as Hornsey and Wood Green in north London, Solihull in the West Midlands, Burnley, Bradford and East Manchester Withington.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9081949","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098246","internalContentCode":"437668176","publication":"The

Based on voting in English councils, the BBC estimated that Labour would get 322 seats, the Conservatives 255, Liberal Democrats 45 and other parties including Ukip 28. Sky News calculations also project a House of Commons with Labour on 322 seats, which is 64 up on 2010 and just four short of the 326 required for a working majority.</p><p>It estimated that the Tories would drop back 45 to 261, very close to Labour's 258 last time, suggesting that a general election today would produce a near mirror image of what took place four years ago. However, Sky predicted a bigger difference for the Lib Dems, which would shed 20 MPs to just 37.</p><p>Projecting general election results from local election polls is fraught; turnout would probably be double the local showing of 36%. Within that, mostly urban and English parts of Britain had a council vote this time around.</p><p>The European ballot boxes, which will be opened on Sunday night, are a sounder basis for projection as the whole of Britain had MEPs to elect. However, the remote Euro-parliament has always been prone to protest voting, which disappears in the real contest. People vote differently in local, European and general elections.</p><p>A Guardian analysis of local voting in the most marginal Westminster constituencies shows a mixed picture for Labour; the party has taken some wards in its 106 crucial battleground areas, but failed to gain ground or retreated in others.</p><p>However, Labour aides claimed the party finished top in 29 of its general election target seats. One of its  biggest coups was taking Amber Valley from the Conservatives, where Tory MP Nigel Mills has the 27th-slimmest majority in Labour's 11th most important target seat. Labour also won  Redbridge, the borough containing Tory MP Lee Scott's Ilford North seat, which is 83 on Ed Miliband's list.</p><p>Labour won two extra wards in Bury, where Tory David Nuttall is defending Bury North – 40th on the target list. The party also got five extra councillors in Enfield, where the north of the town is defended by another Conservative, Nick De Bois, and the 29th Labour target. The party also gained two wards to take Crawley from the Conservatives.</p><p>However, it failed to take several councils with no overall control that contain desirable Tory constituencies, including Simon Reevell's Dewsbury, which is 21 on the list, Stroud held by Neil Carmichael, which is 16th on the list, Gloucester defended by Richard Graham, at 38 on the list, and Swindon held by Robert Buckland and Justin Tomlinson at 55 and 102 on the list. Labour also lost control of Thurrock, its second best hope of a gain from Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price, and Great Yarmouth, the seat of Tory Brandon Lewis, which is 73 on the list.</p><p>Some of Labour's most impressive gains were in Lib Dem areas, suggesting it is in a good position to take Sarah Teather's seat in Brent Central, Simon Hughes's in Bermondsey, Lynne Featherstone's in Haringey and Julian Huppert's in Cambridge.</p><p>But the most striking feature of the forecast concerns the minor parties. These would get some 30 seats, only one more than last time, despite Ukip appealing to a slice of the electorate.</p><p>Psephologist Rob Ford, of Manchester University, said: \"People vote differently in local and national elections, so you have to be careful. But we can get some sense of the relative standing of the parties based on real votes.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9082835","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098287","internalContentCode":"437674260","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Projections suggest general election could produce a near mirror image of 2010, with Tories dropping back 45 seats and Labour up 64","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Labour likely to fall just short of Commons majority in 2015, experts say","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason and Tom Clark","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400871782508/Ed-Miliband-greeted-by-su-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"11","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T19:04:15Z","standfirst":"Projections suggest general election could produce a near mirror image of 2010, with Tories dropping back 45 seats and Labour up 64","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:06Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labur-likely-short-commons-majority-general-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/labur-likely-short-commons-majority-general-election","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","sectionName":"Politics","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/aug/13/labour-leadership-candidates-comparison-burnham-cooper-corbyn-kendall"}]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/rowena-mason","webTitle":"Rowena Mason","r2ContributorId":"58040","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899384228/Rowena-Mason.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png","firstName":"rowena","lastName":"mason","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Rowena Mason is a political correspondent for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowena-mason","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tomclark","webTitle":"Tom Clark","r2ContributorId":"19161","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/6/1425650454462/Tom-Clark.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/6/1425650470747/Tom-Clark-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"clark","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Clark is the editor of the Guardian's editorial column.

Some of the so-called strategists at the top of the Labour party think Ukip doing well is good news because it will damage Cameron. Well, they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world.\"</p><p>The backbencher spoke out as the leaders of Britain's three main political parties woke up to the uncomfortable fact that England had caught up with the devolved nations and now had four main parties.</p><p>By lunchtime Ukip had made nearly 100 gains and deprived Labour of control of Thurrock council in the marginal parliamentary seat the party hopes to recapture from the Tories in next year's general election. The party won around 25% of the vote in wards it contested.</p><p>Farage declared that Ukip had entered the \"Westminster hen house\" and was on course to win seats in parliament at next year's general election. His party performed strongly across England in the local elections.</p><p>Labour received major setbacks in its northern heartlands, where Ukip appeared to eat into its support, prompting the former minister Graham Stringer to warn that Miliband lacked \"immediate appeal\". By lunchtime, with counting continuing, Labour had gained 153 seats – well short of the 490 gains expected by the psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher.</p><p>But Labour pulled off coups by winning David Cameron's favourite London council, Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as Redbridge, Merton and Cambridge.</p><p>The Conservatives are set to lose control of at least eight councils. But they captured Kingston-upon-Thames from the Lib Dems.</p><p>David Cameron said he understood the message from the voters, who he said wanted the government to work harder on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. \"We will be working flat-out to demonstrate that we do have the answers for hard-working people,\" he said.</p><p>The prime minister rejected calls from Eurosceptic Tories to form a pact with Ukip before next year's general election. He told Sky News: \"We are the Conservative party. We don't do pacts and deals. We are fighting all-out for an all-out win at the next election.\"</p><p>The strongest internal party rumblings were in the Labour party as veteran figures raised questions about the leadership's campaign for the European and local elections. A debate that had been taking place behind closed doors burst into the open when Mann said the leadership should have done more to attack Ukip.</p><p>He told the Guardian: \"We should be attacking Ukip over their policies on the economy, on taxation, on their policies on the NHS and, in particular in the north of England, we should have billboards at this election with Nigel Farage with his Margaret Thatcher mug. It was not an accidental strategy, it was a deliberate strategy and the strategists have got a hell of a lot of explaining to do. They called this wrong.\"</p><p>The leadership insisted Miliband had attacked Ukip and had highlighted Farage's admiration for Thatcher. But the leadership took a deliberate decision to follow Barack Obama's approach to the insurgent Tea Party in the US.</p><p>A source said: \"You do not deal with an anti-politics party by calling them names. What you should do is call them out.\"</p><p>But Mann said he and other critics felt excluded from decision making. He said: \"There is a section of the Labour party whose views are not being listened to and the broad coalition that forms the Labour party is too narrow. Those of us who are oiks are not invited to contribute and are not listened to. If we continue to be sidelined then Labour can't win the election – our appeal is too narrow.</p><p>Farage travelled to the swing seat of Thurrock in Essex where Ukip deprived Labour of control of the council. \"The Ukip fox is in the Westminster hen house,\" the Ukip leader said. \"There are areas of the country where now we have got an imprint in local government. Under the first-past-the-post system we are serious players.\"</p><p>But Farage admitted Ukip had struggled to make an impression in London. \"London is a younger demographic but the real reason we are not as strong in London as we are just on the other side of the M25 is political parties rely very heavily on voluntary structure and our voluntary structure is 12 to 18 months behind the rest of the country. There is absolutely no reason why, in many parts of London, we can't do better next year than we have done this year.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9079444","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2097942","internalContentCode":"437638245","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"John

But outside the capital, it struggled to make expected gains in key targets such as Swindon, Walsall, Tamworth and Portsmouth, while losing Thurrock to no overall control because of Ukip votes.</p><p>Farage also ate into Conservative strongholds, causing the party to lose control of eight councils, including Maidstone, Southend-on-Sea, Castle Point, Basildon and Brentwood – the constituency of the local government secretary, Eric Pickles.</p><p>By 7am on Friday, with more than 100 of the 172 councils up for election in England and Northern Ireland still to declare, the Tories had lost 102 seats, Labour had gained 94, the Lib Dems had lost 83, Ukip had gained 86, the Greens had gained one and other parties were up seven.</p><p>The results of the European parliament elections, which also took place on Thursday, will be announced on Sunday, but the swell in votes for Ukip indicated that it was likely to have been a closely run contest with Labour for first place.</p><p>The biggest collapse in the share of the vote for the local elections appeared to be for the Liberal Democrats. The party lost Portsmouth council and looked set to lose Kingston to no overall control.</p><p>Ukip did not appear to have broken through in London, where it was polling in single digits, but the party took more than a third of the vote across some wards in Essex and big cities including Birmingham and Hull, where it previously had little or no presence. In Rotherham, Ukip is the official opposition after winning 10 seats and ousting several prominent Labour councillors including the deputy leader of the council.</p><p>Farage said it was a \"very good night\" as the party was now making an \"imprint\" in local government. He said the Ukip \"fox\" was now in the \"Westminster hen house\".</p><h2>Wakeup call for Labour </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609938'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400767026532/23e5f605-b4c9-467a-922f-024d95d2427a-460x276.jpeg' alt='Ed Miliband in Bloxwich' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ed Miliband campaigning in Bloxwich leisure centre, Walsall. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The early results indicated that the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, would face intense criticism during the next 48 hours, including over his personal performance and his appeal to working-class voters. Questions within the party are likely to focus on whether his campaign strategists realised early enough that Ukip posed a threat to Labour as much as to the Conservatives.</p><p>Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and Labour election co-ordinator, said there were \"grounds for optimism\" in key target seats and that the party was well-placed to win the general election next May.</p><p>But the night was described as a wake-up call for the main political parties by John Healey, Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne.</p><p>\"People are angry. They are saying they aren't hearing enough of what they feel in what we politicians are saying,\" he said. \"For me today was compounded when I was out knocking on doors and one man, a lifelong Labour voter, said to me: 'John, I'm voting for Ukip today. You all need a kicking.'\"</p><p>In Labour target seats further south and east, such as Portsmouth, a strong Ukip vote was destroying the party's hopes of making more than 400 council gains.</p><p>The leader of the Labour group in Portsmouth, John Ferrett, said Ukip's performance was \"causing mayhem\". Labour also suffered a blow in a key election battleground after the Conservatives held on to Swindon, days after Miliband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/20/ed-miliband-suffers-bad-day-on-campaign-trail\" title=\"\">embarrassingly failed to recognise the name of the party's group leader in the borough</a>.</p><p>But the man in question, Jim Grant, said Miliband's gaffe had not had an impact on Labour's disappointing showing in the Wiltshire town.</p><p>\"That's a big media event. I don't think it has affected what has happened here. I'm a big fan of Ed but we have all got to work harder to get our message across.\"</p><p>Labour had hoped that the council would at least slip into no overall control. In fact, the Tories ended up with 30 seats to Labour's 23 and the Lib Dems' four.</p><p>Both the Conservatives and Labour will have to think deeply about whether they can win back the Ukip vote, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/tories-ukip-pact-david-cameron-local-elections\" title=\"\">some rightwing Tory backbenchers urging Cameron to think how they can reunite the centre-right through some form of Ukip-Tory pact</a>.</p><p>The Labour MP Graham Stringer, a longstanding critic of party leaders, issued a savage attack on the quality of the Labour campaign, saying it was \"unforgivably unprofessional\", and asked why his aides had been unable to tell Miliband the price of bread.</p><h2>Liberal Democrat wipeout </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609939'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400772163317/73c50ab0-c8f0-4c2e-8cb8-940489a1314f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Clegg votes in Sheffield' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nick Clegg on his way to vote in the elections in Sheffield. Photograph: John Giles/PA</figcaption></figure><p>The Lib Dems were also braced for a poor performance, in a sign of how the burden of pain is being shared across Westminster. The business secretary, Vince Cable, admitted it was going to be a difficult night for the junior party in the coalition.</p><p>He said the Lib Dems would take a \"kicking\" for being in government as he appeared to distance himself from Nick Clegg by saying the party leader had decided to focus the Lib Dem campaign on the EU. Speaking on Sky News, Cable said: \"The party leader took the gamble of fighting a European election on the issue of Europe, which is a very unusual thing to do in the UK. We'll see.\"</p><p>Cable said that all the main parties would suffer poor results. But he added: \"We are in government. We take a kicking for the things that government does that are unpopular. It does reflect on us.\"</p><p>He said he had not been comfortable about forming a coalition with the Tories. \"We put personal preferences aside and deal with it professionally … We have done massive things in government. We have risen to the challenge.\"</p><p>One longstanding critic of Clegg, the former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, called for him to go as the very first results showed the party's vote had collapsed, even though it was holding some wards in Lib Dem constituencies in Birmingham and Redcar.</p><p>Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem international development minister, said Ukip's \"stunning success\" was a protest at the dissembling of the political class. She added: \"We are so guarded and so on message that we have lost our humanity. We are the whipping boy of the coalition.\"</p><h2>Tories look towards Newark byelection </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437609940'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400746193874/9fde0cae-9521-49fa-bd4b-8d15647715b6-460x276.jpeg' alt='David Cameron and his wife Samantha.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>David Cameron and his wife Samantha.

that the Ukip bubble could be burst.</p><p>But the prime minister will have to endure the possibility that Ukip will be able to claim on Sunday night that it has achieved its main political objective of winning the poll in the European parliamentary

That surely pushes towards a coupon of some kind.\"</p><p>The MP for north east Somerset was referring to the general election of 1918, dubbed the \"coupon election\" in which the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George and the Conservative leader issued a letter of endorsement to candidates who supported them.</p><p>But Shapps rejected a pact out of hand. He told the BBC: \"We are not going to have pacts or joint candidates. It can't happen on a technical basis because we do not allow joint candidates to stand. We are a single party, no other party would have joint candidates. It is not going to happen. We are the Conservative party. We are the best chance of offering an in/out referendum.\"</p><p>The Tories agreed a pact with the Ulster Unionist party in 2010.</p><p>Shapps spoke out after Douglas Carswell, a leading Eurosceptic who favours a UK exit from the EU, suggested that Ukip could decide not to stand against Tories who voted in favour of an EU referendum in a Commons vote in 2011. Cameron now favours a referendum, but was opposed to one in 2011.</p><p>Carswell wrote on a Daily Telegraph blog: \"We need a pact with Ukip. If David Cameron is as serious about an in/out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel Farage is as serious about an exit as he claims, the two of them need to do a deal.</p><p>\"The law already allows joint candidates. We have a list of MPs on both sides of the House who in October 2011 showed that they are serious about securing an EU referendum. If the alternative is Ed Miliband as prime minister, and no chance of a referendum, surely a pact is worth

And who can forget the fiasco of UKIP&apos;s &quot;carnival&quot;, which was picketed by anti-racism campaigners.<br /></p> <p>Mackenzie told the Guardian: “This has been one of the worst elections I have ever known in terms of people saying Ukip is racist … this has really damaged Ukip. All sections of the media and all three main parties have come together to devise a way to demean Ukip and divide the people. What I am most hurt about is seeing a white person comment about racism. The type of racism I face is on a daily basis.”﻿</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a361ee23-596f-4c99-a4bf-bf3a9fbbc734\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400813001888/e83f389f-98dc-47c3-a2e3-f074cb1b1c91-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Pelling, a Labour candidate in Croydon, waits for results of the counting of votes in local elections.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Pelling, a Labour candidate in Croydon, waits for results of the counting of votes in local elections.

Labour finished with 35 to the Tories' 25 and the Lib Dems' surviving three.</p><p>The men and women in red rosettes who prowled and huddled on the floor of the Grade-II-listed town hall in Ilford, where the count took place, kept their lips tight throughout the night except to say that it was going to be close. But now the council's new leader-in-waiting, Jas Athwal, can take his party into new governing territory, proving that the fringes of the metropolis, its more diverse parts at least, are increasingly ready to embrace it.</p><p>Labour is putting its success in Redbridge down to old-fashioned doorstep campaigning, listening hard and offering radical and practical policies.</p><p>Wes Streeting, Athwal's young deputy and parliamentary candidate for the Labour target of Ilford North, stressed nitty-gritty issues such as residents' dissatisfaction with cuts to street cleaning services and his party's promise to put that right. \"We offered clear and specific pledges that we know we can honour.

From a standing start, Ukip made progress, not winning any seats but pushing the Tories into third place in four of the 19 wards up for grabs. To complete an unsatisfactory day for the Tories, the party's leader, Rob Garnham, was ousted after 18 years as a councillor.</p><p>The Cheltenham Liberal Democrat MP, Martin Horwood, expressed delight at the result. \"I think it shows we're in the right place for next year's general election,\" he said.</p><p>Horwood said he believed the general election in the town would still be a two-horse race between the Tories and Lib Dems and partly blamed the media's \"obsession\" with Farage for Ukip's success. \"Anyone who gets that sort of coverage is going to have a surge,\" he said. \"But I think this will be their high water mark.\"</p><p>Steve Jordan, the leader of the council, said the borough election campaign had been a \"dry-run\" for next year's general election battle. \"We have a hard-working MP and a council that people think is doing the right thing most of the time. What's happening nationally doesn't help but this result shows we can still do well in places where we work hard.\"</p><p>Ukip performed best in areas dominated by former council house estates that were once Labour strongholds but latterly have been held by the Lib Dems.</p><p>Christina Simmonds, the Ukip branch chairman, said the party had focused on local issues – complaints over changes to the road system in the centre of town, car parking, leisure facilities. But she said the party's core messages on Europe and immigration were chiming with voters.</p><p>\"I think people are also realising that we are not the idiots the other parties and the media want to make us out to be,\" she said. \"They patronise us and try to make out we don't know what we're talking about just because they don't agree with us. But what we're saying is making sense to good, ordinary people.\"</p><p>Garnham, the ousted Tory leader, claimed the Lib Dems had gunned for him because they wanted to show they could reverse the national trend against Nick Clegg's party. \"They targeted me from day one; they wanted me out.

He later blamed the poor result on &quot;biradari&quot; clan politics among the Pakistani community.</p> <p>Respect has no representatives in Bradford&apos;s town hall since its five sitting councillors – elected in the euphoric aftermath of Galloway&apos;s byelection win in 2012 – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/bradford-respect-party-councillors-resign-george-galloway\">quit the party</a> last year. They now sit as an Independent grouping.</p> <p>The biggest majority in Bradford was won by Labour&apos;s Imran Hussain in the Toller ward, who lost so catastrophically to Galloway in the Bradford West byelection. But on Friday, after polling 4,850 votes to Respect&apos;s 660, Hussain vowed to fight Galloway again in next year&apos;s general election -if selected as Labour&apos;s parliamentary candidate (and if Galloway choses to stand once more).</p> <p>Hussain said: “The Respect party in Bradford West is finished. George Galloway came to town two years ago and made a load of false promises. He hasn&apos;t delivered and he&apos;s never here. People have realised they want local representation. On the doorstep people have been asking me to stand in 2015 and I think I can be a strong voice for the city.”</p> <p>Dave Green, the Labour leader of the council, said: “I think this election shows that the people of Bradford have rejected Respect. George Galloway and his cronies are a busted flush. Politics in Bradford will be better without them.”</p> <p>Galloway did not attend the count, but wrote on Twitter: “It&apos;s with regret I inform you that feudal reactionary &apos;biradari&apos; Labour politics is back in power in Bradford City Council. God help us. Thanks to the thousands who voted Respect yesterday and the candidates who braved foul weather and worse. We lost but we&apos;ll be back.”</p> <p>After winning Bradford West in what he later dubbed the Bradford Spring, Galloway claimed to have “smashed” clan-based bloc voting.</p> <p>At the count, politicians from both Labour and the Conservatives claimed clan politics were still very much in operation in Bradford. Barry Whitaker, chair of Bradford Tories, blamed his party&apos;s woeful showing on &quot;Asian politics&quot;. The Conservatives managed to lose control of Bradford&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.bradford.gov.uk/asp/elections/resultsDetailL.asp?id=99&amp;eid=10\">Bowling and Barkerend</a> ward by more than 2,200 votes, polling a risible 249 to Labour&apos;s 2, 532. In 2010, Tory Zameer Hussain Shah won with 2,357 votes (36.6% share).</p> <p>Whitaker said of the loss: &quot;It&apos;s Asian politics, I&apos;m afraid. In Bradford we have a lot of politics based on family membership or clan membership.&quot;</p> <p>Despite high hopes of walking away with five or more seats in Bradford, Ukip only gained one, in the Keighley West ward, which it took from Labour with a majority of 166.</p> <p>The anti-Eu party hoped to dislodge the Conservative opposition leader Glenn Miller, but he clung on to his Worth Valley seat with a 215 majority.</p> <p>Ukip were also optimistic in Bradford&apos;s Queensbury about dethroning Paul Crombie, an ex BNP councillor who left the far-right party in 2011 after becoming a Christian and becoming disillusioned with party politics. He and his wife, also originally elected on a BNP ticket, both turned Independent a few years ago. But on Thursday he increased his majority after vowing to fight purely on local issues.</p> <p>Labour now has 46 seats on the city council, giving them a majority of one and overall control.

But on Friday morning, Nigel Farage was credited with an act of even greater political absurdity for a rightwing leader: helping drive out the Conservatives and paving the way for a Labour victory.</p><p>Long after dawn broke in the south London borough, the Conservative leader of eight years, Mike Fisher, conceded a crushing defeat to Labour, saying it had not won the vote but Ukip had lost it for the Conservatives. It was not entirely true – Labour increased its vote in key wards and delivered turnouts of close to 50% in some cases. But with Ukip consistently coming second and third in wards there was truth in the Conservative warning of \"Vote Ukip, get Labour\".</p><p>\"When we were canvassing nobody was saying they were for Ukip because it's still a guilty secret,\" said Fisher. \"But the level of support has come out today. Voters are using this as an opportunity to rebel and I hope that when it comes to the general election people will look at the policies of the main parties. The annoying thing here is that Ukip have lots of votes but no seats. Many of those Ukip voters are Conservatives and they will be horrified to wake up this morning to a Labour council.\"</p><p>That annoyance at Ukip's \"cranks and gadflies\" disruption of the normal order of politics threatens to turn into something more serious if Ukip's momentum is maintained into the 2015 election. All around the counting hall, beleaguered Tories muttered about Ukip's destructive impact, taking their votes if not their seats. Deep sighs could be heard from the defeated candidates, many of whom seemed dazed by the scale of the beating.</p><p>\"My hope is the Ukip bubble won't last that long,\" said Tim Pollard, outgoing deputy leader of the council. \"It seems people feel entitled to vote a little irresponsibly. That's just the rough and tumble of politics.\"</p><p>Labour has been out of power in Croydon since 2006 and came back with a bang, taking a 10-seat majority, overturning a four-seat deficit at the 2010 election. It campaigned hard in key areas on housing and employment opportunities and won seven seats from the Conservatives, wiping them out completely in two wards. It was a blow for Gavin Barwell, the Tory MP for Croydon Central who oversaw the campaign and who had to watch as marginal wards in his marginal constituency fell to Labour. Labour's candidate for the general election, Sarah Jones, was left buoyed with confidence for next May.</p><p>\"We are going to have a historic victory for Labour here in Croydon,\" said the Labour leader Tony Newman as he won his own seat early on Friday morning. \"We have to make sure that we start next week to clean up Croydon. We took the decision early on to fight on a positive manifesto and to bring back the decency to politics and we faced a negative campaign from our opponents. I think this victory is not down to Ukip. It may have had some impact, but I think it is voters coming out and backing our plans for Croydon.\" Among the victorious Labour candidates was Emily Benn, 24, granddaughter of Tony Benn and the fifth generation of her family to have entered politics.</p><p>Ukip stressed it had also taken votes from Labour, notably from what it terms \"the left-behinds\" – older working-class voters.</p><p>\"The Conservatives sounded their own death knell by running an administration that lacked transparency and accountability,\" said Peter Staveley, chairman of Ukip for south and central Croydon. Ukip had targeted Croydon with 42 candidates, including nine black candidates in an effort to reinforce Farage's insistence that his party is not racist. It was also a response to the fact that Croydon has one of the UK's fastest-rising ethnic minority populations. In 2001 70% of the south London borough's population was white.

I'm a big fan of Ed but we've all got to work harder to get our message across.\"</p><p>Swindon is an important battleground . The Tories began the night in control of the council with a majority of just one (Conservative: 29, Labour 23, Lib Dem four, Independent one). Labour hoped that the council would at least slip into no overall control, but the Tories ended up with 30 seats to Labour's 23 and the Lib Dems' four.</p><p>The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, did not visit Swindon during the local election campaign but his party made strong gains, finishing in second place in some Tory and Labour stronghold wards.</p><p>John Short, the leader of Ukip in Swindon, said the party had made huge progress in the town. \"Locally and nationally, people are looking for a change.\" he said.</p><p>Conceding Ukip had done well, Grant said: \"Ukip's good performance shows that the voters are disaffected with the mainstream political parties. We really do need to look at a way of reaching our core voters. We have to reconnect with working people in a way that clearly we're not doing at the moment.\"</p><p>Grant added  that the Tory vote had held up while Labour seemed to have suffered in marginal seats. \"There's a lot of work to be done before next year's general election,\" he said.</p><p>Short, a former council deputy chief executive, said Ukip party membership had increased by 50% during the campaign as the party fought on local issues including the shortage of council houses. Concerns about immigration were also a frequent subject of conversation on the doorstep, he said, adding: \"We aren't against immigration; we want to control it. We're not racist, we're not fascist, we're not homophobic.\"</p><p>The result in Swindon is important because it is regarded as a barometer town – whoever wins in its two seats at the general election wins power at Westminster.</p><p>It was also particularly important for Labour to do well because it would be an encouraging sign that they could win seats in the south of England at next year's general election.</p><p>But although the Tories have introduced some unpopular policies, such as charging £40 a year for green waste collections, and are planning to lease out all their leisure centres and golf course, Labour accepted it had failed to make enough progress.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9078498","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2097642","internalContentCode":"437595115","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Conservative party retains control of the town hall, days after gaffe by Labour leader Ed Miliband","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Labour fails to oust Tories in Swindon","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Steven Morris","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400806426087/Ed-Miliband-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T00:54:21Z","standfirst":"Conservative party retains control of the town hall, days after gaffe by Labour leader Ed Miliband","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T01:50:55Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-conservatives-swindon-council-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-conservatives-swindon-council-election","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/swindon","webTitle":"Swindon","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/swindon","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/swindon","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/stevenmorris","webTitle":"Steven Morris","rcsId":"GNL004769","r2ContributorId":"16487","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/steven_morris_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"morris","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Steven Morris is a reporter for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">Guardian</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevenmorris","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/stevenmorris","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}]},{"id":"politics/2014/may/23/local-elections-ukip-opposition-rotherham","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-437866744","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400808517211/Ukip-members-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","displayCredit":"true","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Rob Stothard","altText":"Ukip members","suppliersReference":"493532893","height":"54","credit":"Rob Stothard/Getty Images","caption":"Ukip won seven seats from Labour and two from the Tories in Rotherham.

The assertive victory was seized on by the anti-EU party as proof that it appeals to working-class Labour voters as well as disaffected Tories. The results far exceeded Ukip hopes and Labour's worst fears.</p><p>The anti-EU party won seven seats from Labour and two from the Conservatives and held the one seat it won in a byelection last year. It also scooped up votes from the disintegrating British National Party, which had two councillors in its 2008 peak. Labour will keep control of the council it has run for 80 years, but Ukip is now the official opposition.</p><p>Deputy leader Jahangir Akhtar, first elected in 2000, lost his seat after being embroiled in Rotherham's child sex grooming scandal. He was accused of covering up abuse by his cousin – a charge he has always denied. He stepped down for several months while police investigated and was reinstated late year when detectives decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute.</p><p>He will lose his £21,443 salary after being ousted in his Rotherham West ward by Maureen Vines, whose husband, Caven Vines, held his seat in Rawmarsh. Last year's byelection saw Vines become Ukip's first directly elected councillor in Rotherham.</p><p>Another high-profile victim was Richard Russell, the Labour member for Rother Vale and cabinet member for waste. Responding to the defeat, John Healey, Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne, said: \"It's a message for all the political parties: wake up. People are angry. They are saying they aren't hearing enough of what they feel in what we are politicians are saying.\"</p><p>He added: \"For me today was compounded when I was out knocking on doors and one man, a lifelong Labour voter, said to me: 'John, I'm voting for Ukip today. You all need a kicking'.\"</p><p>Roger Stone, the leader of Rotherham council, said Ukip's victory was part of a national trend rather than something particular about Rotherham. \"Most of the things Ukip were saying were about immigration and Europe, which they can do nothing about [at a local council level],\" he said.</p><p>Asked whether it was good for democracy that Rotherham would have a proper opposition for the first time in a while, Stone disagreed, saying: \"We've always had opposition.\"</p><p>Until Thursday Labour had 57 councillors in Rotherham, with the Conservatives on four and one Independent and one Ukip.</p><p>One of the new Ukip councillors, local businessman John Turner – who served as a Tory councillor before quitting David Cameron's party a few years ago after a row involving his reselection – said Ukip had done so well because people were fed up of Labour in Rotherham, regularly singled out as a \"Rotten Borough\" in Private Eye.</p><p>He said: \"We won for two reasons. Immigration issues. And a common enemy: the Labour party in Rotherham. They have been in power for 80 years. They feel they own Rotherham. They've got in debt, they are doing everything wrong. They don't allow even a degree of democracy in the council chamber: no videoing, no proper minute keeping, no recording of meetings. We are going to try to force Rotherham council to become more democratic. We still expect to be treated with ignominy but hopefully as a consolidated group we will be able to fight for a glimmer of democracy.\"</p><p>Ukip's local party has grown in size and confidence since coming a strong second in a byelection at the end of 2012 (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/30/labour-rotherham-byelection-ukip). Labour held the seat following the resignation of Denis MacShane over his expenses, but Jane Collins – who is top of Ukip's list in Yorkshire for the european elections – managed 21%, a steep increase on her party's performance in the seat in the 2010 general election.</p><p>But even local organiser John Wilkinson admitted Thursday's haul of ten wins far exceeded expectations. On polling day he said the party had only properly targeted four seats in Rotherham, despite managing to field candidates in all 21 wards up for grabs.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9078517","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2097651","internalContentCode":"437596543","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Anti-EU party celebrates after gaining nine seats on South Yorkshire council in addition to the one it won in a byelection</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Local elections: Ukip becomes official opposition in Rotherham","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Helen Pidd, northern editor","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400808520002/Ukip-members-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T01:29:00Z","standfirst":"Anti-EU party celebrates after gaining nine seats on South Yorkshire council in addition to the one it won in a byelection","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-08-20T15:41:29Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-elections-ukip-opposition-rotherham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/local-elections-ukip-opposition-rotherham","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","sectionName":"Politics","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/aug/13/labour-leadership-candidates-comparison-burnham-cooper-corbyn-kendall"}]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/helenpidd","webTitle":"Helen Pidd","r2ContributorId":"19855","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422363522583/Helen-Pidd.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422363539931/Helen-Pidd-R.png","firstName":"helen","lastName":"pidd","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Helen Pidd is northern editor of the Guardian, based in Manchester.

    </video><p>The fox is in the Westminster henhouse. The first tremors of the political earthquake have been felt. The canary may even be asphyxiated in the coal mine. Whatever the chosen metaphor, four-party politics has arrived in Britain, and the only question is whether it will ever go away.</p><p>Labour can fairly claim it is doing marginally better than the first local election results indicated on Thursday night, but Nigel Farage can reasonably say now that Ukip has an imprint in local government under a first-past-the-post system. And he is promising that the imprint will deepen, and provide the basis to win constituency seats in the general election.</p><p>The results have also confirmed, if confirmation was needed, that Ukip can damage Labour as much as the Conservatives, meaning both main parties need to throw out the old methods to project swings and to forecast the marginal seats it will gain.</p><p>For instance, in the West Midlands a strong Ukip performance has meant Labour has not made the gains it had hoped in Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall. \"Worcester man\" has also not gone Labour.</p><p>In traditional Labour heartlands, such as Rotherham, Ukip came first in 10, and 2nd in 11 of the 21 seats it fought. Equally, Ukip's performance in the east of England suggests some of the gains the Tories need to secure an overall Commons majority will be elusive. Thatcher's \"(South) Essex man\" is morphing into Ukip man. Thurrock, Basildon and Castle Point are all in play for the UK Independence party.</p><p>The exception for the moment seems to be London. The capital has its own house prices, its own multi-cultural population and now, almost its own politics. The city that spawned the recession seems to be the part of the country least hit by its consequences, and most willing to back Labour. There will be exceptions, such as Barking, where the former BNP vote is likely to head to Ukip.</p><p>The impressive Labour gains in London also reflect the strength of the activist base in the capital where its \"get out the vote\" operation had some successes.</p><p>One Labour strategist insisted: \"I would rather be where we are this morning than where [Conservative party campaign consultant] Lynton Crosby is. There is a massive wave sweeping over politics called four-party politics. But there is also a strong current to Labour. We think we will make over 200 gains.\"</p><p>The sources continued to insist that Labour was winning where it mattered and pointed to good results outside London in Cambridge, Lincoln, Amber Valley Peterborough and Carlisle.</p><p>Labour accepts that by the time of the general election next year the Ukip vote will not have shrunk back to the 3% it secured in the 2010 general election, but it still believes that the bulk of the Ukip damage then will be inflicted on the Conservatives.</p><p>Still, there will be a deep inquest into the Labour campaign, and why it has been as much the victim of the anti-politics mood as the governing parties. The doorstep issue of Ed Miliband exists. Parts of the campaign malfunctioned: if you are planning to take Swindon council, you need to know the name of the Labour leader on said council; if you are campaigning on the cost of living, you need to know the cost of living.</p><p>But Miliband insists he understands the discontent in the communities that have voted Ukip and is assembling the practical policies to address an anger with politics that has been building for decades. It is the approach Barack Obama took with the Tea Party in the US. It means no name-calling, but addressing the causes of the discontent instead.</p><p>That said, Miliband put out a lot of policy in this campaign and it seems not to have had enough of an effect on the doorstep. The Labour backbench will now demand a much more explicit attack on Ukip.</p><p>Some Labour MPs, such as John Spellar, John Healey, Peter Hain and John Mann, have long been arguing for the party to go on the front foot about Ukip, exposing them as modern-day Thatcherites bent on flat taxes and NHS privatisation. At one point, there was a plan to go after Ukip at the start of the campaign, but it was shelved.</p><p>Miliband has only a year to win over this disillusioned vote.</p><p>The chair of the British Future thinktank, Sunder Katwala, has already divided Ukip support into three groups, each of broadly similar size: \"tactical Ukip\", \"engage-able Ukip\" and \"rejectionist Ukip\".</p><p>Tactical Ukip was simply lending its vote to Farage for the purposes of the European campaign, he says. Rejectionist Ukip is irreconcilable with the political class. Engage-able Ukip voters, he says, \"are those who could vote for a major party in 2015 which is still making a credible pitch for a broad enough electoral coalition to seek to govern. These are the voters who will make the difference between Ukip scoring 6% or reaching 10-12% or higher in the general election, and may determine the success or failure for their major rivals too\" .</p><p>Cameron thinks that by pointing to the threat of Miliband in Downing Street he has the secret weapon to win back defectors to Ukip. Equally, Miliband thinks traditional Labour voters will recoil at the thought of a second term for Cameron, and Ukip's appeal to older white working-class men does not mean Labour will lose heartland seats.</p><p>The next year will reveal the truth.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9080132","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2097949","internalContentCode":"437639535","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Both

On paper, Labour clearly won. They have gained more than 250 seats, and they are easily ahead on projected national share. If Britons voted like this in a general election, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. But it hasn't felt like a victory for them. If you want to know who feels as if they've won an election, ignore what politicians say, turn the volume down and look at their faces on TV. Who's happiest? It's definitely Ukip first, then probably the Conservatives, then Labour, then the Lib Dems. That's because, given the likelihood of the gap between Labour and the Conservatives closing between now and 2015, Labour know this isn't good enough to offer a strong chance of victory.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. </strong>Ukip's chances of winning the European elections don't look as good as they did on Thursday evening. Their national vote share is down six points compared to last year, and, although there must be some people who voted Ukip in the Euros and for another party in the locals, there must be a chance that the polls saying Ukip would win have got it wrong.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong> Labour now fully realise that Ukip presents them with a serious electoral threat. This shouldn't be a surprise. Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Revolt-Right-Explaining-Extremism-Democracy/dp/0415661501/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399622168&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain\">have written a very good book</a> making this very case. But it has taken a while for the message to get through.</p><p></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Labour's post-election inquest will probably be more serious than the Conservatives'. Journalists expected these elections to trigger a mini crisis in the Conservative party, but there has been no evidence of that at all. A few Eurosceptics have renewed their call for a pact with Ukip, but this is an absolute non-starter, and they know it; generally, the Eurosceptics have decided not to cause trouble. But the public comments from Labour figures suggest the party is going to conduct a proper postmortem, not into Ed Miliband's leadership (they are stuck with him, for better or worse), but into whether their Ukip strategy is correct. And that's because ...</p><p></p><p><strong>5.</strong> None of the parties have a clue what to do about Ukip. Politicians from all the main parties have been saying much the same thing: that voters have sent them a message, and that they must listen. But there is no real agreement what the message is, or what they should do about it.</p><p></p><p><strong>6.</strong> A second hung parliament looks increasingly inevitable. Four-party politics is increasingly entrenched in English politics (as in Scottish and Welsh politics, only they have a different four parties), and that makes it harder for any of them to win outright.</p><p></p><p><strong>7.</strong> The Lib Dems are vulnerable even in their strongholds. Last year they thought they had hit rock bottom in the local elections. They hadn't. Although they are holding on in some Lib Dem areas, in others they are losing seats. The BBC say even Vince Cable would lose his seat on the basis of today's results.</p><p></p><p><strong>8.</strong> London really is different from the rest of the country electorally. It seems to be the only place in England impervious to Ukip's charms. Like Scotland. (Perhaps if Scotland goes independent we Londoners could join up with them, share the pound, and leave the rest of England with something Ukip-ish, like the groat?)</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9083191","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098268","internalContentCode":"437672168","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Ukip

I couldn't have been more eager to criticise Nigel Farage for racism, and in doing so I made a fundamental mistake.</p><p></p><p>Until we understand Ukip voters and until we respect the motivations behind their choices, they will continue to rise in the polls. People do not vote for Ukip in such numbers because they are racist. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/24/george-osbornes-speech-at-conservativehome-conference-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">Lord Ashcroft's polling</a> shows that 24% of the people who voted Ukip on 22 May would prefer Ed Miliband to David Cameron as prime minister. Eight per cent had previously voted Liberal Democrat.</p><p>This isn't a party fuelled by racism but one that taps into the feeling of disenfranchisement among the less well-off. Ukip's tone resonates with those who might have been traditional working-class Labour and Conservative voters. Support for Ukip on the doorstep was voiced as support for a party that understood the concerns of ordinary voters, and the three main parties need to learn this lesson.</p><p></p><p>Southwark used to be a Lib Dem stronghold. I was astonished by the numbers of doors opened by people who previously voted Lib Dem but were going to vote Ukip. When asked to unpack that, the ones who generously gave their time explained that their concern was about immigration. They said that the area had been filled with migrants pushing up the cost of housing  and preventing their children from finding homes. Southwark's popularity as a place to live, because it's near the City, has brought in large numbers of young professionals – many of whom I spoke to, who had come to work in London from abroad. More established working-class residents don't feel squeezed out culturally by immigration but economically.</p><p></p><p>There is an argument raging about why London doesn't reflect the national polls when it comes to Ukip support. The party didn't do anywhere near as well in the capital as it did elsewhere. Some claim it shows how ethnically diverse London is, and how tolerant. I don't believe that London is any more tolerant than any other parts of Britain. What it has is wealth, and a property market that has pushed out working-class residents. Thus in London Ukip has both smaller networks of activists and fewer people likely to vote for it.</p><p></p><p>When the main parties are able to unveil policies that assure the least well-off that they are on their side, when the housing market doesn't make people scared that their children will never own homes, then support for Ukip will collapse. When Ukip supporters cite immigration, it's not because they don't like the faces of people moving in down the road, it's because they fear the road is now unaffordable for their children to live on.</p><p></p><p>I made the mistake of calling Ukip racist on the basis of the party's incompetence at selecting good candidates, but demonising its supporters means alienating them further from the political establishment. We would do better to get behind them and bring them back to parties that don't just reflect their concerns, but have the competence to do something about them.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9086553","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098845","internalContentCode":"437813995","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>Rupert

The Tories would drop back 45 to 261, very close to Labour's 258 last time around, suggesting that a general election today would produce something of a mirror image of the one that took place four years ago.</p><p>There would be a bigger difference for the Lib Dems, who would shed 20 MPs, more than a third of their total, being reduced to 37. From Berwick to Birmingham and on to Bude (in North Cornwall), Nick Clegg's party would suffer defeats on this sort of a result, if the swing were uniform. But then the patchy nature of the town hall results strongly suggests the swing would not be uniform, making it hard to make confident projections of a loss in anything but the most marginal seat.</p><p>The most striking feature of the forecast of all, however, concerns the minor parties. The assorted parliamentary \"others\" would come back with just 30 seats, only one more than last time, a reminder that despite the great slice of the electorate that Ukip appealed to, the voting system for the Commons – which requires parties to concentrate enough votes to come out ahead in particular locations – still represents a formidable obstacle in the way of insurgent parties seeking to break the mould.</p><p>The psephologist Rob Ford, of Manchester University, says: \"We know that people vote differently in local and national elections, so you have to be careful. But we can get some sense of the relative standing of the parties based on real votes, which is always interesting.\"</p><p>In particular, Ford – who has co-authored a new book on Ukip – believes that the geography of the council results can tell us something about the battleground for 2015. \"There is an increasingly stark contrast between diverse metropolitan England and particularly London on the one hand\", he says, \"and what we might call 'middle England' small towns on the other. Labour is shoring up well big cities, but is – just like the Tories – being squeezed by Ukip elsewhere.\"</p><p>For 2015, Ford believes, this suggests there are at least large parts of the country where Ukip's strength in voting for councils could play an important role in 2015.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9080130","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098081","internalContentCode":"437651848","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"It is not easy to extrapolate from local election results, but these ones could suggest Labour falling just short of a working majority","allowUgc":"false","headline":"What do the council results mean for the 2015 general election?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Tom Clark","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400857656826/Ukip-supporters-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"72422","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-26T15:11:24Z","standfirst":"It is not easy to extrapolate from local election results, but these ones could suggest Labour falling just short of a working majority","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/what-council-results-mean-2015-general-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/may/23/what-council-results-mean-2015-general-election","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/local-elections","webTitle":"Local elections","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/local-elections","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/society","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government","type":"keyword","sectionId":"society","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment","sectionName":"Society","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/localgovernment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/localgovernment","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","sectionName":"Politics","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/aug/13/labour-leadership-candidates-comparison-burnham-cooper-corbyn-kendall"}]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/liberaldemocrats","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/liberaldemocrats","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tomclark","webTitle":"Tom Clark","r2ContributorId":"19161","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/6/1425650454462/Tom-Clark.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/6/1425650470747/Tom-Clark-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"clark","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Clark is the editor of the Guardian's editorial column.

It was almost as unpleasant as some of the views of the Ukip leader and the out-there candidates who were crash-landing in the news – a collective outbreak of sneering, which started to transcend the party itself and blur into a generalised mockery of anyone minded to support it. You could see it most clearly in the rash of satirical(ish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhyImVotingUkip?src=hash\" title=\"\">#WhyImVotingUkip tweets</a> that are piling up even now (eg \"Because our true British maypoles are set to be completely replaced by foreign gay Poles within 5 years\" or \"Because I'm uneducated,uncultured, white and old\") and it's not pretty: an apparent belief that to vote UKIP is to be an idiot of some description, either bigoted or duped, and worthy of little more than contempt.</p><p>If you remain of that opinion, you should stop reading and go somewhere else. As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\" title=\"\">local election results come in and Ukip's numbers continue to look remarkable</a>, the rest of us should maybe pause for thought and realise that something rather sobering is afoot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/04/ukip-farage-local-election-results\" title=\"\">as happened in the 2012 county council elections</a>, only more so. If a party is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/22/local-election-results-2014-live\" title=\"\">averaging 47% of the vote in a Labour stronghold</a>  such as Rotherham, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27533313\" title=\"\">toppling Tories from their perches in crucial Conservative territory</a> and apparently heading towards first place in the European contest, something important is obviously afoot. Moreover, if people are supporting Ukip in such large numbers – even after the media's massed guns have been rattling at it for weeks – it is probably time to drop all the sneering and think about why.</p><p>So far, neither side of politics has even the beginnings of an adequate response. Listening to senior Conservatives this morning (Michael Gove on BBC Breakfast was a good example), you would think they simply need to further turn the screw on welfare and immigration and everything will be OK. Equally, when the left pipes up about Ukip voters' worries being reducible to either the \"cost of living crisis\" or a tangle of concerns around job markets and public services, they get nowhere near the whole story.</p><p>The truth is that the Ukip surge is built around a multitude of factors that wrong-foot both left and right. And on my side of politics, the most difficult stuff to process is about things from which the left tends to avert its eyes: notions of identity and belonging, anxiety about accelerated change and the fact that that leftie hooray-word \"community\" can actually have chewy connotations. Crudely put, when you meet a Labour-Ukip switcher who expresses worries about immigration, you can't simply reduce what they say to falling wages and the lack of social housing.</p><p>Immigration and people's responses to it are complex beyond words: they test just about every article of faith across the political spectrum.</p><p>I am writing this piece in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/ukip-little-england-east-anglia-lincolnshire-elections\" title=\"\">Great Yarmouth, where the borough council count has yet to start</a>, but a few hours spent talking to people outside polling stations underlined all those themes, and more. What was most telling, though, was the fact that so many people were engaged with what was happening and under precious few illusions. Given that Ukip is a non-story in London, the metropolitan media will presumably continue to misunderstand it and patronise its voters, but one misapprehension needs to be corrected, and fast: Ukip voters do not form some blind personality cult and neither are they unaware of the often unpleasant views of the party's people. Mention Farage and you hear things such as, \"I don't trust him either\". Yet again, \"complicated\" doesn't even begin to describe it.</p><p>This is not some bolt from the blue. The two – no, three – party system is in deep crisis. It looks like there is no way back to the world where either Labour or the Tories compete to break through the magic 40% barrier and all is largely well. The Liberal Democrats look to have had it. Meanwhile, Scotland is threatening to pull away from the UK and the result of next year's general election, let alone what will happen in its aftermath, is anyone's guess.</p><p>In my hotel room – at a ring-road Travelodge, in case anyone was wondering – a succession of Westminster faces are blathering on the television and I have just received a text message from an activist friend in response to one I sent which read, \"I love the smell of toast in the morning\". He wrote: \"We can all smell the coffee. Ed, Cameron et al refuse to act because it's all about them. How long can it last?\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9078613","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2097730","internalContentCode":"437614639","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>John

do hope you're sitting down, because as political slogans go, the following is likely to excite you. So hold on to your hats, and here goes: we need a new kind of apathy. With just a year to go before the general election, I can think of no single more achievable boost to our democracy than having a none-of-the-above box added to every 2015 ballot paper, and an amendment to media regulations insisting that the disaffected be formally represented in all TV studios and other forums in the runup to polling day. They may well be the biggest political demographic.</p><p>At the time of writing, it was unclear how many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/local-election-results-live\" title=\"\">people voted</a> in the local and European elections, but one thing was crystal: the vast majority didn't. It doesn't look to have been a historically low showing, estimated at about 36%. But with predictions that next year's big one could rival the philosophically illegitimising depth of Labour taking 35% of a 61% turnout in 2005, how long should politicians be ethically permitted to ignore such a vast constituency?</p><p>A very long time indeed, were they to get their way. It is notable that the more obvious apathy seems to have become, via social media and so on, the more perversely inward looking politicians have got. They pretend they haven't noticed it; they refuse to conduct anything remotely resembling proper research into why it might be happening; they talk in ever more weird language. The only thing more pronounced than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/labour-election-chief-politics-as-usual-douglas-alexander\" title=\"\">voter apathy</a> has been the politicians' utter apathy towards doing anything about it.</p><p>So, yes, I keep reading that our politics is broken – but our apathy seems more pressingly knackered, because it's evidently so easy to discount it. You would scarcely know it existed from the election coverage, which valiantly discusses Thursday's minority activity the only way people seem to know how.</p><p>Even now, and in the coming days and weeks, the talk will be about how Cameron can alter his attack, or what Miliband must tactically rethink, or the meaning of Nigel Farage. It's the same incestuous, bubblicious way of talking about a world that appears to mostly ignore earthlings that has turned so many of those people off or driven them into the arms of protest voting. Behold our incredible shrinking politics, where the parties apparently see nothing wrong, practically or morally, in pursuing 35% strategies or dividing a few key marginals into titchy subgroups, and lavishing untold resources on targeting those voters almost personally with marketing as micro-sophisticated as it is a macro screw-you to everyone else.</p><p>Why do we need a none-of-the-above box when people are already perfectly entitled to spoil their ballot papers? My gut feeling is that for many perfectly nice British voters who feel they ought to turn out, spoiling a ballot is a graffiti-ish act of rebellion with which they would feel reflexively uncomfortable in a way that they wouldn't with putting a cross in a legitimised none-of-the-above box. And if you think that makes the Great British public sound preposterously meek, then do consider that this is a country whose most prominent so-called rebels are the tweed-jacketed Farage and the prime ministerial tennis partner Jeremy Clarkson.</p><p>Without wishing to crush anyone's self-image, it may be time to accept that Britain doesn't really \"do\" rebellion at this stage in its national journey. There's always Russell Brand, I suppose, and I occasionally picture him planning his revolution of a weekend, perhaps having motored down with his girlfriend, Jemima Khan, to her £20m Oxfordshire estate. But with the best will in the world, it's not exactly Wat Tyler.</p><p>For all that Brand's message of total disengagement from conventional politics speaks swiftly and seductively to many, it is disingenuously simplistic. He is an eloquent man, but I imagine his suggestion that all governments are exactly the same could be demolished in seconds by anyone whom coalition disability cuts have forced to scrimp on incontinence nappies.</p><p>For those without the luxury of time to wait until Russell's revolution coagulates, but who have really had it with voting with nosepegs, or tactically, or for people whose patio furniture or baroque home improvements they were stung for via the expenses racket, a none-of-the-above box would offer an alternative and considerably less ignorable way to be actively counted, and now.</p><p>At the very least, we might learn something. As the American psephological guru Nate Silver noted after he tried and failed to forecast the 2010 UK election with the same laser-like accuracy he brought to the US polls, the paucity of data about UK voting patterns is staggering. Silver contrasted the \"abundance of data\" collected before and after American votes with the failure to do even \"the bare minimum\" in the UK.</p><p>We aren't close to understanding many things about the way we decide how we're governed, and our overlords and ladies apparently don't care to assist us. So few can say with any sort of certainty what a properly promoted none-of-the-above box could take from this party or that. But is there anyone – with the exception of all politicians, including Farage – who could reasonably object to finding out?</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9081020","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098171","internalContentCode":"437659175","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Marina Hyde: </strong>The disaffected should be formally represented in the 2015 general election.

The cameras are always on and every mouthful will be judged. The personal is political, even at 6.30 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>The blurring of talent show contests and politics continues, with celebrity status sometimes counting for more than some of the traditional virtues of political leadership. Affability, or the appearance of it, beats seriousness. Jokes beat speeches. Soundbites beat policy.</p><p></p><p>Every Wednesday at noon, when parliament is sitting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/17/john-bercow-prime-ministers-questions-commons-speaker-mps\" title=\"\">prime minister's questions</a> confirms the extent to which political leadership has become a branch of showbusiness. It is like an open mic session at a not very good comedy club, with coachloads of sixth-formers in attendance. It is all very retro. And the script needs some work.</p><p></p><p>Which is odd, really, because out there in the real world the theory and practice of leadership are changing quite fast. There is nothing very retro about it. The interesting discussions about leadership, and the interesting exemplars, have little in common with the strutting and posing that goes on at the House of Commons and in politics generally.</p><p></p><p>Take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/zappos-shoes-profits-happiness-business\" title=\"\">Zappos</a>, for example, the American online retailer. It has embraced something known as \"<a href=\"http://holacracy.org/how-it-works\" title=\"\">holacracy</a>\", which means abandoning traditional hierarchy and abolishing managers' usual roles and job titles. Instead, employees form themselves into self-governing and interlinking circles based around core tasks. There are still leaders and leadership, of course, but not of a kind that many in London SW1 would recognise.</p><p></p><p>A similar, non-directive approach has existed at WL Gore, the engineering firm (and makers of Gore-Tex), for years. Here no one crudely tells anyone else what to do. \"Want to know if you're a leader?\" a WL Gore employee explained to the management guru Gary Hamel. \"Call a meeting and see if anyone shows up.\"</p><p></p><p>And at Google, leadership has also displayed some unconventional characteristics. In its early years of rapid growth employees were encouraged to spend up to a fifth of their time working on new ideas that interested them. When Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of the company, first started attending meetings there he said he could not tell the difference between graduate interns and the most senior staff: you led with ideas and argument, not rank. Google has become more conventional as it has grown to its current all-conquering position. But the origins of its success lie in the rejection of many elements of old-school leadership.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2826.Jim_Collins\" title=\"\">Jim Collins</a>, author of the best-selling business books Built to Last and Good to Great, argues that some of the most effective leaders eschew \"charisma\" and instead adopt a quiet, relentless, purposeful approach. \"Force of personality is not an argument,\" he told me once. \"It's not facts, it's not evidence, it's not data … Charisma is irrelevant. It's not good or bad, it's irrelevant.\"</p><p></p><p>Well-founded confidence, required by political or business leaders, is one thing. Braggadocio is another. Collins has a test for anyone who says that he or she is a leader. \"I ask them: 'What are you in it for?'\" Some people are in it for themselves. Others are trying to build something that will last, for the benefit of others. This is the test to apply to Messrs Cameron, Clegg and Miliband – and Osborne, May and Johnson too.</p><p></p><p>Politics is not supposed to be showbiz. Soundbites, \"jokes\", bullying and broadbrush statements may get you though PMQs, panel shows or shorter broadcast interviews. But something serious is supposed to be at stake. Fitness for office should really not be determined by how you eat a bacon sandwich at 6.30 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Of course the personal is political. We prefer interesting people to boring ones. Jokes can help. Public speaking is a skill that has too few capable exponents.</p><p></p><p>But the degeneration of our politics has led to a situation in which Nigel Farage can command the undivided and often unquestioning attention of much of our media and wider public. And this is what passes for leadership.</p><p></p><p>I do not follow.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9081975","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098194","internalContentCode":"437663773","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>Stefan Stern: </strong>Politics is not supposed to be about showbiz affability.

Where is the voice of the Labour party and why is it not supporting, loud and clear, the agenda Polly Toynbee has been advocating in your newspaper for so long? Where is the political anger about rising inequality in this country? Who is articulating the benefits of membership of the EU and the importance of our role in making it a force for good? Who is defending public services and utilities against the ravages of mass privatisation? Who is prepared to ignore short-term political and economic gain and say clearly that, unless addressing climate change becomes our number-one priority, the very future of our planet is in question?</p><p>We live in depressing times, with no political vision or leadership to capture the imagination. In this climate, Ukip and their like flourish.<br /><strong>Mike Worthington</strong><br /><em>Hexham, Northumberland</em></p><p></p><p>• On Thursday evening at the polling station there were no fewer than eight mad-frothing-at-the-mouth, little-England parties. It was like a two-legged thesaurus of how many different ways to say we hate foreigners, the EU, and we're scared. Even the polling officers could barely keep straight faces at all this madness. Yet one of these groupings, the kind we used to laugh at, Ukip, has made electoral gains.</p><p>I voted Green. And I will keep voting Green until Labour unites with it to form a progressive \"green\" coalition. I voted Green because I believe Labour will get nowhere much with progressives and the disillusioned until it seriously and openly takes on the Green agenda. That \"going green\" is the only project that offers hope and progress for our society and the world. The only system that offers real jobs and hope as we build a new infrastructure for a better kind of society. Caroline Lucas risked arrest for her principles and I admire that. That strength of purpose matters.</p><p>A sustainable, renewable world is our only hope. Forget Ukip – it's a symptom of despair, not an answer. Ed Balls fiddling with taxes is a boring and unimaginative anti-answer. Fighting climate change and saving ourselves and the creatures and plants of the world is the only progressive answer. The only possible answer. You can only reply to madness with sanity.<br /><strong>Olivia Byard</strong><br /><em>Witney, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Why can't politicians learn from history? If they want to win the next general election, they should learn from Ted Heath's big mistake. He called an election on the basis that the people should decide whether an elected government or the miners should run the country. He had to win on that basis, but in the last week he backed off and the rest is history. The only politician to learn from this was Margaret Thatcher; she set out her policies based on what she believed in and defended them through thick and thin. Likewise, Ukip has done well in these elections because everyone knows what they stand for.</p><p>The problem for the three main parties is that they either don't stand for anything or if they do you cannot be sure they mean it. The worst offenders are the Lib Dems, who will say anything they don't mean to get votes (tuition fees) and the Tories, who are being blown about in Ukip's wind. Labour, on the other hand, has some great policies that will appeal to the majority (keeping energy costs down, fair rents and tackling zero-hours contracts), but it backs off immediately they are attacked. They need to come out fighting and make it clear they will stick to their guns. To win a general election is a simple matter: set out your policies, defend them to the death and stick to them.<br /><strong>Malcolm Howard</strong><br /><em>Banstead, Surrey</em></p><p></p><p>• Ukip has explained it dismal electoral performance in the capital on the grounds that London is \"media-savvy\" and \"well-educated\". This says volumes about what Ukip really thinks about their voters. I think there's a stronger explanation why London proved resistant to Ukip's racist propaganda. London's glory is its diversity – 7 million people, 14 faiths and 300 languages – it's the most multicultural city in the world. In London, the abstract \"migrant\" and \"Romanian\", which Ukip tried to demonise and scapegoat have names and faces. They are neighbours and workmates, lovers and friends.</p><p>London's diversity, not its \"media savvy\" or the education of its citizens, inoculated it from Ukip's racist populism. London's rejection of the politics of hate gives hope for the future everywhere.<br /><strong>Sasha Simic</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>• On Friday morning I was exposed to MPs from the alleged major political parties saying that Ukip gains are a \"protest\" vote. How patronising is that? It assumes that voters do not have independent opinions nor actually think about who they are voting for. They just do not grasp what they are saying about themselves when they adopt these avoidance strategies. I voted for a \"marginal\" party for the first time and here are some reasons why: Conservatives cutting student nurse recruitment, while lying that they haven't but paying huge bonuses to senior managers at the same time; Labour refusing to state their position on EU membership nor providing credible opposition; as for the Liberal Democrats and their actions, there are too many u-turns and compromises to mention (tuition fees being possibly the first notable one) while they demonstrate utter self-delusion as to their actual importance.</p><p>Like many people I simply do not trust younger career politicians: talking to journalists with big, wide eyes, trying desperately to convince us of their integrity no longer works now we all know how corrupt many of them are. After the expenses scandal they no longer have the same status, nor do they deserve to: hypocrisy is not an endearing human trait. Their behaviour during PMQs says it all really – braying, name calling, not listening, avoiding answering questions. Such professionalism.<br /><strong>R Kimble</strong><br /><em>Leeds</em></p><p></p><p>• Polly Toynbee asks \"Why didn't people vote for at least modest reform in the alternative vote referendum three years ago?\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/dismal-eu-ballot-corrupt-electoral-system-safe-seats-rotten\" title=\"\">The British electoral system is corrupt – let's change it</a>, 23 May). She gives the answer: \"Mainly this was a case of voters wreaking revenge on what was a Lib Dem project.\"</p><p>She didn't go on to ask why Labour failed to promote this reform, nor did she ask why voters wanted vengeance so badly, despite thinking that first-past-the-post is unfair. Perhaps she didn't ask because it is she who stokes the flames of anti-coalition hatred so vigorously,  just as David Blunkett poured so much venomous bile on the possibility of a Labour-Lib Dem coalition back in 2010.</p><p>Had they been less consumed by enmity, we might by now have had four years of progressive government – and a less corrupt system of voting.<br /><strong>Peter Davis</strong><br /><em>Bath</em></p><p></p><p>• The national image of our political parties has become dominated by professional public relations people who insist that how they say the parties should present themselves is what will them win more support. If this were true, wouldn't our political parties be more popular now than ever? As Suzanne Moore tells us (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/21/never-mind-ukip-electorate-anger-alienated\" title=\"\">Never mind the threat of Ukip, the electorate has been consumed with anger and alienated for years</a>, G2, 22 May), it is the opposite. The PR people are just a bunch of snake oil salesmen with the most successful product they promote being themselves.</p><p>In the case of the Liberal Democrats, the PR people have insisted that the path to success is to banish all traces of the old \"beards and sandals\" local activist image, and to go on and on about being \"in government\". Every fall in the Liberal Democrat vote is then taken by them as a mark of their success because it is \"expected at this point in the electoral cycle for a governing party\".</p><p>The way the people voted in 2010, and the distortions of the electoral system the people backed by two-to-one in 2011, forced the Liberal Democrats to agree to a coalition which, with just one-sixth of its MPs, was bound to be dominated by the other party. The Liberal Democrats are not, then, \"in government\" in the conventional sense of the term, meaning in complete control of government policy. Their influence goes no more than to be able to swing the balance to the more liberal side of the Conservative party on issues where there is an even split in the Tories. We have a Tory government, and the four-year insistence of the PR people and the Lib Dem leadership that we must keep using words which imply it is a Lib Dem government is electoral suicide.</p><p>Every time Nick Clegg, and party president Tim Farron, who has been a great enthusiast for this line, use those words \"in government\" of the Liberal Democrats, they are telling Lib Dem voters, most of whom voted for the party because it was the local opposition to the Tories, that a Lib Dem government and a Tory government are the same thing. If the Liberal Democrats are to recover, all these people at the top must be got rid of and replaced by those who know how to win votes, even if they do sport beards and wear sandals.<br /><strong>Matthew Huntbach</strong><br /><em>London</em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9079317","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098151","internalContentCode":"437657734","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> Where is the political anger about rising inequality in this country?

So what do they tell us about how ready Labour is for opening night in May 2015?</p><p>Estimates by politics professor John Curtice put the party's share of the vote up three percentage points on 2010 to 30%, but down from 38% two years ago. As he argued this morning: \"If a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections – even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time. The truth is, by that test at least, Labour has not done well enough.\"</p><p>In the face of the Tories' ability to outspend it, one of Labour's great strengths is its volunteer army, which – as it did in 2010, when organisational effort allowed the party to win a 1992 share of the parliament on a 1983 share of the vote – played a key role in its advances yesterday. But the elections also underlined three weaknesses that it must now seek to address.</p><p>First, the election campaign saw a positive tsunami of new announcements from Labour: on increasing the minimum wage, capping rent increases, and giving people the right to see their GP within 48 hours. Each of these policies is undoubtedly popular. A <a href=\"http://www.comres.co.uk/poll/1182/independent-political-poll.htm\" title=\"\">ComRes poll shortly before the elections</a>, for instance, found that 32% of people said Labour's policies for government such as freezing energy prices and increasing the top rate of tax made them more likely to vote for the party.</p><p>However, popular policies alone are not sufficient to guarantee electoral victory. As <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/02/03/why-labours-popular-tax-policy-backfired/\" title=\"\">Peter Kellner of YouGov has suggested</a>, \"history offers plenty of examples of the dangers of interpreting the public mood too simplistically\". In 1992, Neil Kinnock took the supposedly popular policies of higher child benefit and state pensions funded by an increase in national insurance contributions on the better-off to the electorate and was buried by John Major. Similarly, policies on crime, immigration and Europe, which scored well in the polls, did nothing to save William Hague in 2001 or Michael Howard in 2005. The Tories' chances then were sunk by its lingering \"nasty party\" image. Labour's problem is somewhat different. As in 1992, its failure to <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/04/22/labour-loses-ground-economy/\" title=\"\">convince the electorate that it can be trusted with the economy</a> undermines much else it tries to do.</p><p>Second, the elections highlighted the limit to Labour's focus on the cost of living crisis. As wage increases begin to outstrip prices there is a question mark over whether this campaign will reach its sell-by date before May 2015. However, the proceeds of the recovery are not yet being felt by all and the Tories have shown scant interest in ensuring they do. This presents an opportunity for Ed Miliband, but to seize it Labour needs to develop an agenda focused on future prosperity: one that is as much about growing the overall size of the cake as it is about sharing it out more fairly.</p><p>Third, some of Nigel Farage's comments during the campaign – about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/may/21/romanian-nigel-farage-westerham-kent-neighbour-video\" title=\"\">undesirability of having Romanians as neighbours</a>, for instance – reeked of 1960s Powellism. While there were some honourable exceptions, Labour's leadership appeared strangely unwilling to call out Farage's racism and tackle head-on the lies about Europe and migration that Ukip has been allowed to peddle for too long.</p><p>There are legitimate concerns about immigration – principally the exploitation of migrants and the impact on low-paid Britons – which need to be addressed (and, to his credit, Miliband has focused much attention here). And there is a rich agenda around reform of the EU which supporters of Britain's membership need to do more to advance. But basic principles – that migration benefits Britain socially, culturally and economically and that to cut ourselves off from the world's largest single market would be an act of absolute folly – must be defended vigorously.</p><p>Labour not only lags the Tories on economic competence, it also lags on leadership. There is still time for Labour to address both. Miliband has previously indicated his desire to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/16/ed-miliband-labour-margaret-thatcher\" title=\"\">reshape the landscape of British politics in the manner of Margaret Thatcher</a>. She was, in part, able to do this because voters respected the fact that she stood up for what she believed in, even when they disagreed vehemently with those beliefs. Workshops conducted by <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2013/12/01/meet-the-swing-voters/\" title=\"\">BritainThinks for the Labour pressure group Progress in four key marginal constituencies</a> last autumn found a desire and willingness to hear hard truths, even unpopular ones, from the party. A staunch defence of both immigration and Europe by Miliband might fly in the face of public opinion, but in so doing it may give the Labour leader's ratings just the fillip he needs.</p><p>Miliband will receive much advice in the light of the results from David Axelrod, who helped steer President Obama to two landslide victories in America. But perhaps fictional American political drama has something to offer too. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Bartlet_Be_Bartlet\" title=\"\">\"Let Bartlet be Bartlet\"</a>, suggests a staffer in The West Wing. On immigration and Europe we all know where Miliband's instincts and values would lead him. Someone needs to tell him they may make good politics too.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9080277","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098045","internalContentCode":"437648783","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<strong>Robert

A pity – they might learn something.</p><p>Actually, we know what Blair would do because he has already done it. He would largely ignore the European issue as presented by Ukip itself. All polls confirm that it is low on the list of most voter concerns compared with bread-and-butter problems such as rewarding jobs or the state of the NHS. Europe is shorthand for alienation from the political process and dismay at the pace of change in our globalised world – including immigration, carelessly handled by Blair's complacent government.</p><p>As Tory leader in 2001 William Hague, a true child of Margaret Thatcher, decided to run his election campaign on xenophobic themes – Britain as \"a foreign land\" and the like. Blair ignored it. Watching Labour candidates defending marginal seats that year in Kent, exposed as it is to some downsides of immigration, I heard voters complaining about jobs, schools and the poor state of some local hospitals, not about \"saving the pound\". New Labour creamed Hague (and Gordon Brown saved the pound).</p><p>That does not mean Blair or his team would ignore Farage completely. When the Ukip leader slips up the old pro would be on him like a tiger. Vladimir Putin as an admired international statesman? Both Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage, Little Britain nationalists (different bits of Britain), have expressed respect for Putin's reassertion of Russian national pride. So have other rightwing populists across Europe (Salmond's genius is to be both right and left). It is a mistake Blair would have hammered.</p><p>Putin runs a lawless, authoritarian state, overdependent on oil and gas, heading the wrong way in the modern world. You can hear Blair saying it, can't you? Cheeky chappie that he is, he might even add that, for all its woes, post-war Iraq is struggling not to do the same – in the face of religious fundamentalism and thin-skinned nationalism.</p><p>As a matter of fact, largely forgotten, Blair and Farage have clashed directly.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT--RnOYORI\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DT--RnOYORI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT--RnOYORI\">Reading on mobile? Link to video of Farage v Blair in 2005</a></p><p>It happened at the Strasbourg parliament in 2005 after Blair cut a compromise deal on Britain's EU rebate – Maggie's famous handbag rebate in Tory-speak. He did so in return for reform of the bloated agricultural budget (it's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11216061\" title=\"\">happening, though painfully slowly</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT--RnOYORI\" title=\"\">Farage complained</a> that he had been completely outclassed (\"game, set and match\") by President Jacques Chirac of France, this in the year – irony alert – that Chirac won the 2012 Olympics bid for Paris.</p><p>Watch that clip again. For once Farage turns up and fights his corner. It can't have been easy in a hostile setting like that. Good for Nigel. You may think he came out of the exchange best. What is not in dispute is that Blair had a coherent answer which sounds like a man doing a man's job instead of pandering to Ukippery as David Cameron does.</p><p>He did it to win the Tory leadership in 2005 (he foolishly promised to leave the conservative group in Strasbourg and did) and has done again too often since. Fat good it has done Cameron since every concession leads to more \"transitional demands\" – as the left comrades would put it. The anti-EU camp and its backers in the oligarch press want us out. Not since they helped force a vengeful peace at Versailles in 1918 have they done such harm to British interests (unless you count pre-war appeasement in 1938).</p><p>Here's what Blair told Farage. For all the feebleness and folly of EU leadership since then, for all Blair's own greedy excess, it remains the correct answer:</p><blockquote><p>Let me just tell you, sir, and your colleagues: you sit with our country's flag; you do not represent our country's interests. This is the year: 2005, not 1945. We're not fighting each other any more. These are our partners. They're our colleagues and our future lies in Europe. And when you and your colleagues say: 'What do we get in return for what we contribute to enlargement?', I'll tell you what we get. We get a Europe that is unified after years of dictatorship in the east. We get economic development in countries whom we have championed. We get a future reform that allows us – once and for all – to put an end to discussion about rebates, common agricultural policy, and get a proper budget for Europe. That's what we get if we have the vision to seize that opportunity.</p></blockquote><p>Of course by 2005, Blair, though re-elected for a third time, was mired in the legacy of the bloody Anglo-American occupation of Iraq, and much enfeebled at home by his own civil war with Brown. Unwisely persuaded by Jack Straw, he had promised a referendum on the EU constitution which the French and – of all people – the saintly Dutch torpedoed on his behalf when they voted it down.</p><p>Never glad confident morning again for Blair or the EU, which staggers on preoccupied with its internal economic problems, overextended and unable to say boo to the Faragiste pin-up in the Kremlin as he unleashes forces he may not be able to control in Ukraine.</p><p>Love him or hate him, do we really think Blair, the wannabe global plutocrat with a flair for elective politics, would not have made a better fist of coordinating EU policy if he, not Herman Van Thingy, had been in charge? Or a better fist of sticking it to good old Nigel? Go on, admit it, you know he would have been better.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9080703","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2098002","internalContentCode":"437645403","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Admit it – Labour's triple election winner would have known how to handle the threat from the Ukip leader</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Faced with Nigel Farage, what would Tony Blair do?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Michael White","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400852534540/Tony-Blair-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"8","internalStoryPackageCode":"76095","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-30T13:52:00Z","standfirst":"Admit it – Labour's triple election winner would have known how to handle the threat from the Ukip leader","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-01T14:51:02Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/faced-nigel-farage-tony-blair","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/may/23/faced-nigel-farage-tony-blair","sectionName":"Politics","tags":[{"id":"politics/tonyblair","webTitle":"Tony Blair","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/tonyblair","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/nigel-farage","webTitle":"Nigel Farage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/nigel-farage","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","sectionName":"Politics","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/aug/13/labour-leadership-candidates-comparison-burnham-cooper-corbyn-kendall"}]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/blog","webTitle":"Politics blog","description":"The Guardian's blog on politics, politicians and political news","type":"blog","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/eu","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michaelwhite","webTitle":"Michael White","rcsId":"GNL004718","r2ContributorId":"16139","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336544/MichaelWhite.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733744420/MichaelWhite.png","firstName":"michael","lastName":"white","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Michael White is assistant editor and has been writing for the Guardian for more than 30 years, as a reporter, foreign correspondent and columnist.

Even before the latest election results have been fully digested, the three main parties have launched new attempts to win back the 4.3 million Britons who voted for Nigel Farage in the European elections. The Conservatives are turning up the volume on their promise of a EU referendum and hostility to immigration, hoping this will be enough to convince a sufficient number of Ukippers to return to the fold by 2015. While some in Labour also advocate tough talk on immigration,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/labour-ukip-anti-immigrant-vote-ed-miliband-election\" title=\"\"> Ed Miliband has charted a different course</a>; he wants to reconnect with Ukip's left-behind voters but sees little point in trying to out-Ukip the party. And Farage faces his own challenge: how to retain his new voters who after every previous set of European elections swiftly abandoned Ukip.</p><p>But to what extent will Ukip's revolt crash and burn before 2015 and what messages are there for the main parties? We can gain unique insight by looking at the latest wave of the <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/\" title=\"\">British Election Study</a>, a key resource for academics who study elections.</p><p>Let's first consider the widespread assumption that Ukip is about to collapse. As shown below, the reality is more complex. Ukip will certainly lose some support; 36% of those who voted Ukip in the European elections are already planning to abandon the party in 2015. Of these defectors the largest number (25%) will switch to the Conservatives, 8% will vote Labour and 3% for another party. So there is evidence of an exodus from Ukip to the Conservatives, but the figure is far lower than Conservatives would like. In fact almost two-thirds (64%) of Ukip's European election voters plan to stay loyal in 2015. If we include Ukip voters who are undecided about who to support in 2015 then this figure drops to less than 60% – but the message is clear: Ukip will have a stronger base heading into 2015 than at any previous election.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438093388'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401381014404/Ukip-bar-chart-1-004.jpg' alt='Ukip bar chart 1' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ukip voters' intentions as a percentage.</figcaption></figure><p>So who are these Ukip loyalists? First, they are more likely to be women. Ukip struggles to win over women, but when it does, they are more likely to stay loyal. We are not sure why this is, but one implication is that Farage's strategy of promoting women as candidates and spokeswomen might help him retain support. It also suggests that the selection of the older, white male, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/06/roger-helmer-selected-as-ukip-candidate-for-newark-byelection\" title=\"\">Roger Helmer, as its candidate in Newark</a> is a lost opportunity for Ukip. Second, Farage's shift to northern areas is paying off; the most loyal Ukip voters are found in the north-east and north-west where 70% plan to stay loyal (compared with less than 60% in Scotland).</p><p>Third, while Ukip voters in general are disadvantaged, its loyalists are the most left behind. Those planning to stay loyal are the most likely to have no qualifications and the lowest incomes, while those who will leave Farage in 2015 have more skills and income (though remain less well-off than most voters). How can Farage ensure his disadvantaged loyalists turn out, and how can the main parties target these two groups? These are the key questions in 2015.</p><p>Finally, how do the outlooks of these two groups compare? This is where the picture gets really interesting. Those who plan to leave Ukip are significantly more concerned than the loyalists about the economy. The most plausible explanation is that they are being won back by perceptions of Conservative party competence in running the economy and that Ukip is not a safe pair of hands. But remember that defectors are a smaller group, while the more numerous loyalists are animated by a very different issue.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438093389'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401381193691/Ukip-bar-chart-2-004.jpg' alt='Ukip bar chart 2' width='460' height='460' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Ukip's loyalists are concerned less about the economy than immigration; 73% of them see immigration as the main problem facing Britain but only 27% of defectors think so. Ukip is only likely to retain around half of its supporters who feel that the economy is the most pressing issue, but stands a much greater chance of sustaining its core, disadvantaged base who feel far more strongly about immigration. This suggests that Farage's shift to immigration will help him inflict damage in 2015, but only so long as the issue remains important in the minds of his core voters. For Labour and the Conservatives, the message is clear: the more they focus on immigration, the more they risk heightening its importance among left-behind voters, and the greater the chance that Farage will lock them into his revolt until 2015.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9102591","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2101051","internalContentCode":"438082997","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p><strong>Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo: Ukip matters: </strong>Don't bank on a collapse in support for Nigel Farage and co between now and 2015, despite Labour and Tory siren calls</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"The battle is on to poach Ukip's voters – but they're a loyal bunch","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401376160716/Ukip-struggles-to-win-ove-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"74649","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-01T16:45:34Z","standfirst":"Don't bank on a collapse in support for Nigel Farage and co between now and 2015, despite Labour and Tory siren calls","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-06-21T02:11:23Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/ukip-voters-loyal-nigel-farage-2015-labour-tory","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/ukip-voters-loyal-nigel-farage-2015-labour-tory","sectionName":"Comment is free","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","webTitle":"Ukip matters","description":"A regular look at Ukip and the political divides emerging as Britain moves towards the 2015 general election, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthew-goodwin\">Matthew Goodwin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/caitlin-milazzo\">Caitlin Milazzo</a>","type":"series","sectionId":"commentisfree","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/series/ukip-matters","sectionName":"Comment is free","references":[]},{"id":"politics/ukip","webTitle":"UK Independence party (Ukip)","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ukip","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/labour","sectionName":"Politics","references":[{"type":"rich-link","id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/aug/13/labour-leadership-candidates-comparison-burnham-cooper-corbyn-kendall"}]},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/conservatives","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/general-election-2015","sectionName":"Politics","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","sectionName":"UK news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/matthew-goodwin","webTitle":"Matthew Goodwin","r2ContributorId":"30580","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/19/1345392425163/Matthew-Goodwin.jpg","firstName":"matthew","lastName":"goodwin","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Matthew Goodwin is associate professor at the University of Nottingham whose latest book Revolt on the Right: Explaining Public Support for the Radical Right in Britain is published by Routledge.

His point concerning London's \"difference\" is interesting but partial. A review of council seats gained, lost and held across much of England reveals a much more complex, less London-centric, picture.</p><p>In the major cities and large towns across England, it is clear that with only one major exception Ukip failed. Not one of the following councils returned a single Ukip candidate: Birmingham, Coventry, Exeter, Ipswich, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Norwich, Preston, Southampton, Stockport, Sunderland. Ukip holds one seat in each of Bradford, Bristol and Wolverhampton, three in Plymouth and Sheffield and, here's the major exception, six out of 42 in Portsmouth.</p><p>Of course, the failure to capture seats on these councils does not mean that Ukip is absent; the party clearly has support. However, it begs the question of why Ukip is so strong in other areas such as Adur, Basildon, Cannock Chase, Dudley, Great Yarmouth, Kirklees, Newcastle-under-Lyme, North East Lincolnshire, Rotherham, Southend-on-Sea, Thurrock and the Wyre Forest. Taken together, Ukip has 89 seats in these councils. That is more than half of its entire holding.</p><p>At first glance these places do not have a lot in common. First glances, however, are not enough. My guess is that poverty and unemployment will be found to be two major underlying reasons why people have abandoned the three established parties. It will be interesting and important to see how these reasons and others are refracted through the prism of national identity and individualism set in place by Mrs Thatcher 35 years ago.<br /><strong>Derek Mckiernan</strong><br /><em>Leeds</em></p><p>• Despite Zoe Williams' excellent article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/green-party-support-media-ukip\" title=\"\">Support for the Greens is surging – haven't you heard?</a>, 21 May) pointing up the Green party's invisibility in the media commentary leading up to the election, the Guardian and the rest of the media have continued to ignore the Greens and to present an extraordinary counterfactual account of the local election results. Ukip's share of the poll actually fell from 23% last year to 17% this year and it is the Conservative seats that have suffered most at their hands. The aggregation of voting into London and the rest ignores major variations throughout the country: Havering elected their seven existing Ukip councillors while Liverpool, Manchester and Preston elected none. The north-east similarly ignored Ukip.</p><p>It would be hard to discover in the coverage that Labour took over half the council seats up for election and gained control of five councils while Ukip gained none and its 160 seats are so scattered they will have very little power, especially as they are mainly complete political newcomers with no knowledge of how to be most effective as the only Ukip representative. Will we see a Ukip member joining the non-aligned group and working with a Green? It was very difficult to discover that the Green party had 20 seats before the election, of those seats being contested this year. We won 23 more seats with almost no press coverage. The Greens now have 162 councillors on 56 councils, including six in Bristol, six in Oxford, 15 in Norwich and 10 in Solihull. Is none of that even worthy of a brief footnote.<br /><strong>Ruth Funnell</strong><br /><em>Great Torrington, Devon</em></p><p></p><p>• Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/editorial-local-elections-small-earthquake-england\" title=\"\">24 May</a>) states Ukip support is strong in the east of England. The BBC's Nick Robinson has also invented a myth that \"Essex man has gone Ukip\". Following the local election results you published on the same day, this is hard to justify. In Colchester, not a single Ukip councillor was elected. In other cities in the east, in Cambridge, Norwich and Ipswich, the latter having long been as cosmopolitan as London, again Mr Farage has failed. I suggest Ukip flourishes only on the fringes of the region. This is often in declining seaside resorts where retired people have been persuaded Bulgarians are out to snatch their pensions.<br /><strong>Michael Munt</strong><br /><em>Bredfield, Suffolk</em></p><p></p><p>• Another local election staggers past the finishing post. Thanks to voter apathy and demographic chance, the winning party in my borough has a dictatorial majority of 59 out of 63 seats, based on the votes of less than one in six of the electorate. Ukip's share of the vote has gone down from 23% to 17% nationally, and yet they have gained 128 more council seats. Will this finally persuade the major parties to accept a fairer voting system (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/dismal-eu-ballot-corrupt-electoral-system-safe-seats-rotten\" title=\"\">The British electoral system is corrupt – let's change it</a>, 23 May)? If we don't find a better way soon of making elections mean something to more people, we may as well outsource all the decisions to Serco.<br /><strong>Pauline Gaunt</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p>• I was appalled to read (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ed-miliband-labour-ukip-change\" title=\"\">Miliband told: raise your game</a>, 24 May) that there is anger in the Labour party \"that Miliband focused too much on policy rather than projecting an empathy with voters' sense of alienation from the political class\". To my mind, one of the major reasons that the public feels alienated from politicians is that we are treated by the likes of David Cameron and Nigel Farage as mindless idiots who can only absorb one idea at a time, and at that one designed to appeal to unnecessary xenophobia stirred up by the media. I would like our politicians to explain more about their policies on all subjects, not less.<br /><strong>Wendy Churchman</strong><br /><em>Birmingham</em></p><p></p><p>• In 1956, Pierre Poujade, a French demagogue whose declared aim was to defend the \"common man\" against the French establishment and fight any foreign influences that might alter the French traditional way of life, got elected to the Assemblée Nationale together with the leader of his party's youth branch, a jeune-homme called Jean-Marie Le Pen. Two years later, Poujade's party, the Union de Défense de Commerçants et Artisans, faded into oblivion. I wonder why I suddenly remembered all this.<br /><strong>Eduardo de Benito</strong><br /><em>Cley next the Sea, Norfolk</em></p><p></p><p>• Marina Hyde is right (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/23/apathetic-general-election-none-of-the-above\" title=\"\">Come my revolution, the apathetic will get their say</a>, 24 May). People who don't support any of the candidates on their ballot forms need a \"none of the above\" option. That is why I started <a href=\"https://notabradford.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">NOTA – None of the Above</a>, a campaign registered with the Electoral Commission to encourage voters to write those words on the ballot. She is right, too, to say people are resistant to spoiling their ballot in this way. That was the feedback we received when we leafleted the People's Assembly in March, which is why we are supporting the online petition to include this option in all future elections.</p><p>Signatures may be placed at <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/51127\" title=\"\">epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/51127</a>.
