Cash said:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do you appreciate the import of Mr Justice Mostyn's ruling opens the flood gates now to a tidal wave of charter-based legal action at enormous cost to the British taxpayer and businesses, and raises a fundamental clash between Westminster supremacy and the claims of the EU and the European court of justice which goes beyond mere renegotiation?&nbsp;</p> <p>Will you agree to support my proposal for urgent legislation as follows: notwithstanding any provision of the European Communities Act 1972, nothing in the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union shall be binding in any legal proceedings of the United Kingdom, and shall not form part of the law applicable in any part of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;This act reaffirms the supremacy of the United Kingdom parliament?&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Grayling said the government did not agree with Mr Justice Mostyn and that it hoped to clarify the matter soon.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The case [last week] was dismissed on its facts but the judge, in passing, made some comments on the charter and on the case law of the court of justice of the European Union in Luxembourg. The judge's view was the Luxembourg court in a case called NS held the charter could create new rights that apply in the UK.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is important to be very clear to the House we do not agree with that analysis of the NS case. We intend to find another case - and the reason we can't do it on this one is because the Home Office was successful and you can't appeal on a case you have won. We do, though, intend to find another case at the earliest opportunity to clarify beyond doubt the legal effects of the charter and to put the record straight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has told MPs that banks can afford to pay a higher levy to the government to fund an extension in free childcare.</strong> He made the claim in a debate on Labour 's plans to extend free childcare from three and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours per week.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last financial year, the banks paid a staggering &pound;2.7 billion less in overall tax than they did in 2010. The government has given the banks an extraordinary tax break and we would reintroduce some fairness into the system to support our child care plans. </p> <p>Can I quote from this Saturday's Financial Times? 'Good times return as City gets in Christmas spirit', reported the paper. 'After years of yuletide austerity following the financial crisis party organisers and venue owners are seeing a resurgence in the market for festive frivolity', according to the FT. </p> <p>Good luck to them. We on the Labour benches like to see a return to some animal spirit but all we are saying is some of that festive frivolity can be spent on securing affordable child care.

The medical profession seem to like it. But others are less positive.</p> <p>From <strong>Robert Francis </strong>QC, who led the inquiry into Mid Staffs</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the publication of the report I have been very encouraged by meeting many dedicated healthcare professionals from all parts of the service - doctors, nurses, managers, and trainees - who want to play their part in making the NHS a uniformly safe and caring place for all their patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reassuringly many in the NHS have not waited until today to get on with much needed changes and initiatives to begin the process of reform.</p> <p>Much has already changed in the health service. From the front line to the boards of national bodies, things are happening and being done which would have been inconceivable before the Mid Staffordshire inquiries two years ago.&nbsp;</p> <p>The system is on its way to becoming more transparent, and shortcomings are more readily admitted and more actively addressed than before. However there is still much to do.</p> <p>I believe that the proposals being announced today will continue the process started by my report. They will encourage the commitment and enthusiasm of so many in the service to be focussed on what really matters in the NHS: the provision of safe, effective and high quality care to all patients, on each and every occasion they need it.</p> <p>They will contribute to the development of the openness, transparency and candour that will maintain the public's confidence and promote a true partnership with patients.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the<strong> BMA</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patient safety should always be paramount, which is why safe staffing levels should always be set in accordance with the best available evidence and with a dynamic consideration of patients' needs at any one time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Centrally imposed mandatory staffing levels would be difficult to implement as they fail to recognise that not every patient is the same and, as such, safe levels will vary from time to time across hospitals.</p> <p>The Government is right to want to deal with this through a combination of evidence-based guidance, rigorous governance, transparency and openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the <strong>Royal College of Nursing</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The RCN has been calling for some time for greater transparency in identifying the number of staff on each ward. By making this information available on a monthly basis we are going some way to ensuring that each hospital in the country offers patients access to the care they deserve.</p> <p>We also welcome the focus on consistent training for healthcare support workers through the care certificate. Although we remain convinced that the mandatory regulation of all healthcare support workers is the most effective way of protecting patients, the announcement today is an important first step.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Emma Jones, from law firm <strong>Leigh Day</strong>, which represented more than 120 victims of abuse and neglect at Stafford Hospital</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are very pleased to see the way in which the government has adopted the majority of the proposals put forward by Robert Francis QC; however, we believe many proposals have stopped short of covering every incident of abuse or negligence and may not extend throughout all providers of care within the NHS.&nbsp;</p> <p>We are also disappointed that a duty of candour has not been be extended to individuals.</p> </blockquote> <p>From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/23562.asp\">Niall Dickson, chief executive of the <strong>General Medical Council</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We all need to step up to the challenge of the Francis report - patients should always be at the heart of healthcare but we know this is not always the case. We welcome the Government’s response and in particular the emphasis on greater consistency between healthcare regulators.</p> <p>Through our guidance, we have already done a great deal to encourage a duty of candour among doctors, but we are not complacent. We know there is more to do. We must strengthen the link between our guidance and doctors' practice on the front line, the words on the page and actions on the ward.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/our-statement-governments-full-response-francis-inquiry-report\">Catherine Foot, assistant director of policy at </a><a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/our-statement-governments-full-response-francis-inquiry-report\"><strong>The King's Fund&nbsp;</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome today's focus on making honesty and transparency the guiding principles for patient safety. Implementing the change set out by the government will be a long haul and requires culture change right across the NHS. This will take place against a backdrop of severe financial pressure, with NHS organisations already facing difficult decisions about whether to prioritise patient care or balance the books.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the <strong>Royal College of Midwives</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall this is a robust and comprehensive response by the government. Safety, staffing and openness and transparency should be at the heart of the NHS.</p> <p>If the government really follow up their commitments in this response then I hope we will see an even safer and better NHS and, a maternity service that has the right number of staff, with the right skills. This will lead to better care for the millions who rely upon the NHS to safeguard themselves and their loved ones, and who place their lives in its hands.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Jackie Smith, chief executive of the <strong>Nursing and Midwifery Council</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We particularly welcome the commitment to legislate at the earliest opportunity to provide all healthcare regulators with a modern and efficient legal framework. We believe this will make fitness to practise faster, more efficient and more effective.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Peter Walsh, the chief executive of<strong> Action against Medical Accidents</strong>. He said he was&nbsp;&quot;dismayed&quot; that the legal duty of candour on organisations would only apply in relation to death or severe harm cases.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The case for a full duty of candour about any significant incident and applying to everyone in the organisation, from board to ward, is overpowering.&nbsp;It would be the biggest advance in patient safety and patients' rights in a lifetime.&nbsp;The current proposals would be disastrous - in effect legitimising cover ups of the vast majority of incidents which cause serious harm to patients.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>From Gina Dowding, a <strong>Green party</strong> spokesperson</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is vital that the public have confidence that their hospitals have safe staffing levels. The debate about safety in hospitals is extremely important. Per head of population the UK spends far less than most of our European counterparts.</p> </blockquote> <p>From John Lister from the <strong>National Health Action party</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s vital that staffing levels are consistent with clinical evidence on patient safety. It’s now widely recognised that when the registered nurse to patient ratio is worse than 1 to 4 or 5 on day shifts, the risk of adverse events rises rapidly. A ratio of 1:8&nbsp;represents the danger level. The overall ratio in is England 1:8.6. That is a dangerous level.&nbsp;</p> <p>We will see more tragedies like mid-Staffs unless the government introduces safe and appropriate staffing levels. It’s useless just making hospitals publish snapshot figures of how many nurses are on duty in wards without guaranteeing appropriate levels. How will hospitals pay for new nurses to ensure safe care at a time when this government is imposing a financial squeeze on the NHS and over half of NHS trusts are in financial difficulty? It’s fine to want to have staffing based on patient need, but let’s see the money to match it.</p> <p>The creation of an offence of “wilful neglect”&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to dump the blame on individuals&nbsp;and&nbsp;lets completely off the hook those who are actually responsible: the Trust Boards who were slammed by the Francis Report in Mid Staffs for their cavalier disregard for the impact of cuts; medical directors and senior management whose inadequately staffed services generate these problems; and of course the ministers whose unprecedented cash squeeze on the NHS is creating this chaos and forcing dozens of Trusts into cuts bigger than those at Mid Staffs.&nbsp;This government, with its cuts and chaotic NHS re-disorganisation, has created a backdrop for neglect.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d5029fcc-d1dd-454b-bea6-c5da5e0adbc4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/8/1381255041844/Robert-Francis-QC-009.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Francis QC\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Robert Francis QC.

In Westminster, <strong>Nick Boles</strong>, the planning minister, seems to have the same idea. He floated the proposal in a speech to Bright Blue, a Conservative campaign group promoting liberal, modernising ideas in the party.</p> <p>After 2010 Boles suggested the Tories should form an electoral pact with the Lib Dems in 2015. Now he has changed his mind.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had misjudged the Liberal Democrats. Although there&nbsp;are some true believers in freedom in the party - and&nbsp;they appeared to make the running in the first year of the coalition - the heart of the Liberal Democrats beats on the left and the party's instincts are statist. In recent months we have seen their leader twist and turn in a desperate attempt&nbsp;to position himself for coalition with a deeply illiberal Labour Party after the next election – and render himself principle- free zone in the process.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Boles says the Conservative party is too monolithic.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Modern Britain is a place in which people prize their individuality and define themselves by their interests and pastimes, likes and dislikes. Yet when they look at the Conservative Party they see an old fashioned monolith.&nbsp;Big retailers and consumer brands have found that they cannot rely on a single brand with one undifferentiated message to attract and hold the attention of all the customers they need. They have turned themselves into loose but coordinated collections of brands and product ranges, all operating from a common platform but free to express&nbsp;themselves individually and craft a more targeted appeal to particular consumer niches.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is where the idea for a new party (or, rather, the revival of an old one) comes in.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1947 the National Liberal Party (previously the Liberal National faction of the gradually disintegrating Liberal Party) merged at constituency level with the Conservative Party. Until 1968 it continued to maintain a distinct political profile and national brand. Candidates who were associated with this new affiliate stood under a variety of labels: 'National Liberal, National Liberal and Conservative, Liberal and Conservative'. Michael Heseltine stood as a National Liberal in Gower in 1959. And John Nott began his parliamentary career in 1966 when he was elected as National Liberal MP for St Ives.</p> <p>My question is this. Is it impossible for us to contemplate reviving the National Liberal Party, or something like it, as a an affiliate of the Conservative Party, which only puts up&nbsp;candidates for election jointly with the Conservative Party? Existing MPs, councillors, candidates and party members of liberal views would be encouraged to join. And we could use it to recruit new supporters who might initially balk at the idea of calling themselves Conservative. In three-way marginals and the key target seats that we have to take off the Liberal Democrats, an explicit National Liberal pitch might make the difference between victory and defeat.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1c290729-5bf6-4b6b-a9be-45e9e9c3db23\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/12/1360707715780/Planning-minister-Nick-Bo-010.jpg\" alt=\"Planning minister Nick Boles immigration\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Nick Boles.

It was as if, having been brought in as health secretary after Labour mauled his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, over the Health Act, he decided it was best to retaliate by using Mid Staffs to suggest that Labour in general, and Andy Burnham in particular, were somehow directly responsible for the deaths of countless patients pre-2010. It was not pretty, and I'm not sure how many people believed it, but it has been how the debate on Mid Staffs has been conducted for most of this year.</p> <p>Today, though, Hunt adopted a slightly different tone. There was still a partisan undercurrent to his remarks, but today he sounded more like a man promoting transparency in the NHS primarily because he believes in it, not primarily for base political purposes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are the main points.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/19/hospitals-mistakes-jeremy-hunt\">• Hunt has announced that hospitals that try to conceal mistakes could have to pay compensation out of their own funds, instead of having medical negligence cases settled centrally.</a></strong> They could even lose their insurance cover in some cases, he suggested. This was the most striking new measures in a wide-ranging package of announcements, some of which have been trailed in advance. There are full details<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/francis-report-on-mid-staffs-government-accepts-recommendations\"> in the Department of Health's news release.</a>&nbsp;Hunt said they would make the NHS the most transparent health system in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is probably the boldest step forward towards transparency of any healthcare system anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said it was &quot;absolutely shocking&quot; that the NHS was spending more than &pound;1bn a year on litigation claims and that the only way to cut this figure was to raise standards.</p> <p><strong>• Hunt claimed that &quot;cruelty became normal&quot; in the NHS under the old system.</strong> Here's the quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the most chilling accounts of the Francis report came from Mid Staffs employees, who considered the care they saw as being normal.&nbsp;Cruelty became normal in our NHS and no-one noticed. The Francis report made 290 recommendations. I accept the principles behind all of them and wherever possible have adopted the practical solution suggested by the inquiry.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>When a Labour MP challenged him, Hunt said that he was not saying all NHS staff were cruel, but that he was trying to make a point about Mid Staffs.</p> <p><strong>• An explicit &quot;duty of candour&quot; will be imposed on doctors, nurses and other health professionals, Hunt said</strong>. But this will be a professional duty, not a legal duty. Here's what the news release says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Health professionals will have to be candid with patients about all avoidable harm and the guidance will make clear that obstructing colleagues in being candid will be a breach of their professional codes. Speaking up quickly may also be considered to be a mitigating factor in a conduct hearing and this will further encourage individual candour. Inspired by normal practice in the airline industry, “near misses” of serious harm will also be subject to a professional duty of candour, fostering an NHS culture in which reporting and learning from mistakes is the norm.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Andy Burnham said that Monitor, the health regulator, has admitted that in the long run nursing numbers are set to fall again.</strong> Hunt said that NHS trusts are due to hire another 3,700 nurses. But Burnham said &quot;Monitor has warned trusts are planning major nurse redundancies in the 2014 to 2016 period that far outweighing any increases this year&quot;. Labour aides pointed to a line in a Monitor report saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Across 2014/15-15-16 there is planned disinvestment, largely through reductions in nursing numbers (4%). This suggests that the previous year's investment is seen as a short-term fix for operational pressures.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4539144e-e093-4993-b806-2c599f58d286\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384873561580/d662a3bb-e240-400d-93d9-a035697e4b9e-460x276.png\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jeremy Hunt Photograph: /BBC Parliament</figcaption> </figure> <p>I'll post some reaction soon.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T15:06:56.217Z\">at 3.06pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-528b71bbe4b02747f7fb8f07\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T14:15:10.934Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Peter Bone</strong>, a Conservative, says the current NHS complaints system is deliberately long.

It was set up 65 years ago with the noble ideal that no one should ever be prevented by background or finance from accessing the best care. That is why it remains the most-loved British institution, and rightly so.&nbsp;But each and every case of poor care betrays those worthy aims. I do not simply want to prevent another Mid Staffs, I want our NHS to be a beacon across the world, not just for equity but its excellence.&nbsp;</p> <p>I want it to offer the safest, most compassionate and most effective care available anywhere and I believe it can. But only if there is a profound transformation in the culture of the NHS. The inquiry shows the devastating effects of overly-defensive responses, hurting families, suppressing the truth and preventing lessons being learned.&nbsp;Failure cannot be addressed when it is being covered up and so today I am announcing new measures to promote a culture of openness and transparency ...</p> <p>One of the most chilling accounts of the Francis report came from Mid Staffs employees, who considered the care they saw as being normal. Cruelty became normal in our NHS and no-one noticed. The Francis report made 290 recommendations. I accept the principles behind all of them and wherever possible have adopted the practical solution suggested by the inquiry.&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert Francis has today welcomed today's announcement as a carefully considered and thorough response to his recommendations, which he says will contribute greatly towards a new culture of caring and making our hospitals safer places for their patients.&nbsp;Today's measures are a blueprint for restoring trust in the NHS, re-enforcing professional pride in NHS frontline staff and above all giving confidence to patients that after Mid Staffs, the NHS has listened, the NHS has learnt and the NHS will not rest until it is delivering the safest, most effective and most compassionate care anywhere in the world.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528b6c9be4b010b65d556192\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T13:51:00.466Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Hunt says these changes will lead to an increase in the amount of reported harm in the next few months.

So for some it may well be one to eight; for others it may be one nurse to four patients or one nurse to six patients. The other thing you need to think about is the whole team. So for example, if you’re working in a stroke ward, you might need to have occupational therapy, speech therapy and physiotherapists working alongside nurses and doctors. What we’re talking about here is actually making that decision locally and actually making sure that we use evidence to determine that.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-17b7f155-63f8-466b-8a6f-831cd4ed8617\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384853184202/418f8211-7e0d-423a-be01-f612b1e52294-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane Cummings.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Jane Cummings.
