He was the first major composer who was not a servant, either of an aristocrat, or of the Church. The idea of the artist as hero, of the work of art being a triumph of the human will over adversity (and Beethoven had his fair share), was an utterly Beethovenian one. He pushed this idea beyond art and onto the world stage, in the fight against tyranny and for human freedom. The two Beethoven pieces in this concert are firmly in this heroic mould.</p><p>Beethoven's overture to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egmont_%28play%29\" title=\"\">Goethe's play </a> about Count Egmont's unsuccessful attempts to free the Netherlands from Spanish oppression carries this message of freedom so powerfully that it was adopted as the unofficial musical symbol of the 1956 Hungarian uprising against the Soviet Union.</p><p>The overture begins in dark vein, as F minor string chords punch out an oppressively heavy rhythm, countered by plaintive cries of pain in the winds. These musical motives battle it out in a stormy central section until, ultimately light and right triumph.</p><h2><br />Benjamin Britten: Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra</h2><p>Benjamin Britten was much less concerned with the idea of the artist as hero as he was with the desire for his music to be useful. The commission to write a piece of music for a film that introduced the instruments of the orchestra to an audience of children might have been, in other hands, a dry and worthy exercise, but Britten's turned out an exuberant masterpiece in his Young Person's Guide. The first good choice he made was to structure the piece as a set of variations on a majestic, minor key theme by Henry Purcell, taken from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OPO3ORYgOo\" title=\"\">Purcell's incidental music to Aphra Behn's play The Moor's Revenge</a>. After introducing the theme, Britten's variations one by one,  show off what the orchestral sections can do, starting from the highest woodwinds, going down through strings and brass and ending with a great dance for the percussion section. Then, in the climactic masterstroke, he brings all the instrumental groups back, one by one, in a scurrying fugue (fugue meaning a musical game of chase). <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HhTMJ2bek0&amp;feature=related#t=15m45s\" title=\"\">The moment when the big Purcell theme comes blazing back in the brass</a> with all of the other instruments still skirling around it might just be the most ecstatically joyful moment in all music.<br /><em><br /><strong>25-minute interval </strong></em></p><h2><br />Beethoven: Eroica Symphony (No3)</h2><p>Beethoven's Heroic Symphony was written as a defiant and life-affirming statement immediately following a major crisis in his life when, unable to fight his encroaching deafness, <a href=\"http://www.beethovenseroica.com/Pg2_hist/history.html\" title=\"\">he had written his will and contemplated suicide</a>. This daring symphony was longer, louder, more dissonant and contained more extremes of sound and of mood than any symphony to date. In keeping with its grand ambition, Beethoven originally dedicated it to Napoleon, but the manuscript <a href=\"http://etonmess.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/beethoven-eroica.jpg\" title=\"\">clearly shows where he violently scrubbed out the name of his former hero</a> on learning that he had declared himself \"Emperor\".</p><p>The Eroica is in four movements, following the classic Beethovenian journey from darkness into light. The first is a tour de force of emotional narrative, of contrasts and extremes, with violent mood swings, in which the opening rocking melody is quickly transformed into music which is more dark, dramatic and defiant. Beethoven allows the dark side to triumph in the second movement, a funeral march which seems to pre-shadow Mahler, and which treads an inexorable, minor key path towards a terrifying, loud climax before retreating back to a heartbreakingly fractured version of the original march. A demonic, fast dance (scherzo) breaks the mood  in the third movement before giving way to the extraordinary finale. A tentative, plucked rhythm on the strings creeps in. The music builds up line by line, growing in confidence until the full orchestra blazes in with a broad, triumphant melody which Beethoven then uses as the basis of a set of exuberant variations.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6331206","productionOffice":"UK","showInRelatedContent":"true","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1763353","internalContentCode":"391988860","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>The Southbank Centre's head of classical music Gillian Moore introduces each of tonight's three pieces</p>","allowUgc":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:31:33Z","headline":"Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra with Gustavo Dudamel - 23 June","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/22/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-23-june-programme-notes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/22/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-23-june-programme-notes","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","webTitle":"Dudamel and Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra - live","description":"Conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela perform at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London 2012 festival and the Southbank Centre's Sounds of Venezuela series.

Performing two of the orchestral works with which Beethoven redefined the idea of music as an art, here was a grown-up orchestra offering themselves for comparison with the world's best.</p><p>Yet for all that, the orchestra remains incomparable simply because its young members have grown up together. Their sound is given energy not by grandly conceived notions about the implicit nobility and virtue of the music they play, but by a knowledge, grounded in experience, that this music is creating a new world for them and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/20/dudamel-bolivar-sistema-raploch-bignoise\" title=\"\">can do for others</a>.</p><p>I have heard more penetrating interpretations of the Eroica than this, but I've never heard a performance in which the symphony's spirit – the embodiment of an idea of man as author of his own destiny – shone through with more brilliance and force. There were moments when Dudamel might have sought to extract more tension – the funeral march sagged, and the extraordinary decrescendo before the finale's last Presto explosion, in which flute and bassoon play chicken with the strings, could have gone further – but the quality and collective precision of the playing still raised the experience far above what is normally achieved with this work.</p><p>Dudamel's instinctive virtuosity was better displayed in the Egmont Overture and in Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, for which the stage was rammed full of players, including the 14 double-basses whose breathtaking clarity of tone completely overhauled the hall's dry acoustic.  The grand opening and the extraordinary controlled collisions in Britten's closing fugue showed Dudamel at his best, just as the solo sections revealed the orchestra's extraordinary depth of talent (as well as Britten's exceptional ear for instrumental colour), giving the entire work a sense of dynamism and urgency I've never heard in it before.</p><p>The single encore was a beautifully voiced performance of Elgar's Nimrod – a tribute, Dudamel suggested, to a London audience now firmly part of the orchestra's history. As the ensuing 15-second silence proved, these inspirational musicians have certainly earned their place in ours.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"6339017","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1764225","internalContentCode":"392097483","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>The Eroica has seen more penetrating interpretations, but its inner spirit has never shone through with more force than under Dudamel and co, writes <strong>Guy Dammann</strong></p>","allowUgc":"false","starRating":"4","headline":"Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra/Dudamel – review","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Guy Dammann","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/6/24/1340547913364/Dudamel-conducts-the-Simo-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"23","internalStoryPackageCode":"42302","commentCloseDate":"2012-07-24T09:59:00Z","standfirst":"Royal Festival Hall, London","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:41:03Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/24/simon-bolivar-dudamel-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/24/simon-bolivar-dudamel-review","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","webTitle":"Dudamel and Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra - live","description":"Conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela perform at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London 2012 festival and the Southbank Centre's Sounds of Venezuela series.

They are separated by a century, and written by composers who, themselves, were born a century apart (Esteban Benzecry, born 1970 and Richard Strauss, born 1864). </p><p>Although Dudamel and his orchestra have triumphantly made the mainstream European classical repertoire their own, they are also passionate champions of music by South American composers.  The motivation behind Benzecry's Rituales Amerindios (American Indian Rituals) is, in the Argentinian composer's words, \"my wish to write something  that would represent the three great pre-Columbian Latin-American cultures - the Aztec (in Mexico), the Mayan (in Southern Mexico and Central America) and Inca (mostly in Peru).\" </p><p>In this 25-minute piece divided into three movements,. Benzecry skillfully uses the colours in his giant orchestra to depict nature, water, evocations of forests, thunder, as well as ritualistic dances. The opening movement is dedicated to Ehecati, the Aztec god of the wind. We hear a fanfare-type flourish which will turn up again in different guises in the other two movements.  Chaac, the Mayan water god, inspires the second slow movement of the work, full of liquid percussion, including slides upwards on timpani, low marimba sounds and the miraculous noise of the rain-stick. Things get moving again in the last movement, with an evocation of the Inca thunder God Illapa: a storm gathers, rushing up through the orchestra which, this being Latin music, inevitably transforms itself into a dance.<br /> <br /><strong><em>25-minute interval</em></strong></p><h2>Richard Strauss: An Alpine Symphony</h2><p>Richard Strauss's gigantic Alpine Symphony is a very different hymn to nature - this is the complex and ecstatic relationship between man and nature, with no place for any Gods.  Strauss revered Nietschze, (his most famous piece, Also Sprach Zarathursta, best known from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey) and only at the last minute did he think better of calling the symphony The Antechrist. </p><p>The Alpine Symphony could be subtitled \"A Day in the Life of a Mountain\" and, throughout its unbroken 50-minute span,  it shows Strauss the painter of musical pictures and the teller of stories at his blazing best. We start in the shadows of night.  A descending scale creeps downwards through the orchestra, leaving a harmonic trail behind it suggesting, perhaps, the outline of a huge, dark mountain as it emerges from darkness. About three minutes in, the descending scale becomes a blazing, triumphant melody - the sun rising on the mountain.  Moments later, Strauss introduces the bold human character with an energetic, upwards melody which he titles \"the climb\" in the score.  Strauss uses his vast orchestra to depict the experiences of his character on the mountain: a distant hunting party (listen for the 12 offstage horns), waterfalls, meadows, a dark, threatening forest, losing the path, the triumphant view from the summit and the best storm in music since Rossini's William Tell Overture (listen out for the wind machine).  But Strauss's painting of nature in sound is far from naïve and literal. By the time the dark music of night returns, we feel that through all of the dangers, the moments of being lost and the triumphant conquests, we have been on a rich psychological journey.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","showInRelatedContent":"true","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1765052","internalContentCode":"392193136","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>The Southbank Centre's head of classical music Gillian Moore introduces the two works in Tuesday 26 June's concert </p>","allowUgc":"false","lastModified":"2014-05-21T03:50:44Z","headline":"Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra with Gustavo Dudamel - 26  June","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-26-june-programme-notes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/jun/26/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-26-june-programme-notes","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","webTitle":"Dudamel and Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra - live","description":"Conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela perform at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London 2012 festival and the Southbank Centre's Sounds of Venezuela series.

It's also likely, however, to divide opinion. Even though the music pulverises, its eclecticism is also very apparent. The influence of Bartók, Stravinsky and, above all, Prokofiev in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL_69tdTn8Q\">primitivist-constructivist</a> mode is too overt.

Inside the Albert Hall was a mindboggling frenzy. \"Absolutely the best EVER Proms night I have seen in 35 years.\" \"By far the most exhilarating and life-affirming concert I have ever experienced.\" \"The greatest Prom of all time.\" Those are just <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2007/interact/reviews/19aug.shtml\" title=\"\">a few from thousands of such comments online</a>. I asked Dudamel recently about his reactions to this concert. \"When we came here to London,\" he said, \"we experienced and we felt that warmth of the Proms. It was something we've never forgotten.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, when Dudamel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/20/simon-bolivar-gustavo-dudamel-review\" title=\"\">returned to London in 2009 for a residency at the Southbank Centre</a>, there was an air of expectation. He didn't disappoint: 60,000 people mobbed the Bolívars that week, with not much letting up of the intensity from 2007. This time, instead of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/dmitri-shostakovich\" title=\"\">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> and Leonard Bernstein's Mambo, they brought Béla Bartók, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pyotr-tchaikovsky\" title=\"\">Pyotr Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/igor-stravinsky\" title=\"\">Igor Stravinsky</a>. Plus Latin encores galore, performed in their <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/06/25/Bolivar460x276.jpg\" title=\"\">trademark brightly coloured jackets</a> that got twirled and thrown as the concerts gave way to on-stage parties that were more indie rock than classical. The love affair was still on, and with a week to enjoy it, even more passionate.</p><p>Then, last summer, they returned to the Proms, and something odd happened. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/06/prom-29-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-review\" title=\"\">They played Gustav Mahler's monumental Resurrection symphony</a>. But now there were no coloured jackets, no madcap encore behaviour. Of course, this was Dudamel's well-placed reaction to the symphony. You don't follow a piece of that gravity with fun \"pop\" stuff. Yet it was fascinating watching some of the Proms audience who had turned up for the usual \"mambo-madness\" looking almost crestfallen at no fun to follow Mahler's triumphant resolution. Like all good programming there was something clever at play here: a concert revealing something deeper not just about the music but also the musicians.</p><p>Dudamel and his orchestra are growing up. It's not just that they now wear the tailcoats of more established orchestras, or that they have changed their name from \"youth\" to \"symphony\". These changes are a sign of something more profound: this is an orchestra and music director on a frontier. The truth is, there has never been an orchestra like this one. Now mainly in their early 30s, they have already played together for almost two decades. No one really knows how far, and in what ways, they will develop.</p><p>Dudamel, meanwhile, clearly thrives in London. \"London will always be a place with many special and diverse memories,\" he says. \"Much of my early work was here, learning with great conductors and orchestras, I had the opportunity to visit London often – my relationship with your city and your arts scene started then. I went to the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Opera House</a>, spent time at the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">British Museum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Tate</a>, ate almost every lunch at <a href=\"http://www.wagamama.com/\" title=\"\">Wagamama</a> and explored your concert halls and learned what makes the 'London orchestra' such a one-of-a-kind in the world. My relationship with the <a href=\"http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Philharmonia Orchestra </a>brought me many times to London and I will always reflect positively on that early period of development with them – their patience, their warmth, their dedication.\"</p><p>But there is something else special about London. \"You have achieved something unique – it's sort of like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/14/abreu-el-sistema-venezuela-interview-clemency-burton-hill\" title=\"\">our Centre for Social Action in Music</a>, transported piece by piece, concept by concept, to the <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/festivals-series/sounds-venezuela-2012\" title=\"\">Southbank Centre</a> – that is one of a kind outside of Venezuela,\" says Dudamel. \"Everywhere will be music this week in London. A 'pop-up' nucleo, I don't think, has ever happened before in this form. We're going to share a little of what happens, every day, for 500,000 kids in some 350 nuclei around Venezuela in the heart of London. And I think that is perhaps why we feel so at home working and performing here in London.\"</p><p>Talking with the orchestra's players a few weeks ago as they rehearsed in Caracas, I heard the usual youthful bonhomie, and as they boarded UK-bound flights on Saturday, Facebook was humming with posts – principal viola player Ismel Campos still typing as he got on the plane. \"The UK,\" replied one of his friends immediately, \"Take umbrellas!!\" Off stage it is still fun, but will the London audience buy the developing on-stage Bolívars?</p><p>Dudamel has certainly decided to play the stakes high. <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/dudamel-sim%C3%B3n-bol%C3%ADvar-symphony-orchestra-of-venezuela-56273\" title=\"\">He opens the residency on 23 June with Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, a composer he has never performed in London with this orchestra. This is not <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/jun/14/dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra-bernstein-mambo\" title=\"\">mambo</a>, but core European repertoire. Can the Bolívars pull this one off? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTQy1kWmhA\" title=\"\">As the twin opening E flat chords</a> of the most revolutionary symphony of all time are played by the most radical orchestra of all time, we may well find the answer.</p><p>The good news is that if you are not one of the lucky 2,700 who have a ticket to the concert, you can still watch it live <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live\" title=\"\">here on the Guardian</a>.

Will the newly matured Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra make the grade?","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>This is a challenge for Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, make no mistake. Their <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/series/sounds-venezuela\">programmes at the South Bank</a> - part of a well-curated weekend of music-making that celebrates not only Venezuela's El Sistema and its Scottish and English outposts, but at least a soupçon of the spectrum of some other London-based music education projects - contain some repertoire that belongs firmly in the Bolívar party-piece category, such as Britten's Young Person's Guide and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/24/simon-bolivar-youth-orchestra-review\">Strauss's Alpine Symphony</a>. But Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, the climax of their first concert on Saturday (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bolivarlive\">which you can watch live here</a>) decidedly is not. This is a chance for the orchestra, and for Dudamel, to prove how, as Marshall Marcus puts it, they've \"grown up\" - as their changed moniker suggests that they have (a youth orchestra no longer, they are now a \"Symphony Orchestra\", pure and simple, with many of the same personnel who grew up with Dudamel now in their 30s). </p><p>They made a disc of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/dec/08/classicalmusicandopera.art1\">Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh</a> a few years ago, a mixed bag of excitement and interpretative thrills and spills that proved how dynamic this orchestra and conductor could be, but also how far they still had to go to be up there with the best.</p><p>The thing with Beethoven, especially the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRTQy1kWmhA\">Eroica</a>, is that there's nowhere to hide, no gigantic perorations of brassy virtuosity to disguise any interpretative infelicities or flaws in the ensemble, as there can be in the barnstorming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn85GysPT7E&amp;feature=fvst\">late-romantic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZbJOE9zNjw\">20th century</a> repertoire the Simón Bolívars often play. The test of this performance will be  whether it's a beacon of the Bolivars' increasing musical maturity, whether their Beethoven can be as revelatory, as subtle, and as thrilling as that of, say, the Philharmonia or the London Philharmonic - or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/08/spira-mirabilis-eroica-review\">Spira Mirabilis</a>, who played this same piece on their first appearance in London.</p><p>And talking of beacons: the Bolívar's concert tonight with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/20/dudamel-bolivar-sistema-raploch-bignoise\">Big Noise in Stirling</a> ought to have the same effect for music education. (You may, at this point, have the sensation of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tomserviceblog/2010/jun/22/el-sistema-big-noise-music\">old saw being re-oiled</a>, so to speak.) For me, the real point about the Big Noise or In Harmony is not that they demonstrate the unique power of El Sistema, and how that model can be rolled out in other parts of the world. It's rather that El Sistema, like any good programme of socially cohesive music education, reveals the power of music to change lives. And if governments in Scotland and the rest of the country buy into El Sistema (the council in Stirling is now using taxpayers' money to fund the Big Noise project), then the result ought to be increased support for music education across the board, from community music projects to youth orchestras, for the whole social and educational ecology that generations of inspirational, pioneering musicians have developed in the UK over the last few decades. That would really be a properly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/audioslideshow/2012/jun/20/olympic-2012-big-noise-orchestra-audio-slideshow\">olympic-sized legacy</a> of that inspirational concert in Stirling.</p><p><em>* The Guardian is live-streaming the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra's 23 and 26 June Royal Festival Hall concerts. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bolivarlive\">Details here</a>; click <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/interactive/2012/jun/21/simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live-stream\">here to watch the concerts live</a> </em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","showInRelatedContent":"true","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1763098","internalContentCode":"391964848","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Beethoven's third symphony - the Eroica - is an exposing piece for any orchestra.

On the afternoon we meet, the sun is shining and the streets are bustling. Nevertheless, to make the short journey by foot from a nearby car park, we are accompanied by three conspicuously armed guards.</p><p>This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/10/venezuela-caracas-gang-warfare-murder\" title=\"\">Caracas</a>, one of the most violent cities in the world. Venezuela's murder rate is three times that of Iraq and four times that of Mexico. On average, 53 people are murdered here every day.</p><p>This grisly statistic is on my mind as I am ushered in to meet Abreu, the 73-year-old former economist and conductor whose visionary philosophy has, since 1975, been based on the notion that a free, immersive classical music education for the poorest of the poor might positively influence the social problems plaguing the country.</p><p>Abreu's hypothesis has been overwhelmingly vindicated, with more than 380,000 children engaged in national music programmes, more than 80% of whom come from low- or middle-income areas. Of the two million graduates of the programme since its inception, many have gone on to become not just musicians, but lawyers, teachers, doctors and civil servants. Yet it remains one of the great paradoxes of \"El Sistema\", as Abreu's <a href=\"http://www.fesnojiv.gob.ve/en/el-sistema.html\" title=\"\">Fundación Musical Simón Bolívar</a> has come to be known, that no matter how successful it is, how many <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/16/gustavo-dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra\" title=\"\">Gustavo Dudamels</a> it creates, how many <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/03/britain-children-orchestra-sistema\" title=\"\">wealthier nations</a> seek to emulate it, the Venezuelan crime rate still climbs.</p><p>Abreu agrees that the statistics are \"extremely grave\". But he points to evidence that also seems to prove  that without El Sistema's extensive network of <em>nucleos</em> (community music schools), orchestras and choirs, they would be considerably grimmer. \"The Inter-American Development Bank, the Venezuelan State and the Andean Development Corporation are continually supervising the foundation's projects,\" he says, \"because they have invested so many resources. Wherever there is an impact evaluation study, the results are unanimous. Children engaged in the programme attain above-average results in school and show a tremendous capacity for collective community action. The orchestra and the choirs, the heart of the programme, help create a sense of solidarity. Involvement becomes a weapon against poverty and inequality, violence and drug abuse.\"</p><p>Abreu himself is a humble and ascetic figure who has dedicated his life to what he describes categorically as a \"human development\" project. \"The idea came to me because I saw that in Venezuela, music education did not include orchestras for young people,\" he explains, \"but I also could see, in the few existing music schools at that time, that the children who were participating in orchestras developed with a much more humane perception of their role within society. They had a completely different set of values.\"</p><p>The scheme was launched, famously, with just 11 kids in a local garage – a far cry from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEMIX-N3B5Q\" title=\"\">scenes at</a>, say, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms\" title=\"\">Royal Albert Hall 30-odd years later</a>, but his conviction of the possibility of social transformation through music was absolute even then. \"At our first rehearsal, I was certain of it,\" he says, beady brown eyes glittering. \"I told those first 11 members of the orchestra that we were creating the beginning of a network that would eventually turn Venezuela into a musical power by rescuing children from low-income families.\"</p><p>A few days later, I ask Frank di Polo, the violinist and original leader of the orchestra, if he remembers the moment. \"Of course,\" he laughs. \"Maestro Abreu knew all along what he was creating and what it could achieve.\"</p><p>El Sistema, despite the nickname, is not actually a \"system\" of music education, but, as Abreu insists, \"a conception regarding the function of music within society\". It is a vast network of schools, orchestras and choirs that now extends to all 23 provinces in Venezuela, and touches an estimated three adults for every child engaged in the programme. Whether Hugo Chávez or Henrique Capriles triumphs in October's forthcoming presidential elections, it is inconceivable that they should withdraw support for the programme.  Seven successive Venezuelan administrations from across the political spectrum have supported El Sistema – to the tune of around 90% of its operating budget. The funds, tellingly, have always been disbursed by the social services rather than culture departments. This is surely down to the laser political vision of Abreu, whose tiny form and Mother Theresa-esque manner belie a formidable, strategic intelligence. \"The fundamental element that has determined support has been the results El Sistema has proved in the social field,\" he says. \"For Venezuelans, music education is now a constitutional and legal right.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-391429554\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/6/11/120611Bernstein-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120611Bernstein/120611Bernstein.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>Next week, the most visible and thrilling exponent of that principle returns to the UK, when Dudamel, 31-year-old music director of <a href=\"http://www.laphil.com/\" title=\"\">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a>, brings his \"other\" orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Symphony, to <a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000961369\" title=\"\">Raploch, Scotland</a>, for a concert alongside the El-Sistema-inspired initiative <a href=\"http://makeabignoise.org.uk/big-noise-raploch/\" title=\"\">Big Noise</a>.

It is not at all fanciful to propose that in coming years, many more European, American and Asian music institutions will have a spirited young Venezuelan at their helm, usually with terrifically emotive hair.</p><p>This represents something of a dilemma for Abreu, mentor and father figure to all these wildly gifted young maestri. One reason why El Sistema works so well is its familial mechanism: as soon as a child is accomplished enough, they begin to help teach younger generations. If the most talented teenagers leave as soon as the big musical agencies – including the Berlin Philharmonic, in the case of Sistema double bassist <a href=\"http://edicsonruiz.com/index.php\">Edicson Ruiz</a> – come calling, the system may falter.</p><p>Abreu admits it can be difficult to reconcile the need to allow his brightest proteges to spread their wings internationally with the need to keep them in Venezuela as all-important role models, but he repeats that this is a \"human development project\". El Sistema exists, he maintains, \"to strengthen the moral and spiritual development of the country\" in whichever form that takes.</p><p>There are many who believe this quietly charismatic man should be in line for the Nobel peace prize. Sir Simon Rattle, who describes El Sistema as \"nothing less than a miracle\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/03/jose-antonio-abreu-sistema-rattle\" title=\"\">has been advocating it</a> since 2008. But Abreu shakes his head. \"The biggest reward is the opportunity to keep doing our work,\" he says. The international attention his system receives \"creates a great sense of reward and responsibility\". He indicates a poster on the wall emblazoned with the phrase \"<em>Tocar y Luchar</em>\", the official motto of the programme ever since that afternoon in the garage. \"To play and to struggle: that came from our earliest experience when we had so many obstacles for undertaking the project – lack of spaces, instruments, financial resources,\" he explains. \"To play – it's a form of striving, so we can show the validity of the efforts we are committing ourselves to. The struggle is against the obstacles that present themselves. So   there was always this double meaning within the kids, to be both artists and social fighters.\"</p><p>The slogan is more applicable today than ever. \"We are still facing the gravest social problems, and we have a challenge to incorporate as many excluded children as possible,\" Abreu admits. \"We need more teachers, instruments, space, funding.\" The number of kids engaged in El Sistema programmes is estimated to hit the half-million mark by 2015, which seems mind-boggling; but Abreu points out that 33% of Venezuela's 30m population is under 14. I get the sense that he will not rest until every one of those children has access to a local nucleo.</p><p>\"We know that the efforts we put into it are not enough, given the size of the challenge ahead. But this is our dream. And we will keep fighting for it, every day.\"</p><p><em>Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra open London 2012 Festival in Raploch on 21 June, then perform at the Royal Festival Hall on 23 and 26 June as part of Southbank Centre's Festival of the World.

Everyone wants a piece of him. His minders preside over him with a stopwatch. Thirty minutes with the maestro will not be 29 minutes or 31 minutes. It will be 30 minutes.</p><p>We are in Lucerne, so the Swiss time-keeping is even more precise. Dudamel is such an exuberant conversationalist that the guards are doubtless essential. You get the sense that, left to his own devices, he would talk till the cows came down from the mountains for their evening milking.</p><p>His torrent of words is all the more remarkable given his ever more relentless conducting schedule. Long gone are the days when the world flocked to Venezuela to see the man acclaimed by Simon Rattle as the most astonishingly gifted conductor he had met, the man credited with single-handedly rescuing the tradition of western classical music in the barrios of South America.</p><p>Dudamel now carves his life up between Sweden, where he is music director of the&nbsp;Gothenburg Symphony; Los Angeles, as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Caracas; and anywhere else prescient enough to have booked him before he broke through as a box-office superstar, travelling the continents with the ever-dazzling Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra, whose artistic director he has been since 1999.</p><p>But his youth orchestra is not so young these days, and nor is Dudamel – nudging 30 next year. In his first year at Los Angeles, the early tremors of a backlash were evident in some sniffy reviews from one or two American critics. They said he lacked depth, that he pushed the music to the extremes and wanted subtlety. In short, he was not the messiah after all.</p><p>\"No, I'm not the messiah,\" says Dudamel with a shrug and a smile. He spreads his arms along a black leather sofa backstage at the concert hall, where he has been rehearsing. He rattles off the list of the scores he's currently studying, or planning. \"Bruckner symphonies, and opera. I'm really looking forward to conducting Verdi operas, because I have been learning a lot with my maestro,  José Antonio Abreu. There's Carmen at La Scala. And Mozart, of course. And, next year, all the Brahms symphonies and the German Requiem. And I didn't sleep a lot yesterday. I was working. I have to do Mahler's Seventh soon.\"</p><p>Top of his agenda in Los Angeles has been the inclusive approach and energy that he has brought to Venezuelan music-making. \"People can think I'm crazy, that I'm talking about impossible things, but I'm talking about impossible things that are happening,\" he says. He is describing his efforts to change the mix of the audience in LA. It is, of course, impossible to snap his fingers and replicate the Venezuelan system – El Sistema – that has seen the best part of 300,000 children given an orchestral training, and which&nbsp;has engrained classical music in numerous wider communities.</p><p>But he made a start in his first season with the west coast orchestra. He began by talking to the people who worked at the hall selling tickets or programmes, and persuading them to bring their friends and relatives to a concert.</p><p>\"I said, 'We have to do concerts for these people!' Because they are working there, they are giving their life for that hall and they love classical music. It's the same for the community,\" he says. \"We have a huge audience, built up over years. But, from this last season, we have begun to build a new audience, combining of course with the traditional one.</p><p>\"It's amazing working with the new children's orchestra, the Yola [Youth Orchestras of LA] project,\" he says. \"It's like the Sistema in Venezuela. And we also have audiences coming from the children's communities, sometimes poor and excluded ones. When we played a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, I think around 90% of the audience there were listening to classical music for the first time.\"</p><p>In Gothenburg, too, he's determined to bring classical music to a new audience. \"We went, for example, to this place, Hammarkullen – a very poor suburb – and we played two concerts, one for the children of the community, and one for the parents,\" he says.</p><p>\"It's not that people don't like classical music. It's that they don't have the chance to understand and to experience it. Going to a concert can sometimes be very difficult. It can be a long journey. There's the ticket prices. But when the music goes to the community – not the community coming to the concert – they say, 'Wow! I didn't know that this music was so amazing!'</p><p>\"We have to go and show these people what classical music is. We say sometimes that classical music has a small audience, but it's because people don't have the chance to be closer to it. Of course, we also have to play in concert halls. This is our dream when you are a musician – to play in a good, comfortable hall with a wonderful acoustic. But it's also important to bring these new audiences to concerts.\"</p><p>We are speaking as Dudamel prepares to play Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony with the Simón Bolívar players at the&nbsp;Lucerne festival, to which he returns&nbsp;this weekend with the Vienna Philharmonic for the summer festival's closing concerts.</p><p>Is it difficult making the switch between youth and professional orchestras?</p><p>\"Youth orchestras have a special energy,\" he says. \"For a young orchestra, everything is new. But working with a professional orchestra is the same pleasure. In most cases you have tradition there: a tradition in sound, a tradition of a way of playing. I am learning all the time – from every orchestra. Even when you are conducting a children's orchestra, it's very special to have the control and the concentration from a child. I wouldn't want ever to lose touch with that.\"</p><p>For Dudamel, the key is to approach everything as if for the first time. \"You become a musician because you like music ... but in time, when you have your job and you start to work every week, music becomes a routine. My job is to avoid this routine. The challenge is not so much to change the sound. The challenge is to connect and to create something special,\" he says.</p><p>\"Sometimes I say to orchestras, 'Look, people are coming to concerts to listen but also to see what is happening on the stage.' Because it's so easy to enjoy music with a CD in your house. You can stop whenever you want. If you want to talk to somebody with your mobile or to drink a little glass of wine or a scotch.</p><p>\"A concert, it's like a ritual. But the ritual has sometimes become tired. And&nbsp;that is why, even for me sometimes, when I go to a concert, I think, 'Oh my God, here we need something more!' The musicians have to give something more.&nbsp;They don't have to jump, they don't have to scream, but they do have to communicate their feelings.\"</p><p>Dudamel has famously achieved that&nbsp;with the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, with tricks of dress and dance. How does a conductor achieve the same with professional bands?</p><p>\"You can have the most amazing knowledge about music, but if you cannot convince the orchestra, it's impossible. This is part of the mystery of conducting. Toscanini was a very tough man, really direct and angry with the musicians. But he earned their respect because of his knowledge of music and also because of his personality.</p><p>\"After I turned 29, I started to think a little bit more deeply about things. Right now for me it's a big question. Sometimes I see things that I have done in the past – with all my energy. And sometimes now I'm conducting the same thing with less movement but with the same energy.</p><p>\"I was thinking just now of rehearsing the Alpine Symphony. That is a symphony with a huge orchestration, and it's not true that less and less is more. I remember [Sir John] Barbirolli speaking about Jacqueline du Pré – a huge artist giving everything in every note – and he said, 'If you don't exaggerate when you are young, what will you have when you are old?' \"</p><p>We are in the 29th minute of this stream of thoughts, words and gestures – and Dudamel's minder is stepping forward. She contributes an anecdote of her own. None of the young Venezuelan orchestra here to play the Alpine Symphony had ever seen snow-capped mountains until their arrival in Lucerne.</p><p>\"So Gustavo cancelled the rehearsal and paid from his own pocket to take them all to the top of a mountain.\"</p><p>We are back into the potential of messiah&nbsp;metaphors. But time is up. Dudamel needs rest. Even Moses slept before a big gig.</p><p><strong>The Lucerne festival's closing concert will be streamed live on Saturday to cinemas throughout Europe and the UK, and will also be webcast live at 5.30pm at lucernefestival.ch.  The Teresa Carreño Youth Orchestra of Venezuela are at the Royal Festival Hall, London on 12 and 14 October; Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic perform at the Barbican, London on 27&nbsp;and 28 January 2011.</strong></p><h2>Venezuela's next musical sensation</h2><p><strong> </strong>Christian Vásquez is Gustavo Dudamel's fellow product of El Sistema and the teaching of José Antonio Abreu. The 25-year-old Vásquez – who with his long wavy hair looks as much the romantic hero as Dudamel – is set to take the world by storm with the Teresa Carreño Youth Orchestra. This is the next generation of brilliant Venezuelan musicians, players aged 14-19 who are the breeding ground for the Simón Bolívar Orchestra.</p><p>Vásquez and the Teresa Carreño musicians will be at London's Southbank Centre next month, but when I meet him, he has just come offstage after conducting the Simón Bolívar in Lucerne. What was his first experience with the blue-riband ensemble of El Sistema? \"I got a call from Maestro Abreu,\" he tells me through a translator, \"who told me that in two weeks, I would be conducting Mahler's Second Symphony! I said: 'Excuse me?' But it was not so hard in the end.\"</p><p>That's typical of his self-confidence. He makes his musical journey from child chorister, to leader of his local El Sistema orchestra, to globe-trotting twentysomething conductor sound like a serene progress. But then he has models in Dudamel and Diego Matheuz (another Venezuelan making his mark) to inspire him. Does he want to do anything differently from his world-famous predecessor? \"I want to follow Gustavo in the sense of making Venezuela and El Sistema known around the world. But I want to find my own path, my own way, and my own repertoire with the orchestras I conduct.\"</p><p>Vásquez's great opportunity is also his biggest danger. Comparisons with Dudamel are inevitable, but the question is: how many Dudamelitas can the musical world take? The proof will come over the next decade, in whether Vásquez, Matheuz and others establish themselves independently.</p><p>But such thoughts will be far from Vásquez's mind right now: he brings Beethoven, Prokofiev, and Tchaikovsky to the Royal Festival Hall with the Teresa Carreño Orchestra. What can first-time audiences expect? \"Their technical level is spectacular, and the sound they make is amazing. What makes them really special is how hard they work for the music, and how much they love to play. They transmit so much joy, it's fantastic, and contagious,\" says Vásquez.<strong> Tom Service</strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p>","internalOctopusCode":"3804843","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-09-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1452701","internalContentCode":"366730430","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>From Los Angeles to Lucerne, Sweden to La Scala, conductor Gustavo Dudamel tells <strong>Alan Rusbridger</strong> how he's still passionate about his mission to bring joy to the world</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Gustavo Dudamel: 'I'm not the messiah'","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Alan Rusbridger","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2010/9/15/1284564665507/Gustavo-Dudamel-conducts--002.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"9","internalStoryPackageCode":"42302","commentCloseDate":"2010-09-19T21:00:00Z","standfirst":"From Los Angeles to Lucerne, Sweden to La Scala, conductor Gustavo Dudamel tells Alan Rusbridger how he's still passionate about his mission to bring joy to the world","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-20T02:01:26Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/16/gustavo-dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2010/sep/16/gustavo-dudamel-simon-bolivar-orchestra","sectionName":"Music","tags":[{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","webTitle":"Classical music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music","type":"keyword","sectionId":"music","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/music","sectionName":"Music","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alanrusbridger","webTitle":"Alan Rusbridger","rcsId":"GNL004793","r2ContributorId":"15314","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/24/1416841199180/Alan-Rusbridger.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/24/1416841217351/Alan-Rusbridger-R.png","firstName":"","lastName":"rusbridger","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alan Rusbridger was editor of the Guardian from 1995 to 2015. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/aug/26/alan-rusbridger-profile\">Full profile</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alanrusbridger","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/filmandmusic/filmandmusic1","webTitle":"Features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/filmandmusic/filmandmusic1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/filmandmusic/filmandmusic1","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/filmandmusic","webTitle":"Film & music","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/filmandmusic","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/filmandmusic","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"music/series/dudamel-and-simon-bolivar-symphony-orchestra-live","webTitle":"Dudamel and Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra - live","description":"Conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela perform at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the London 2012 festival and the Southbank Centre's Sounds of Venezuela series.

Click here to view.</a></p><p>In the Community Campus of Raploch, a housing estate on the outskirts of Stirling, 120 children aged between six and 13 are rehearsing the Rondeau from Purcell's Abdelazer – familiar to most as the imposing opening theme of Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra. This is the Big Noise Orchestra; but before the music can begin, this rustling, restless, excited gaggle of children must be calm.</p><p>\"Let's have some Big Noise silence now,\" says the conductor, Francis Cummings, a former violinist with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.</p><p>\"We are going to sit in silence until you listen. What we need to do is start from silence.\"</p><p>Eventually, through squeaks and shuffles, through parps from the brass and bashes from the timpani, through the grunts from the basses and jitters from the violins, peace comes. And then the music starts.</p><p>In another part of the building, beyond the gym and the hairdressers, a second orchestra is preparing to rehearse in the sports hall. The musicians of Venezuela's <a href=\"http://www.fesnojiv.gob.ve/en.html\" title=\"Simon Bolivar Orchestra\">Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra</a>, most of whom are in their 20s and early 30s, are making as much noise as 200 people with musical instruments can. There's a clatter of chat and tuning; lads in jeans and baseball caps are swapping violins, trying each other's instruments by turning musical tricks of insouciant virtuosity.</p><p>Then <a href=\"http://www.gustavodudamel.com/\" title=\"Gustavo Dudamel\">Gustavo Dudamel</a>, their 31-year-old conductor, comes to the podium and sits down on his high stool. He looks up, and slightly raises both arms. At this simple gesture, all sound falls instantly away.</p><p>The two orchestras are rehearsing for the same event: a concert to be held on Thursday, 21 June in Raploch. It will open the London 2012 festival, the summer of cultural events ushering in the Olympic Games: an open-air concert for 8,000, to be broadcast live on BBC4. After that, the Venezuelans travel to London, where their concerts at the Southbank Centre on 23 and 26 June<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bolivarlive\"> will be streamed live</a> on the Guardian website.</p><p>Although the two orchestras appear so different – the Venezuelans with their grown-up professionalism and absolute concentration; the Scottish children still fresh to their instruments – they are related. Later Dudamel, who is also the much-fêted chief conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, calls the Scots \"our little sons and daughters\".</p><p>The children are the young members of Sistema Scotland, a radical social-intervention programme based on the model that produced these Venezuelan musicians. Like its Latin American exemplar, Sistema Scotland is hoping to change the lives of the children of an underprivileged community through immersion in classical music.</p><p>The Venezuelan El Sistema was founded by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/14/abreu-el-sistema-venezuela-interview-clemency-burton-hill\" title=\"Guardian: Abreu\">José Antonio Abreu</a>, who began teaching music to 11 students in a Caracas garage. Thirty-seven years on, two million people – including, most famously, Dudamel and the players of the Simón Bolívar Orchestra – have passed through the programme.</p><p>Since that orchestra's sensational UK debut in Edinburgh and the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms\" title=\"Guardian review\"> Proms in 2007</a>, it has exploded many British people's ideas about what classical music can be: these players perform with a fiery passion and joyous exuberance that counters the reputation of classical music as a polite pastime for the middle-aged middle classes.</p><p>The man behind the Scottish version of El Sistema is Richard Holloway, the author and former bishop of Edinburgh. Tipped off by the Guardian in 2005 about how El Sistema was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/nov/24/classicalmusicandopera\" title=\"Guardian: Land of hope and glory\">trying to tackle social inequality in Venezuela</a>, he travelled to Caracas, and was impressed.</p><p>\"I felt in my bones it was what was needed. It was incremental, it was organic. It wasn't quick. To create a great orchestra is by definition slow. It's like growing hard, hard wood … Scotland, like other parts of Britain, has a problem with deprived communities that nothing seems to shift … I've been interested to see if there's not something in the world that would turn that around.\"</p><p>At the same time as Holloway was discovering the Venezuelan Sistema, Stirling council was trying to tackle the problems of one of its most deprived areas: Raploch. In 2004, it began a regeneration project in an area where, at the time, the average income was £6,240; a fifth of the residents were on incapacity benefit, and half of them had no formal educational qualifications.</p><p>\"All the things that happen in deprived communities were happening here: underachieving children, unhealthy adults, a drug problem, kids fed into the criminal justice system,\" said Holloway. \"But it also had a lot of feisty eager people who loved their children and wanted the best for them.\"</p><p>Holloway approached Stirling council and \"they were as mad as we were\". In 2008, Sistema Scotland began its work in Raploch, and now 450 children from the area (whose population is a little over 3,000) are learning how to play musical instruments. The scheme costs £750,000 a year – just 14% of which comes from the public purse.</p><p>But can classical music really be the instrument of social change? The truth is that the effects of Sistema Scotland will only really become clear when the children who started in its 2008 cohort grow up: will they escape the poverty trap and what Holloway calls the \"revolving doors\" of the youth criminal-justice system?</p><p>Even now, walking round the streets of Raploch – whose idyllic position on the banks of the Forth, beneath the benign gaze of Stirling Castle, stands in stark contrast to its history of social deprivation – it is impossible to find anyone with a bad word to say about Big Noise.</p><p>It is a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone, which means everyone knows a young musician. Taf Magoche, whose daughter Chantelle plays violin, says: \"It's a thing that brings the community together, and in the long run it's sowing a lot more benefits because when the kids get older there will be more options.</p><p>\"It's not the best community, but for the future it will be a lot better because of the project. When you look at the social unrest, people on benefits, drugs and all that … this programme has brought something new and different for the kids – something that's not running around the streets causing mayhem.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Martin has a grandson who plays the double bass – \"bigger than he is\". \"The mothers are so proud of their kids,\" she said. \"The wee tears will be in my eyes on Thursday night.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/16/sistema-scotland-stirling-classical-music\" title=\"Guardian: Stirling success for classical music scheme\">A report</a> commissioned by the Scottish government found that all the parents of pupils in the Scottish Sistema felt their child's confidence had improved as a result of their involvement, and more than 90% felt that their child was happier.</p><p>What makes the Scottish Sistema different from other music education schemes in Britain, according to its director, Nicola Killean, is the fact that it is completely immersive.</p><p>\"We have everything from baby classes to orchestral rehearsals,\" she said. The children involved play three times a week, for nearly three hours. It is also collective: \"about being part of a community from the very beginning\".</p><p>Unlike traditional European and north American music education, it does not focus on individual tuition: children play in an orchestra from the beginning.</p><p>Verónica Urrego, who teaches violin and viola in Raploch, and is herself a Venezuelan product of El Sistema, says: \"We are not here just to teach them how to play an instrument, but also how to behave in a community, in a society.</p><p>\"We have to give them the whole package – the discipline to behave in an orchestral rehearsal … It's not an extracurricular activity, it's a way of life,\" she says.</p><p>In Venezuela, the Sistema has grown organically as children grow up and feed back into the system as teachers. Holloway wants the same for Scotland, and a new scheme is on the cards for Govanhill in Glasgow. According to Dudamel, the orchestra can act as a microcosm of wider society.</p><p>\"It has changed not just the lives of the individuals involved – but also of their families, the communities around the children.</p><p>\"And it changed because they have access to beauty; because they have access to sensitivity; because they have access to creativity; they have access to discipline. We are talking here about the elements of a good citizen.\"</p><p>In Raploch, preparations continue for the big night and the big concert. Bartek Bialuckie, an 11-year-old cellist, professed himself \"amazed at the sounds I can make\" and excited about being conducted by Dudamel – \"one of the best conductors on planet Earth\".</p><p>The 20 best musicians from the Big Noise orchestra now join the Venezuelans to rehearse Beethoven's Egmont Overture together. Four years ago, these children were a handful of restless five-year-olds holding their instruments for the first time. Now, they are sitting alongside professionals.</p><p>One tiny blonde bass player is almost exactly half the size and heft of the huge Venezuelan sitting beside her. In the viola section, an 11-year-old girl called Nyree Davidson is playing with total focus and confidence. She has the indefinable poise and alertness of a true musician.
