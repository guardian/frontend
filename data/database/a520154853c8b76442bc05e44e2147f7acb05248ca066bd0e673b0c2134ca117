Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Of the many accolades bestowed on Charleston, South Carolina, the most prestigious is probably Best City in America (in the eyes of the readers of Condé Nast Traveller, anyway). But I&apos;m more interested in two of its more specific boasts: its growing reputation as a gourmet hotspot – where slow-cooked, traditional Southern food is experiencing a revival – and the fact that it was voted Sexiest City in America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. What more incentive does a greedy single girl need to head down south?</p> <p>Before I&apos;ve had a chance to size up the local talent, I am seduced by the prettiness of the genteel port city itself. Founded by the English in 1670, it has picturesque streets lined with palm trees and original, old-timey gas lamps, in front of pastel-painted townhouses with pillars and porches, just begging for a languid afternoon spent lounging with a mint julep. Still so low-rise is the perfectly preserved city that a cruise liner parked in the harbour looms over the rooftops and spires like an ocean-going Godzilla.</p> <p>My first pit stop is at a tiny diner, the Dixie Supply Bakery &amp; Café (<a href=\"http://www.dixiecafecharleston.com/\" title=\"\">dixiecafecharleston.com</a>) at 62 State Street. It&apos;s only open for breakfast and lunch, and most of the menu hovers around the $5 mark. Famed throughout the state for its tomato pie – flavour-packed tomatoes layered with cheese, garlic, basil and spring onions, in a pie crust, served in slices with a hunk of homemade amber-coloured cornbread – it also specialises in the rib-sticking southern dish of shrimp and grits. Grits – a semolina-like paste, made from ground corn cooked with milk and cream – is something of an acquired taste, which, I must confess, I have not yet acquired.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626279\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951383662/Shops-in-Rainbow-Row-Char-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the city has a growing reputation among the foodie fraternity, and was an early adopter of the locally grown movement, its cuisine is firmly anchored in the past – from rustic barbecue joints to a rash of new fine-dining restaurants. These include the award-winning Husk (<a href=\"http://www.huskrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">huskrestaurant.com</a>) named Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appétit magazine in 2011, where nothing grown or farmed outside of the south is served.</p> <p>English settlers arriving here in the 17th century made full use of the pigs left behind by the Spanish, and found its protected peninsula teeming with hundreds of species of seafood. Native Americans taught them which crops would thrive in the swampy, alligator-infested environment, namely corn, sierra beans, and squash. And the arrival of a wave of French Huguenots in the 18th century, drawn by the city&apos;s pledge of religious tolerance to all, brought desserts to the party, plus even more emphasis on pork, introducing charcuterie and cassoulets.</p> <p>Less nobly, Charleston was also the centre of the slave trade in the 18th century: three out of four enslaved Africans arrived in America through this port city. But the ships which docked in the harbour brought with them not only slaves but also cooking and farming practices, introducing rice, okra – eaten fried or in soup – collard greens, aubergines and peanuts. And after more than half a century of celebrating convenience foods, the Lowcountry, as the region is known, is returning – like much of America – to its culinary roots.</p> <p>Central to this is barbecue – by which the locals mainly mean pork, the definitive ingredient of southern cooking. At Jim &apos;N Nick&apos;s Bar-B-Que at 288 King Street, I round off a day of non-stop munching with tender pulled pork, slow-cooked for seven hours, and served with a cheese biscuit (which is nothing like a biscuit, and something like a scone), and collard greens, boiled with and flavoured by juicy lumps of bacon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626280\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951454834/Peninsula-Grills-coconut--001.jpg\" alt=\"Peninsula Grill's coconut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peninsula Grill's coconut cake, Charleston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charleston&apos;s compact size makes it one of the few US cities where it is possible to spend a few days without needing a car. But while exploring the city on foot helps you digest all that hearty southern food, it also means you may end up walking past Kaminsky&apos;s Baking Company (<a href=\"http://www.kaminskys.com/\" title=\"\">kaminskys.com</a>) on N Market Street, famed for its desserts and, dangerously, open until 2am. Just as perilous is Market Street Sweets up the road, with its lip-smacking pralines, peanut brittle and bear-claw caramels. A uniformed temptress calls &quot;Free samples&quot; from the doorway, like the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Next door, the Peninsula Grill (<a href=\"http://peninsulagrill.com\" title=\"\">peninsulagrill.com</a>) serves its celebrated, sensual coconut cake in 1lb slabs, for sharing.</p> <p>As I stagger home, trying to dodge the sweet treats, I realise, a little too late, that I have assiduously road-tested the cuisine, but not surveyed the city&apos;s sexiness. But with my mind now firmly on finding something with a stretchy waistband, the men of Charleston will just have to wait for another, less gluttonous, day.</p> <p><em>• Flights to Charleston were provided by US Airways (</em><a href=\"http://www.usairways.com\" title=\"\"><em>usairways.com</em></a><em>), which flies from Gatwick to Charleston, via Charlotte, North Carolina, from £555 return.

I say that because three of them, friends of mine, live in a mechanic&apos;s shop around Northside Village, Houston, Texas; and the key to a successful Texan road trip is to not consult or visit them, or even go near their street. Big characters, adventurous in business, dangerous at backgammon, generous with rum – but I never fully survived a drive that started at their place, or followed their directions.</p> <p>The first time I drove from their yard I was held overnight at the Mexican border post they recommended, where my residency was cancelled despite paying gratuities. That post phoned the next and I was detained there as well, my residency cancelled again, after paying gratuities the first post told the next I was good for. It all eventually led to me living and writing in Ireland, hence the boys&apos; responsibility – plus here borders are open, and officers are content to just be smug.</p> <p>In the meantime, though, I roamed as a tourist over that border. The second time I left the Riveras, seeing that I was driving nearly seven litres of Americana, the boys loaned me a radar detector, which in the end only beeped after a sheriff&apos;s deputy reached the window to book me for speeding. Then I was busted for the detector as well. And still I returned – but by the third time I hit Rivera territory, I just parked the car in their yard and had them drive me to the airport after a fortnight of lending each other money and choosing who would make Leroy go for beer.</p> <p>A few months after I left, they sold the car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645344\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350042131165/DBC-Pierre-on-the-road-001.jpg\" alt=\"DBC Pierre on the road\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DBC Pierre on the road</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It&apos;s a long introduction, I know; but things are richer with context, and it lays a context for this: in the end I devised a road trip from Houston that avoids the Rivera brothers altogether. A weekender like a TV movie, where a girl slams a motel door, where pumpjacks and crickets compete in the night, where guitar players called Cletus drink rye. A ready-meal road trip that we can take today, a mixture of neon lights and nooks and crannies; because although the perfect drive is the one without a destination, if we&apos;re travelling from here we don&apos;t have the time to ask that many gas station attendants the way to the interstate. With these instructions, all the realities and hospitalities, the expected and unexpected beauty of central Texas can unfold without need of a map; we just have to get to Houston.</p> <p>Even without a destination, a good road trip will have a goal, however; and this, if not risky, should at least mess with temptation – chasing fruitless infatuations, gambling, escaping an abusive partner, or a suicide pact with a friend are all valid fuels for the road. For this starter road trip, the goal must be Texas barbecue: the best in the land, beef as soft as sashimi, served by the pound, on paper.</p> <p>For vegetarians there can be turkey and beans.</p> <p>To do it properly we need to rent a Dodge Charger, if not a small truck. It&apos;s not a long drive for a weekend, maybe an eight-hour round trip. If you draw the route on a map, you&apos;ll see it&apos;s a small triangle in south central Texas – but bear in mind that Texas is almost three times the size of the UK, plus any itinerary should have room to sit and hear the world creak in a breeze. As this page goes to press it&apos;s 28C in central Texas, and humid. Grackles chatter in trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958983798/Blacks-BBQ-001.jpg\" alt=\"Blacks BBQ\" width=\"460\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black's Barbecue in Lockhart, Texas. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday: arrive at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. I once saw Larry Hagman here, back when he really thought he was JR – suddenly we risk seeing him again. If we&apos;re travelling with children or parents, now is the time to leave them; children can shuttle to the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html\" title=\"\">Johnson Space Center</a>, parents to the Houston Medical Centre, arranging to meet on Monday before the flight back.</p> <p>Pick up the car. Before setting the mirrors, tune the radio to 102.5FM, KMKS, a Bay City station with range. Leave the airport and turn right on to the Sam Houston Tollway, heading west to Interstate 10, the Katy Freeway. This junction is the closest we come to the Rivera brothers. Keep moving. If you&apos;re a ZZ Top fan, we pass the turn off to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1380&amp;bih=871&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=s0Bb3slaKBUI0M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zztopgreatest.htm&amp;docid=NEHZqyiBasGuqM&amp;imgurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zzlagrange.jpg&amp;w=754&amp;h=743&amp;ei=JVN1ULzZAaHU0QXUo4GoBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=185&amp;vpy=144&amp;dur=1226&amp;hovh=223&amp;hovw=226&amp;tx=137&amp;ty=110&amp;sig=103750408551928658366&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=153&amp;tbnw=155&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:71\" title=\"\">La Grange</a>, and can detour and pose at the road sign. If not then, two-and-a-bit hours west along I-10, keep an eye out for signs to Luling and Lockhart.</p> <p>For these two-and-a-bit hours a local might say there&apos;s not much to see – but it&apos;s a good time to reflect on how hard it is to imagine John Wayne riding through these subtropics; and to calculate that there are 254 counties in Texas, a mixture of wet, dry, and moist counties, alcoholic beverage-wise. Moist counties are wet and dry depending when and where you are.</p> <p>Take a right into Luling on 183, cross the railway lines, and across the road to the left (633 East Davis Street) sits City Market – the holy grail of beef brisket. If it&apos;s before six in the evening, go in for a pound in butcher&apos;s paper, with a jalapeño, some potato salad, bread or beans. After six, mark the spot to return for breakfast or lunch. Note the heavy smell in the air around here – crude oil. This is a town where oil pumpjacks spring out of backyards and roadsides, many decorated, turned into moving characters, cowboys, grasshoppers, girls, planes.</p> <p>Drive a few miles up 183, watching out for skunks if it&apos;s dark – hit one and never smell the same again – and just before Lockhart, the Plum Creek Inn (<a href=\"http://www.plumcreekinn.net/\" title=\"\">plumcreekinn.net</a>), our motel, appears on the left. What can we say, a motel – big rooms, a swimming pool, air conditioners, no Laura Ashley. In the movie of your life a girl slams a door. Maybe some neon fizzes and crackles. Critters make noise in the grass.</p> <p>From here it&apos;s a quick drive to the old town centre of Lockhart – mecca of barbecue, and somewhere small to wander and soak up. Find North Main Street, at the far side of the courthouse square, and stroll north to Lilly&apos;s at number 110, a beer shop and pool joint – practise your Spanish, one of those nice ladies is Lilly – or walk on one block to Black&apos;s Barbecue (<a href=\"http://www.blacksbbq.com\" title=\"\">blacksbbq.com</a>) the oldest continuously owned barbecue restaurant in Texas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958911674/San-Antonio-riverfront-001.jpg\" alt=\"San Antonio riverfront\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The San Antonio Paseo del Rio river walk, Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And after collapsing to late-night TV – maybe something with a motel in it – there&apos;s only one way to spend Saturday if the car is pointed up highway 183: follow it a while more to Austin, through Mustang Ridge and past Bergstrom Airport, veering left down East 7th Street to East 6th Street. This is the home of live music in the south, a mellow chaos of blues, rock and country. Get lit up at Shakespeare&apos;s Pub (<a href=\"http://www.shakespearesaustin.com/main.html\" title=\"\">shakespearesaustin.com</a>) then trawl the street for the bands that most pull you in.</p> <p>To recover on Sunday, with our mayhem all rinsed out, a long drive down Interstate 35 to San Antonio is the key – for my money San Antone is one of the three most beautiful cities in the US. Hang out by the river, visit the Alamo, eat an enchilada and ponder – this is where Mexico lost its northern state of Texas in battle.</p> <p>Then, driving down I-10 back to Houston, reflect: the Rivera boys are still levelling the score.</p> <p>• <em>DBC Pierre&apos;s first novel </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571215164\" title=\"\"><em>Vernon God Little</em></a><em>, set in Texas, won the Man Booker Prize in 2003</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","wordcount":"1268","commentCloseDate":"2012-10-15T21:45:04Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2012-10-11T12:30:48Z","internalComposerCode":"56a797d5e4b05514c2d823d5","internalOctopusCode":"6765117","internalPageCode":"1813496","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-10-12T11:44:43Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-10-13T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3b3he","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3b3he"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/oct/12/dbc-pierre-texas-us-road-trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/12/dbc-pierre-texas-us-road-trip","webTitle":"DBC Pierre's classic US road trip in central Texas","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-12T21:45:04Z","sectionName":"Travel","sectionId":"travel","type":"article","id":"travel/2012/oct/12/dbc-pierre-texas-us-road-trip","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","editions":[{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","code":"default"},{"id":"au/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/travel","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/travel","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/travel","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1813975","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-397694692","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/8/30/1251633492163/Route-66-at-Oatman-Arizon-001.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Route 66 at Oatman, Arizona during the Grapes of Wrath road trip.","caption":"On the road in Arizona.

Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Let the dawn rise behind you, and drive on towards the sunset. The great American road trip goes west, not east, and it ends at the barrier of the Pacific Ocean. Westward like the pioneers, you travel through ever bigger, emptier and more dramatic landscapes. The skies get taller. The horizons stretch out. You reach the great national parks of the Rockies, where wolves and bears and something close to wilderness still exists, and drive on through the red rock canyonlands of Utah and Arizona.</p> <p>The worst mistake is to be in a hurry. The drive from New York to California is 2,800 miles if you make the mistake of taking the most direct route. If you loop and detour as you should, it&apos;s closer to 3,500 miles, and you want at least 10 days and preferably three weeks or more. Use the interstate highways when you have long stretches to cross, but be sure to meander down plenty of backroads.</p> <p>Unless you have the sort of personality that can&apos;t stand it any other way, keep the planning to a minimum. A cross-country road trip should be a loose, freewheeling, improvisational adventure, full of surprises and sudden friendships with extraordinary strangers.</p> <p>Bars are always good places to meet people. So are independent bookstores – where they survive. The staff invariably know the best places to eat and drink locally, and if there happens to be a cool band playing that night, or a wrestling contest in the back of a local feed store, they can usually tell you about that too. Be observant. America is a land of many signs and billboards, and this is how you&apos;ll find your way to, say, the World&apos;s Largest Prairie Dog, or a saloon called something like Bad Barb&apos;s Vapors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967311338/Richard-Grant-001.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Grant\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Grant on the road</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If a weird rock formation glimpsed off in the distance looks appealing, get yourself over there. A hummingbird might buzz your face; a coyote might trot past. Maybe you&apos;ll experience a moment of perfect silence, or run across an eccentric burying an old fridge full of modern artefacts as a time capsule for future archeologists.</p> <p>I used to go across the country with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, and sleep in the back of whatever shitheap car I had bought for the trip. These days I&apos;m not so pure. I like a dependable vehicle and I stay in motels until I reach the western deserts and mountains. Then I look for remote public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (<a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html\" title=\"\">blm.gov/wo/st/en.html</a>) where I can camp for free and build a fire, usually without sticking to a designated area. I pack a sleeping bag and sometimes a tent, and I never get on the road without a camp stove, an espresso pot, and a pound or two of good ground coffee. Motel and gas station coffee is almost uniformly awful. A bottle of whiskey is a true friend if you find yourself in a dry county down south, and a gallon of water can quite literally save your life if you break down on a desert backroad in summer. I also pack a knife, fork, matches, can-opener and corkscrew, and a small grill to prop over a campfire.</p> <p>Gastronomic despair is a real possibility, especially on interstates. The same fast food restaurants cluster at every exit — Mickey-D&apos;s, Burger Thing, Junk In The Box, Pizza Butt, Dead Lobster and Taco Hell. There are now websites devoted to eating well across the country, and while I check them obsessively in gas stations and motels, the results are usually disappointing. The websites are crowd-sourced, which means that most of the reviewers don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about. <a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/boards\" title=\"\">Chowhound.com</a> is the best of them, but I&apos;d advise looking up the recommendations of top American food writers such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/oct/13/foodanddrink.features5\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Steingarten</a> or Jonathan Gold.</p> <p>The most direct route across the US takes you through the flat cornfields of the Midwest, where American food, and arguably American culture, is at its least zesty. I advise a more southerly course, for the music and storytelling and because the south has barbecue. The meat, which is usually pork shoulder and ribs until you reach Texas, where it changes to beef brisket, is rubbed or marinated with spices and tenderisers, and then cooked slowly for many hours over woodsmoke in a pit or chamber. Hot damn! Done right, it&apos;s amazingly succulent and tangy, and there are dozens of regional variations. An Alabama prison guard once told me his favourite barbecue was &quot;so good it make you wanna hurt somebody!&quot;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967238887/Mississippi-Riverboat-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mississippi Riverboat\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A riverboat on the Mississippi. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Presumably, you will have supplied yourself with some suitable American music for the journey. If the blues sounds good in Clapham, try listening to Muddy Waters or Fred McDowell when driving through the swamps and cotton fields of the Mississippi delta. Better yet, stop off in a raw backcountry juke joint, buy a pint of moonshine from the man outside and hear the last surviving bluesmen playing it live. You will feel very foreign, but not unwelcome.</p> <p>Tom Waits has a knack for getting you through the last miles to a motel when you&apos;re dead tired. When you&apos;re driving through a thunderstorm at night on the high plains of Colorado, try Bob Dylan. Gram Parsons sounds just right in the desert, and so do the new tripped-out DJ sounds of Gonjasufi.</p> <p>The first time I drove across the country, I felt so liberated and happy – and so dejected when we reached the end of the road and stared out at the Pacific. So I drove back the other way to New Orleans, and then up to Montana, and down to Arizona. For a couple of years, I lived on the road, sleeping in cars and tents and other people&apos;s houses, doing odd jobs and pieces of journalism. You hear a lot of windy nonsense trumpeted about freedom in America, especially by politicians, but when you&apos;re roaming around the enormous public lands of the American west, sleeping next to a different campfire every night, you&apos;re about as free as you can realistically get in this day and age, and that&apos;s the best reason there is to hit the road.</p> <p><em>• Read more about Richard&apos;s travels at </em><a href=\"http://www.richardgrant.us/\" title=\"\"><em>richardgrant.us</em></a><em>.

Click on the magnifying glass to see a map of Kari's trip</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>&quot;The way I see it, the further north you go, the better it gets,&quot; the old timer tells us as we fill up with fuel at Grand Marais, an end-of-the-road town in northern Michigan, on the shore of Lake Superior. A brutal cold wind whips in off the lake, direct from the Canadian wilderness. Among the huddle of buildings is a small brewery and an outfitting store (We Welcome Hunters and Trappers). Further up, a clapboard house is, appropriately, called End of the Trail.</p> <p>We have driven more than 1,000 miles to get here, to the very edge of the US. To give our two-year-old daughter, Nell, the experience of being in the wilds, my husband and I have brought her on a road trip through Michigan, to its remote Upper Peninsula, on a route rated one of North America&apos;s best for autumn colour. We are in effect circumnavigating Lake Michigan, with a few detours.</p> <p>The name Michigan comes from the Native American word <em>michigama</em>, meaning great lake. With 3,288 miles of shoreline, Michigan has more coast than the US&apos;s entire eastern seaboard. Our journey takes us through scenic inland waterways, giant dunes, old-growth forests, and vast inland seas.</p> <p>With Chicago behind us, we head up the eastern shore of Lake Michigan in a rented motorhome, our passport to the wilds when travelling with a young child. We cover many miles in the first couple of days, cruising up Route 31. Beyond the highway and strip malls are small, genteel towns with immaculate harbours, catering for well-heeled tourists and second-home owners.</p> <p>In the warm autumn light we pass farmers&apos; markets and fruit farms. In tented shelters by the road, trestle tables are piled high with wooden boxes of blueberries, apples and raspberries. Michigan is well-known as a fruit-growing state, and Traverse City is famed as the cherry capital of the US. The state is also home to around 100 vineyards and wineries, producing particularly good rieslings. We dine well as we travel north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644417\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966873674/Kari-Herbert-and-Nell-at--001.jpg\" alt=\"Kari Herbert and Nell at Hurricane Bay\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kari with daughter Nell at Hurricane Bay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At night, we opt for rustic state forest campsites, often in areas of outstanding natural beauty. We cook over a fire, reading and talking by candlelight. In the darkness, we can see the glow of other campfires and hear nothing but the distant murmur of voices and the wind in the trees. We&apos;re alone, but with others nearby; there is comfort in these woods. In the mornings, Nell plays on the golden beaches by the clear waters of Lake Michigan, and dances through piles of leaves and pine cones in the forests.</p> <p>Our first major destination is Sleeping Bear Dunes national park, named after a Chippewa legend which tells how a forest fire on the lake&apos;s western shore drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake. After many miles of swimming, the mother bear reached safety and waited on a high bluff for her cubs to join her. Too tired to continue, the cubs drowned within sight of the shore. The great spirit Manitou created two islands to mark where the cubs disappeared and a solitary dune to represent the mother.</p> <p>Wind and erosion have greatly reduced the size of the &quot;bear&quot; over the years; nevertheless, this 35-mile stretch of towering dunes, forests and beaches is consistently voted as one of the most beautiful places in the US. We pay $10 to take the seven-mile Pierce Stocking scenic drive – a gentle loop through woodland with spectacular viewpoints over forests and lake.</p> <p>Down on the lakeshore the dune climb is also popular, particularly for kids. On top of the giant dune, we are 150m above the lake, which stretches almost 60 miles west towards Wisconsin, hidden by the curve of the Earth. We continue north, passing Traverse City and Elk Rapids and a sign announcing the 45th parallel – halfway between the equator and the North Pole. Cheered by this unexpected landmark, we pull over for a cup of tea and a slice of apple pie.</p> <p>Miles of blueberry and corn fields and acres of vines are punctuated by immaculate tall red barns and stands of pine, aspen and maple. Halloween is fast approaching. Pick-ups at roadside stalls are filled with pumpkins and dark-skinned gourds.</p> <p>The leaves are beginning to deepen: golds of the trembling aspen and white birch, burnished copper of white ash, and russets and deep blood-reds of sugar maple and black gum trees. We&apos;d been told many times that the autumn colours get better the further north you go. This is true of many things in Michigan: fewer bugs, fewer tourists, cleaner air. We want to get to the wilds, to big country, to solitude.</p> <p>Ernest Hemingway figures large in this landscape. His lazy childhood days beside Walloon Lake and in the nearby streams and woods fundamentally influenced his writing. Many of his short stories were based here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644418\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966820720/Lake-Superior-the-Shipwre-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We take a short detour to Horton Bay on Lake Charlevoix, a favourite spot for those following a Hemingway trail. Beside the General Store is the Red Fox Inn, where Hemingway stayed as a young man, and whose owner, Vollie Fox, taught him to fish. Handpainted signs tell the story. The wonderful store, too, is full of memorabilia. The store owner, Chip Lorenger, spreads a well-used map on the bar and directs us to some of his favourite places.</p> <p>Taking his advice we head out on the backroads following a route taken by Hemingway and his first wife after their wedding in 1921. &quot;See all that,&quot; Hemingway told his bride. &quot;Talk about the beauty of the Bay of Naples! I&apos;ve seen them both, and no place is more beautiful than Little Traverse in its autumn colours.&quot; We cannot help but agree as we swing round the bay and make our way on route 119 towards the great <a href=\"http://www.mackinacbridge.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Bridge</a>, gateway to the Upper Peninsula and roughly the halfway point of our journey. To mark this – and to enjoy a hot bath and good food – we leave the motorhome and catch a ferry to <a href=\"http://www.mackinacisland.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Island</a>.</p> <p>Cars are prohibited here, so residents and visitors use bicycles or horse-drawn carriages. It is a slightly unreal but enjoyable escape into nostalgia. Numerous fudge shops pump their sweet, chocolatey fumes into the street as day trippers pour off the ferry. We spend a night at the impressive Grand Hotel, built colonial-style in Michigan white pine. Opened in 1887, it is the grand dame of American hotels.</p> <p>Back on the mainland, we head towards the famed Tahquamenon Falls on the northern side of the peninsula, setting for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&apos;s epic poem The Song of Hiawatha. At the village of Paradise we turn west and enter wilderness territory – 1,000 square miles of old-growth forest. At its heart is the Tahquamenon, the &quot;dark river&quot; or &quot;golden river&quot; of the poem. The upper falls are the largest waterfall east of the Mississippi river, after Niagara.</p> <p>Snow is beginning to fall as we rent a small boat and row to the island between the five smaller cascades that form the Lower Falls. We have the place to ourselves. Chipmunks scurry across our path as we step over logs half-gnawed by beavers. We watch the play of colours across the falling water – the crimson, gold and russet forest framing the brown, churning torrents.</p> <p>The warmth of the previous week is gone. The thermometer has dropped by 20 degrees overnight. Days before, a man in flip-flops and T-shirt had said, &quot;Enjoying the weather, are ya? Make the most of it. Winter is coming.&quot;</p> <p>As the cold bites, we begin to see why many of the local residents head south, like birds, to warmer climes. Many places in the Upper Peninsula can expect between four and five metres of snow during the winter.</p> <p>We reach the far north of Michigan. At Muskallonge Lake state park the tarmac ends. On a rutted track we grope our way slowly along the shores of Lake Superior, as white-tailed deer cross our path. This is a seasonal route, accessible in winter only by snowmobile. It&apos;s dark by the time we arrive at the Hurricane River campsite. A sign pinned to the small registration hut warns of black bears. Our motorhome is shaken through the night by growling winds. We wake to find the skylights covered in snow and a carapace of ice.</p> <p>We are on the fringes of the 40-mile Pictured Rocks shoreline, a sandstone escarpment that runs from Laughing Whitefish Falls to Tahquamenon in the east. This dramatic exposure of rocks is Michigan&apos;s top tourist attraction – and best viewed from a boat on the water in milder weather.</p> <p>As the storm clouds pass, we walk to the shoreline and find one of the most beautiful, and the most treacherous, beaches I have ever seen. This northern shore of Michigan on Lake Superior is known as the Shipwreck Coast. Waves crash on the bone-white sand. We walk through spray towards the Au Sable lighthouse, our daughter gathering up sand-polished stones – agate, jasper, quartz, basalt and hematite – and rolling them into the surf.</p> <p>We can just spot the teeth of the infamous sandstone reef appearing through the waves. We weave our way along the beach and over jutting platforms of marbled rocks, to cut back on to the trail through fir and aspen.</p> <p>As we near the lighthouse, we begin to see the shipwrecks. Black ribs jut out of the sand, the remains of the hull of a boat. Farther on lies another nautical skeleton. There is beauty here, but desolation too, and we feel that particularly now, as winter approaches.</p> <p>We reach Au Sable Point and watch the darkening sky. We cannot go any farther north. This is the edge of the US, and the Canadian wilderness lies beyond these perilous waters. That will be another journey.</p> <p>It&apos;s often the road to nowhere that brings you to exactly the place you need to be. Many of the roads we have taken to get here were glorious. For the most part, the delight was in the driving: each turn of the road providing a different display of indescribable autumnal colour.</p> <p>We didn&apos;t know it when we started out, but this place is our turning point. With wind-stung cheeks, we sing our way back down the trail to ward off black bears. We have the storm at our backs and something of the wilderness in our hearts. This is what we came for.</p> <p>• <em>Kari Herbert&apos;s latest book is </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Wives-Remarkable-Behind-Explorers/dp/192681262X/ref=sr_1_2?\" title=\"\"><em>Polar Wives: The remarkable women behind the world&apos;s most daring explorers</em></a><em> (Greystone £10.79)</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"4","wordcount":"1768","commentCloseDate":"2012-10-15T21:45:05Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2012-10-11T14:40:37Z","internalComposerCode":"56ab76a0e4b079b5028b1b9a","internalOctopusCode":"6758839","internalPageCode":"1813614","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-10-12T11:36:30Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-10-13T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3b3yz","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3b3yz"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/oct/12/michigan-us-great-lakes-road-trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/12/michigan-us-great-lakes-road-trip","webTitle":"Fall for the lakes: a road trip through Michigan's wilderness","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-12T21:45:05Z","sectionName":"Travel","sectionId":"travel","type":"article","id":"travel/2012/oct/12/michigan-us-great-lakes-road-trip","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","editions":[{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","code":"default"},{"id":"au/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/travel","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/travel","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/travel","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1813716","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-397637097","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349973157789/Ride-down-the-Salmon-rive-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Ride down the Salmon river in Idaho, America.","caption":"Ride down the Salmon river in Idaho, America.

Photograph: Dennis Macdonald/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>It&apos;s 131 years since the gunfight at the O.K. Corral but Tombstone is still milking that most famous of western shootouts – between the Earps and the Clantons – for every cent. And the latest piece of Earpsploitation is Virgil&apos;s Corner. Now a boutique B&amp;B, it was once the home of Virgil Earp. Virgil was the kingpin of the Earp family. When things reached a head with the Clanton gang, he deputised his younger brother Wyatt and his friend &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday to help him sort things out. We have heard of Wyatt because, unlike his brothers, he lived to a ripe old age, long enough to spin the tale.</p> <p>Virgil was senior lawman in Tombstone and built a house a couple of blocks from the O.K. Corral in 1880. The More family took on the house in 1969 – but it was badly damaged by fire in 1998. Timbers that survived, including original doors, had been put into storage. And all of them have now been incorporated in the B&amp;B&apos;s front section, which replicates Virgil&apos;s original 14ft x19ft house.</p> <p>&quot;I started planning and dreaming of the B&amp;B because of the location and historical significance of the property,&quot; said Diane More. &quot;I hated to think it would just be a vacant lot. What better way to allow people to experience the wild west than to build a B&amp;B on a historic site in Tombstone?&quot;</p> <p>Diane scoured antique shops across Arizona and Texas for authentic items for the B&amp;B. And when it eventually came to decorating the place, she chose paint colours that had been available in the 1880s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397694683\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349871238050/Virgils-Corner-former-Ear-001.jpg\" alt=\"Virgil's Corner, former Earp family home\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virgil's Corner, former Earp family home</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That probably explains why, to contemporary eyes, the decor looks a bit on the drab side: cheap but not overly cheerful. Remember, though, that this would have been the height of sophistication in the late-19th century – and still wild – west, where mud, wood and sawdust were established style statements.</p> <p>The silver stars on the bedheads are a little tacky, especially the big one saying &quot;US Marshal&quot; over the bed in Virgil&apos;s room. But this is a town for western fans, and Virgil&apos;s Corner is as close as you&apos;re going to get to the homely ambience of the old days.</p> <p>If, like me, you&apos;re a sucker for the Wyatt Earp legend, you get a hell of a kick knowing that you&apos;re sleeping on the spot where he and his brothers used to get together of an evening.</p> <p>Some parts of Tombstone have been &quot;restored&quot; to the point where you feel like you&apos;re in a theme park. The O.K. Corral is still there and, inevitably, there is a daily re-enactment of the gunfight. Big Nose Kate&apos;s saloon on East Allen Street, named after Holliday&apos;s girlfriend, is a very touristy version of its original incarnation as the town&apos;s Grand Hotel, but it still has the same long bar at which the Earps and the Clantons would have taken their drinks.</p> <p>There is probably nothing better after a night at the saloon than breakfast at Virgil&apos;s Corner …</p> <p><em>• Virgil&apos;s Corner (97 East Fremont Street, +1 520 548 1025, </em><a href=\"http://www.virgilscorner.com\" title=\"\"><em>virgilscorner.com</em></a><em>) has doubles from $98.

Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>It&apos;s 10am on Sunday in Williamsburg, and sleepy-eyed locals are swarming around the magnificent vintage counter at Diner (<a href=\"http://dinernyc.com/\" title=\"\">dinernyc.com</a>), a neighbourhood favourite in a converted 1920s Kullmans dining car on the corner of Berry Street and Broadway. Inside the restaurant, which has been championing &quot;locavore&quot; fare for 14 years, 1960s Americana streams from the speakers, a waiter in hotpants and oversized hipster specs serves us bloody marys, and I&apos;m about to take a bite of a juicy, grass-fed burger.</p> <p>Since Diner opened in 1998, Brooklyn&apos;s food scene has grown exponentially, and now ranges from three Michelin stars at <a href=\"http://www.brooklynfare.com/\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Fare</a> to American-Asian sharing plates at <a href=\"http://taldebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">Talde</a>, progressive pizza at <a href=\"http://robertaspizza.com\" title=\"\">Roberta&apos;s</a>, and rib-sticking southern barbecue at <a href=\"http://fettesaubbq.com\" title=\"\">Fette Sau</a>.</p> <p>When I say I&apos;m in New York mainly for a bite of the second borough, a well-respected New York chef quips, &quot;We do have restaurants in Manhattan too, you know.&quot; I can understand his exasperation: Brooklyn is rather hogging the culinary limelight. Of<a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/2012/09/best-new-restaurants-2012\" title=\"\"> Bon Appétit magazine&apos;s best new restaurants in America 2012</a>, two (<a href=\"http://www.blancanyc.com/\" title=\"\">Blanca</a> and <a href=\"http://battersbybrooklyn.com\" title=\"\">Battersby</a>) were in Brooklyn; none was from over the bridge.</p> <p>It&apos;s not just restaurants that make Brooklyn a foodie destination. Its grass-roots food culture takes in everything from street food – the brilliant Smorgasburg Sunday &quot;flea food market&quot;, with stalls selling everything from oysters to beef jerky – to decent blue collar bar food as seen at newbie Pork Slope (<a href=\"http://www.porkslopebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">porkslopebrooklyn.com</a>), and a local brewing scene.</p> <p>As an American food obsessive, I jumped at the chance to join burger expert and craft beer nut Tom Byng on a &quot;research tour&quot; of the meaty, beery hotspots of Brooklyn.</p> <p>&quot;In the UK we&apos;ve been drinking flavoured water for decades, thinking it was beer, but the Americans pack theirs full of flavour, which is great for burgers because the flavours stand up to it,&quot; says the restaurateur, whose regular research visits underpin the food and drink at his UK-based Byron burger chain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397770791\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349955327401/Burger-at-Diner-Brooklyn-001.jpg\" alt=\"Burger at Diner, Brooklyn\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burger with skin-on fries and pickled red onion at Diner in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&quot;This is late for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve eaten a burger at 7am before now. When you do tours like this, you have to start early.&quot;</p> <p>We&apos;re pleased with Diner&apos;s freshly ground, simple, but well-put-together burgers ($14.50), which come with a molten slick of sharp American cheddar and a dwarfing mound of crunchy, skin-on fries.</p> <p>&quot;The pickled red onion is a nice touch, and the Yanks are way ahead of us on burger buns,&quot; says Byng, holding up a Jewish challah-style bun, golden and brioche-like in its sweetness and texture. It&apos;s a decadent spread for breakfast-time, but the quality of the ingredients shines through.</p> <p>We&apos;re now interested in a midday tipple, and soon find ourselves in the midst of the tour crowds at Brooklyn Brewery. The UK is the brewery&apos;s second-largest export market after Sweden, and it supplies hip bars from Aberdeen to London. It started in 1988, when founders Steve Hindy and Tom Potter set about reviving Brooklyn&apos;s forgotten brewing past (before prohibition, the borough boasted 48 breweries). I try the Fiat Lux Brewmaker Reserve, a one-off, small-batch beer that changes every quarter. This one is flavoured with coriander and lime peel and is rich, hoppy and aromatic, with an underlying sourness.</p> <p>While its beer may be sold all over the world, the Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s local impact should not be underplayed: when it opened here, Williamsburg was desolate and mildly scary. Now it&apos;s a desirable neighbourhood full of independent shops, cafes, craft beer-led pubs such as Mugs Alehouse (<a href=\"http://mugsalehouse.com/\" title=\"\">mugsalehouse.com</a>) and beer delis such as Bierkraft (<a href=\"http://www.bierkraft.com\" title=\"\">bierkraft.com</a>), which sells more than 1,000 brews.</p> <p>It has also paved the way for other alcohol producers, including the <a href=\"http://sixpoint.com/\" title=\"\">Sixpoint</a> craft brewery further south in Redhook. Brooklyn Brewery co-founder Tom Potter has opened the <a href=\"http://nydistilling.com/\" title=\"\">New York Distilling Company</a>, also in Williamsburg, where we sample some throat-scorching Perry&apos;s Tot gin.</p> <p>Most local bars and burger joints stock these brews. At Dutch Boy Burger, at 766 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, a kitsch diner gives way to a dark craft beer room complete with vintage arcade games, and the burger comes with a fried mushroom and onion topping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397770792\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349969877587/Beer-pumps-at-Barcade-001.jpg\" alt=\"Beer pumps at Barcade\" width=\"460\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beer pumps at Barcade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arcade games from the 1980s are also in vogue at Barcade (<a href=\"http://barcadebrooklyn.com/\" title=\"\">barcadebrooklyn.com</a>), back in Williamsburg, where I order the Ta Henket ancient ale. This is brewed by Delaware craft brewery <a href=\"http://www.dogfish.com\" title=\"\">Dogfish Head</a>, according to methods specified in (get this!) ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It&apos;s fermented with Egyptian yeast, and flavoured with Middle Eastern herbs. I have never tasted anything quite like it, but I love its complexity and weirdness, its spicy apple notes.</p> <p>Then it&apos;s on to the legendary Spuyten Duyvil (<a href=\"http://www.spuytenduyvilnyc.com\" title=\"\">spuytenduyvilnyc.com</a>) bar over the expressway on Metropolitan Avenue. Blackboards are scrawled with wonderfully named beers, there&apos;s an old red bike on the wall, and retro barbers&apos; chairs provide comfy seating. We try a refreshing, aromatic, slightly fruity <a href=\"http://stillwaterales.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stillwater</a> pale ale, which is made by a nomadic, small-batch brewer using wild yeast.</p> <p>And it&apos;s not just beers that are being fermented. At new waterfront restaurant Governor (<a href=\"http://www.governordumbo.com/\" title=\"\">governordumbo.com</a>) in Dumbo, 32-year-old chef Brad McDonald (previously of Noma and Per Se), is fermenting his own tongue-twitchingly intense soy sauce to adorn sweet, pearlescent jewels of raw scallop.</p> <p>&quot;Being in Brooklyn means a lot,&quot; he tells me from his open kitchen. &quot;It&apos;s a hotbed of culinary creativity, art and forward thinking, and it&apos;s going through a huge artisanal renaissance.&quot;</p> <p>• <em>The trip was provided by Byron (</em><a href=\"http://www.byronhamburgers.com\" title=\"\"><em>byronhamburgers.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"9","wordcount":"915","commentCloseDate":"2012-10-15T21:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2012-10-09T16:22:49Z","internalComposerCode":"56a7828ee4b0a855b746cbd6","internalOctopusCode":"6757276","internalPageCode":"1812531","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2012-10-15T14:26:17Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-10-13T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3b28y","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/3b28y"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2012/oct/12/brooklyn-new-york-beer-food","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/12/brooklyn-new-york-beer-food","webTitle":"Beer and burgers: how Brooklyn, New York, is brewing up a storm","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-12T21:45:00Z","sectionName":"Travel","sectionId":"travel","type":"article","id":"travel/2012/oct/12/brooklyn-new-york-beer-food","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","editions":[{"id":"travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel","code":"default"},{"id":"au/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/travel","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/travel","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/travel","webTitle":"Travel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/travel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/travel","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/1813373","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-397626277","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951279027/The-Battery-Charleston-008.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"The Battery, Charleston","caption":"18th-century homes on the promenade at Battery Park, Charleston.

class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">18th-century homes on the promenade at Battery Park, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Of the many accolades bestowed on Charleston, South Carolina, the most prestigious is probably Best City in America (in the eyes of the readers of Condé Nast Traveller, anyway). But I&apos;m more interested in two of its more specific boasts: its growing reputation as a gourmet hotspot – where slow-cooked, traditional Southern food is experiencing a revival – and the fact that it was voted Sexiest City in America by the readers of Travel + Leisure magazine. What more incentive does a greedy single girl need to head down south?</p> <p>Before I&apos;ve had a chance to size up the local talent, I am seduced by the prettiness of the genteel port city itself. Founded by the English in 1670, it has picturesque streets lined with palm trees and original, old-timey gas lamps, in front of pastel-painted townhouses with pillars and porches, just begging for a languid afternoon spent lounging with a mint julep. Still so low-rise is the perfectly preserved city that a cruise liner parked in the harbour looms over the rooftops and spires like an ocean-going Godzilla.</p> <p>My first pit stop is at a tiny diner, the Dixie Supply Bakery &amp; Café (<a href=\"http://www.dixiecafecharleston.com/\" title=\"\">dixiecafecharleston.com</a>) at 62 State Street. It&apos;s only open for breakfast and lunch, and most of the menu hovers around the $5 mark. Famed throughout the state for its tomato pie – flavour-packed tomatoes layered with cheese, garlic, basil and spring onions, in a pie crust, served in slices with a hunk of homemade amber-coloured cornbread – it also specialises in the rib-sticking southern dish of shrimp and grits. Grits – a semolina-like paste, made from ground corn cooked with milk and cream – is something of an acquired taste, which, I must confess, I have not yet acquired.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626279\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951383662/Shops-in-Rainbow-Row-Char-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shops in Rainbow Row, Charleston. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the city has a growing reputation among the foodie fraternity, and was an early adopter of the locally grown movement, its cuisine is firmly anchored in the past – from rustic barbecue joints to a rash of new fine-dining restaurants. These include the award-winning Husk (<a href=\"http://www.huskrestaurant.com\" title=\"\">huskrestaurant.com</a>) named Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appétit magazine in 2011, where nothing grown or farmed outside of the south is served.</p> <p>English settlers arriving here in the 17th century made full use of the pigs left behind by the Spanish, and found its protected peninsula teeming with hundreds of species of seafood. Native Americans taught them which crops would thrive in the swampy, alligator-infested environment, namely corn, sierra beans, and squash. And the arrival of a wave of French Huguenots in the 18th century, drawn by the city&apos;s pledge of religious tolerance to all, brought desserts to the party, plus even more emphasis on pork, introducing charcuterie and cassoulets.</p> <p>Less nobly, Charleston was also the centre of the slave trade in the 18th century: three out of four enslaved Africans arrived in America through this port city. But the ships which docked in the harbour brought with them not only slaves but also cooking and farming practices, introducing rice, okra – eaten fried or in soup – collard greens, aubergines and peanuts. And after more than half a century of celebrating convenience foods, the Lowcountry, as the region is known, is returning – like much of America – to its culinary roots.</p> <p>Central to this is barbecue – by which the locals mainly mean pork, the definitive ingredient of southern cooking. At Jim &apos;N Nick&apos;s Bar-B-Que at 288 King Street, I round off a day of non-stop munching with tender pulled pork, slow-cooked for seven hours, and served with a cheese biscuit (which is nothing like a biscuit, and something like a scone), and collard greens, boiled with and flavoured by juicy lumps of bacon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397626280\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349951454834/Peninsula-Grills-coconut--001.jpg\" alt=\"Peninsula Grill's coconut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peninsula Grill's coconut cake, Charleston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charleston&apos;s compact size makes it one of the few US cities where it is possible to spend a few days without needing a car. But while exploring the city on foot helps you digest all that hearty southern food, it also means you may end up walking past Kaminsky&apos;s Baking Company (<a href=\"http://www.kaminskys.com/\" title=\"\">kaminskys.com</a>) on N Market Street, famed for its desserts and, dangerously, open until 2am. Just as perilous is Market Street Sweets up the road, with its lip-smacking pralines, peanut brittle and bear-claw caramels. A uniformed temptress calls &quot;Free samples&quot; from the doorway, like the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Next door, the Peninsula Grill (<a href=\"http://peninsulagrill.com\" title=\"\">peninsulagrill.com</a>) serves its celebrated, sensual coconut cake in 1lb slabs, for sharing.</p> <p>As I stagger home, trying to dodge the sweet treats, I realise, a little too late, that I have assiduously road-tested the cuisine, but not surveyed the city&apos;s sexiness. But with my mind now firmly on finding something with a stretchy waistband, the men of Charleston will just have to wait for another, less gluttonous, day.</p> <p><em>• Flights to Charleston were provided by US Airways (</em><a href=\"http://www.usairways.com\" title=\"\"><em>usairways.com</em></a><em>), which flies from Gatwick to Charleston, via Charlotte, North Carolina, from £555 return.
