While observing routines that wouldn't be so alien to the Duke of&nbsp;Red River – building fences and fires, funnelling beasts this way or that – it sometimes strays off the beaten track into shapelessness, but Oreck lends individual segments a quiet fascination: rarely can anyone have paid such rapt attention to reindeer dental records, or made such quotidian drama from a wolverine hunt. Sensitive viewers should be warned of some grisliness involving those unfortunate Rudolphs marked for slaughter; though even this might be considered a show of Aatsinki's honest curiosity, how Oreck

rightwing commentator suggested the violence in The Hunger Games, which Rodger's father worked on, could have inspired the killing spree","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>The rightwing US commentator Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/05/27/the_left_takes_another_human_tragedy_and_converts_it_into_a_political_issue\">has said</a> on his radio show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/elliot-rodger-suspect-california-mass-murder-shooting-stabbing\">Elliot Rodger's killing spree</a>, which left six people dead in southern California, could have been in part inspired by the film The Hunger Games.</p><p>Rodger's father was an second unit director on the film, in which a totalitarian state organises a televised fight to the death between various citizens in order to maintain control. \"Have you seen any of the Hunger Game movies?\" said Limbaugh. \"Do you know what they're about? … This is crucial! This is what this guy's dad did. It's teenagers killing other teenagers. It's a survivalist game … They're being forced to, but they're still doing it … This kid might say he was forced to [kill] by societal pressure.\"</p><p>He's not the first to suggest that Hollywood had a hand to play in influencing Rodger. The Washington Post's film critic Ann Hornaday suggested that \"frat-boy fantasies\" like Bad Neighbours caused frustration to those, like Rodger, whose lives didn't match up, and that a culture of \"violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger\" on screen could have catalysed Rodger's acts. Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow, who the article alluded to, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/27/seth-rogen-ann-hornaday-elliot-rodger-judd-apatow\">reacted angrily</a> on Twitter, prompting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/ann-hornaday-responds-seth-rogen-judd-apatow-elliot-rodger\">a rebuttal from Hornaday</a>.</p><p>Limbaugh also suggested that social media was partly to blame. \"Half the people or more on these social media sites exaggerate a bit about all the fun they're having... It's going to create inferiority complexes.  It's gonna create, in some people's minds, misery and unhappiness.  They read about all the fun their friends are having. They read about all the fun people their age are having, and they look at their own lives and they're dull and boring by comparison. When, in fact, they're reading a bunch of people talking about things that really aren't happening. Everybody's simply fantasising, or a lot of people are.  So I don't know if that's the case here, but I'll bet you it's a part of it.\" </p><p>In the segment, headlined 'The Left Takes Another Human Tragedy and Converts It Into a Political Issue', he also argued that calls for gun control in the wake of the killings were unnecessary: \"There is no gun control law being currently proposed that would have stopped this shooting spree.\"</p>","headline":"Rush Limbaugh pins blame on Hunger Games for Elliot Rodger killings","trailText":"<p>The rightwing commentator suggested the violence in The Hunger Games, which Rodger's father worked on, could have inspired the killing spree</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/8/5/1375712165718/Rush-Limbaugh-003.jpg","wordcount":"374","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-01T07:22:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/rush-limbaugh-blame-hunger-games-elliot-rodger","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/may/29/rush-limbaugh-blame-hunger-games-elliot-rodger","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"media/rush-limbaugh","webTitle":"Rush Limbaugh","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rush-limbaugh","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/rush-limbaugh","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-hunger-games","webTitle":"The Hunger Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-hunger-games","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","webTitle":"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-crime","webTitle":"Gun crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-crime","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","webTitle":"US gun control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.

He rarely sells his original drawings, so they're all here: work for children's books next to brutal cartoons of <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Small%20Warts%20and%20All%20-%20Nixon_edited-1.jpg\" title=\"\">Richard Nixon</a>, court sketches from the trial of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/feb/02/archive-free-patty-hearst\" title=\"\">Patty Hearst</a>, and the legendary grotesques from his collaborations with the <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Vintage%20Dr.%20GONZO.jpg\" title=\"\">gonzo journalist</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/news/page/0,8097,1419505,00.html\" title=\"\">Hunter S Thompson</a>. And there's the portrait of Thompson that Steadman arranged for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/01/william-burroughs-junky-will-self\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a> to shoot at.</p><p>\"He was old and his hands were quite unsteady,\" Steadman remembers with a smile. \"I pointed at three places on the drawing I wanted him to shoot at. He fired six times and missed all of them. I said, \"You seem to have missed, William.\" And he said\" – his voice drops into an impressive approximation of Burroughs's parched drawl – \"'Well, he's dead, ain't he?'\"</p><p>Director <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IpAPXQxh5M\" title=\"\">Charlie Paul</a>, who spent a staggering 12 years making a feature-length documentary about Steadman called <a href=\"http://www.fornogoodreasonmovie.com\" title=\"\">For No Good Reason</a> and still shows no sign of tiring of his company, flits about, taking photographs and fetching various new drawings to show me. At 78, Steadman is busy with a variety of projects. On his desk sits a piece of paper bearing three large black ink splatters, part of a new book of bird drawings, a sequel to 2012's <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/extinct-boids-9781408178621/\" title=\"\">Extinct Boids</a>. His drawings almost always begin this way, he says: he throws the ink first and works out what it is later. \"I've got to turn that into parrots,\" he&nbsp;says.</p><p>He's also been working on a drawing of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener\" title=\"\">Lord Kitchener</a> looking aggressive in his underpants, \"for the British Museum or someone\", and a particularly unflattering cartoon of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/osborne-audit-what-have-we-learned\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> for the New Statesman. The latter comes as a surprise, given that Steadman announced in the mid-80s that he wasn't going to draw politicians any more, partly because he'd decided that lampooning them didn't change anything. \"Well,\" he shrugs, \"I did him because the Statesman asked me. I really don't like Osborne. I don't like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">Cameron</a>, either. They've just got these balloon faces, haven't they? A crowd of bobble-faces. They all look like babies in suits – really pathetic.\" He sighs. \"I don't know whether I do politicians or not now. I'm not sure.\" A shake of the head. \"I'm not sure what I do.\"</p><p>Watch For No Good Reason and you might find yourself raising an eyebrow at the idea that Steadman is doing <em>anything</em> at all. The film is fascinating and funny, but ends on a bleak note, with Steadman informing interviewer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\" title=\"\">Johnny Depp</a> that, after nearly 60 years, he doesn't think he wants to be an artist any more, for fear of becoming a \"visual polluter\". He sighs. \"I feel like that every day. I think, 'Oh, bloody hell, not more.' It's always in doubt. I'm getting a bit fed up with this new bird book, you know. It's not going to make a blind bit of difference, is it?\" He gestures towards his garden and, with a dark laugh, adds: \"A pigeon shat on my pool this morning. A sign from God: that's enough.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438008697'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/5/28/1401298541680/Johnny-Depp-and-Ralph-Ste-011.jpg' alt='Johnny Depp and Ralph Steadman in the documentary For No Good Reason' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Johnny Depp and Ralph Steadman in the documentary For No Good Reason.</figcaption></figure><p>It may sound gloomy, but all this is delivered with a kind of wry twinkle. Steadman is hugely convivial company, if almost impossible to interview in any accepted sense. No sooner has a question left your lips than Steadman wrenches the conversational steering wheel from you and proceeds to drive it wildly off-road. You ask about his dislike of politicians and end up discussing the landlady he rented a room from 50 years ago, via a recent TV drama, the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/acgrayling\" title=\"\">AC Grayling</a>, the Austin Sprite once driven by his former friend the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/03/gerald-scarfe-cartoonist-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">Gerald Scarfe</a>, and the story of how the two men fell out after Steadman's first wife accused Scarfe of plagiarism. Occasionally, Paul tries to coax Steadman back on track, with limited success. \"Now you realise why it took us 12 years to finish the documentary,\" he says quietly.</p><p>The only option is to go with it – hardly a chore, however tangential the conversation. Steadman has a big, shoulder-shaking laugh and a lovely voice: soft Scouse with a hint of Wales, perfect for storytelling. Most of his stories involve Thompson, best known as the author of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>. Nearly a decade after his suicide, Thompson's shadow still seems to hang heavy over Steadman, although their collaborations accounted for only a fraction of the 60 or so books he's illustrated. Apart from the gonzo work, he's published books on <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/collection-view.asp?collection_urn=114\" title=\"\">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanshop.com/images/products/freud-cover-1.jpg\" title=\"\">Sigmund Freud</a>, worked with Ted Hughes and Will Self, and illustrated editions of <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Alice%20WHITE%20RABBIT.jpg\" title=\"\">Alice in Wonderland</a> and Animal Farm.</p><p>Perhaps it's just that the stories involving Thompson are the most colourful. At one juncture, Steadman excuses himself, then reappears sporting Thompson's sunglasses, hat and cigarette holder, the better to illustrate the tale of the time he took the writer to a pub in Kent. \"He asked for whisky and the guy behind the bar served him a single measure,\" he says. \"Hunter stared at it, then looked at me and asked, 'What the hell is this? A free&nbsp;sample?'\"</p><p>In his writing, Thompson tended to present Steadman as a naive Limey being helplessly dragged along in his wake, but he was clearly an inveterate troublemaker, fascinated by the grimness beneath the American dream long before he met Thompson. He says his drawing style didn't reach its full flowering until he went to America: \"The blatant idiocy of people's behaviour there changed it.\" But by then, Steadman had already brought a new level of savagery to British political cartooning: at the end of the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/05/04/180907071/a-decadent-and-depraved-derby-with-hunter-s-thompson\" title=\"\">the Times fired him</a> on the grounds that his work was \"too seditious\".</p><p>He travelled to New York and immediately headed to the Bowery neighbourhood, to photograph and draw the most hopeless-looking vagrants he could find. While he was there, he received the call asking him to meet Thompson. \"He'd got really frustrated with working with photographers, because they wouldn't get involved in the story, they wouldn't become part of it, and that was the idea of gonzo.\" This was not, it has to be said, a concern with Steadman: \"I always thought the ideal was that my drawings would be done while a security guard had me in a headlock.\"</p><p>For all of Thompson's drugged lunacy, it was Steadman whom people really seemed to object to: \"They'd see me drawing them and take it personally, like it was an insult, like I'd gone up to them and said, 'You ugly son of a bitch.'\" And he was more than ready to take centre stage. Quite aside from the infamous incident during the 1970 America's Cup, when he unwisely helped himself to some of Thompson's hallucinogens and attempted to spray-paint \"FUCK THE POPE\" on one of the competing yachts, there was the duo's commission to cover the 1980 Honolulu marathon for Running magazine. Convinced that the best story would involve them ruining the race, they got drunk and installed themselves at the foot of Diamond Head, the final uphill stretch.</p><p>\"They call it Heartbreak Hill, because it was the part that broke them. So we stood there, these louts with drinks, jeering at them, yelling, 'Run, you lazy bastards, run! Why are you slowing down now? What's wrong with you?' And they'd get really angry and start shouting back, 'You assholes! Where's your sportsmanship?' And they'd use up the last bit of energy they had in getting angry – and start staggering and falling over. Very funny. But it was mean, really, wasn't it? I wonder if gonzo really was mean-minded. There was this mischievous germ of unpleasantness beneath everything we did.\"</p><p>He always believed that \"you can do anything in drawing, as viciously as you like\", but recently he found himself wondering if you should. He'd been watching a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/03/how-we-made-wallace-and-gromit\" title=\"\">Wallace and Gromit</a> cartoon. \"There was nothing vicious about it, and I was just laughing. Then you start thinking, after the event, why was I bothering to be vicious anyway, in drawings? Have I been unfair, you know, to be that vicious? Were human beings that bad? Isn't there a little compassion in them somewhere, in human beings?\"</p><p>The compellingly grotesque drawing&nbsp;of George Osborne suggests he decided the answer was no, I say. He gives one of his shoulder-shaking laughs. \"Well, in a way, I find there isn't. I think I might be right about most human beings.\"</p><p>• For No Good Reason is at the <a href=\"http://www.curzoncinemas.com/films/details/2233/for-no-good-reason-qa-ralph-steadman-charlie-paul--lucy-paul/\" title=\"\">Curzon Soho</a>, London W1, on 30 May (followed by a Q&amp;A with Steadman and Paul) and the <a href=\"http://billetto.co.uk/for-no-good-reason\" title=\"\">White Space</a>, London WC2, on 31 May.

Based on a graphic novel written by his wife Coco, which itself was based on her own experiences of growing up as a teenage punkette in Stockholm in the 1980s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jan/04/2\">Lukas Moodysson</a>’s  We Are the Best! is warm, exuberant and almost absurdly catchy. It's the movie equivalent of one of those summer pop songs that drifts out of shop fronts and car windows – you can’t help humming along to it and it leaves you grinning like a fool.<br></p><p>It’s 1982, and the Human League is playing in the suburbs of Stockholm. Two school friends,  Bobo (Mira Barkhammer), and Klara (Mira Grosin), decide to form a punk band when the school’s resident heavy metal group fail to put their names down on the rehearsal room roster. Admittedly, Bobo and Klara only seem to have one song, about hating PE class, called Hate the Sport (“The world is a morgue and you're watching Björn Borg”).</p><p>Also, they don’t know to how play any instruments. “Do drums have chords?” asks Bobo, bespectacled and boyish in a chunky square-patterned sweater. Klara is a little more promising, a blithe provocateur with a pixieish mohican, even if it is kept up with her brother’s help.    “Is that egg?” asks one of the school’s resident blondes, one of a pair with matching perms and lip gloss, who chew their gum in tandem. </p><p>Undeterred, Bobo and Klara seek out a third member for their group and sign up Christian, friendless Hedvig, after seeing her play classical guitar at a school talent show. “We’ll influence her away from God,” plots Klara, but in fact something like the opposite happens. Hedvig is soon introducing them to the alien concept of chords and harmony (“What the hell is that?”)  while her lilting rendition of a punk anthem has them squealing in delight.</p><p>The film repeatedly pulls off the same trick:  channelling punk’s sneer in the direction of more charitable embrace, Moodysson has fashioned a sweet, spirited misfit anthem, a spirited ode to anarchy, teen spirit and home-made haircuts. He may be the only film director in whom the legacies of Ingmar Bergman and ABBA might be said to be, if not reconciled, then put on the same page: hawk-eyed observation of his fellow humans duking it out with the equally acute desire to join them when they bum-rush the dancefloor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfPytPjV1xc\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfPytPjV1xc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>We Are the Best! trailer.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just recently, it looked like Bergman had the upper hand, with Moodysson going on a prolonged dark tear, making films on sex trafficking (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/apr/13/features.review\">Lilja 4-Ever</a>), pornography (A Hole in My Heart) and globalisation (Mammoth). We Are the Best! sees him returning to the warm-hearted vitality, and suburban mileu, of his 2000 film, Together, about life on a hippie commune in the 1970s as viewed through the eyes of its latchkey kids. You’d call it a coming-of-age film, except the ages were reversed: the adults squabbling like kids, the kids sombre and purposeful, like miniature adults.</p><p>That reversal is present in softer, refracted form, too, in We Are the Best!, which boasts its share of un-sorted out parents, negotiating their 40s by arguing about politics, getting drunk and playing spin-the-bottle. Bobo’s mother, in particular, seems to be emerging from her divorce as a newly-born 13-year-old, sobbing on the bed when her latest boyfriend breaks up with her. Bobo administers a hug, then makes dinner for herself by popping fish sticks in the toaster.</p><p><a></a>Bobo has grown in the opposite direction, you realise:  she stares at her squashed-potato face in the mirror in a manner both deeply unimpressed and mutely accepting of what she sees – the look seems to say, “What are you going to do?”  The film – shot with a handheld camera, and ragged editing rhythms to match – feels uncannily true to the episodic, pell-mell rhythms of adolescence.</p><p>There are no worked-up epiphanies, or exaggerated conflicts demanding resolution.  Moodysson instead has a fondness for episodic scenes   that descend into the sprightlier type of anarchy, a goal in which he is added and abetted by his young actors, particularly Grosin, a cheeky terror whose line in BS is matched only by grin with which she delivers it, as if she has long ago given up on the hope of being believed. Her eyes stretch wide with her own outrageous lies. </p><p>“My mom is dead and my dad is drunk and I haven’t been fed in weeks,” Klara tells a shopper in the local mall where they go panhandling for money to buy an electric guitar. They get some money but blow it on sweets, which only makes you wonder how things might have turned out if Sid Vicious has spent his money on licorice.    Was punk ever this fun? The Sex Pistols had the decline of empire to sharpen their disaffection, plus the Queen, and, well, the complete lack of imagination shown by the British public towards safety pins. Klara and Bobo have between them, a divorce, a clueless boy, and an embarrassing dad or two, but a lyric advising everyone to “abort all the parents!” aside,  their disaffection comes pocket-sized and Moodysson scales his movie to match.</p><p>It’s his lightest film, no question, but the lightness feels right –it flies along like an old 45, a spider-whorl of pink graffiti, a sugar rush. If Charles Schulz – another Scandinavian, albeit by way of Minnesota – had ever penned a Peanuts strip about punk rock, it might have looked and felt a little like this. Exclamation points seem entirely apropos: it’s the best!</p><p>• We Are the Best is released in the US on 30 May.</p>","headline":"We Are the Best! review: 'A spirited ode to anarchy and home haircuts'","trailText":"<b>Tom Shone:</b> This warm, exuberant movie sees director Lukas Moodysson leaving his recent dark streak behind in favour of a joyful tale of 80s punk rock in the suburbs of  Stockholm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/27/1401225013351/f92ba31d-5467-4c0a-9c7d-cf0ed4be32c1-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"949","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Tom Shone","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-05-31T15:30:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/we-are-the-best-film-review-spirited-anarchy","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/may/28/we-are-the-best-film-review-spirited-anarchy","tags":[{"id":"film/we-are-the-best","webTitle":"We Are The Best!","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/we-are-the-best","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/we-are-the-best","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","references":[]},{"id":"film/world-cinema","webTitle":"World cinema","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/world-cinema","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/world-cinema","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-shone","webTitle":"Tom Shone","r2ContributorId":"42997","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/18/1337359925067/Tom-Shone-003.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Shone is the author of Blockbuster: How Hollywood Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Summer (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004) and In The Rooms (Thomas Dunne, 2011).

mix of malevolent, magnificent, beneficent and maybe Millicent, the flapper played by Julie Andrews in Thoroughly Modern Millie. This is another in that emerging post-Wicked genre, the revisionist-backstory fairytale. Angelina Jolie is the wicked witch (she turns out to be named Maleficent) in Sleeping Beauty, who puts a terrible spell on the infant princess, the one about pricking her finger on a spinning wheel. But how did that witch get to be so wicked? Did she start out wicked? Was she, in point of fairytale fact, quite as wicked as all that? This new story explains that maybe if she hadn't had her heart broken by a certain royal someone back in the day, she wouldn't be so mean. </p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-438000716\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent/140528Maleficent.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/28/140528Maleficent.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p> Jolie's face has been digitally tweaked to bring out its edges and planes and her cheekbones are razor sharp. Maleficent has horns (not necessarily evil ones), a dark head-dress that may or may not be physically part of her head, and a sharp, bony ring that makes it look, from a&nbsp;distance, as if she is always smoking a&nbsp;fag. Elle Fanning plays the sweet-natured princess, who is entirely upstaged by Jolie. Her performance has a vinegary touch of panto, something to compare with her role as Alexander the Great's mum in Oliver Stone's Alexander (2004) and Grendel's mum in Robert Zemeckis's Beowulf (2007). I'd forgotten what a fierce screen presence Jolie is: she&nbsp;is&nbsp;becoming the Sophia Loren of&nbsp;our age. Now I want to&nbsp;see her in a&nbsp;grownup film.</p>","headline":"Maleficent review – Angelina Jolie adds vinegar to salty Sleeping Beauty spin-off","trailText":"<p>Jolie grows horns, goes panto and

Discounting previews from the tallies, Days of Future Past's Friday-to-Sunday takings of £7.55m compares even more favourably with the equivalent number for Amazing Spidey 2: £6.13m.</p><p>The success of the film so far is in contrast to the numbers for spin-off films <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men-origins-wolverine\" title=\"\">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wolverine\" title=\"\">The Wolverine</a>, which achieved a respective £16.38m and £13.70m over their lifetimes, and 2011's cast refresh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men-first-class\" title=\"\">X-Men: First Class</a>, which clawed its way to £15.02m. Adding in the 26 May bank holiday takings, Days of Future Past is already at £11.6m (after five days of play), and is clearly going to sail past the lifetime totals of all those recent X-Men films.</p><p>Days of Future Past has in fact posted the top opening number of any X-Men film, ahead of previous best debutant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men-the-last-stand\" title=\"\">X-Men: The Last Stand</a> (£7.09m, including £1.03m in previews). In terms of final tallies, X-Men 2 currently is the franchise victor, with £20.70m. The latest instalment should easily overtake that number.</p><p>Pointing to reasons for success, it's hard to decide between the return of director Bryan Singer and the excitement generated by combining the two X-Men casts. Marvel certainly discovered that more can be more when it combined Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk in Avengers Assemble, achieving box-office far ahead of anything seen from those individual characters.</p><p>The X-Men have always been mid-level commercial performers in the UK – all the films so far have been convincingly beaten here by all of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies as well as reboot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/09/amazing-spiderman-2-review\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> – so 20th Century Fox does seem to have finally made a breakthrough with the latest film. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has achieved £23.64m so far, and Fox will be hoping to push Days of Future Past to similar levels.</p><p>Given the result, it's no surprise to hear that Fox plans to include original cast members in next instalment X-Men: Apocalypse, due in 2016, and it will take screenwriter ingenuity to keep the twin timelines credibly bubbling along.</p><h2>The runner-up</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430783625\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/26/140226Godzilla-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/26/140226Godzilla_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/26//140226Godzilla.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/26/140226Godzilla_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/26/140226Godzilla/140226Godzilla.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>Falling 47% to second place, Gareth Edwards' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/godzilla-review-gareth-edwards-reboot-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Godzilla</a> has now stomped its way to a muscular £11.83m after 11 days of play, and £12.7m including bank holiday Monday. Roland Emmerich's 1998 version reached just shy of £16m over the course of its lifetime, a figure the new film will match fairly soon. Adjusting for ticket-price inflation, it's a different story.</p><p>Godzilla was always going to be vulnerable to X-Men on its second weekend – the films appeal to similar audiences – and backers Warner Bros will be hoping that the film can now stabilise. The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is arguably the other current title most vulnerable to Wolverine and friends, fell 43%, a similar drop to Godzilla. Most other films posted much stronger holds, and cooling temperatures (compared to blazing hot skies the previous weekend) were presumably a factor.</p><h2>The disappointments</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-437974616'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/28/1401275369981/Postman-Pat-film--009.jpg' alt='Postman Pat film ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/25/postman-pat-review-shiny-scary\" title=\"\">Postman Pat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/25/blended-review-sandler-putrid\" title=\"\">Blended</a>, released respectively on 502 and 388 screens, both underwhelmed at the box office. The TV cartoon spin-off managed £775,000, while the Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore comedy delivered £689,000.</p><p>Given that most schools are now on holiday for half-term, Postman Pat should recover this week, and indeed bank holiday takings were strong, pushing it up to £1.09m after four days.</p><p>Blended posted the lowest debut ever for a Sandler-Barrymore comedy. The Wedding Singer kicked off with £1.03m back in 1998, and 50 First Dates began with £1.65m six years later. Outside of the Grown-Ups franchise, Sandler has had a tough time wooing UK audiences lately – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146343/that-s-my-boy\" title=\"\">That's My Boy</a> stumbled out of the gate in September 2012 with just £255,000 from 289 cinemas.</p><h2>Family films bounce back</h2><p>The start of the half-term holiday saw family films resurgent, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/03/rio-2-review\" title=\"\">Rio 2</a> surging a handy 69% and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/lego-movie-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">The Lego Movie</a> back in the top 10 in its 15th week of release. Rio 2 has now cracked £14m, including bank holiday takings, as against £13.56m in its lifetime for the original Rio. Rio 2 opened with a relatively mild £2.18m (plus previews), but sustained play has seen it achieve a strong multiple (x 6.4) of that debut.</p><p>With £33.51m so far, The Lego Movie is the biggest grossing film of the year, ahead of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (£23.64m) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wolf-of-wall-street\" title=\"\">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>.</p><h2>The arthouse market</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-435675142\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/04/30/140429TwoFaces-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/04/30/140429TwoFaces_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/04/30/140429TwoFaces/140429TwoFaces.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/04/30/140429TwoFaces_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/04/30//140429TwoFaces.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p>With cinemas dominated by action, comedy and family, Patricia Highsmith adaptation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/the-two-faces-of-january-review-handsomely-mounted\" title=\"\">The Two Faces of January</a> is the sole film in the top 10 offering an alternative. The film's opening the previous weekend (£320,000 from 224 screens, plus £9,000 in previews) might well be termed a disappointment, but a sensational hold at the weekend – box-office down just 5% – signals an improvement in fortunes. Given that the period crime picture lost 13% of its venues, the small drop in takings is all the more impressive, and its screen average actually went up. The film has taken a decent £907,000 after 10 days of play, and may well sustain a long run on a more limited number of screens.</p><h2>Admissions update</h2><p>Admissions figures – number of tickets sold – are in for April, and they are 7% ahead of April 2013. However, admissions overall this year are still trailing 2013 levels: the first four months are 2% down on a year ago. Each weekend in May has seen box-office down on the equivalent period from 2013, so May is also likely to show an admissions shortfall versus a year ago. Then in June there is the World Cup, so cinemas will have a lot of catching up to do in the second half of this year.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Despite those hefty X-Men numbers, overall the market is still 6% behind the equivalent frame from 2013, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/23/hangover-part-3-review\" title=\"\">The Hangover Part III</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/16/fast-and-furious-6-review\" title=\"\">Fast &amp; Furious 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155263/epic\" title=\"\">Epic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/14/great-gatsby-review-cannes\" title=\"\">The Great Gatsby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/star-trek-into-darkness\" title=\"\">Star Trek Into Darkness</a> all delivered solid returns. Next? World Cup football is on its way, and the release calendar looks alarmingly thin from mid-June, but before then several major contenders are hoping to grab an audience. This week sees the arrival of Disney's long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/maleficent\" title=\"\">Maleficent</a>, starring Angelina Jolie and based on the Sleeping Beauty fairytale. Seth Macfarlane aims to prove that Ted was no fluke with comedy western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/million-ways-to-die-in-the-west\" title=\"\">A Million Ways to Die in the West</a>. And Tom Cruise looks set to deliver another in his long line of hits with the well-regarded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-edge-of-tomorrow\" title=\"\">Edge of Tomorrow</a>, from Doug Liman. The three films skew in different directions, so theoretically the market can expand to accommodate them all.</p><h2>Top 10 films May 23-25</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/25/x-men-days-future-past-review\" title=\"\">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a>, £9,144,971 from 537 sites</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/11/godzilla-bryan-cranston-gareth-edwards-first-look-review\" title=\"\">Godzilla</a>, £2,731,355 from 546 sites.

nomination for her work on the 2002 film, will reprise her role as a first-generation Greek-American who falls in love with a non-Greek. John Corbett is back as the man who married her last time around, but the sequel is expected to centre on a new wedding.</p><p></p><p>Vardalos, who based My Big Fat Greek Wedding on her autobiographical one-woman stage show, has also written the script for part two. No director has yet been signed for the project.</p><p></p><p>\"Now that I'm experiencing motherhood, I'm ready to write the next chapter of my family story,\" said Vardalos, 51. \"Of course a few jaded folks in the press corps will claim I ran out of money or just want to kiss John Corbett again. One of these things is true.\"</p><p></p><p>The plot for the new film unveils a family secret and a second wedding which brings Fotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos's Greek clan back together again. My Big Fat Greek Wedding took $369m (£220m) worldwide 12 years ago and is also one of the highest-grossing independent movies of all time.</p><p></p><p>Vardalos has had mixed success since 2002. A US TV adaptation of her film, My Big Fat Greek Life, was cancelled after just seven episodes in 2003. She made her directing debut on the independent 2009 romcom I Hate Valentine's Day, which performed poorly at the box office despite reuniting her with Corbett on screen, and co-wrote the 2011 Tom Hanks romcom Larry Crowne, which picked up decent receipts but similarly disappointing reviews to I Hate Valentine's Day.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgiFy52mrDY\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile?

linking Elliot Rodger's killing spree to a Hollywood culture of \"frat-boy fantasies\".</p><p>She originally said that many men might feel \"unjustly shut out of college life\" after watching films like the Seth Rogen-starring Bad Neighbours, and that Hollywood's \"escapist fantasies so often revolve around vigilantism and sexual wish-fulfillment... no one should be surprised when those impulses take luridly literal form in the culture at large.\"</p><p>Rogen tweeted at Hornday that he found her column \"horribly insulting and misinformed,\" while director Judd Apatow wrote: \"She uses tragedy to promote herself with idiotic thoughts.\"</p><p>Now Hornaday has posted <a href=\"http://wapo.st/1pfOxdY\">a video</a> in which she explains her column further. \"In singling out Neighbors and Judd Apatow, I by no means meant to cast blame on those movies or Judd Apatow's work for this heinous action — obviously not,\" she said. \"The whole reason that I weighed in on this issue was that [Rodger] had created this video on YouTube that seemed to be such a product of the entertainment industry that he did grow up in, literally and also just as a member of the culture.\" Rodger, the son of a film director, posted videos to YouTube ahead of his killings that outlined his frustrations and intent, which Hornaday then links to a broader filmmaking culture in Hollywood.</p><p>\"And it seemed that his self-pitying complaints, a lot of them had a lot to do with the sense of entitlement that he had to a life that he had seen reflected around him, and I wanted to sort of tease out how the movies we watch that are primarily created by men and primarily pivot around fantasies of male wish-fulfillment and vigilante justice, how that might inform not just someone suffering under a terrible mental illness but the culture at large in terms of conditioning our own expectations of what we think life is and what we feel like we deserve from it.</p><p>\"I was looking at the video as a lens through which to examine questions about sexism, insecurity and entitlement, how they've threaded their way through an entertainment culture historically dominated by men and how they've shaped our own expectations as individuals and a culture.\" Hornaday also posted <a

selection of the responses that readers had emailed her.</p><p>Since getting caught up in the debate, Apatow added <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddApatow\">further tweets</a>, saying: \"[Hornaday] can criticize but can't handle criticism?  That is as logical as her opinions... Remember everyone - ads next to articles generate money.

He rarely sells his original drawings, so they're all here: work for children's books next to brutal cartoons of <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Small%20Warts%20and%20All%20-%20Nixon_edited-1.jpg\" title=\"\">Richard Nixon</a>, court sketches from the trial of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/feb/02/archive-free-patty-hearst\" title=\"\">Patty Hearst</a>, and the legendary grotesques from his collaborations with the <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Vintage%20Dr.%20GONZO.jpg\" title=\"\">gonzo journalist</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/news/page/0,8097,1419505,00.html\" title=\"\">Hunter S Thompson</a>. And there's the portrait of Thompson that Steadman arranged for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/01/william-burroughs-junky-will-self\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a> to shoot at.</p><p>\"He was old and his hands were quite unsteady,\" Steadman remembers with a smile. \"I pointed at three places on the drawing I wanted him to shoot at. He fired six times and missed all of them. I said, \"You seem to have missed, William.\" And he said\" – his voice drops into an impressive approximation of Burroughs's parched drawl – \"'Well, he's dead, ain't he?'\"</p><p>Director <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IpAPXQxh5M\" title=\"\">Charlie Paul</a>, who spent a staggering 12 years making a feature-length documentary about Steadman called <a href=\"http://www.fornogoodreasonmovie.com\" title=\"\">For No Good Reason</a> and still shows no sign of tiring of his company, flits about, taking photographs and fetching various new drawings to show me. At 78, Steadman is busy with a variety of projects. On his desk sits a piece of paper bearing three large black ink splatters, part of a new book of bird drawings, a sequel to 2012's <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/extinct-boids-9781408178621/\" title=\"\">Extinct Boids</a>. His drawings almost always begin this way, he says: he throws the ink first and works out what it is later. \"I've got to turn that into parrots,\" he&nbsp;says.</p><p>He's also been working on a drawing of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener\" title=\"\">Lord Kitchener</a> looking aggressive in his underpants, \"for the British Museum or someone\", and a particularly unflattering cartoon of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/osborne-audit-what-have-we-learned\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> for the New Statesman. The latter comes as a surprise, given that Steadman announced in the mid-80s that he wasn't going to draw politicians any more, partly because he'd decided that lampooning them didn't change anything. \"Well,\" he shrugs, \"I did him because the Statesman asked me. I really don't like Osborne. I don't like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">Cameron</a>, either. They've just got these balloon faces, haven't they? A crowd of bobble-faces. They all look like babies in suits – really pathetic.\" He sighs. \"I don't know whether I do politicians or not now. I'm not sure.\" A shake of the head. \"I'm not sure what I do.\"</p><p>Watch For No Good Reason and you might find yourself raising an eyebrow at the idea that Steadman is doing <em>anything</em> at all. The film is fascinating and funny, but ends on a bleak note, with Steadman informing interviewer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\" title=\"\">Johnny Depp</a> that, after nearly 60 years, he doesn't think he wants to be an artist any more, for fear of becoming a \"visual polluter\". He sighs. \"I feel like that every day. I think, 'Oh, bloody hell, not more.' It's always in doubt. I'm getting a bit fed up with this new bird book, you know. It's not going to make a blind bit of difference, is it?\" He gestures towards his garden and, with a dark laugh, adds: \"A pigeon shat on my pool this morning. A sign from God: that's enough.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-438008697'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/5/28/1401298541680/Johnny-Depp-and-Ralph-Ste-011.jpg' alt='Johnny Depp and Ralph Steadman in the documentary For No Good Reason' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Johnny Depp and Ralph Steadman in the documentary For No Good Reason.</figcaption></figure><p>It may sound gloomy, but all this is delivered with a kind of wry twinkle. Steadman is hugely convivial company, if almost impossible to interview in any accepted sense. No sooner has a question left your lips than Steadman wrenches the conversational steering wheel from you and proceeds to drive it wildly off-road. You ask about his dislike of politicians and end up discussing the landlady he rented a room from 50 years ago, via a recent TV drama, the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/acgrayling\" title=\"\">AC Grayling</a>, the Austin Sprite once driven by his former friend the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/03/gerald-scarfe-cartoonist-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">Gerald Scarfe</a>, and the story of how the two men fell out after Steadman's first wife accused Scarfe of plagiarism. Occasionally, Paul tries to coax Steadman back on track, with limited success. \"Now you realise why it took us 12 years to finish the documentary,\" he says quietly.</p><p>The only option is to go with it – hardly a chore, however tangential the conversation. Steadman has a big, shoulder-shaking laugh and a lovely voice: soft Scouse with a hint of Wales, perfect for storytelling. Most of his stories involve Thompson, best known as the author of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>. Nearly a decade after his suicide, Thompson's shadow still seems to hang heavy over Steadman, although their collaborations accounted for only a fraction of the 60 or so books he's illustrated. Apart from the gonzo work, he's published books on <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/collection-view.asp?collection_urn=114\" title=\"\">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanshop.com/images/products/freud-cover-1.jpg\" title=\"\">Sigmund Freud</a>, worked with Ted Hughes and Will Self, and illustrated editions of <a href=\"http://www.ralphsteadmanartcollection.com/images/collections/Alice%20WHITE%20RABBIT.jpg\" title=\"\">Alice in Wonderland</a> and Animal Farm.</p><p>Perhaps it's just that the stories involving Thompson are the most colourful. At one juncture, Steadman excuses himself, then reappears sporting Thompson's sunglasses, hat and cigarette holder, the better to illustrate the tale of the time he took the writer to a pub in Kent. \"He asked for whisky and the guy behind the bar served him a single measure,\" he says. \"Hunter stared at it, then looked at me and asked, 'What the hell is this? A free&nbsp;sample?'\"</p><p>In his writing, Thompson tended to present Steadman as a naive Limey being helplessly dragged along in his wake, but he was clearly an inveterate troublemaker, fascinated by the grimness beneath the American dream long before he met Thompson. He says his drawing style didn't reach its full flowering until he went to America: \"The blatant idiocy of people's behaviour there changed it.\" But by then, Steadman had already brought a new level of savagery to British political cartooning: at the end of the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/05/04/180907071/a-decadent-and-depraved-derby-with-hunter-s-thompson\" title=\"\">the Times fired him</a> on the grounds that his work was \"too seditious\".</p><p>He travelled to New York and immediately headed to the Bowery neighbourhood, to photograph and draw the most hopeless-looking vagrants he could find. While he was there, he received the call asking him to meet Thompson. \"He'd got really frustrated with working with photographers, because they wouldn't get involved in the story, they wouldn't become part of it, and that was the idea of gonzo.\" This was not, it has to be said, a concern with Steadman: \"I always thought the ideal was that my drawings would be done while a security guard had me in a headlock.\"</p><p>For all of Thompson's drugged lunacy, it was Steadman whom people really seemed to object to: \"They'd see me drawing them and take it personally, like it was an insult, like I'd gone up to them and said, 'You ugly son of a bitch.'\" And he was more than ready to take centre stage. Quite aside from the infamous incident during the 1970 America's Cup, when he unwisely helped himself to some of Thompson's hallucinogens and attempted to spray-paint \"FUCK THE POPE\" on one of the competing yachts, there was the duo's commission to cover the 1980 Honolulu marathon for Running magazine. Convinced that the best story would involve them ruining the race, they got drunk and installed themselves at the foot of Diamond Head, the final uphill stretch.</p><p>\"They call it Heartbreak Hill, because it was the part that broke them. So we stood there, these louts with drinks, jeering at them, yelling, 'Run, you lazy bastards, run! Why are you slowing down now? What's wrong with you?' And they'd get really angry and start shouting back, 'You assholes! Where's your sportsmanship?' And they'd use up the last bit of energy they had in getting angry – and start staggering and falling over. Very funny. But it was mean, really, wasn't it? I wonder if gonzo really was mean-minded. There was this mischievous germ of unpleasantness beneath everything we did.\"</p><p>He always believed that \"you can do anything in drawing, as viciously as you like\", but recently he found himself wondering if you should. He'd been watching a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/03/how-we-made-wallace-and-gromit\" title=\"\">Wallace and Gromit</a> cartoon. \"There was nothing vicious about it, and I was just laughing. Then you start thinking, after the event, why was I bothering to be vicious anyway, in drawings? Have I been unfair, you know, to be that vicious? Were human beings that bad?

This is what this guy's dad did. It's teenagers killing other teenagers. It's a survivalist game … They're being forced to, but they're still doing it … This kid might say he was forced to [kill] by societal pressure.\"</p><p>He's not the first to suggest that Hollywood had a hand to play in influencing Rodger. The Washington Post's film critic Ann Hornaday suggested that \"frat-boy fantasies\" like Bad Neighbours caused frustration to those, like Rodger, whose lives didn't match up, and that a culture of \"violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger\" on screen could have catalysed Rodger's acts. Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow, who the article alluded to, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/27/seth-rogen-ann-hornaday-elliot-rodger-judd-apatow\">reacted angrily</a> on Twitter, prompting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/ann-hornaday-responds-seth-rogen-judd-apatow-elliot-rodger\">a rebuttal from Hornaday</a>.</p><p>Limbaugh also suggested that social media was partly to blame. \"Half the people or more on these social media sites exaggerate a bit about all the fun they're having... It's going to create inferiority complexes.  It's gonna create, in some people's minds, misery and unhappiness.  They read about all the fun their friends are having. They read about all the fun people their age are having, and they look at their own lives and they're dull and boring by comparison. When, in fact, they're reading a bunch of people talking about things that really aren't happening. Everybody's simply fantasising, or a lot of people are.  So I don't know if that's the case here, but I'll bet you it's a part of it.\" </p><p>In the segment, headlined 'The Left Takes Another Human Tragedy and Converts It Into a Political Issue', he also argued that calls for gun control in the wake of the killings were unnecessary: \"There is no gun control law being currently proposed that would have stopped this shooting spree.\"</p>","headline":"Rush Limbaugh pins blame on Hunger Games for Elliot Rodger killings","trailText":"<p>The rightwing commentator suggested the violence in The Hunger Games, which Rodger's father worked on, could have inspired the killing spree</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/8/5/1375712165718/Rush-Limbaugh-003.jpg","wordcount":"374","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-06-01T07:22:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/rush-limbaugh-blame-hunger-games-elliot-rodger","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/may/29/rush-limbaugh-blame-hunger-games-elliot-rodger","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"media/rush-limbaugh","webTitle":"Rush Limbaugh","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rush-limbaugh","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/media/rush-limbaugh","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-hunger-games","webTitle":"The Hunger Games","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-hunger-games","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","webTitle":"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-crime","webTitle":"Gun crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-crime","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","webTitle":"US gun control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://beta.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.
