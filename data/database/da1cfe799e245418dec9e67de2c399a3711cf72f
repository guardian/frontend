        "headline":"Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all",
        "body":"<p>'The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine', and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, 'Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody'.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\" title=\"\">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a> would recognise this moment. Now it is not the land his impostors are enclosing, but the rest of the natural world. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, nature is being valued and commodified so that it can be exchanged for cash.</p><p>The effort began in earnest under the last government. At a cost of £100,000, it commissioned a research company to produce a total annual price for England's ecosystems. After taking the money, the company reported \u2013 with a certain understatement \u2013 that this exercise was \"theoretically challenging to complete, and considered by some not to be a theoretically sound endeavour\". Some of the services provided by England's ecosystems, it pointed out, \"may in fact be infinite in value\".</p><p>This rare flash of common sense did nothing to discourage the current government from seeking first to put a price on nature, then to create a market in its disposal. The UK now has a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/\" title=\"\">natural capital committee</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a> and an inspiring new lexicon. We don't call it nature any more: now the proper term is \"natural capital\". Natural processes have become \"ecosystem services\", as they exist only to serve us. Hills, forests and river catchments are now \"green infrastructure\", while biodiversity and habitats are \"asset classes\" within an \"ecosystem market\". All of them will be assigned a price, all of them will become exchangeable.</p><p>The argument in favour of this approach is coherent and plausible. Business currently treats the natural world as if it is worth nothing. Pricing nature and incorporating that price into the cost of goods and services creates an economic incentive for its protection. It certainly appeals to both business and the self-hating state. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force speaks of \"substantial potential growth in nature-related markets \u2013 in the order of billions of pounds globally\".</p><p>Commodification, economic growth, financial abstractions, corporate power: aren't these the processes driving the world's environmental crisis? Now we are told that to save the biosphere we need more of them.</p><p>Payments for ecosystem services look to me like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since Rousseau's encloser first made an exclusive claim to the land. The government has already begun describing land owners as the \"providers\" of ecosystem services, as if they had created the rain and the hills and the rivers and the wildlife that inhabits them. They are to be paid for these services, either by the government or by \"users\". It sounds like the plan for the NHS.</p><p>Land ownership since the time of the first impostor has involved the gradual accumulation of exclusive rights, which were seized from commoners. Payments for ecosystem services extend this encroachment by appointing the landlord as the owner and instigator of the wildlife, the water flow, the carbon cycle, the natural processes that were previously deemed to belong to everyone and no one.</p><p>But it doesn't end there. Once a resource has been commodified, speculators and traders step in. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force now talks of \"harnessing City financial expertise to assess the ways that these blended revenue streams and securitisations enhance the ROI [return on investment] of an environmental bond\". This gives you an idea of how far this process has gone \u2013 and of the gobbledegook it has begun to generate.</p><p>Already the government is developing the market for trading wildlife, by experimenting with what it calls biodiversity offsets. If a quarry company wants to destroy a rare meadow, for example, it can buy absolution by paying someone to create another somewhere else. The government warns that these offsets should be used only to compensate for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" and \"must not become a licence to destroy\". But once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold? Nature, under this system, will become as fungible as everything else.</p><p>Like other aspects of neoliberalism, the commodification of nature forestalls democratic choice. No longer will we be able to argue that an ecosystem or a landscape should be protected because it affords us wonder and delight; we'll be told that its intrinsic value has already been calculated and, doubtless, that it  turns out to be worth less than the other uses to which the land could be put. The market has spoken: end of debate.</p><p></p><p>All those messy, subjective matters, the motivating forces of democracy, will be resolved in a column of figures. Governments won't need to regulate; the market will make the decisions that politicians have ducked. But trade is a fickle master, and unresponsive to anyone except those with the money. The costing and sale of nature represents another transfer of power to corporations and the very rich.</p><p>It diminishes us, it diminishes nature. By turning the natural world into a subsidiary of the corporate economy, it reasserts the biblical doctrine of dominion. It slices the biosphere into component commodities: already the government's task force is talking of \"unbundling\" ecosystem services, a term borrowed from previous privatisations. This might make financial sense; it makes no ecological sense. The more we learn about the natural world, the more we discover that its functions cannot be safely disaggregated.</p><p>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value \u2013 from love to greed \u2013 we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. Pull up the stakes, fill in the ditch, we're being conned again.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394265264|2012-12-20T11:47:43Z|04e971ca19d06cf52145e44a78bc2d07e803de3d -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p>Recent calculations of the economic value of nature and ecosystem services have caused many environmentalists to react negatively. They point to the risk of a progressive \"privatisation\" and \"commodification\" of nature, and argue that society should appreciate the intrinsic values of nature \u2013 nature for its own sake. Putting a 'price on nature' will create more enclosures whereby the public benefits derived from ecosystems will be seized by corporations and other private interests.</p><p></p><p>The new discourse about \"natural capital\" is seen by some as another step towards the degradation of the biosphere. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">George Monbiot wrote is such terms this week</a>. He argued:</p><p><blockquote>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value \u2013 from love to greed \u2013 we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it.<br /></blockquote></p><p>But to paint such a one-sided picture is a dangerous game. For decades campaigners have fought for the protection of nature for its own sake, and while there has been notable progress (seen for example in the rapid increase in protected areas worldwide, which will hopefully continue irrespective of purely economic evaluations), the overall trends have not been encouraging.</p><p>The destruction of unprotected forests, loss of soils, depletion of aquifers, extinction of animals and plants and plunder of the oceans has continued apace. It seems that the moral argument has gained insufficient traction, and that in the absence of new frames continuing population and economic growth will cause more damage.</p><p>One source of hope comes from the growing realisation that nature is essential for economic development. The message is clear: without nature the economy is nothing. That penny is beginning to drop in various important places, and could soon lead to a new era of policy-making. One in which ecology and economics go hand in hand, but only if we have the tools to build bridges between these worlds that are so alien to each other. And that is where the economic valuation of nature can come in.</p><p>By appreciating that nature is vital for economics, and has measurable tangible financial values, it is possible to get the attention of people who have at best hitherto regarded nature a supplier of resources, or worse still an economically costly distraction that gets in the way of economic 'growth'. Making the moral case in the face of such beliefs won't work. If, on the other hand, such scepticism can be met with economically compelling logic, then we might get a bit further.</p><p>There are of course ecological values (like beauty and the very fact that things exist) that sometimes cannot be assigned financial values, and should be protected by the law, policy and public backing rather than through markets.</p><p>There are certainly dangers that come with financial values being attached to natural systems. These might be seen in how countries choose to reflect the value of ecosystems (like forests) that indigenous people rely on and have ancestral rights over (or should do). Those dangers need to be managed with regulations and other safeguards when, for example, those same forests are deemed as financially valuable in supplying a distant city with water, and when managing that water affect the rights of the people in the forest. There are risks but just outcomes can be secured.</p><p>While I am alarmed at how some environmentalists reject the economic valuation of nature, I am more alarmed still at how such a position can appear similar to those with deeply sceptical views about whether we should protect the environment in the first place. Nigel Lawson, the arch climate change denier, is like many environmentalists dead against putting financial values on nature. He knows well that if this happens then economics would have to change in fundamental ways requiring new government policies, changes to how capital is invested and shifts in consumption patterns. By campaigning against the valuation of ecosystem services, some campaigners could inadvertently strengthen the hand of those who believe nature has little or no value, moral, economic or otherwise.</p><p>And it seems to me there is not a choice here. I have spent the past 25 years campaigning for nature for its own sake, because it is beautiful, because it should exist for its own reasons and because we have no right to destroy it. I have found that not everyone agrees with that though, and while I am trying to convince them, more forests are cleared, oceans polluted and greenhouse gases released.</p><p>We could carry on like this, with ideological purity preserved (on all sides), or we could open a new discourse, one that requires the sceptics to meaningfully engage, and on the field where future environmental battles will be won and lost \u2013 the field of economics. After all, it is not most environmentalists who have misunderstood the realities that come with 'growth' a finite Earth, but most economists.</p><p></p><p>\u2022 Tony Juniper's book on the value of ecosystems for economies, What has Nature ever done for us? will be published in January</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394510045|2012-12-20T11:47:43Z|e6c4f489dac192803d5a87efd80027437cbde357 -->",

        "headline":"Putting a price on the rivers and rain diminishes us all",
        "body":"<p>'The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine', and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, 'Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody'.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau\" title=\"\">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a> would recognise this moment. Now it is not the land his impostors are enclosing, but the rest of the natural world. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, nature is being valued and commodified so that it can be exchanged for cash.</p><p>The effort began in earnest under the last government. At a cost of £100,000, it commissioned a research company to produce a total annual price for England's ecosystems. After taking the money, the company reported \u2013 with a certain understatement \u2013 that this exercise was \"theoretically challenging to complete, and considered by some not to be a theoretically sound endeavour\". Some of the services provided by England's ecosystems, it pointed out, \"may in fact be infinite in value\".</p><p>This rare flash of common sense did nothing to discourage the current government from seeking first to put a price on nature, then to create a market in its disposal. The UK now has a <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/\" title=\"\">natural capital committee</a>, an <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/\" title=\"\">Ecosystem Markets Task Force</a> and an inspiring new lexicon. We don't call it nature any more: now the proper term is \"natural capital\". Natural processes have become \"ecosystem services\", as they exist only to serve us. Hills, forests and river catchments are now \"green infrastructure\", while biodiversity and habitats are \"asset classes\" within an \"ecosystem market\". All of them will be assigned a price, all of them will become exchangeable.</p><p>The argument in favour of this approach is coherent and plausible. Business currently treats the natural world as if it is worth nothing. Pricing nature and incorporating that price into the cost of goods and services creates an economic incentive for its protection. It certainly appeals to both business and the self-hating state. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force speaks of \"substantial potential growth in nature-related markets \u2013 in the order of billions of pounds globally\".</p><p>Commodification, economic growth, financial abstractions, corporate power: aren't these the processes driving the world's environmental crisis? Now we are told that to save the biosphere we need more of them.</p><p>Payments for ecosystem services look to me like the prelude to the greatest privatisation since Rousseau's encloser first made an exclusive claim to the land. The government has already begun describing land owners as the \"providers\" of ecosystem services, as if they had created the rain and the hills and the rivers and the wildlife that inhabits them. They are to be paid for these services, either by the government or by \"users\". It sounds like the plan for the NHS.</p><p>Land ownership since the time of the first impostor has involved the gradual accumulation of exclusive rights, which were seized from commoners. Payments for ecosystem services extend this encroachment by appointing the landlord as the owner and instigator of the wildlife, the water flow, the carbon cycle, the natural processes that were previously deemed to belong to everyone and no one.</p><p>But it doesn't end there. Once a resource has been commodified, speculators and traders step in. The Ecosystem Markets Task Force now talks of \"harnessing City financial expertise to assess the ways that these blended revenue streams and securitisations enhance the ROI [return on investment] of an environmental bond\". This gives you an idea of how far this process has gone \u2013 and of the gobbledegook it has begun to generate.</p><p>Already the government is developing the market for trading wildlife, by experimenting with what it calls biodiversity offsets. If a quarry company wants to destroy a rare meadow, for example, it can buy absolution by paying someone to create another somewhere else. The government warns that these offsets should be used only to compensate for \"genuinely unavoidable damage\" and \"must not become a licence to destroy\". But once the principle is established and the market is functioning, for how long do you reckon that line will hold? Nature, under this system, will become as fungible as everything else.</p><p>Like other aspects of neoliberalism, the commodification of nature forestalls democratic choice. No longer will we be able to argue that an ecosystem or a landscape should be protected because it affords us wonder and delight; we'll be told that its intrinsic value has already been calculated and, doubtless, that it  turns out to be worth less than the other uses to which the land could be put. The market has spoken: end of debate.</p><p></p><p>All those messy, subjective matters, the motivating forces of democracy, will be resolved in a column of figures. Governments won't need to regulate; the market will make the decisions that politicians have ducked. But trade is a fickle master, and unresponsive to anyone except those with the money. The costing and sale of nature represents another transfer of power to corporations and the very rich.</p><p>It diminishes us, it diminishes nature. By turning the natural world into a subsidiary of the corporate economy, it reasserts the biblical doctrine of dominion. It slices the biosphere into component commodities: already the government's task force is talking of \"unbundling\" ecosystem services, a term borrowed from previous privatisations. This might make financial sense; it makes no ecological sense. The more we learn about the natural world, the more we discover that its functions cannot be safely disaggregated.</p><p>Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value \u2013 from love to greed \u2013 we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. Pull up the stakes, fill in the ditch, we're being conned again.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@GeorgeMonbiot</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394265264|2012-12-20T11:47:43Z|04e971ca19d06cf52145e44a78bc2d07e803de3d -->",
