        "headline":"Graphic footage of Boris bike cyclist's death seen by family",
        "body":"<p>The family of a French student killed by a lorry while she was riding a \"Boris bike\" broke down as graphic CCTV footage of the collision was shown to her inquest.</p><p>The parents, brother and sisters of Philippine De Gerin-Ricard, 20, watched through their fingers as the footage, taken from different cameras, showed the incident outside Aldgate East underground station that occurred as she rode home to Bromley-by-Bow, east London, on 5 July.</p><p>Coroner Mary Hassell, sitting at Poplar coroner's court, had given a \"very strong warning\" to the student's relatives and HGV driver Richard James, that the evidence would be distressing and upsetting.</p><p>Gerin-Ricard's mother, Anne Boudet du Mochet, who had travelled from  France, asked to see the images twice, before briefly leaving the court room in tears. She returned to plead action be taken to protect cyclists in the capital \"now and quickly\".</p><p>Her daughter, the first person to be killed on a Boris bike, was cycling along one of the London mayor's so-called flagship commuter cycle routes, which provide no separate path for cycling.</p><p>James, an HGV driver for about 22 years, said he was travelling at around 10-12mph in slow-moving peak traffic at around 7pm, with scaffolding from building works on one side of the road.</p><p>He told the inquest the first he knew of the collision was the sound of a \"tinkling or rattling noise which I thought was my mirrors catching the scaffolding.</p><p>\"Then I could see a young lady tumbling backwards off her bike. Then I stopped.\"</p><p>Asked if there was anything he could have done differently, he shook his head and said no.</p><p>The cyclist was rushed to the nearby Royal London hospital but died of multiple injuries.</p><p>Richard Brown, a bus driver, said it was very narrow between the lorry and scaffolding, and he did not feel there was sufficient space for Gerin-Ricard to pass. Both he and James told the coroner that high visibility clothing might help with the safety of road cyclists.</p><p>Addressing the inquest through an interpreter, Gerin-Ricard's mother said: \"The problem with cycle lanes here in London is not a new problem. Things have been asked by cyclists – if anything had been done, it has not been helpful to cyclists.</p><p>\"I have heard the clothing that cyclists wear and what Philippine should have been wearing was discussed here.</p><p>\"What needs to be discussed is the provisions of lanes for cyclists. Action needs to be taken.\"</p><p>Investigating officer PC Mike Andrews said Gerin-Ricard had been riding on the footpath before passing the scaffolding, possibly in a move to try to pass a bus. \"As Mr James conducted his pre-movement check in the mirrors, Philippine was riding on the footpath – at best she would have been on the very limit of his view.</p><p>\"With the other pedestrians at the bus stop and milling around, it would have been quite difficult for him to recognise her as a bicycle rider.\" The coroner ruled it was an \"appalling accident\" and said she would be writing to Transport for London to encourage an \"innovative response\" to the problems at the narrow and busy road junction where the  front of the lorry collided with the rear wheel of the bicycle.</p><p>She also called for improved education of cyclists.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420187762|2013-10-17T10:28:05Z|a89c34fe1a64993cb18d83bbc0d04a76b4768fac -->",
