        "trailText":"Britain's women's team pursuit squad could slash 10 seconds off their world record by 2016 Games, says head coach Shane Sutton",
        "headline":"British women pursuiters race to overtake men's teams before Rio",
        "body":"<p>If Great Britain's all-conquering women's team pursuit squad continue at their current rate of progress, their head coach, Shane Sutton, expects them to lower the world record of 4min 19.604sec for the new 4,000m distance to at least 4:10 by the time of the next Olympic Games. \"I'd say around a [4min] 7sec to 10sec,\" Sutton said. \"We had the conditions here but we've got to look at how we can be around that 10 mark.\"</p><p>To put that in perspective, in Manchester on Friday only 10 of the 17 teams in the men's team pursuit tournament beat the 4min 8sec mark. To take the same point in the last Olympic cycle as a reference, between November 2009 and August 2012 the Great Britain women improved their time over 3,000m by 9sec.</p><p>The performance director, Sir Dave Brailsford, said that the recent increase in distance at the women's team pursuit from 3,000m was \"the dream scenario\" because of the size of the British women's endurance squad and the pressure for places. \"It has killed off some nations – they just don't have the depth. We were very happy with the change. We have that squad. You need, in any event, to be looking over your shoulder, making sure your position is safe. You can't coach that, that upward pressure.\"</p><p>Brailsford hailed the women's endurance riders' performance in Manchester, where Laura Trott, Dani King, Jo Rowsell and Elinor Barker took the pursuit, dropping the world record to below 4min 20sec, with Trott adding the omnium gold, Rowsell winning the individual pursuit and Katie Archibald – riding for Scotland but very much a part of the squad – adding silver in the scratch race and bronze in the pursuit to make their medal haul five from five events, almost half the entire team's total of 11 medals.</p><p>\"The women's endurance group have been fantastic, they're the star act in many respects for the last four years … world record after world record after world record,\" Brailsford said. \"The performance here was so far ahead of the other teams and they've maintained that performance and desire for so many years. It is impressive; it's fantastic to see. But they can get better, that's for sure.\"</p><p>Sutton said that Great Britain have nine riders available to them in this area, with the addition of the four juniors who won their world championship this summer. \"Any combination of that nine can be on the podium and be gold medallists in Rio. If you look at the way those [junior] girls rode that world championship, [it was a] smooth ride, equivalent to anything the top team has done.</p><p>\"Women's endurance is filled with bundles of talent at the moment, we're quite blessed.\"</p><p>Brailsford and Sutton imagine that Archibald, too, has massive potential for improvement. \"That goes to the point we've always tried to make here, that the door's always open,\" Sutton said. \"We dropped an Olympic champion to give her a ride in the [European championship] qualifying round then dropped another Olympic champion to give her a ride in the final. And she broke the world record. She's come up here and took her chance in the scratch race, and rode really well. She looks a completely different bike rider.\"</p><p>Brailsford added that because of the youth of his squad – the oldest rider, Ed Clancy, is 28 – compared with the same point in the past two Olympic cycles, there will be an intense focus on the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow next summer, as the July-August date will offer a unique opportunity to rehearse the timetabling that is demanded by an Olympic Games.</p><p>\"For Glasgow it makes absolute sense for the age and experience of this group to go there and take it very seriously. The periodisation, the training through into a summer goal is something that happens every two years.</p><p>\"Everyone's training's geared around being at the best for the worlds, which is February-March time. We can use this as great experience for the youngsters to experience what it's like to try to hit a peak in the middle summer, rather than March.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647699|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|f2c639209d9c45c9cb4f10378f671b9b5a1140f0 -->",

        "headline":"Laura Trott digs deep to claim omnium gold in cycling's track World Cup",
        "body":"<p>This opening round of the winter World Cup has been dominated by the British women, who have between them accounted for eight of the team's 11 medals. The bulk of those prizes have come in the endurance events where Laura Trott's gold medal in the omnium  added to the gold won in the individual pursuit by her team-mate Joanna Rowsell and the team pursuit gold the pair had shared with Elinor Barker and Dani King on Friday night.</p><p>Trott had had a low-key opening day in the six-event discipline on Saturday, managing sixth in the flying lap, seventh in the points race and a surprising second in the elimination, her personal party piece where her dominance is taken as a given. But a runner-up position in the individual pursuit on Sunday morning pushed her into the bronze medal position, and the gold was gained in courageous style with a dramatic win in the scratch race, by no means her strongest discipline.</p><p>The Olympic champion attacked early in the 40-lap event, gambling on using her time-trialling ability to gain a lap on the field, and hoping that the rest of the riders would let her get on with it. It fell to the event leader, the Canadian Gillian Carleton, to chase, but she was unable to close down Trott.</p><p>Trott was assured victory if she crossed the line ahead of the Pole Malgorzata Wojtyra, who had also lapped the field, and her finishing speed meant that was never in doubt. With that in the bag, she had only the 500m time trial to negotiate, and another victory there, with Carleton in third, sealed the deal.</p><p>\"I'm normally terrible at [the scratch] but I went into it six points down, I thought this is my chance and I'd take it. When you're a kid you race like that, think 'sod it' and go, but I was never going to win the omnium by sitting back. I didn't go full gas, my coach said floor it and I had no choice. It took me nine laps, and the crowd were massive.\"</p><p>With the help of the women's new  endurance coach, Chris Newton, Trott is planning to work on her past weakness, the points and scratch races. \"There's a lot of room to improve, some work to be done.\"</p><p>British cycling's breakout star of 2013, Becky James, has not looked at her searing best over the weekend, but salvaged her third medal in three events with silver in the keirin to go with her bronze in the match sprint and the silver she and Victoria Williamson took in the team sprint. With James's boyfriend, the Wales rugby wing George North, watching from the stands, she dominated the two qualifying rounds, winning both from the front, but the final turned out to be far more tactical, with the entire field stalling on the penultimate lap.</p><p>James had looked impossibly boxed in at the bell, but showing courage as well as sheer speed she fought her way underneath Wai Sze Lee of Hong Kong, then somehow found an opening to claim silver. However, she never looked like getting on terms with the winner, Kristina Vogel of Germany, who has been imperious over the three days with a clean sweep of gold medals across the sprint disciplines.</p><p>The afternoon closed with a courageous bronze medal in the 10-km scratch race for the British omnium champion, Jon Mould, riding in Welsh colours, who was one of a five-rider group chasing the winner, Andreas Müller of Austria, but even so the disparity over the weekend between Britain's men and women was summed up by the fortunes of Trott's boyfriend, Jason Kenny.</p><p>The Olympic match and team sprint champion was unable to perform as he would have wished in the keirin final on Saturday – he described himself as \"a passenger\" – and then put in a poor qualifying round on Sunday morning for the match sprint, coming in 24th out of 41, with 16 to go through to the first round. \"The times were amazing and he didn't have the legs for it,\" was Trott's view.</p><p>The implications are not serious – yet – as regards qualifying for the world championships are not serious yet, but he will need to travel to the next World Cup in Mexico and possibly the third – rumoured to be in South Africa in January – to earn his place.</p><p>With Kenny absent, it fell to the local boy Matt Crampton to fly the flag as far as the semi-final, where he went out to Nijsane Philip of Trinidad, the eventual silver medallist behind the tree trunk-thighed German Robert Förstemann.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421569145|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|7e8a768caa942783bbf59031ffdc9cc15b6d0488 -->",

        "headline":"Joanna Rowsell takes gold for Britain at cycling's track World Cup",
        "body":"<p>With Commonwealth nations occupying all three medal positions in the women's individual pursuit at Saturday evening's session of the track World Cup, the pointers to Glasgow next July were impossible to ignore, with Joanna Rowsell taking the gold medal and the meteoric rise of Scotland's Katie Archibald continuing as the 20-year-old from Milngavie rode to a surprise bronze.</p><p>Rowsell, having qualified fastest in 3min 34.341sec ahead of Australia's Rebecca Wiasak, on the back of her part in the women's team pursuit squad's world record-breaking gold medal ride on Friday night, made a rapid start then built on her initial advantage to close the match almost 2sec ahead.</p><p>The 24-year-old from Sutton estimates that she is now back to 90% of her best form after breaking a collarbone in a crash at the women's race at the RideLondon GP in August.</p><p>\"It is better than I could have ever hoped for. I missed the world championships on the track last season to focus on my road racing – I won the national title and after that everything went wrong; it was just disaster after disaster, setback after setback. The second half of the road season was about getting fit for the track and that went completely out of the window.</p><p>\"I have done no races since I broke my collarbone so I'm just so pleased that I managed to come here and win two gold medals. I've got a lot more to come this track season. We're going to have our work cut out at the world championships. We have really set the standard here, so everyone knows what to aim for in that team pursuit so we will have our work cut out – but bring it on.\"</p><p>Archibald's dramatic transformation from virtual unknown to overnight sensation continued on Saturday with third place in qualifying for the pursuit behind Rowsell and Wiasak, and she backed that up with 3:37.093 in the bronze medal ride-off against Eugenia Bujak of Poland. In a bizarre contest, Archibald started far slower than the Pole and was almost a quarter of a lap slower after the first kilometre. After that she got into her rhythm as Bujak crumbled and finished more than 3sec behind the Scot.</p><p>This came less than 24 hours after her silver medal in Friday night's scratch race, and just two weeks since her gold medal-winning ride as part of the Great Britain team pursuit team in the European championships in Apeldoorn. This is Archibald's first full-time year of racing and it has culminated with her recent inclusion in the Great Britain academy.</p><p>This continues an intriguing trajectory that began with grass-track racing on the Highland Games circuit – which is little known outside Scotland but surprisingly lucrative and, in the distant past, produced the Olympic sprinter Craig MacLean – in 2011, thanks to the intervention of her father, a fell runner. Archibald took a gold medal in the British junior pursuit championship the following year – her first racing on a hard track – which brought her to the notice of the then British women's endurance coach, Paul Manning.</p><p>There was disappointment for Great Britain's women's world sprint champion Becky James – mitigated by the knowledge that she has been racing virtually non-stop since early September – when the Abergavenny racer went out in the semi-final to the world championship silver medallist Kristina Vogel of Germany.</p><p>That put her up against Victoria Pendleton's former rival Anna Meares of Australia in the bronze medal ride-off. James held off the Olympic champion by inches in the first ride and came late on the final banking in the second to win by half a bike. Meares may be making her return to international competition after 15 months, and was shocked by the intensity – not to mention the fact that another British rival has come along to replace Pendleton – but she is still a scalp well worth taking and she is another with her eyes on Glasgow.</p><p>There was frustration for Great Britain's other sprint star in Minsk, the world keirin champion Jason Kenny. The local hero had dominated the earlier rounds, taking straightforward victories from the front in the first and second rounds before lining up for the final. But here his decision to come late backfired and he was unable to get through the traffic on the final lap, coming in fourth, three bike-lengths behind the gold medallist, François Pervis of France. \"I was a passenger,\" said Kenny.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421535676|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|62db97c3b26976ddb51d232dfc434ba711846261 -->",

        "headline":"Joanna Rowsell takes gold for Britain at cycling's track World Cup",
        "body":"<p>With Commonwealth nations occupying all three medal positions in the women's individual pursuit at the start of Saturday evening's session at the track World Cup in Manchester, the pointers to Glasgow next July were impossible to ignore, with Joanna Rowsell taking the gold medal and with the impressive rise of Scotland's Katie Archibald continuing as the 20-year-old from Milngavie rode to a surprise bronze medal.</p><p>Having qualified fastest in 3min 34.341sec, ahead of Australia's Rebecca Wiasak, on the back of her part in the women's team pursuit squad's world record breaking gold medal ride on Friday night, Rowsell made a rapid start then built on her initial advantage to close the match almost 2sec ahead.</p><p>The 24-year-old from Sutton estimates that she is now back to \"90%\" of her best form after breaking a collarbone in a crash at the women's circuit race at the RideLondon GP in August. \"I had my tonsils out in July as well, so two setbacks in a row were a nightmare. I was planning a big block of training over the summer and all that went out the window. I am getting quicker all the time but I'm not aiming to peak until the world championships.\"</p><p>Archibald's dramatic transformation from virtual unknown to overnight sensation continued on Saturday with third place in qualifying for the pursuit behind Rowsell and Wiasak, and she backed that up with 3:37.093 in the bronze medal ride-off against Eugenia Bujak of Poland. In a bizarre contest, Archibald started far slower than the Pole and was almost a quarter of a lap slower after the first kilometre. After that she got into her rhythm as Bujak crumbled and finished more than 3sec behind the Scot.</p><p>This came less than 24 hours after her silver medal in Friday night's scratch race, and just two weeks since her gold medal winning ride as part of the Great Britain team pursuit team in the European championships in Apeldoorn. This is Archibald's first full-time year of racing, and it has culminated with her inclusion in the Great Britain academy.</p><p>This continues an intriguing trajectory that began with grass-track racing on the Highland Games circuit – which is little known outside Scotland but surprisingly lucrative and, in the distant past, produced the Olympic sprinter Craig MacLean – in 2011, thanks to the intervention of her father, a fell runner.</p><p>Archibald took a gold medal in the British junior pursuit championship the following year – her first racing on a hard track – which brought her to the notice of the then British women's endurance coach Paul Manning, who included her among a group of potential team pursuiters for monitoring. She is a distinctive figure thanks to her adoption of different hair colours – she is currently sporting pink but may switch to blue next summer – and has the potential to be one of the breakout stars of the Glasgow Games.</p><p>The women's endurance coach, Chris Newton, said: \"We had a training camp this summer, three days of team pursuit drills ending with a match against the junior squad over 3km, and she held herself really well. After that we needed a fifth rider for the Europeans and it all went from there.\"</p><p>Earlier, the world women's match sprint champion, Becky James, qualified sixth in the women's behind Victoria Pendleton's nemesis of old, Anna Meares – returning to the international stage for the first time since the London Olympics – before going through to face Kristina Vogel of Germany in the semi-finals. In the first leg she was unable to match Vogel's initial jump, while in the second she again left herself too much to do and finished more than a bike length behind.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421532197|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|af020a160a65be75410a2920600195811630f046 -->",

        "headline":"Sir Chris Hoy's absence felt as GB sprint team struggle in World Cup",
        "body":"<p>As Great Britain's track cyclists begin their second international season without Sir Chris Hoy after his retirement in April, and his absence through the winter of 2012-13, the void is obvious, and not merely because Hoy spent the weekend at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. It's not just about Hoy's six Olympic titles or the 11 world titles, or the bulky, genial, reassuring presence in the pits and the little buzz that accompanied the arrival of the great man in the velodrome at any meeting between Athens and London.</p><p>If Jason Kenny has stepped up in the match sprint and keirin, the team sprinters are going through yet another period of uncertainty. There is no particular panic, just a sense of churning emotion without Hoy's anchoring presence, be it Kenny's evident frustration at the team's inability to string together performances between Olympic Games, or his admission that the trio were on the wrong end of a hiding two weeks ago in the European championship, where they finished fourth.</p><p>\"It's definitely a big issue for us,\" sprint coach Iain Dyer said before the men's trio raced to a bronze medal on Friday night, with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton alternating in the anchor position behind Kenny in man two and the starter Philip Hindes. Even without Hoy, however, it is a little more straightforward than the situation before the London Olympics, where Jamie Staff retired from man one two years out, after which there was a scramble to replace him, with Hindes coming good at the very last minute.</p><p>\"We spent 99% of the four years between Beijing and London being criticised for our team sprint performances,\" added Dyer. \"Even in 2010, people were saying: 'It's 2005 since you last won a world title, how's it going?' We're in the same boat again. Leave it with us and we'll come back to you in 2016.\"</p><p>\"We can win [in Rio] as we did in London but replacing Sir Chris was never going to be easy,\" said the head coach, Shane Sutton. \"We are starting from a good place because we've got the engine in man one and man two [Hindes and Kenny] which led us to gold in 2012. We have two athletes in Kian and Matt who just need training up for three years. It's about finding that third rider, about whether we make changes, for example trying Matt at two with Jason running at three.\"</p><p>Sutton acknowledges that the men's sprint is the only area within Great Britain where there is little upward pressure from the junior ranks. There are four young women's sprinters currently jostling behind Becky James, the women's endurance squad stands at a healthy nine, while young male endurance riders keep popping up, as Simon Yates, Owain Doull and Jon Dibben have shown in the past 12 months.</p><p>\"It's something we're working on,\" said Sutton. \"We have to try and source those athletes. We've got a new academy pathway manager working with us. There must be young sprinters out there, we've just got to find them.\"</p><p>In the early rounds on Saturday, Joanna Rowsell took an early option on individual pursuit gold – about 12 hours after taking team gold – with the fastest time in the qualifying round ahead of Australia's Rebecca Wiasak. Katie Archibald, riding for Scotland, continued her meteoric rise by going through to the bronze medal ride-off, having taken silver in Friday's scratch race.</p><p>The world women's match sprint champion James qualified sixth in the women's behind Victoria Pendleton's nemesis of old Anna Meares – returning to the international stage for the first time since the London Olympics – before going through to face Kristina Vogel of Germany in the semi-finals, while Jess Varnish finished fifth.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421523171|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|7ede0326be8a3527f4a827cebb8c7745a61512a4 -->",

        "headline":"Britain's women smash world record in team pursuit at World Cup",
        "body":"<p>This opening session at the World Cup marked the start of the road to Rio, according to the senior rider in the Great Britain squad, the team pursuiter Ed Clancy, who said that the post-London hangover was long gone. If that is indeed the case, it is the endurance riders, male and female, who are leading the British, with the women's quartet bowling down the highway in pretty much the same shape – or arguably even better – as when they rolled off the boards at the Pringle in London 15 months ago.</p><p>It would be disrespectful to Laura Trott, Dani King, Joanna Rowsell and Elinor Barker to say that they make record breaking look routine but it is more than a habit, for the old hands Trott, King and Rowsell at least. The distance of the event has been increased by a kilometre from the start of this winter's track season and teams have had to add a fourth member, meaning that all the teams are on new ground, but it matters not a jot.</p><p>On Friday night the quartet broke their own world best time in qualifying; and in the final against Canada there was no question that they would win gold, given they had ridden over 4sec faster.</p><p>The big question was the time and the British quartet stepped up to the mark with 4min 19.604sec. They had their rivals in sight after half-distance, and came close to catching the Canadians in the end, helped by the disturbed air in their rivals' wake, meaning that in a single afternoon and evening, they had taken over 7sec off the record they had set two weeks earlier in winning the European championship in Apeldoorn. That is in addition to Trott's, Rowsell's and King's run of six world records in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics – before Barker joined the party at this year's world championships in Minsk – and through to last year's World Cup in Glasgow.</p><p>\"Because it is a new event we are finding our own limits at the moment,\" said Rowsell. \"In training [at] the first few sessions we plucked a number out of thin air. Over the last few competitions we have been pushing it that little bit further, that little bit harder. I think to go sub-20 is probably ahead of where we expected to be. We always said that we want to go through three kilometres quicker than we did in the Olympics. It's only going to get quicker.\"</p><p>The Glaswegian Katie Archibald has risen rapidly to become the fifth member of the squad; the 20-year-old was a team pursuit finalist in Apeldoorn and took the silver medal in the scratch race on Friday evening a few minutes after her team-mates had taken their pursuit gold medal.</p><p>There is also intense competition among the men's squad, for whom Clancy, Steven Burke, Andy Tennant and the Welsh 20-year-old Owain Doull took the gold medal here ahead of their perennial rivals Australia. \"Six guys are going for four spots coming into the world championships and at the moment I couldn't say who will be in the team,\" is Burke's view.</p><p>Clancy said there is more to come, from what he  terms \"a development squad\", after they gained inexorably on the Australians throughout the three kilometres, then hung on to win by just over half a second. \"None of us really gave it everything in qualifying but as soon as we tried to step it up [in the final] we were on our limit apart from Burkie. A little bit more and we'll have a good go at the worlds.\"</p><p>Doull, currently, is the rider in pole position to step up alongside the more experienced trio but Jon Dibben and Sam Harrison are waiting in the wings.</p><p>\"We tried Owain out in the final in Apeldoorn, didn't know what we were going to get, ever since then he's had his foot in the door and he's looking good at the moment,\" said Clancy. Doull, who will ride on the European professional circuit next season with Sean Kelly's development squad, is on a run of form that began in mid-September with the Tour of Britain, after which he has progressed through the world road championships and into the winter track season.</p><p>In time he will face the dilemma which besets all British men's team pursuiters, which is whether to specialise on the road or the track, but for Friday night he looked simply delighted.</p><p>Immediately after the men's pursuit Becky James and Victoria Williamson took to the track for the final of the women's team sprint, where they had qualified second – thanks to a storming second lap from James – to the German world champions Miriam Welte and Kristina Vogel.</p><p>The form book suggested that the Germans would take gold, and so it proved, but James was happy with her form and is optimistic ahead of Saturday's sprint&nbsp;tournament.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421488646|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|30232b6021cc5b5a69e8b0bc963a75c151d82c9c -->",

        "body":"<p>Another day, another race, another world record for Great Britain's women's team pursuiters, who have become the squad's most reliable gold-medal bankers and update world-bests seemingly at will. After a devastating performance in qualifying from Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell, Laura Trott and Dani King, few would bet against the quartet moving seamlessly to a gold medal on the first evening of competition at the opening round of the winter's World Cup series.</p><p>Trott, King and Rowsell updated their world record over 3,000m time after time in the run-in to London 2012. They achieved what is set to remain the definitive time at the World Cup a year ago in Glasgow, sealing a run of six consecutive world marks. The event has been amended this year and is now for four women over 4,000m – the same as the men – and the British trio, with the addition of Barker, appear to have set off on the same trajectory.</p><p>At their first outing over the distance in the European championships two weeks ago in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn they set an initial record of 4min 26.556sec over the distance. In qualifying here  on Friday afternoon, on a track which is widely acknowledged to be quicker than the one in the Netherlands, they pulverised that by more than two and a half seconds with a time of 4:23.910.</p><p>That left them over four and a half seconds ahead of the Canadian quartet and in a position where only an unforeseen event could deprive them of a gold medal.</p><p>While other nations appear to be struggling to adapt to the increase in distance and numbers, Great Britain have progressed seamlessly, with Barker stepping up from the junior ranks at the world championships in Minsk during February, which Rowsell sat out to focus on road racing. They brought the 20-year-old Scotswoman Katie Archibald into their line-up for the final in Apeldoorn, where she replaced Barker; she will join the senior GB squad soon.</p><p>There is more talent waiting down the ranks, with a British junior quartet winning gold at their world championships in Glasgow this summer.</p><p>Three of their number, Emily Kay, Amy Hill and Hayley Jones, are competing here against the seniors as part of a Welsh squad building towards the Commonwealth Games, and managed to finish ninth of the 12 teams.</p><p>If the women's team pursuit is still a new event dominated by a single nation, the men's equivalent is rather different – the last endurance event with any history on the Olympic schedule and a tale of two squads, Great Britain and Australia.</p><p>That rivalry dates back to Athens in 2004 and it continued in familiar vein here, although Great Britain at least are in a rebuilding phase with the London gold medallists Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh returning to road racing for Team Sky.</p><p>The two other London gold medallists, Ed Clancy and Steven Burke, were joined by Owain Doull and Andy Tennant to qualify fastest with the only sub-four-minute ride of the afternoon while Australia, last off in the 17 teams, had only to finish inside the Danish quartet's time of 4:02  to qualify for the gold-silver ride-off.</p><p>The men's team sprinters are still struggling to adapt to life without Sir Chris Hoy, who retired in April, but Philip Hindes, Jason Kenny and Kian Emadi still qualified for the bronze medal ride-off while their female counterparts, Becky James and Victoria Williamson, progressed to the gold-silver ride-off against the world champions, Germany.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421474871|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|599652b4cc089b20ae1c10dec911a7792d1fa31f -->",

        "headline":"Becky James: I'd love to rewind to amazing feeling of winning world gold",
        "body":"<p>Becky James has learned enough about the art of winning, as a dual world champion, to pick her battles. The <a href=\"http://www.trackworldcup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">World Cup in Manchester</a>, which begins on Friday, might seem like a war worth winning because the 21-year-old sprint cyclist will be roared on by a partisan crowd at the velodrome where she trains relentlessly. But the pain of 2012 taught James some valuable lessons and, through defeat, she found the momentum to win surprising sprint and keirin titles at the world championships in Minsk in February.</p><p>\"If someone had said in February 2012 that I'd be a double world champion a year from then, I would have thought they were crazy,\" James says with typical exuberance. \"But I've learnt about peaking when it matters most. There is nothing better than a home World Cup and so I'm very excited. I feel well and everything is good but, compared to Minsk, this hasn't been ideal preparation. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/31/becky-james-japan-keirin\" title=\"\">I was in Japan for a month, racing in the keirin</a>, and so I haven't had the solid block of training I would have wanted. It would be nice to find some amazing form and do really well in Manchester – but for me this World Cup is just another stepping stone to the next world championships in Cali [Colombia, in February].\"</p><p>James is a refreshing character, not least in her candid assessment of her chances this weekend in the team sprint, with Victoria Williamson, and her two world-champion disciplines. \"I expect some people might beat me in Manchester,\" she says cheerfully, while reiterating that the world cup series is less important than defending her rainbow jerseys in Cali in March. The formidable Olympic sprint champion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/26/london-2012-anna-meares-victoria-pendleton\" title=\"\">Anna Meares</a>, is a confirmed entrant and James smiles disarmingly. \"I imagine pretty much everyone will be there because you have to race two World Cups. Manchester is the easiest place to get to for nearly everybody.</p><p>\"I raced against Anna in the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010 and came very close in the final. It was this close [her thumb and index finger are separated by millimetres] in the one race. So nothing is impossible but Anna is an incredible rider and a lovely person with a nice heart. I really like her.\" This might sound strange when remembering <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/pendleton-meares-likes-to-push-the-rules with Meares\" title=\"\">Victoria Pendelton's racing enmity with Meares</a> but James has begun a new era in British cycling. She might not have the same natural speed but James's ambition and composure make her a suitable successor to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Between-Lines-Autobiography-Victoria-Pendleton/dp/0007327528\" title=\"\">Pendleton</a> who won nine world championships and two Olympic titles in an imperious career.</p><p>Meares did not race in Minsk but she is building towards another determined crack at Olympic gold in 2016. James, however, produced some remarkable performances while defeating seasoned champions in Guo Shuang and Kristina Vogel. \"In the past, if I came up against a big name, their reputation stopped me from winning. But me and my psychologist, Dave Readle, work so hard on that. Against Anna Meares it's important you don't think of her as anything more than an opponent. It's hard but I've learnt how to do it. Shuang is an incredible rider so to beat her 2-0 in Minsk [in the semi-final] …\"</p><p>James makes a noise of incredulous delight. \"I was then up against Vogel. I've always had a block against Vogel and had never beaten her. She beat me in the first race [of three] but even that didn't bother me. I won the next one. The final race was so funny. My coach Jan van Eijden was holding me up on the line – and he was shaking and breathing heavily. Normally I would be the one [James hyperventilates in amusing fashion] while Jan would be dead calm. I said to him afterwards: 'God, you were nervous…'  Jan said: 'I had to talk to the doctor and see if he could give me anything'…'\"</p><p>James laughs before explaining how she <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/21557815\" title=\"\">dominated Vogel tactically and psychologically in the decider</a>. She barely slept after her victory and, having won bronze in both the team sprint and 500m time trial, she was exhausted on the last day. \"I was so tired in the keirin that, in the first race, my eyes were stinging. I made it to the semis, got through it, came third and qualified for the final. My coaches were amazing. They said: 'You've done what you needed to do, so just enjoy this last race.' The pain when I crossed the line was really bad but knowing I'd won made it go away. I'd love to rewind to that amazing feeling.\"</p><p>The contrast between that moment and her desolation exactly a year earlier was stark. \"I was in the worst possible place physically and mentally,\" James says of February 2012. After suffering an achilles injury she went to the World Cup in Beijing. \"It was the worst experience of my life. I was 25th in sprint qualifying so didn't even make it [to the knockout rounds]. In the team sprint me and Vicky Williamson came 10th out of 12. I went out early in the keirin. I was so emotional, in the worst form of my life, and came back and got appendicitis. I then had the heartbreak of the Olympics.\"</p><p>Shane Sutton, British Cycling's blunt head coach, told James her peer accreditation for London 2012 would not help her make the holding camp in Newport or experience the Olympics themselves. He insisted she train in Manchester. \"I knew I wouldn't be racing but I thought I'd be part of it. I got told on the Thursday and I was so upset I went home to Wales on Friday and let all the emotion out. But by the Monday I was ready to hit it hard in training again. It was definitely the best thing to stay in Manchester.\"</p><p>Did she watch the Olympics on television? \"Yeah,\" she grimaces. \"There were quite a lot of tears but it gave me motivation as well.\" James trained so hard last summer that she began to notice a radical improvement. \"I then had a really good training block in Perth in December. I came home and kept getting better week in, week out. I kept shocking myself and at the worlds I was in the best possible place.\"</p><p>Her boyfriend, the rugby player George North, had to endure good-natured tweets from his Wales team-mates who were amused that he was the less successful sporting partner in their relationship. North then helped Wales win the Grand Slam, he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L46Uzudj4Ds\" title=\"\">blistering on the wing for the Lions in Australia</a> – and James has retreated from the spotlight.</p><p>\"I never get recognised unless I'm with George. I'm then thought of as George North's girlfriend. Once or twice in Cardiff, when we were out together soon after I became world champion, people said: 'Are you Becky James?' That felt really weird. I'm happy as I am …\"</p><p>James has the confidence of a world champion and the more humane perspective of her family. She is one of six children, five of whom are ferociously sporty while her sister, Bethan, is severely handicapped. Last year, amid James's sporting desolation, Bethan was in hospital. \"When I moan about stupid things, or worry so much,\" James says, \"my mum points out how lucky I am.\"</p><p>The need to care for Bethan is so consuming that her parents rarely get the chance to see Becky race. \"My parents are my heroes, really. I don't know how they've managed with six of us and looking after Bethan. I don't think she knows what's going on but she's got emotions. When I go home she'll smile as she recognises my voice. She's just turned 18.\"</p><p>Only three years older than her sister, James suddenly looks as profound as she is young. Against such a personal backdrop, and revering her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/27/becky-james-cycing-dynasty\" title=\"\">extraordinary family</a>, her preference to downplay expectations this weekend seems as wise as it is pragmatic. Another World Cup round will soon pass in a blur. Her world championship status, in contrast, might endure for years. \"I'll have my ups and downs,\" James says, \"but I know what's important. I'll hopefully peak at the worlds next year and at the Olympics. But I'll have some fun in Manchester – whatever happens.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421375753|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|295601c724d4eb68c307b2800de157da9ecb72fa -->",

        "body":"<p>Ryder Hesjedal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/27/ryder-hesjedal-joaquim-rodriguez-giro-ditalia\" title=\"\">the winner of the 2012 Giro d'Italia</a>, admitted on Wednesday that he had doped \"more than 10 years ago\".</p><p>\"I have loved and lived this sport but more than a decade ago I chose the wrong path,\" said the Garmin-Sharp rider in a statement. \"Even though those mistakes happened more than 10 years ago, and they were short-lived, it does not change the fact I made them and I have lived with that and been sorry for it ever since.\"</p><p>The statement came in response to allegations by the Dane Michael Rasmussen, who said earlier on Wednesday that he taught the Canadian how to take the banned blood-booster erythropoietin (EPO) in 2003.</p><p>Rasmussen was kicked out of his Rabobank team while leading the Tour de France in 2007 for having lied about his whereabouts to doping authorities. His claims were made in a book, whose extracts were published <a href=\"http://politiken.dk\" title=\"\">by the Danish newspaper Politiken</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Rasmussen was at Rabobank in 2003 while Hesjedal, then a mountain bike rider, was in the Dutch operation's development team. \"I believe that being truthful will help the sport continue to move forward, and over a year ago when I was contacted by anti-doping authorities I was open and honest about my past,\" said Hesjedal.</p><p>The Canadian was one of several riders – past and present – and managers to be called on to testify by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) in the case against Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping.</p><p>Hesjedal was one of Armstrong's team mates at US Postal and Discovery Channel in 2004 and 2005.</p><p>Having joined Garmin, a team built on a strong anti-doping stance, Hesjedal is confident his sport is on the right path. \"I have seen the best and the worst of the sport and I believe that it is now in the best place it's ever been,\" he said.</p><p>Garmin-Sharp said they are backing their rider. \"As we have previously stated, our expectation is that anyone in our organisation contacted by any anti-doping authority must be open and honest with that authority,\" a team statement read. \"Ryder is no exception and a year ago when he was contacted he cooperated fully and truthfully testified to Usada and CCES [Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport]. For this reason and because of our desire for 100% truth and reconciliation in the sport of cycling, we support him.\"</p><p>Several riders at Garmin-Sharp, including the former Armstrong team-mates David Zabriskie, Hesjedal, Tom Danielson, Christian Vande Velde and the manager Jonathan Vaughters, have testified before Usada against the disgraced American rider.</p><p>In January Armstrong admitted to years of using performance-enhancing substances during his career.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421326176|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|449c8a3230f282919d62f8e8e8316d52a13aa314 -->",

        "headline":"Tour de France: how Team Sky climbed to the top and stayed there",
        "body":"<p>There is a new joke doing the rounds among cycling fans: British Tour de France winners are like London buses. You wait years for one to come along, and then you get two, one right after the other. Two British victors of cycling's toughest event back to back might seem an outlandish idea, but Dave Brailsford, Team Sky, Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins have managed to make it seem routine at the same time.</p><p>In July 2009, Team Sky was merely a series of spreadsheets, random jottings, and what the team's founders term \"brain dumps\" as Brailsford and his associates tried to figure out how to start a professional cycling team. They had little idea of what they were getting into. But this July Froome started as the overwhelming Tour favourite, led the race from the end of week one, and never looked likely to be beaten. Wiggins did exactly the same in 2012.</p><p>It has taken four years, but that is not a coincidence: four years is an Olympic cycle, the time frame in which British Cycling, the UK's governing body, and its performance director, Brailsford, have tended to function since the arrival of lottery funding into the sport in 1997. Britain's Tour de France domination stems directly from its record Olympic medal hauls, which drew in the big money from Sky – James Murdoch is an active cyclist and turns up to races intermittently – and gave Brailsford the knowledge base from which to climb cycling's Everest: the Tour.</p><p>The Sky goal was to dominate road cycling using the same methods that had brought Olympic success, most notably the \"aggregation of marginal gains\", where every area is examined in minute detail for possible improvement, and the cumulative effect of many small gains gives a considerable advance on the opposition. Sky would also use the people-management principles devised by Steve Peters, the \"mechanic of the mind\", a psychiatrist who had worked at Rampton mental hospital.</p><p>The first year was a struggle. The \"marginal gains\" that Sky brought to cycling initially made it the butt of derision. Its special set-up at time-trial stages, with non-slip matting laid out so the cyclists wouldn't slip in their custom-made carbon-fibre soled shoes, took hours to set up – and other teams would laugh at them as they toiled away.</p><p>Attempts to use weather modelling to locate training camps and decide Wiggins' start time in a Tour time trial fell spectacularly flat. Staff would moan about the extra effort it took lugging the riders' custom-made bedding in and out of hotels every night. There were tensions among riders and staff, with European hirings struggling to fit in with British Cycling's methods. Key members left; there were complaints about constant meetings.</p><p>The ridicule and mutterings lasted only as long as it took for Sky to start winning, and since the end of 2011 it has been a trail of success, not just in the Tour but in other stage races. By then Sky's training guru, Tim Kerrison, had begun putting together a radical programme that is at the root of Wiggins and Froome's successes: intense training at high altitude, reverse periodisation, which turned the idea of a gradual buildup to the Tour on its head, less racing and more training.</p><p></p><p>Rod Ellingworth, Sky's performance manager, and Kerrison put together a method of internal communication based on dropboxes, to compensate for the fact that Sky's 80 personnel were spread around Europe. Advanced planning and logistical systems were put in place. More training staff were hired, so that, uniquely in professional cycling, Sky's riders benefit from one-to-one training on a constant basis. \"You can see from this team how much you can get by investing relatively small amounts in coaching,\" Kerrison has told the Guardian. \"The gains are disproportionate.\"</p><p></p><p>Kerrison's computer modelling of the Tour's athletic demands meant the team could target precisely what training was needed to win the Tour.</p><p>There has been no let-up on the marginal gains front. The team's dietitian, Nigel Mitchell, has been a constant presence on the race, monitoring every gram the riders consume, including the fish oils, and fruit and vegetable shakes that are Sky staples. The fruits of Froome's work in a wind tunnel could be seen in his time-trial success and in the bursts of speed on the climbs that won him the race. And the Olympic link is as strong as ever: two of Sky's key team members, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh, were gold medallists at the \"Pringle\" in London.</p><p>On Saturday, Froome spoke about his personal journey to Tour de France success, from pounding dirt tracks in Kenya as a teenager when he was unaware La Grande Boucle even existed. But the voyage taken by Brailsford and his cohorts from callow tyros to Tour tyrants is equally remarkable. The Sky head said before the Tour that in 2010 he would have given his right arm to see one of his cyclists make the podium in a major Tour; now the cycling world is scrabbling to catch up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413308338|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|1cf44d6ef73706bd9ddf4cd26621d5620e21ef42 -->",

        "headline":"Eddy Merckx: this much I know",
        "body":"<p><strong>My parents taught me honesty</strong> and respect for other people. When I was at school I&nbsp;wanted to go to the Côte d'Azur for holidays, like my schoolfriends. We went to the North Sea. My father, who was a grocer and one of 11 children, said: \"Don't look to those who go to the Côte D'Azur, but look to those who can't go the North Sea – keep your feet on the ground.\"</p><p><strong>I wanted to be a cyclist</strong> from the age of four. I listened to the Tour de France on the radio during the holidays. My teachers said: \"That's not a job\", but I was the Belgian amateur champion at 16 [he won 445 races as a pro].</p><p><strong>My earliest memory</strong> is my first crash on a&nbsp;bike. It was when I was four. My legs were going faster and faster until, in the end, they couldn't keep up with the pedals and I&nbsp;crashed spectacularly.</p><p><strong>The closest I have come to death</strong> was when I had my crash at the Blois outdoor vélodrome in central France in September 1969. I'd just won the Tour de France and I&nbsp;was racing behind my pacer, who was on a&nbsp;Derny [a custom-built motorbike]. He&nbsp;crashed into another bike and was killed. I&nbsp;hit him at full speed. I flew through the air, landing head first. I&nbsp;had nothing on my head – just sponge and leather. I twisted my hips and injured my back and I was never the same. I&nbsp;was always in pain, and still have treatment on my back every two months.</p><p><strong>I heard Sir </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/21/bradley-wiggins-never-ride-tour-de-france-again\" title=\"\"><strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong></a> made £6m last year. I'm not jealous about that, because I&nbsp;don't understand why cyclists aren't paid as much as footballers or tennis players or golfers, but if I could have made £6m in a&nbsp;year I wouldn't have ridden as much. You had to ride a lot back then to make money. When I started, I got a jersey and some equipment. Sometimes I would get the equivalent of €25 to enter a race and €15 prize money.</p><p><strong>I don't know how many races</strong> I was in over the years [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/16/eddy-merckx-william-fotheringham-review\" title=\"\">Merckx</a> competed in 1,413 races from 1966-77], but in 1975, the year I lost  the Tour de France, I did 195 races. I was racing everywhere.</p><p><strong>They called me the Cannibal.</strong> It was a&nbsp;young girl, the daughter of my old Peugeot teammate Christian Raymond, who gave me the name. We were on the start line and Christian said to her: \"This guy won't let us win anything – he wants everything for himself.\" She said: \"So he's a cannibal.\"</p><p><strong>When you are number one, </strong>the pressure is on you. It's not only physical but mental. You&nbsp;become tired.</p><p><strong>Cycling is a good school for life.</strong> It makes you hard and gives you ambition, but you can never say you've arrived.</p><p><strong>I don't like it when people say </strong>I was the best ever. It's silly. I am not the best ever. I was the best of my time. You cannot compare generations. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/may/31/fausto-coppi\" title=\"\">Fausto Coppi</a> after the war, Anquetil, Hinault, Indurain, Fignon. I&nbsp;never rode for the glory. I rode because I&nbsp;like cycling and winning. But not to say I am the best.</p><p><strong>I made a big mistake in 1975</strong>, when I had a&nbsp;crash in the Tour de France and broke my jaw [he was also punched by a spectator but still finished second]. I should have retired from the race. I was exhausted.</p><p><strong>I am 68, but still ride every week</strong> with some friends, maybe 60km at a time, but we enjoy a glass of wine and some parma ham afterwards.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411601601|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|89a6f6c96f9d6f585c777ead922640ae05d22d09 -->",

        "headline":"From the Observer archive, 4 July 1965: The man who makes the Tour de France's wheels turn",
        "body":"<p>\"The Tour De France,\" said Antoine Blondin, \"is a mobile village – an anarchy with its own laws and customs, a territory 30 kilometres long and as wide as the road, ruled by a mayor who is Jacques Goddet. The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411679059|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|cda8cfb873be8350a009f222ce5d3128436d9326 -->",

Obree, described as a genius by Sir Chris Hoy, possessed huge natural talent and drive, but a series of factors – not least his refusal to touch the drugs then prevalent in the sport – cut short his career in the 1990s and he slipped into relative obscurity and intermittent depression.</p><p>Now at 47, he plans to try for the world human-powered land speed record on a machine which he rides head first, just above the ground. If that wasn't enough, the bike was almost entirely built in his kitchen from recycled parts, including metal from an old saucepan.</p><p>The idea that a self-built steel-framed creation, which Obree estimates cost around £1,000 to build, could tackle the 82.8 mph record set in 2009 by a Canadian rider using a computer-modelled, carbon fibre-shelled recumbent machine, seems ludicrous. But this is well-trodden ground for Obree, one of the more creative, bloody-minded and enigmatic characters in British sport.</p><p>The Ayrshire-based rider achieved fame from seemingly nowhere in July 1993 when he broke the world one-hour cycle distance record at a Norwegian velodrome, using a self-built bike, Old Faithful. This incorporated a self-created, highly aerodynamic tuck position as well as, famously, ballbearings borrowed from a washing machine.</p><p>Obree retook his record the following year, also winning a track world championship title on Old Faithful. When cycling's governing body, the UCI, outlawed the tuck stance, Obree came back with an equally creative alternative, the stretched out \"Superman\" position, to win another world title.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531352'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372165923377/Graeme-Obree-1996-Olympic-010.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree 1996 Olympics' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree competes during the preliminary round of the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That was where it ended. It is arguably paradoxical to describe a man whose autobiography, The Flying Scotsman, was made into a film staring Jonny Lee Miller, as an unsung hero, but Obree never notched up the titles and fame of his peers, such as Chris Boardman.</p><p>Obree's sole Olympics, in 1996, saw him exit in the preliminary rounds. His career with a French professional road cycling team lasted one day. Obree has always maintained he was sacked when he made it clear he would not use drugs.</p><p>He has endured a turbulent personal life, affected by self-criticism and depression, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Obree came out as gay a couple of years ago, something he says has contributed to his happiness. His decision to do so is still relatively unusual in professional sport.</p><p>He reinvented himself as an author and a speaker, and just over two years ago began plotting an attempt at the human-powered bike speed record. Rather than adapt one of the feet-first recumbent bikes traditionally used for such bids, Obree, typically, started from scratch.</p><p>The result is the Beastie, in which the rider lies face down and head forward, with his or her feet powering a pair of narrower push-pull levers rather than conventional pedals.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531353'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372166249301/Graeme-Obree-001.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree' width='220' height='424' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree on the sea front in Ayrshire in 2007. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"The idea came from first principles,\" Obree said. \"The widest part of the body is the shoulders, so if you think about a teardrop shape it makes sense to have that at the front, and the feet‚ with the push-pull, meaning they just miss each other at the narrowest part, at the back.</p><p>\"The first thing I had to do was the basic outline of the structure. The body's the one thing you can't change. Everything else was built around that mechanically.\"</p><p>The Beastie was built mainly in Obree's small flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with excursions to a friend's workshop. The steel frame came primarily from old bikes, and as many other components as possible were recycled. Stainless steel from an old saucepan became part of a shoulder rest.</p><p>Such a process was necessary, given the innovative design. Obree said: \"It was one of those things where I didn't know exactly what I wanted until I could see how it came into shape. If you're building it yourself you can make all the fine changes as you go along. If it's done by someone else, when it comes back you'll go: 'Oh, that's wrong,' and it could take weeks to fix. But doing it myself, in my own flat, the same process could take an hour.\"</p><p>Obree has tried out the machine once, wobbling to a modest 30mph or so on a runway at Prestwick airport, without the aerodynamic fairing, as he got used to the low-slung machine's twitchy ride. \"The main thing was, once I was launched I could hold a relatively straight line,\" he said. \"That's good to know. I'd say the test was pretty successful in terms of mechanical parts working. The skin's fine, the bike's steerable, nothing fell off.\"</p><p>In September Obree and the Beastie will decamp to a super-smooth, high altitude road in Nevada for the annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge. He is promising nothing. \"All I can do is go and give it a good punt,\" he said. However, a record would bring renewed recognition.</p><p>The temptation is to create a narrative in which this would be vindication for a man denied the celebrity of Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins thanks to petty officialdom and the endemic drug taking of early 1990s cycling. <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/36717-graeme-obree-interview-part-2-doping-olympics-uci-regulations-and-future-projects\" title=\"\">Obree, typically, doesn't see it that way</a>.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways I wouldn't like to be as famous as Bradley Wiggins. I think that would be totally awful, actually, getting stopped in the street everywhere. I get it occasionally but it's quite polite, it's nice. It's not a crowd of people around you, like Chris Hoy gets. I wouldn't want that level of fame.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Obree says he is glad the post-Lance Armstrong cycling era is more ready to hear his story: \"I've got no regret about not taking drugs. But I obviously wonder how I'd have got on at the Tour de France. That was what I was lined up for. But that wasn't my overriding goal from the start, my goal was a world record, so I got that, and the world championships. The Olympics got away, obviously. And it would have been great to get Olympic gold and, say, a Tour de France stage win. But hey ho.</p><p>\"And you know what? I escaped with my health and my honour. In a lot of ways I don't have any regrets.\"</p><p></p><h2>An innovative man</h2><p>To get a sense of the extent to which Graeme Obree likes to re-think the very fundamentals of his sport, consider his self-penned 2012 training manual, The Obree Method. Inside is an entire chapter about how to adapt your breathing so as to absorb more oxygen (it's all to do with the out-breaths).</p><p>Craig MacLean, who competed on the velodrome for Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, recalls first meeting Obree at track competitions in the early 1990s.</p><p>\"He thinks about everything in a very unconventional way. There's some ideas about training he gave me which I still use today. Cycling is almost like a big experiment for him.</p><p>\"He was a bit of a maverick around that era. Cycling was very much a traditional sport ‚you only ever rode fixed gear in the winter and you had to do a certain number of miles before you were allowed back on your normal road bike, all these things that had been around since the dark ages. But he always did things differently.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411524674|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|aa6db372e6fca631aba51bba37f1070482b1f06c -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins has left the Giro d'Italia to return home to recover from the severe cold and chest infection that ruined his hopes of winning the first Grand Tour of the 2013 season.</p><p>He had been lying 13th overall, but the writing was clearly on the wall when he was left behind by the peloton during Thursday's rain-soaked stage into Treviso, losing three minutes.</p><p>\"We monitored Bradley overnight and this morning we've withdrawn him from the Giro after consulting the team doctor,\" the Team Sky head, Dave Brailsford, said on Friday. \"His chest infection has been getting worse and our primary concern is always the health of our riders. Bradley will return to the UK today for treatment and to rest and we hope to have him back on the road as soon as possible.</p><p>\"As a passionate racer he wanted to continue but he is simply unable to do so on medical grounds.\"</p><p>Team Sky had said that a decision would be taken first thing on Friday depending primarily on Wiggins's health but also on the weather, as further rain would be certain to affect him adversely. Rain was forecast for Friday morning in Emilia Romagna, the location of the stage start, together with winds gusting to 40km/h.</p><p>The risk was that by continuing to pursue what had become a lost cause, Wiggins might create more problems for his health in the long term. A prompt withdrawal at least means he can return for the Tour de France; there are opportunities for him to return to competition before then, including the Tour of Switzerland in late June, but the team will wait for a complete recovery before deciding on his programme.</p><p>Wiggins had made the sign of the cross to cycling fans at the finish of Wednesday's stage in Fruili; even though he was able to hang on to the leaders, he admitted that he had been ill for several days and had been taking antibiotics. He had limited his time loss on the first severe mountain-top finish of the race on Tuesday to just 37sec, inspiring hopes that he might still tilt for the podium.</p><p>The most likely cause for Wiggins's sickness is the rough weather which has followed the Giro as it has travelled from the south of the country to the north. While some cyclists thrive in the wet and cold, Wiggins has always been open about the fact that he is susceptible to such conditions.</p><p>The wet weather hit the Giro 10 days ago, on stage four, and Thursday was the fourth stage run in rain and cold; Wiggins had lost time on stages four and seven in the grim conditions. The forecast for the weekend's Alpine stages is for snow, with speculation that Sunday's finish on the Galibier will be cut short.</p><p>Wiggins was not the only winner of a Grand Tour from 2012 to quit the race; before the Briton's departure was confirmed, Garmin-Sharp announced that Hesjedal would not start Friday's stage. The Canadian had suffered immensely on Tuesday's stage in Friuli, and like Wiggins, the three-hour run on to the Veneto plains on Thursday proved too much for him.</p><p>\"There's a virus that's been going around, so it could be that, or severe allergies – whatever it is, I'm only getting worse,\" said Hesjedal in a statement released by his team. \"Yesterday's stage was just too much for me, I fought to get through it but after seeing the medical staff last night, I also know that its time for me to go home, get some tests done and get healthy again.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409034147|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|282a8ec06109783116138943ba11e8921f170f6b -->",

        "body":"<p>The US government has filed court documents laying out its case against cyclist Lance Armstrong, who is accused of defrauding the Postal Service by taking millions of dollars in sponsorship money while flouting professional cycling rules by doping. </p><p>The US department of justice is joining a whistleblower lawsuit brought in 2010 by Armstrong's former teammate, Floyd Landis, and on Tuesday the department filed its formal complaint. </p><p>Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and was banned for life from cycling in 2012 after accusations he had cheated for years. In January he said the accusations were true in an interview with television host Oprah Winfrey. </p><p>Armstrong and his teammates from Tailwind Sports were paid US$40m by the Postal Service from 1998 to 2004, according to the lawsuit. Armstrong's salary during that time, excluding bonuses, was $17.9m, the complaint says.<br /> <br />The government is suing under the False Claims Act and can recoup up to three times the amount it lost as a result of the fraud. The complaint also alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment and fraud. </p><p>An attorney for Armstrong said the complaint was opportunistic and insincere. \"The US Postal Service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship of the cycling team. The USPS was never the victim of fraud,\" said attorney Elliot Peters in a statement. \"Lance Armstrong rode his heart out for the USPS team and gave the brand tremendous exposure during the sponsorship years.\"<br /> <br />The complaint echoes Landis's claims that Armstrong and others defrauded the US government by falsely denying the doping accusations and continuing the sponsorship relationship with the Postal Service. </p><p>When the government believes a suit has merit, it may take over the litigation. The individuals, or whistleblowers, get a portion of the proceeds if the case is successful. </p><p>The US complaint accuses Armstrong of using at least one prohibited substance or method in connection with every Tour de France between 1999 and 2005. \"Moreover he knew that his teammates were engaged in similar doping practices, and he actively encouraged and facilitated those practices,\" the complaint says.</p><p>\"The United Stated suffered damage in that it did not receive the value of the services for which it bargained.\"<br /> <br />A lawyer for Landis, Paul Scott, said in statement that he was \"pleased to see the United States take this important step toward recovering taxpayer dollars lost to fraud\".<br /> <br />The case has been filed the US district court for the District of Columbia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407736960|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|135d107c1af268546f581d422e7fc9d53e80783e -->",

        "headline":"Chris Hoy to retire from cycling after 13 years on top",
        "body":"<p>Since the London Olympics last August, and the magic moment on \"Super Tuesday\" when Sir Chris Hoy edged his front wheel in front of Germany's Maximilian Levy to seal the sixth Olympic gold of his career the question has been asked – when would the Scot retire?</p><p>Now it appears that after 13 years at the highest level, Hoy will confirm his departure from cycling on Thursday.</p><p>The rider, who is now 37, will make \"a major announcement\" at Murrayfield stadium in his native Edinburgh at noon. Hoy has been a proud Scot all his career and it seems entirely typical of that he should choose to make his official farewell not far away from the mouldering old wooden Commonwealth Games stadium at Meadowbank, where he made his debut in track cycling in the&nbsp;early 1990s.</p><p>Since 7 August, when he won keirin gold in London and was saluted as he left the boards by a guard of honour consisting of all the Great Britain team staff, Hoy has officially been contemplating his future with a view to continuing as far as the Commonwealth Games next year in Glasgow, at the new velodrome which has been named after him. That decision, he said last November, would depend on whether he felt his body would hold out.</p><p>Senior figures within British Cycling have, however, felt recently that he would be hanging up his wheels some time this year. One indication that he would be quitting competition came in the last few weeks when his press officer Charlie Reid, who has run his media engagements since the Beijing Games, was quietly moved to other duties.</p><p>Hoy has also been dealing with his newly launched bike range, and motor racing. Nothing has pointed to a resumption of training. At the world championships in Minsk in February, it was clear that the British sprint staff were looking for a new rider to take over Hoy's place in the team sprint.</p><p>It seems likely that Hoy has made the decision on two grounds: first, he is unlikely to make a better farewell than his spectacular gold medal in the keirin in London. If he were to continue to Glasgow next August, there would be a risk that a younger opponent might show him up. Given the reputation of the track head coach Shane Sutton for plain speaking, this may well have been&nbsp;put to him.</p><p>Also, in the runup to London, Hoy's body was buckling. It was kept quiet – for obvious reasons – but the updated version of his autobiography published after the Games made it clear that he was carrying a back injury between the world championships in Melbourne in April, and the Olympics.</p><p>Between Beijing and London he also broke a rib while weight training, and had a big crash at the Copenhagen World&nbsp;Cup in February 2009 that injured&nbsp;his hip.</p><p>Hoy's departure will mark the end of an era: he is one of the last members of the Olympic cycling team who competed in the distant era before lottery funding arrived in 1997 to transform the sport. He was one of a group of sprinters, together with Jason Queally and Craig Maclean, who were given funding soon after lottery cash arrived, and they broke through at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 with a silver medal in the team sprint to go with Queally's gold in the kilometre time trial. Since then he has spearheaded the British squad's rise to world domination.</p><p>Hoy's first world titles came in 2002 in Copenhagen, where he triumphed in the kilometre, and he followed that up with gold at the discipline in the Athens Olympics. When the time trial was dropped from the Olympic programme he reinvented himself as a keirin and match-sprint rider in time for Beijing, using his immense strength to ride from the front in a dominating style that was completely novel at the time.</p><p>That earned him a spectacular hat-trick of gold medals at the Beijing Games, which in turn led to his election as BBC Sports Personality of the Year for&nbsp;2008. By this stage he was established as the father figure in the British track team, seen as the exemplar of commitment and discipline, as well as ultra-competitiveness, which was the template for the younger squad members.</p><p>By the run-in to London, Hoy's position in the match sprint was under threat from Beijing silver medallist Jason Kenny, and the younger man was given the nod in June.</p><p>But in April, Hoy had taken his fourth keirin world title in six years, showing when he emerged from the pack in a daring move on the final banking that he had broadened his skills, and could now win from almost anywhere on the track.</p><p>That epic moment set up what now looks to have been the final flourish, the&nbsp;highlight of the London velodrome racing in August. If Hoy confirms his departure on Thursday, that will have been one hell of an exit, befitting one of&nbsp;the greatest British Olympians.</p><h2>Hoy's golds</h2><p><strong>Olympic Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Athens 2004 </strong>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Beijing 2008 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff); keirin; sprint</p><p><strong>London 2012 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes); keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>World Championships</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2002 </strong>1km time trial; team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Staff)</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2004</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Los Angeles 2005</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Jason Queally and Staff)</p><p><strong>Bordeaux 2006</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Palma 2007</strong></p><p>Keirin, 1km time trial</p><p><strong>Manchester 2008</strong></p><p>Sprint, keirin</p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2010</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2012</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>Commonwealth Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Manchester 2002</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2006</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Ross Edgar, and Craig MacLean)</p><p></p><p>Hoy has also achieved one Olympic silver medal, eight World Championship silver medals and nine world championship bronze medals.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407237443|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5e26a6129341836d50b3fab535f43fb99d81f472 -->",
