        "headline":"Seeking Help to Buy? Think small lenders over big banks",
        "body":"<p>The launch of the second wave of the government's Help to Buy mortgage scheme a month ago means homebuyers with small deposits now have a wider choice of mortgages – but while the focus has been on 95% loans offered through the scheme, better deals have been cropping up elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Help to Buy encourages lenders to offer 95% LTV mortgages by giving them a taxpayer-backed guarantee for 15% of the mortgage, protecting the bank if the borrower defaults. It was hoped this would allow lenders to grant applicants the same rates as if they had a 20% deposit, but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/08/help-to-buy-mortgage-rates-disappoint-buyers\" title=\"First Help to Buy mortgage rates disappoint housebuyers\">handful of deals announced so far have been a bit of a letdown</a>, with Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest and Halifax charging borrowers between 4.99% and 5.49%.</p><p></p><p>What it has done, though, is spurred some smaller lenders into action. <a href=\"http://www.cambridgebs.co.uk/\" title=\"Cambridge BS website\">Cambridge Building Society</a> has just unveiled a \"stepped rate\" discount mortgage which charges a variable rate of just 3.99% to first-time buyers with a 5% deposit. This rate lasts for the first year, then climbs to 4.89% for the final two years of the three-year deal. The society only lends within the following counties: Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire. For existing borrowers moving away from one of those regions, however, it will lend across England and Wales.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.thehanley.co.uk/\" title=\"Hanley Economic BS website\">Hanley Economic Building Society</a>, which lends across England and Wales, is offering a two-year fixed rate at 4.89% up to 95% LTV, available to both first-time buyers and existing borrowers. Like many smaller lenders, Hanley shuns the strict \"computer says no\" lending criteria adopted by the big banks. Head of operations David Lowndes says: \"We underwrite all our loans individually rather than relying on mechanistic credit scoring, and have approved 85% of applications in the past year.\"</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbonline.co.uk/\" title=\"Clydesdale bank website\">Clydesdale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ybonline.co.uk/\" title=\"Yorkshire bank website\">Yorkshire</a> banks have launched a three-year fixed rate for first-time buyers charging 4.99% up to 95% LTV with no arrangement fee. <a href=\"http://www.hrbs.co.uk/\" title=\"Hinckley  Rugby BS website\">Hinckley &amp; Rugby Building Society</a> offers a two-year discount mortgage at 5.09% to 95% LTV, with fees totalling £990.</p><p></p><p>These deals all undercut the Halifax Help to Buy two-year fixed rate priced at 5.19%, which also carries a £995 product fee, and they are notably cheaper than the five-year fix from RBS and NatWest, which charges a pricey 5.49% at 95% LTV, albeit with no fee.</p><p></p><p>Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says the Help to Buy rates are disappointing, especially since lenders have a government guarantee behind them. \"It is worth looking beyond the scheme, especially if you can get help from the Bank of Mum &amp; Dad,\" he says.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.woolwich.co.uk/mortgages/first-time-buyer-mortgages.html\" title=\"Woolwich website\">Woolwich Family Springboard</a> allows you to buy a property with a 5% deposit, provided a family member can place a further 10% in a linked savings account. After three years the \"helper\" gets their money back, plus interest of 2% a year. The Springboard rate has just been cut from 3.99% to just 3.69%, fixed for three years and with no application fee. \"Guarantors must be aware of the risks, because their savings may be used to cover any shortfall if the buyer defaults on their loan,\" Harris says.</p><p></p><p>Lloyds' <a href=\"http://www.lloydsbank.com/mortgages/offers/lend-a-hand.asp\" title=\"Lloyds Lend a Hand mortgage\">Lend a Hand mortgage</a> is available to first-time buyers with a 5% deposit, provided a family member deposits another 20% into a savings account. The mortgage is a three-year fix at 3.34%, and Lloyds pays the saver a fixed 2.7% for three-and-a-half years.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ybs.co.uk/\" title=\"Yorkshire BS website\">Yorkshire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newbury.co.uk/\" title=\"Newbury BS website\">Newbury</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mhbs.co.uk/\" title=\"Market Harborough website\">Market Harborough</a> building societies also allow parents to offset their savings to secure a lower interest rate for their kids. \"<a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/savings/limited_access/savetobuy/introduction.htm\" title=\"Nationwide website\">Nationwide's Save to Buy scheme</a> is another option,\" says Adrian Anderson, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris. \"If you pay £50 a month into a special savings account for a minimum six months, you can borrow to 95% LTV at 5.59% for three years, with a £499 fee.\"</p><p></p><p>If you're looking at 95% of a property's value you must be aware of the risks, Anderson says. \"If house prices fall, you could quickly find yourself in negative equity, although this is only really an issue if you need to remortgage or move.\"</p><p></p><p>You should also make sure you can still afford your repayments when interest rates finally rise, as is likely in the next two or three years, Anderson adds.</p><p></p><p>Help to Buy rates should fall from January next year as more lenders launch deals, says Brian Murphy, head of lending at the <a href=\"http://www.mortgageadvicebureau.com/\" title=\"Mortgage Advice Bureau website\">Mortgage Advice Bureau</a>. Virgin Money and Santander are among those to have announced that they will offer home loans under the scheme. \"But for now, you may find a cheaper 95% LTV mortgage from regional building societies,\" Murphy says. George Osborne and David Cameron have made a big noise about Help to Buy, but for now at least small is beautiful.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421690639|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|e9ef6dcf2392b1d57f7f233605f0621bb19c08e1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The big six energy companies will on Tuesday be ordered to stop \"sitting on customers' cash\", as the government comes under pressure from Labour to deal with soaring household bills.</p><p>In an assault on overcharging by the utility companies, Greg Barker, a Tory energy minister, will demand to know why gas and electricity firms are hoarding up to £2bn from people who pay by direct debit.</p><p>He will use a meeting with company bosses to ask about reports they are making £36m a year from interest alone because many customers are paying too much when they are automatically charged an estimated amount for their gas and electricity each month.</p><p>A source close to Barker said he will demand the energy companies – British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF, E.ON and npower – declare how much consumer credit they are sitting on and how many of their customers are in credit.</p><p>On Monday night he said it was vital people who paid by direct debt were not \"being unknowingly ripped off\".</p><p>\"The better energy companies will now automatically refund your cash if you build up more money than required to meet your normal bill or will pay you interest if you are in surplus,\" he said. \"However, it looks like some companies aren't doing that and I&nbsp;am determined to get consumers a better deal and call time on the big six sitting on customers' cash.\"</p><p>It comes after the Guardian saw figures showing npower stockpiled £400m at one point last year from customers, while British Gas put £20m in \"credit balances\" into its annual account in one recent financial year.</p><p>Following those revelations, the minister will ask companies to pay interest to customers who are in surplus, following the lead of some small suppliers, including Ovo Energy, which pays 3% interest on credit balances.</p><p>Meanwhile Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has written to water companies to \"stress the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down\" for households.</p><p>He will ask the companies to consider if they need to apply the full price increases allowed by the regulator next year, which are likely to be around £12 on the average £388 annual bill. The companies are also being urged to bring in \"social tariffs\" with discounts for households who are struggling to pay.</p><p>The coalition has been searching for ways to reduce household bills after Ed Miliband attacked the government for its failure to act on the \"cost of living crisis\" and offered to freeze gas and electricity prices if he wins power in 2015.</p><p>However, Labour is likely to criticise the government for asking utility companies to change their ways on a voluntary basis, rather than forcing them with laws to treat their customers better.</p><p>\"More than two million households, over one in 10, now spend more than 5% of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe,\" said Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary. \"Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648879|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|94fde60fb32e138dc21fc29bc720453f5ee26611 -->",

        "body":"<p>Among the many lessons that parents are expected to impart on their offspring is how to manage a budget. Usually, they provide the first weekly allowance, the first piggy bank and the first trip to the bank for a savings account.</p> <p>But currently many parents of the so-called ‘millennial’ generation also face difficult decisions regarding money and their children. Among these: is it more important to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/29/retirement-savings-small-steps\">save for retirement or college</a>? Should parents push college-age kids to live within their means and attend colleges with affordable tuitions, or should kids attend their dream schools even if it means being saddled with debt for many years post-graduation?</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2013/oct/01/us-student-loans-college-planning-problems\">US college loans debt surpasses $1 trillion</a>, millennials are beginning to rethink investing in college. A <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/press/2013/20130522_MorethanhalfofMillennials\">Wells Fargo survey</a>&nbsp;of 1,414 millennials conducted this past spring revealed that 31% regret attending college and paying tuition; they believe they would have been better off working. Furthermore, 57% don’t believe that going to a more expensive and prestigious college always outweighs going to a less expensive schools.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/23/young-people-unemployment-jobs-report-answers\">millennials struggle to find their footing</a> in the financial reality of 2013, it would be easy to blame parents for not properly preparing them for the fiscal realities of being an adult. More than half of millennials say that the greatest influence on how they view money comes from their parents. About 61% would turn to their parents for financial advice; however, only 46% would describe their parents as savers.</p> <p>And so, Guardian readers, we want to hear from you.&nbsp;Millennials and parents: what financial lessons have you learned (or wish you hadn't) from each other?&nbsp;</p> <p>Fill out the following form and we’ll contact you for an ongoing project on millennial finance.

        "body":"<p><strong>In June 2012, we bought a Sharp microwave from a local retailer. It worked well until this month when it explicably seemed to cause all the power points in the kitchen to fail. We called in an electrician, who confirmed that it was the microwave that was causing the problem.</strong></p><p><strong>The next day, on the advice of the retailer, we contacted Sharp. Without hesitation the customer care assistant accepted everything I said and agreed to replace the appliance with the updated version of the same model, even though it was already four months out of guarantee.</strong></p><p><strong>We had to pay a £24 \"logistics fee\" but it was delivered just three days after the problem had first emerged. We are very impressed. </strong><em>BA, Hyde, Cheshire</em></p><p>That is indeed impressive service, so a big \"well done\" to Sharp – a firm we get very few complaints about.</p><p>Other happy readers this week include a Brabantia bin owner who had a new lid sent free of charge for an out of warranty bin. This is one of several letters we have received in praise of the firm.</p><p>Eurotunnel also won praise from a reader who received a refund of their return ticket and a free future crossing after they endured a five-hour wait to cross the channel.</p><p>Lastly, however, spare a thought for a reader, ZK, who took her MacBookPro Retina laptop back to PC World only to be told that \"if it was a day out of warranty\" they could not do anything without charge. ZK's broke down 30 days after the warranty expired.</p><p>Apple told her it would have replaced the logic board if she had bought it directly from them.  </p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannotanswer individually.

In the summer of last year I rang them to cancel the direct debit as I was getting my eyes lasered. I also needed to return the spare lenses I'd already been sent.</strong></p><p><strong>But when I went into the store in Sheffield where I had originally signed the direct debit, the staff found that something was amiss. I later got a call to say that, due to an administrative error, they had failed to debit any money from my account and I was told to contact someone at the Sheffield store. When I tried this I was told someone would get back to me, but they never did, and I assumed they must have decided that the issue wasn't worth pursuing.</strong></p><p><strong>I have had no correspondence with Specsavers since, except for regular postal reminders that my eye check is overdue, until I got a letter from a debt collector demanding £143, including extra costs.</strong></p><p><strong>I am furious with Specsavers for selling on my \"debt\" and handling this matter so badly, when I was fully prepared to arrange payment with them, in spite of this being their mistake. </strong><em>JG, Sheffield</em></p><p>Given its size we get very few complaints about Specsavers, which is just as well as we have found this firm as difficult to deal with as you. Specsavers HQ's attitude has been one of it not being its fault, even though its staff and systems appear to have failed all the way along. It claims it wrote to you several times asking for the money to be repaid, but you say these letters didn't arrive. Neither staff or head office appeared to know what the other was doing.</p><p>Eventually, after some testy exchanges and far too long a period of time for a relatively small sum, the press office finally got its act together. It has now asked Capitol Collections to waive the £15 admin fee and has reduced the debt by £50, leaving an outstanding balance of £80, which you are happy to pay. Let's hope that is the end of the matter.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p><strong>While holidaying in France our Renault Espace car broke down. We contacted the RAC, which arranged for us to be picked up and towed to a garage of its choice. The fault was identified as a broken steering pump. After several days a new one was fitted, along with the corresponding belt kit, at a cost of more than £500.</strong></p><p><strong>When we picked up the repaired car, the steering felt heavy, but we assumed the stiffness was due to the new part, which would ease after time. However, when we returned to the UK two weeks later there was still no improvement, so we took the car to our regular garage which found that non-Renault parts had been fitted. This meant the power steering was not working properly. They have said it will cost another £500 to put right.</strong></p><p><strong>I called RAC to complain and was told that someone would contact me in a few days. I had no reply. So I called and spoke to a lady who apologised profusely and said someone would definitely call me back in three days and gave me a reference, just in case. I have now contacted the RAC six times but to no avail. Can you help? </strong><em>HH, London</em></p><p>We have seen a noticeable increase in complaints about the RAC in recent months, but we are not sure this one is entirely merited. Leaving aside the fact that the (private-equity owned) recovery service failed to respond to you six times, which is very poor, we don't feel you can hold the RAC responsible for the French garage's shoddy work.</p><p>The RAC is there to recover you to a local garage in the event of a breakdown, which it did, alongside providing a replacement car and hotel. It didn't oversee the actual work and therefore cannot really be held responsible for the repairs carried out. A spokesman for the RAC confirmed as much to us.</p><p>Your dispute is with the garage in France. To complicate this story there is a suspicion that the pump may not have needed to be changed at all – it could be that just the belt had failed. Foreign travellers have long been taken advantage of by garages in this way.</p><p>Your best bet, given that you paid by credit card, is to try to make a claim against your card provider for the reasons stated in the first letter.</p><p>Alternatively, the European Consumer Centre (UKECC.net) will advise you on how to bring a cross-border claim against the garage in France, although the card option will be much the easier option.</p><p> <strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p><strong>In June 2011 my wife booked a balloon trip with a firm called Go Ballooning to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. It was cancelled, as were the next eight rebooked attempts to fly, due to adverse weather.</strong></p><p><strong>After five occasions I asked Go Ballooning if they would refund us, but it referred us to its terms and conditions which stated that we might get a partial refund after 10 attempts, at their discretion. I understand that these attempts all had to be taken in the same year to qualify – not something that was practical for two people in full-time employment. In the autumn of 2012 the firm said it would be happy to extend our vouchers to include weekends, but when my wife tried to rebook in March we found it had gone into administration.</strong></p><p><strong>As she paid by Barclaycard, we asked it to refund us the £190 cost under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. However, it has refused, saying we were unable to offer written proof that Go Ballooning had offered to extend our contract.</strong></p><p><strong>I argued that repeated bookings and cancellations were evidence of this, but it refuses to accept this. There is nothing else I can provide Barclaycard with as further proof, but believe they are being pedantic when the facts are clear. Can you help? </strong><em>IH, Feltham, Hounslow</em></p><p>Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act makes the credit card provider \"jointly and severally liable\" for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the company you are purchasing from. It means that as long as you paid for the goods or services (costing between £100 and £30,000) using your credit card, you can ask the card firm to reimburse you if you fail to get the goods or service you paid for.</p><p>This is why we keep banging on about using a credit card to pay for goods bought online – if they don't turn up, you can claim against the card provider. The trouble can be getting the card providers to honour these rules, as you and others have found.</p><p>In our view your claim had clear merit – Go Ballooning had gone bust and was in no position to honour the contract. We asked Barclaycard to re-examine your case and, having done so, it has agreed to repay you the £190 to your account as a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>Other readers take note. If you are buying anything where there is a possibility of the supplier going bust before they can supply the goods – a deposit on a used car is a good example – always use your credit card.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p>The big six energy companies will on Tuesday be ordered to stop \"sitting on customers' cash\", as the government comes under pressure from Labour to deal with soaring household bills.</p><p>In an assault on overcharging by the utility companies, Greg Barker, a Tory energy minister, will demand to know why gas and electricity firms are hoarding up to £2bn from people who pay by direct debit.</p><p>He will use a meeting with company bosses to ask about reports they are making £36m a year from interest alone because many customers are paying too much when they are automatically charged an estimated amount for their gas and electricity each month.</p><p>A source close to Barker said he will demand the energy companies – British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF, E.ON and npower – declare how much consumer credit they are sitting on and how many of their customers are in credit.</p><p>On Monday night he said it was vital people who paid by direct debt were not \"being unknowingly ripped off\".</p><p>\"The better energy companies will now automatically refund your cash if you build up more money than required to meet your normal bill or will pay you interest if you are in surplus,\" he said. \"However, it looks like some companies aren't doing that and I&nbsp;am determined to get consumers a better deal and call time on the big six sitting on customers' cash.\"</p><p>It comes after the Guardian saw figures showing npower stockpiled £400m at one point last year from customers, while British Gas put £20m in \"credit balances\" into its annual account in one recent financial year.</p><p>Following those revelations, the minister will ask companies to pay interest to customers who are in surplus, following the lead of some small suppliers, including Ovo Energy, which pays 3% interest on credit balances.</p><p>Meanwhile Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has written to water companies to \"stress the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down\" for households.</p><p>He will ask the companies to consider if they need to apply the full price increases allowed by the regulator next year, which are likely to be around £12 on the average £388 annual bill. The companies are also being urged to bring in \"social tariffs\" with discounts for households who are struggling to pay.</p><p>The coalition has been searching for ways to reduce household bills after Ed Miliband attacked the government for its failure to act on the \"cost of living crisis\" and offered to freeze gas and electricity prices if he wins power in 2015.</p><p>However, Labour is likely to criticise the government for asking utility companies to change their ways on a voluntary basis, rather than forcing them with laws to treat their customers better.</p><p>\"More than two million households, over one in 10, now spend more than 5% of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe,\" said Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary. \"Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648879|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|94fde60fb32e138dc21fc29bc720453f5ee26611 -->",

Take out £30 for 10 days, pay it back after a week and then judge us by our customers,\" he said.</p><p>His remarks came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/wonga-film-premieres-london\" title=\"\">Wonga made a film showing the positive experience of the \"silent majority\" of its customers</a>, ahead of a session in the House of Commons when MPs will question payday loan companies.</p><p>Representatives from Wonga, QuickQuid and Mr Lender – three of the biggest payday lending firms – will appear before the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee.</p><p>MPs are expected to follow up on a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which found \"deep-rooted\" problems in the way payday loans attract and treat customers.</p><p>Lenders have come under intense scrutiny from the Competition Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since the OFT report was published in September amid reports of widespread impropriety in the sector.</p><p>The committee hearing pre-empts the transferral of regulatory powers in the consumer credit market from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA on 1 Apri 2014. The new body, which came into being in April this year, has promised to strengthen protection for consumers.</p><p>It has been equipped with the power to impose unlimited fines and compel businesses to give people their money back when they have lost out due to poor treatment.</p><p>New curbs proposed by the body in October will force lenders to place \"risk warnings\" on their promotions and advertising, urging consumers to \"think\" before taking out a payday loan.</p><p>Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, will also appear before the committee on Tuesday. He welcomed the FCA's new role but said \"the government and regulators must go further to clean up the wider credit market\".</p><p>Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice Bureau, will also address the committee.</p><p>She said: \"MPs have the opportunity to hammer home some hard truths from their constituencies. The payday loan industry has boomed as people struggle to cope with the rising cost of living, but it has failed to act responsibly.</p><p>\"When I speak to MPs at the select committee, I will tell them how evidence from Citizens Advice finds that people are being given loans without any proper checks to make sure they can afford to pay them back. This sends borrowers into a spiral of debt which is very hard to get out of.</p><p>\"Some payday lenders are misusing continuous payment authorities by emptying their customers' bank accounts without prior warning – leaving them without any money to get to work, pay the bills or buy food.\"</p><p>Payday lenders have also been criticised for aggressive advertising campaigns that reportedly mislead potential consumers. In July, the FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, indicated that offending firms could face a complete advertising ban.</p><p>He said previously: \"Clearly that is an option that could be considered if it was felt that the way that advertising was being used couldn't be dealt with through any other measures short of that.\"</p><p>The MPs' intervention follows research by a government-backed body that found more than 1 million people plan to take out a payday loan to cover the cost of Christmas.</p><p>The Money Advice Service (MAS) said one in 40 (2.44%) people surveyed for its research, equating to around 1.2 million across the UK, is thinking about turning to a payday lender to fund their seasonal spending.</p><p>One-third (32%) of the 2,000 consumers questioned also said they will increase their credit card debts to pay for the festivities, while one in  11 (9%) people said they are still paying off what they owe from last Christmas.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680058|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|c0ac8b31d62d2eada5789e9313f9bc12161880c4 -->",

        "headline":"Co-op Bank scrambles to convince customers its ethical stance will survive",
        "body":"<p>The Co-operative Group was scrambling late on Monday to convince the 4.6 million customers of its banking arm that its ethical stance could survive aggressive US hedge funds taking a stake in the troubled bank.</p><p>As details of a £1.5bn rescue package were announced, the group disclosed the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, was asking questions about information it provided about its financial strength in its 2012 annual report. The bank had concluded it did not need to reissue the accounts.</p><p>About 50 of the 324 Co-op bank branches are to close and a significant number of jobs from the 10,000-strong workforce are under threat as the new management team attempts to reverse steep losses. It could take five years to make the bank profitable again after losses caused by bad lending and the merger with the Britannia building society in 2009.</p><p>The troubles at the bank are forcing the wider Co-operative Group, which owns supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, to pump £462m into the bank – equivalent to around £60 for each of the group's 7.9 million owner-members.</p><p>While this is less than the £1bn the group originally expected to stump up, it means the UK's largest mutual will own just 30% of the bank; the rest will be owned by its bondholders. Those include a group of hedge funds, led by the US-based Silver Point and Aurelius, that has forced the rewriting of a radical proposal first outlined in June, when the £1.5bn shortfall was identified.</p><p>Despite concerns that the millions of pounds being used to prop up the bank would starve the Co-op of cash to invest in its other businesses, the finance director, Richard Pennycook – part of a new management team installed in the last six months – said the alternative would have been worse.</p><p>\"We are all extremely sorry about what has happened,\" said Pennycook. \"But there is a difference between today and June. In June, if we hadn't taken this action the bank was going to go bust … the impact on the wider group would have been disastrous.\"</p><p>Bondholders including 30,000 retail investors, largely pensioners, still need to back the deal, without which the bank fears it would fall under control of the Bank of England, or could be nationalised.</p><p>In an attempt to demonstrate commitment to the ethical stance the bank has been known for since 1992, the new bank will poll its customers in the spring about the businesses it should turn away on ethical grounds. Since 1992 it has turned away £1.2bn of business, including backing for arms shipments, coalmining and cleaning products tested on animals.</p><p>But Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, warned: \"With hedge funds at the wheel, the bank will become more ruthlessly commercial. Cutting 1,000 jobs at the same time as you launch an ethics policy is quite a contradiction.\"</p><p>The bank will be able to use the Co-operative name only if it keeps an ethical stance that will be overseen by an independent director who will chair an ethics and values committee. The bank said \"customer power\" would keep it ethical.</p><p>The Co-operative Group on Monday warned its brand could be  damaged by the bank continuing to use the Co-op name. The City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and the business secretary, Vince Cable, can force the bank to change its name if the description is misleading.</p><p>The bank's constitution will be written from 15 November to force it to take account of the \"highest standards of ethical principles\" and being a \"good corporate citizen … contributing to building a stronger and sustainable society\".</p><p>It will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders unless it also considers its commitment to society and the environment. The group of hedge funds, advised by Caroline Silver of the Wall Street investment bank Moelis, and known as LT2, stressed that it was determined to maintain the ethical stance, which Silver described as a \"unique mission\".</p><p>The hedge funds will put in an extra £125m of capital in addition to their bonds. The secretive group admitted only  on Monday that it included Aurelius  – known for a long-running battle to force Argentina to pay out £800m – and Silver Point, linked to troubled financial firms such as Lehman Brothers. Others, including Beach Point Capital Management, Caspian Capital, Canyon Capital Advisors and Monarch Alternative Capital, then stepped forward.</p><p>Euan Sutherland, who arrived from B&amp;Q to run the Co-op in May, refused to criticise the hedge funds, describing them as \"very economically rational people\" who were investing in the bank because they believed it could become profitable again. He said the bank had lost its way over the previous five years, during which it had expanded rapidly, merging with the Britannia and then attempting the audacious but ill-fated takeover of more than 600 so-called Verde branches <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/coop-pulls-out-talks-buy-lloyds-bank-branches\" title=\"\">from Lloyds Banking Group, in a move that would have given the Co-op a 1,000-strong network</a>.</p><p>Under Niall Booker, who also joined in May, the bank's high-street presence will shrink. At least 15% of the 324 branches are to be shut, and £500m ploughed into investing in IT systems that previous management neglected.</p><p></p><p>Sutherland said it was his idea for Co-op Group would use £130m of the £462m it is pumping into the bank to issue new bonds to some 30,000 private investors who would otherwise have been wiped out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421599156|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|eb55867797c78e234b31845ee92642abac06ab1d -->",

        "headline":"Single parents bear brunt of benefits changes, charities warn",
        "body":"<p>Single parents with already stretched finances are bearing the brunt of government changes to benefits, charities have warned, when many are already struggling with huge increases to household bills. \"Among our clients single parents have the highest levels of rent, council tax and water arrears,\" says Ed Ware for debt charity StepChange. \"The pressure on household finances can be acute, with energy bills now a big worry despite these parents already facing substantial difficulties balancing the rising cost of living with childcare, all on just one income.\" Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that single-parent households make up a quarter of the total number of householdsin England and Wales.</p><p>The Labour government attempted to improve the finances of the 1.9 million single parent families through a raft of measures in its 1997 \"family-first\" budget, which included the New Deal for Lone Parents scheme to help people back into work. However, the coalition government has declared that once a single parent's youngest child turns five, they are no longer entitled to income support and must seek work or take up a job, or face having their benefits dramatically cut. But single parents say the obstacles they face to finding work with childcare and flexible working demands have not changed.</p><p>Dee Hathaway, 37, is mum to Jude, five, and earns around £400 a month working part-time for a nursery. She says her greatest financial strain comes from funding childcare during school holidays when the nursery she works at remains open. \"It costs me around £400 upfront – my monthly salary – to put Jude into a holiday club for a month, meaning summer holidays can be a financial nightmare,\" she says. \"I might resort to candles if gas and electricity goes up any more.\"</p><p>She claims tax credits, housing and council tax benefit and working tax credits, which will be replaced by a single payment through the universal credit. While she would like to take a training course offered by her employer and increase her hours, this would see her financially worse off due to the current benefits system: \"I'd be worse off by between £50 to £100 a month because of benefit cuts, which is crazy.\"</p><p></p><h2><strong>Universal credit</strong></h2><p>Charities say changes to benefits fail to honour the government's pledge to \"make work pay\" for single parents.Universal credit, which is being rolled out across the country, is set to gradually replace six means-tested benefits by 2017. But calculations from the charity Gingerbread show that on average, single parents working on the minimum wage will lose just over £200 a year under the scheme compared with the current system.</p><p>As part of the changes, parents who receive help towards childcare through tax credits will receive up to 85% of these costs under universal credit. But those earning less than £10,000 a year – the threshold for paying income tax – will receive only 70% towards their childcare costs. A Gingerbread spokesman says: \"Work has to be a route out of poverty for single parents, but we've found that under universal credit, not only will they lose out on average, they will also struggle to increase their income by taking on extra hours. The government must ensure single-parent families get the financial support they need to enter and progress in work – and with a delay in the roll-out of universal credit there's now time to make that happen.\"</p><h2><strong>Childcare voucher scheme</strong></h2><p>For families not claiming universal credit or working tax credit the government has said that it will phase out the employer-supported childcare voucher scheme and replace it with a tax-free \"voucher\" of up to £1,200 a year per child that can be claimed online. Unlike the current system, this will be available to all working parents rather than dependent on whether their employer offers a scheme.</p><p>Anand Shukla, chief executive of charity Family and Childcare Trust, says: \"The proposed tax-free childcare scheme provides additional welcome financial support for childcare costs, but there are major question marks over the proposed distribution of this funding. Support is increased for those on higher incomes but is not extended to the poorest working parents, who are more likely to be single parents.\"</p><p>The new scheme will enable working parents, including the self-employed, earning up to £150,000 each to claim back 20% of the first £6,000 of childcare costs per child, which, according to the government, is the average annual price of a childcare place. Shukla says: \"As tax free childcare will be limited to 20% of costs, a parent would need to spend £6,000 to be eligible for the full amount, so few families will actually receive £1,200 per child.\"</p><p>The system, which is expected to be implemented in autumn 2015, will initially apply to children up to five years old, but will be extended over time to include those up to the age of 12 years.</p><p>The vouchers can also only be used to pay for childcare registered with Ofsted in England, and the equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some parents may have to decide between extra cash in their pockets and retaining their non-registered child carer, who may be a friend or family member. Parents will have to register online with a voucher company and pay into an account; for every £8 paid in, the government will add £2, up to a maximum £1,200 a year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421471631|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|23d8837c26a576d183ba1c1ad63f0e000838e88e -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>In June 2011 my wife booked a balloon trip with a firm called Go Ballooning to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. It was cancelled, as were the next eight rebooked attempts to fly, due to adverse weather.</strong></p><p><strong>After five occasions I asked Go Ballooning if they would refund us, but it referred us to its terms and conditions which stated that we might get a partial refund after 10 attempts, at their discretion. I understand that these attempts all had to be taken in the same year to qualify – not something that was practical for two people in full-time employment. In the autumn of 2012 the firm said it would be happy to extend our vouchers to include weekends, but when my wife tried to rebook in March we found it had gone into administration.</strong></p><p><strong>As she paid by Barclaycard, we asked it to refund us the £190 cost under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. However, it has refused, saying we were unable to offer written proof that Go Ballooning had offered to extend our contract.</strong></p><p><strong>I argued that repeated bookings and cancellations were evidence of this, but it refuses to accept this. There is nothing else I can provide Barclaycard with as further proof, but believe they are being pedantic when the facts are clear. Can you help? </strong><em>IH, Feltham, Hounslow</em></p><p>Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act makes the credit card provider \"jointly and severally liable\" for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the company you are purchasing from. It means that as long as you paid for the goods or services (costing between £100 and £30,000) using your credit card, you can ask the card firm to reimburse you if you fail to get the goods or service you paid for.</p><p>This is why we keep banging on about using a credit card to pay for goods bought online – if they don't turn up, you can claim against the card provider. The trouble can be getting the card providers to honour these rules, as you and others have found.</p><p>In our view your claim had clear merit – Go Ballooning had gone bust and was in no position to honour the contract. We asked Barclaycard to re-examine your case and, having done so, it has agreed to repay you the £190 to your account as a gesture of goodwill.</p><p>Other readers take note. If you are buying anything where there is a possibility of the supplier going bust before they can supply the goods – a deposit on a used car is a good example – always use your credit card.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p>It is very concerning that some women are discriminated against at work because they choose to have children, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has said.</p><p>Mark Hammond said bias against pregnant women or those returning to work after maternity leave \"needs to be tackled\". Launching a new EHRC research project, Hammond vowed to uncover the extent of the problem.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that some pregnant women experience prejudice while on maternity leave or on their return to work, an ECHR spokesman said.</p><p>The review will examine pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the workplace. Experts will investigate employers' treatment of workers who are pregnant or on maternity leave, and these employees' experiences.</p><p>Hammond said: \"It is very concerning that in 2013 a number of women are still being disadvantaged in the workplace just because they are pregnant. That would be unlawful discrimination and needs to be tackled.</p><p>\"We will look at existing research, gather new evidence and carry out our expert analysis to establish the extent of the problem and advise on how best it can to be addressed.\"</p><p>Rosalind Bragg, director of charity Maternity Action, said: \"It is important that the government does not weaken the law on pregnancy discrimination but instead focuses on employer compliance. The principles of non-discrimination were established decades ago and should be accepted as an essential part of the business environment.</p><p>\"Since the economic downturn began, pregnant women and new mothers have faced an increasingly difficult time in the workplace. Unfair and unlawful treatment of new mothers is widespread and action is urgently needed. Pregnancy discrimination imposes major costs on new families at a time when they are least able to handle additional financial stress.\"</p><p>Kiran Daurka, an employment lawyer at Slater &amp; Gordon, said: \"Mothers, whether expecting children or returning to work, are a vital part of Britain's workforce. We need to treat them better. We are delighted to hear that the EHRC is to undertake some very important and much needed work around maternity discrimination.</p><p>\"Following our own findings over the summer, which revealed that more than a quarter of mothers feel discriminated against, it is clear that urgent action is needed to protect pregnant employees and those returning from maternity leave.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421574658|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|bdb09ee9b29febbcb7cce8dace45f023a946c568 -->",

        "body":"<p>As energy bills soar again and wages fall behind inflation Britain is in the grip of a cost of living crisis. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the average household is now able to save just £5.20 a week, or £270.40 a year. Those on the lowest incomes are saving nothing, while those on middle incomes are raiding their savings to pay their monthly bills.</p><p>Analysis by Which? has found that one in five households has no savings, and that only 26% of us are saving regularly. Part of the problem, according to Which?, is that interest rates are so low few households feel there is much incentive to put money aside.</p><p>Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: \"Our research paints a worrying picture of consumers vulnerable to financial shocks and unable save for retirement, with the rising cost of living forcing them to dip into their savings to pay for essentials like food and bills. We want the regulator to take real action to help savers to get the best deal out of the savings market, rather than leaving billions of pounds languishing in accounts paying poor levels of interest.\"</p><p>So how do people manage to save? Guardian Money conducted in-depth interviews with five families and individuals, asking how much they earn, how much they are able to put aside, and what they go without to be able to save. The stories reveal how even relatively high earners find it difficult to build up long-term savings balances, although we also found that it can be the people on the lowest incomes who are the most budget-concious and who put aside cash for a rainy day.</p><p>The most important lesson? If you want to save, set up a direct debit that takes money from your account as soon as you are paid and don't even give yourself a chance to spend it. </p><h2>'We're on £65,000 a year but only save £100 a month, which soon  gets spent'</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421466153'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2009/5/8/1241783349420/DIY-001.jpg' alt='DIY' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Frank Baron</figcaption></figure><p><strong> Vicky, 35, is an accountant earning £25,000. Her partner, 38, is an online marketing manager on £40,000. They have a one-year-old son and live in  London.</strong></p><p>We try to save regularly but we haven't managed to set aside as much as usual in the past year as I have been on maternity leave, so things are tight.</p><p>We save £100 a month. It is our emergency fund – we use it to pay for any DIY and repairs around the house. We bought a house last year and are slowly trying to add our own mark to it. If there's enough left over after all that, we use the money to pay for a holiday once a year. That's unlikely at the moment. We've just cleared out our savings – about £500 – to pay for some bits and pieces for the house.</p><p>We also set aside £50 a month in a junior Isa. That is topped up with any money he gets for his birthday, Christmas and general hand-outs from grandparents – we're lucky to have a generous family around us. We've saved £1,600 so far. That is for when he is older – hopefully to pay for university, if that is what he wants.</p><p>I definitely think folk spend money unnecessarily, but then I'm pretty tight. I'd rather save into our son's Isa then buy him unnecessary treats and toys. Some mummies buy any (and sometimes it seems every) piece of plastic rubbish going for their kids. It's not cheap and gets the attention of the child for two minutes. I've even heard some admit it is that they like to buy it, rather than because the child needs it.</p><p>It would be nice to be able to save more but the mortgage is our killer expense. That costs us so much each month that savings are relegated to what is left in the pot afterwards. </p><h2>'I got rid of the car so I could save'</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421466154'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/16/1353089464336/Bride-and-bridegroom-figu-010.jpg' alt='Bride and bridegroom figurines on a wedding cake' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Image Source/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Laura-Jayne, 23, works in sales support for a telecommunications company earning £16,000 a year.

It means we are really having to tighten our belts, but it will be worth it in the end when we have a beautiful wedding day.</p><p>We started off saving each month so that we could buy a house. We've done that and it was nice to see what saving could achieve, so we carried on and started saving for a wedding.</p><p>In order to keep it up we have direct debits to take money straight from both our accounts at the start of the month. That way, if we don't see the money, we can't spend it.</p><p>We've made some big sacrifices so we can keep saving so much. I sold my brand new car because I simply couldn't afford the mortgage, the car and to save. It was a wrench, but my wedding is simply more important than a car.</p><p>Becoming a saver has been a big change for me. I always used to be the type of person for whom money just burned a hole in my pocket.</p><p>I loved spending, but now I love having the security of savings, and feel a lot less inclined to spend money frivolously.</p><p>Once we're married, I aim to continue saving, just maybe not quite so much each month. </p><h2>I only earn £12,000 but  am careful  and can save regularly</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421466155'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/18/1326909711102/A-discount-sign-in-a-shop-007.jpg' alt='A discount sign in a shop' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong> Claire, 35, is a teaching assistant earning £12,000.

When I met my husband he was a spender rather than a saver and had built up some hefty debts. But, thanks to my savings, I was able to pay off his debts when we got married, then I started getting him to save, too.</p><p>We have several accounts. I have a standard savings account where I place any money that is given to us as gifts. That has a balance of £6,000. This is for our next house, which I hope will be our forever home. I'd rather spend the bare minimum on our current house and have money to make our next home just right.</p><p>We also both have Isas. We save £50 a month into each. My Isa has been going for 14 years and has a balance of around £7,000. This is the rainy-day fund, there to give us a safety net should anything break or go wrong.</p><p>My husband's Isa has several thousand pounds in it, but that's his business contingency fund.</p><p>He set up on his own six months ago so that money is there to cover slow months as he gets himself up and running.</p><p>Saving is hard work and we do have to make cutbacks. I'm a naturally frugal person and know where to make cutbacks. For example, I go to discount supermarkets to buy the cupboard essentials and use the money I've save there to be able to buy better quality meat.</p><p>As a family we aren't flash with our cash, but I don't think we are missing out on anything. I work in a private school and get to see the small children with laptops and iPads. Our daughter is no less happy for not having the latest gadgets.</p><p>Love is about a lot more than giving your child material things. We're saving so she'll have a brighter future.  </p><h2>'Our total savings are  just £3,000'</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421466156'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/5/30/1275239255965/A-pregnant-woman-006.jpg' alt='A pregnant woman' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Laura, 28, lives in Brighton with her husband, 32, and their three-month-old son. She is on maternity leave from the council's youth service where she earns £20,000. Her husband is the head of operations for a food company earning £20,000 a year.</strong></p><p>Our aim is to save at least £100 a month but, if I'm honest, we don't always manage that. Sometimes we save a lot less and sometimes we manage to set aside a little bit more. We do have a rough budget that we try to stick to each month, but there is flexibility within that. We make sure we allow ourselves some treats, such as a nice meal out from time to time. So far we've managed to save £3,000.</p><p>Sometimes it is difficult to find that extra cash to set aside – especially now, when I am only getting maternity pay – but we think it is important, even though it is often more appealing to spend on various nice things.</p><p>We look for the best deals on everything and if it is a big purchase we make sure we shop around. Now we're always on the lookout for nappy deals.</p><p>We've always been savers – we saved to buy our first house, then once we had bought it we just carried on. Now we have our son we feel it is really important, and it allows us to treat ourselves. For example, we're heading off to Spain for a holiday soon. That would have been hard to do while on maternity leave without our savings. </p><h2>'We are in  our 30s but  have been  able to save £60,000'</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421466157'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2007/10/25/NestEgg472.jpg' alt='Nest egg with golden eggs' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Nation Wong/Zefa/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Jono, 34, is a web designer. He lives in London with his wife, 37, and their two-year-old son. They have a combined income of £80,000.</strong></p><p>We manage to save £500–£1,000 a month, although sometimes less. How much depends on what is happening that month. If we have a big expense, like a buying a flight for a family holiday, or having to replace some furniture,  it will be right at the bottom end and we'll more or less be paying off the credit cards.</p><p>We started saving when our son was born. We opened an account with an online investment management firm, Nutmeg. We only invest around £50 a month but, from the projection, we see that could come out as a sizeable sum when he is 18 – the account is already worth £15,000 thanks to some extra transfers from our other accounts.</p><p>The money we set aside for him is instead of paying for life insurance for me and my wife. A basic policy would have cost about £50 a month, but as we're both healthy and have supportive families should something happen, we decided to save the money instead. It's a risk, but it feels better to have that as a credit towards our son, rather than an expense.</p><p>We put the rest of our savings towards filling our Isa allowances as best we can. So far we've managed to build up a £60,000 nest egg.</p><p>Saving is definitely a priority as we need to make sure we can support ourselves and our family in the future, especially if we have another child. Nursery costs are significant in London.</p><p>We try to spend on experiences we will remember, rather than things that will be used up or break.</p><p>So we do without some interior decorating and tech upgrades we might like in order to save and spend our money on things that may make us happier in the long run.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421307718|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|767405d3700f25e53f835a94e459564599cedb44 -->",

        "headline":"HS2 … the high-speed train route with the same old staggering fares",
        "body":"<p>The government says its proposals for High Speed 2 \"assume a fares structure in line with that of the existing railway\". So we can probably expect to fork out an absurd sum for a ticket unless we trawl through websites three months in advance, can be absolutely certain we are going to travel on the 3.42pm on a Tuesday afternoon, and we craftily split the journey half way to Manchester. Get any stage wrong and the inspector will haul you off the train and land you with a huge fine.</p><p>It is remarkable that in the debate on HS2 so little has been said about fares. Will taxpayers be expected to pump billions upon billions into a Mitterrand-style <em>Grand Projet</em> then find it's out of the reach of anybody other than swish executives on expense accounts? The omens, despite the government's reassurances, aren't good.</p><p>Take the prices for travelling on our only existing high-speed track, HS1, that whizzes through the Kent countryside. If you live in Ashford, the opening of the line promised a huge improvement in train times into the capital. Sure enough, it now takes just 35 minutes into London St Pancras compared to the 61 minutes it takes on the former route into London Victoria.</p><p>But at what cost? A season ticket for commuters from Ashford to a London terminal using the old route, plus an onward journey on the tube, costs £4,996 a year. That's a pretty staggering sum for a 54-mile journey (about the same as London to Brighton). But if you want to take the HS1 trains, and save half an hour, the cost rises to £6,360. A commuter paying 40% tax has to earn £10,600 a year just to pay to get into work (oh, and there's a £700 to £900 a year bill to park at the station).</p><p>The Ashford example suggests that using HS1 costs 27% more than the fare structure of the existing railway, which I think we can rely on as a better indicator of what fares will be like on HS2 than what the politicians are telling us. The – so far – lacklustre economic gains that HS1 has brought to north Kent should also deflate some of the more ambitious claims about the impact of HS2 on northern cities. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21588409-faster-train-service-has-been-good-londonless-so-elsewhere-slow-start\" title=\"\">An analysis in the Economist</a> this week suggests HS1 has brought benefits for London, but little elsewhere.</p><p>What the Ashford example also highlights is how the price of season tickets in the UK remains a national disgrace. The last in-depth study that compared train prices across Europe was in 2009, but Passenger Focus, which commissioned the research, tells me the pattern of prices remains the same. It found that a long-distance commuter in the UK typically paid more than £3,100 a year in 2009, and no doubt much more today: Brighton to London is £3,500-£3,800 a year, while Tunbridge Wells to London is £4,130 to £4,750, depending on whether you need an onward Underground journey.</p><p>Now compare that with our continental cousins. The Netherlands is a pretty similar country to the commuting areas of the south-east of the UK – densely populated, expensive land, high wages – yet long-distance commuters there pay an average of £2,000 a year. Germany comes in at around £1,600 a year, while in Italy it is astonishingly cheap – around £700 a year for the sort of journey which in Britain costs five times as much. Here, travellers are paying business class fares for a budget airline service.</p><p>Of course HS2 is not about providing a new route for commuters, but its proponents partly rely on arguments about relieving congested commuter routes to justify the enormous cost of the project. Maybe the case for expanding capacity, rather than the minutes it will shave off journey times, will eventually result in a green light for HS2. But, to me, it carries the whiff of Concorde – a huge national project beloved of politicians, but underwritten by taxpayers, to allow rich people to get from A to B more quickly. If we are going to tax nurses, plumbers and bank clerks to pay for HS2, can we at least have some concrete guarantees they will actually be able to afford to travel on it? And not just on a wet afternoon in February.</p><p> </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421393707|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|de8bf8355f3f8ca098f87ba39b8ffdaad1ac9e81 -->",

        "body":"<p>If you are a typical supermarket shopper, chances are this weekend you will pop a bottle of wine into your trolley – and it will almost certainly be on discount and quite likely even half price. Nine in 10 of the bottles of wine we drink in the UK are bought from the major supermarket chains, and 60% of those are on discount. But are the half-price or two-for-a-tenner deals genuine?</p><p>Guardian Money asked mySupermarket.co.uk, which compares prices at all the major chains, to track the pricing on some of the major wine brands sold by the supermarkets over the past year – and found an extraordinary zig-zag pattern where prices are \"established\" at what critics say are artificially high levels to meet legal requirements, then cut to give shoppers the impression they are obtaining a bargain.</p><p>We also talked to industry insiders – including the former head of wine at Sainsbury's, who says many of the promotions are manufactured. Shoppers, he says, are being told a £5 bottle is \"half price\" when it was never worth £10. We found that even after a \"half price\" reduction, shoppers are sometimes paying more than they were being charged just a few months earlier.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454748'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383309698591/Tesco2-001.jpg' alt='Tesco2' width='220' height='287' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Take Tesco's Ogio Pinot Grigio, one of the supermarket's top selling wines. This weekend it is on sale at £5.49, marketed as half price, down from £10.99. The figures from mySupermarket show that Tesco priced the wine at £10.99 for just 63 out of the last 365 days. Indeed, for almost the same length of time – 58 days – the Ogio Pinot Grigio was on sale at Tesco for £4.99. Buyers of the \"half price\" wine this weekend are actually paying 50p more than they were in July this year.</p><p>Hardy's Legacy Shiraz at Tesco is another wine with extraordinary price movements. This weekend it is on half-price offer at £4.99, down from £9.99. It has jigged up and down from £9.99 to £4.99 several times over the past year, and in March was selling for just £4.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454745'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383310517857/Sainsbury-001.jpg' alt='Sainsbury' width='220' height='287' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's a similar picture at Sainsbury's, where we tracked the price of its Mondelli and Montepulciano wines. This weekend it is marketing Toretta de Mondelli Pinot Grigio as \"Save 33%, was £7.99 now £5.32\". But it has only been priced at £7.99 for 16 days out of the last 365, according to the mySupermarket data. For 148 days out of the past year, and as recently as 23 September, Sainsbury's priced the same bottle at £4.99. Buyers this weekend, although getting a third off the most recent price, are paying 33p more than they were for much of the past year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454746'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383310386691/Asda-001.jpg' alt='Asda' width='220' height='287' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Asda, which coined the slogan \"Always Low Prices\", also hikes and drops wine prices. It is telling shoppers this weekend that its Campo Viejo wine is on \"Rollback\" at just £6, down from £8.50. But at the start of the year it was £5, and has traded at £8.50 for just 85 days in the past year. Much of the rest of the time it has been at £5, £6 or £8.28. And if you are thinking about buying some Jacobs Creek wine at the store this weekend, currently priced at £7.50, you might want to hold off. Asda's Jacobs Creek Pinot Grigio has been £5 or £7.50 all year; given that it has spent October priced at £7.50, shoppers can perhaps expect it to be back at £5 pretty soon.</p><p>There is no suggestion the supermarkets are breaking any laws on price promotions. They meticulously stick to the rules on \"price establishment\" before they launch a cut-price deal. But critics say the half-price deals lure consumers into thinking they are receiving a bargain when it's nothing of the sort.</p><p>Allan Cheeseman joined Sainsbury's as a wine buyer in 1971 – when it was selling 76,000 bottles a week – and became its director of wine in 2000, by which time 3.5m bottles were passing through the tills. But since leaving the supermarket and becoming an industry consultant, he has spilled the pinot on pricing practices. He says: \"Some of the half-price offers at the supermarkets are blatantly manufactured. You will see a Mondelli or an Ogio on sale for a very high price for a period of time, then discounted massively. But I know what the supermarkets paid in the first place. The problem is that as a nation we have become promotion junkies.\"</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/supermarket-wine-oz-clarke\" title=\"\">BBC Watchdog</a> programme aired in October found similar pricing issues to those highlighted by Guardian Money. Wine writer and broadcaster Oz Clarke said: \"The truth is that the only way to make a profit out of the wines they sell so much of, is if the wine was never worth more than £5 in the first place.\"</p><p>Ted Sandbach, founder of independent wine distributor the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk\" title=\"\">Oxford Wine Company</a>, claims to have seen cynical pricing practices at first hand. \"I saw it on a trip to Australia with the wine buyer from one of the big supermarkets. The winemaker had a lot to offload, so the supermarket created a brand – the sort of thing that is labelled 'Crocodile Dundee' or the like – and priced it at £9.99 in some of its stores, then reduced it to a 'half price' £4.99, but still made a whacking big profit. Some people might call this clever marketing. I call it downright cheating.\"</p><p>We showed the mySupermarket data to the major supermarket chains and asked them to justify the zig-zag in wine pricing. Why does wine move up and down in price so much, given it's not seasonal produce, like fruit or vegetables? Are shoppers right to suspect that the supermarkets are cynically establishing prices at a high level only to manufacture half-price deals later?</p><p>Few answered the questions directly. In a statement Tesco said: \"Customers have repeatedly told us they really enjoy the variety and great value our wine selection offers, and both the Ogio and Hardy's wines are extremely popular. Our half-price wine offers remain popular, indicating customers are satisfied with both the quality and value for money.\"</p><p>Asda said: \"As Britain's lowest price supermarket our simple aim is always to offer the lowest prices for the longest,\" while Sainsbury's said: \"Wine prices are highly dependent on factors that vary – from harvest yields to transport costs and duties. We work hard to mitigate these and keep prices down, including offering price reductions and promotions whenever possible.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421454747'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383310445885/Waitrose-001.jpg' alt='Waitrose' width='220' height='287' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Waitrose challenged the suggestion that its wine deals may not be genuine. To be fair to Waitrose, when Guardian Money went in search of wine promotion and deals at the retailer, it had fewer on offer than the other big chains. We picked the Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Chardonnay, on offer this weekend at £7.99, down from £9.99. As recently as mid-July, Waitrose was selling it for £7.49, and in April it cost £6.29, according to mySupermarket.</p><p>Waitrose disputed the figures, saying the mySupermarket prices did not align with its own records on 10 days out of the last 365. A spokeswoman said: \"This wine has been promoted three times in the last year and has been off promotion for 79% of the time … We believe one promotion every four months to be a good frequency and the wine offers real value at both its full selling price and promotional price. The price has been £9.99 for 127 days since May this year, which is not a short period increase. Costs from suppliers are confidential but it is worth noting that since the previous increase to £8.49 in June 2011 there have been two increases in duty.\"</p><p>Guardian Money did not cover Morrisons because mySupermarket obtains its data from supermarket delivery websites, and Morrisons does not offer an online buying service. Aldi does feature on mySupermarket, but doesn't use promotions to sell its wine. While we counted 73 wines in Tesco on some sort of deal, Aldi has none (although Aldi's three Pinot Grigios, at £3.99 to £4.39, are all priced lower than Tesco's cheapest deal).</p><p>We also shared our findings with Stella Creasy MP, the shadow consumer affairs minister. She said everyone loved a good deal, but it was clear some retailers were \"moving the goalposts\" in providing the information people need to help them choose.</p><p>\"We want supermarkets to compete to be the best at quality and value, not confusion and sleight of hand when it comes to marking up prices. Just as we've seen in other markets, such as those around the sale of furniture, there are lessons to be learned about how to ensure consumers have more information about just how good a bargain they are really getting before they fill their trolleys, so that they don't end up paying over the odds.\"</p><p>Not every supermarket wine offer should be treated with suspicion. In some cases, even the cynics say you should jump at the deal. Sandbach says he has found Moet &amp; Chandon on sale in Tesco at a lower price than he is offered by Moet as a wholesaler, while Cheeseman says wine quality has improved massively since the cheap plonk of the early 1970s, and that a lot of sub-£5 wines represent incredible value. \"It's actually quite difficult to buy a bad wine these days,\" he says.</p><p>But the days of a decent £5 wine are numbered, he claims, as on a £5 bottle of wine, £2 is duty and £1 is VAT. Once transport costs and the supermarket's mark-up are included, as little as 50p may be going to the vineyard. \"It's the £8-£10 market that is growing now. The three-for-£10 or under-£5 wines aren't going to be there,\"<strong> </strong>Cheeseman says.</p><p>Sandbach adds: \"In a £4.99 wine, only a few pence are going to the producer. But in a £7.99 wine, a lot more goes to the producer, and you are buying a much higher quality wine.\" As an independent retailer, he asks: \"Why do suppliers allow their product to be torn apart by constant promotions?\"</p><p>The answer may be that it won't happen for much longer, according to Cheeseman, who says the big producers are beginning to turn their noses up at the British supermarkets.</p><p>\"You can go to Castel [France's largest wine producer] and their turnover is more than the entire UK wine market,\" he says. \"A British supermarket might say, we are very important and we sell four million bottles a week, but globally Britain is slipping down the wine buying league. The suppliers are beginning to turn their back on the UK because of our arrogance and pricing.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421391970|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|7013df7454b912d5ad4f39ad2d9b58f1ffcdc1a9 -->",

        "headline":"Lloyds bank jumps on the cashback bandwagon",
        "body":"<p>Lloyds is the latest bank to jump on the cashback bandwagon, with a scheme allowing its current account holders to earn back up to 15% of what they spend. In particular it may appeal to those who do their weekly shop at Morrisons or Ocado, or could be tempted to use them.</p><p>Britain's high street banks are jockeying for position following the launch in September of new current account switching rules, and have clearly decided that cashback is one of the best perks when it comes to keeping hold of existing customers and winning new ones.</p><p>Lloyds bank's move comes weeks after Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest and Halifax launched cashback schemes. They may have been influenced by Santander, which has enjoyed huge success with its 123 current account, where customers get cashback on their household bills.</p><h2><strong>Lloyds bank</strong></h2><p>Lloyds will launch its scheme, called Everyday Offers, later this month, allowing its millions of current account customers to earn on spending at selected retailers. This initiative – similar to one launched by the Halifax in August – will let people earn back between 5% and 15% when they shop at retailers ranging from Morrisons and Ocado to Homebase and Argos.</p><p>There are 18 retailers on the list so far, and by the end of this month, customers will start to see the offers  appear when they do their online banking. However, some of the details as to who will be offered which deals are sketchy. Offers will be tailored to individuals, so not every customer will receive the same offer from the same retailer.</p><p>Customers will have to activate their offer, which will have an expiry date. Once they do that, they will earn cashback on that transaction by using their debit or credit card. This money will be paid into their current account at the end of the following month. While each offer will have its own terms and conditions, the good news is that it appears that, to start with at least, there will be no cap on the cashback that can be earned per transaction. To take part customers have to be registered for internet banking. \"As long as they use their debit card, we expect that they'll see a number of different offers each month,\" says a spokeswoman.</p><p>Lloyds bank is also launching a lottery-style scheme called It's On Us, available to everyone who has registered for Everyday Offers, where it will randomly select transactions that will be repaid to people's current accounts. One thousand purchases a week will be repaid, up to a value of £500.</p><h2><strong>Halifax</strong></h2><p>Halifax<strong> </strong>is part of the Lloyds banking group. It has launched a scheme for its current account holders called Cashback Extras, which offers payments of between 5% and 15% on purchases made using debit and credit cards at selected retailers. Its partners also include Morrisons, Ocado, Homebase and Argos.</p><p>The bank said customers could make more than £100 a year \"simply by buying the things they already spend money on\".</p><h2><strong>RBS/NatWest</strong></h2><p>The banks recently launched the Cashback Plus Loyalty Programme. This offers 1% cashback on debit card purchases at a selection of retailers, including BP petrol stations and cinema chain Cineworld, and the banks said more than 12 million existing customers, plus any new people switching, are able to earn rewards.</p><p>As a launch offer, NatWest and RBS customers can earn 1% back on debit card spend in Tesco stores until the end of June 2014. The bank was quick to emphasise that this offer \"is provided direct from RBS/NatWest and is not in any way endorsed, sponsored, sold or promoted by Tesco, or otherwise implemented with Tesco's co-operation\".</p><p>A bank spokeswoman recently revealed that one NatWest customer spent £2,299 at jeweller H Samuel on a diamond ring for his wife, and received £229 cashback. \"He chose to partially trade up the rewards and more than doubled their value on eight Cineworld tickets. For £20 in rewards he received £56 worth of cinema tickets, still leaving £209 in rewards left to spend.\"</p><p>Customers need to register online to take part.

        "body":"<p><strong>I won an iPad in a design competition and decided to sell it to raise funds for my wedding, and we did so on 30&nbsp;June using eBay. </strong></p><p><strong>We dispatched the item to the buyer using special delivery, insured to the value of £500, and the receipt we were given by Royal Mail shows the weight of the item as 1.491kg. However, the buyer opened a case against us stating that we had sent him an empty box.</strong></p><p><strong>Royal Mail said that it would investigate if the packaging was sent back for examination. At first the buyer was fine with this; then after a variety of excuses he said he would only comply if we gave him a full refund. This we were reluctant to do before Royal Mail had had a chance to investigate.</strong></p><p><strong>Ebay asked us to send proof of identity, proof of address and proof of postage. This we duly did, but the next day we heard from eBay that it had given the buyer a full refund because he had been to the police and&nbsp;obtained a crime report (he hadn't, he had been to Action Fraud and got a reference number, which anyone can do without supporting evidence). </strong></p><p><strong>In total we have requested 13 times via email for the buyer to send the packaging back and eBay and Royal Mail have made direct requests, which he has ignored. We appealed against eBay's ruling in his favour and this has been rejected, because the buyer has an Action Fraud number. </strong></p><p><strong>I called the buyer myself to try to reason with him and he told me that he is a business that buys and sells iPads, whereas in our original correspondence he said he bought the iPad for his brother's birthday. </strong></p><p><strong>We have provided eBay with everything it has asked us for, whereas it seems the buyer has provided nothing but an Action Fraud number. The £362 was supposed to pay for my wedding dress and is now gone. </strong><em>VC, Colchester, Essex</em></p><p></p><p>Despite eBay's reassuring FAQ's on seller protection it would seem that not the slightest effort was made to investigate your case properly. Nor do my attempts to stir it into action have any effect. Five weeks after I raise your issues it responds lamely that sellers should use a tracked, insured delivery service (you did) and that the buyer had provided \"evidence\" in the form of a police report (he hadn't).</p><p>The fact that your proof of postage shows that the parcel weighed considerably more than an empty box, and that the buyer has refused to cooperate in the dispute resolution process, appears irrelevant to eBay.</p><p>When I point this out there's a sudden last-minute change of heart. 'It is clear we did not live up to our usual high standards,' says the same spokesman.</p><p>He explains awaiting third-party investigations from delivery companies would take too long, but that if you submit a police report about your loss eBay will bear the cost of the fiasco.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto: your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "body":"<h2><strong>How can I spur my unemployed partner out of his apathy?</strong></h2><p><strong>My partner has been unemployed for nine months and his apathy towards job hunting is driving me mad. How can I spur him on? I am convinced that in this climate he needs to do more than just apply for advertised posts on job websites, but for reasons I cannot understand he is reluctant to do anything beyond this, such as get unpaid work experience or network with professional or academic contacts.</strong></p><p><strong>He took voluntary redundancy in 2011 and returned to university, graduating with a master's in IT in January, and hopes to become a website designer for a firm. However, he has not had one interview and while his outlook has gone from unrealistic optimism to concern, he still refuses to take those extra steps.</strong></p><p><strong>Suggestions from me descend into arguments, with him feeling accused of not doing enough – which is probably fair. He does lack confidence, which I think is a factor.</strong></p><p><strong>He received a good redundancy payout so will be OK financially for another six months. I have tried taking a backseat to let him beat his own path, but the search grinds to a halt. I don't want to be his job counsellor; I just want him to put in the effort needed so we can get on with our lives.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>I think it unlikely that your partner's reluctance to pull out all the stops is caused simply by apathy or laziness. I suspect it's something more complicated; not necessarily more admirable, but maybe a bit more manageable.</p><p>I think he finds failure extremely painful; failure challenges his self-belief and disturbs his vanity. You say that when he first started looking for a job, armed with his new master's in IT, his outlook was one of unrealistic optimism – but he then met nothing but rejection. To a more realistic person, early disappointment would have come as no surprise; to him it may have come as a serious shock.</p><p>There are many ways of dealing with rejection, but to oversimplify, you can adopt one of two extremes. It either intensifies your resolution and determination, or you shy away from further pain. You either redouble your efforts, or you find that so demeaning – and with such a high probability of further humiliation – that you shrink back. The irrational belief is, the less hard you try, the less it will hurt when you're yet again rebuffed. This is understandable and is human. So if you want to steer your partner into more enterprising ways, berating him – however tactfully – is unlikely to be effective. You're more likely to be successful if you appeal to his intelligence.</p><p>He knows he is clever and well-qualified. He knows there are jobs out there he could do extremely well and he knows that other people, less able than he, are getting those jobs. So work with him on concocting a plan based not on plain, dogged perseverance, but one that uses his intelligence and imagination, one than explores different, unconventional approaches. Encourage him to think of it as a way of outwitting the system. As a would-be web designer there should be plenty of opportunities to demonstrate his talents and enterprise. There is a very good chance that his enjoyment of this exercise will in itself lift his spirits and his sense of purpose.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• He is solvent and has time available but is lacking experience; that's the ideal opportunity to start working for himself as a web designer. He could charge very competitive fees and use the experience to build up a portfolio if he doesn't want to remain self-employed.<strong> webweasel</strong></p><p></p><p>• Master's in IT, no job after nine months. His CV must be seriously deficient or his expectations too narrow. Find out what his peers are doing, as this is an indication of where his particular master's is valued. <strong>Burzmaili</strong></p><h2>Job interviews: at what stage is it okay to ask about salary?<br /></h2><p><strong>Many jobs are advertised with an \"attractive\" or \"competitive\" salary, with no specific figure mentioned. I, like most people, have certain financial commitments, so it would seem pointless to attend an interview for a job paying a wage that cannot cover these. This would be wasting both my time and the interviewer's. But at what stage of seeking a job is it permissible to ask about the salary on offer? How is the subject best broached at an early stage without it appearing that the only consideration is money?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>However delicately you phrase the question, you risk alienating the prospective employer before they have even had a chance to size you up.</p><p>Remember that for most desirable jobs there will be at least a dozen fully qualified candidates, so interviewers will be looking for objective reasons to eliminate applicants. An applicant who asks about salary right at the start of the recruitment process could provide exactly such a reason – and not just, as you suggest, because the only consideration seems to be money. It also implies a lack of interest or curiosity and a willingness to forfeit the chance of a job before knowing anything about it.</p><p>Furthermore, the absence of even a guideline salary figure in the original advertisement might simply mean that the employer is prepared to be flexible; that if an outstanding candidate emerged, the salary could be negotiated to suit. In other words, even if you raised the subject, the employer might be unable to give you a definitive answer. You would have risked a big black mark with nothing useful gained.</p><p>While it might be \"pointless\" to attend an interview if it transpires that the maximum salary is well below your necessary minimum, you will never be certain ahead of the event. And you run the real risk of eliminating yourself needlessly from a job that might have suited you perfectly.</p><p>Make it absolutely clear from the beginning that you very much like the sound of the role on offer, that you would like to hear more about it, and why you think you might be the perfect match. If the employer agrees that you are a more suitable candidate than any of the others, discussions about salary levels are obviously much more likely to be to your liking.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• The way it works is that the manager wants who he/she thinks is best and doesn't care what that person is paid – as long as it is less than they get. The upper constraint is set by HR or a more senior manager. I think the best approach is to concentrate on being a dazzling candidate at interview, one that the manager is prepared to make the extra effort for in terms of persuading HR and his/her boss that you merit a good salary. <strong>salamandertome</strong></p><p></p><p>• If you have done your research and know your industry you should already have some idea of the remuneration. Interview well, be the best candidate, and the salary will come up in the follow-up interviews. Then it's time to negotiate. <strong>hok011 </strong></p><p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

        "body":"<p><strong>Q </strong>I am based in London and work full-time earning around £33,000. I'm keen to get onto the property ladder as I'm nearly 37-years-old and feel that time is running out. I would look to buy on the outskirts of London or further out if I could commute in easily. Based on my income I estimate I could apply for a mortgage of between £105,000 and £125,000. I'm working hard to pull together a deposit and hope to have 5% to 10% saved in about a year's time. Based on my current salary I estimate I could purchase a property of around £160,000 with Help to Buy.</p><p></p><p>There has been a lot written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme and in my circumstances applying for the scheme is very attractive as it would help me get on the housing ladder a lot more quickly, with a smaller deposit in London, where prices are so high. I'm not sure I could save for a deposit large enough without the Help to Buy scheme if I wanted to buy in London before I'm 40-years-old.</p><p>In a couple of years' time I expect my salary to increase as I move roles which could mean I borrow more if I applied for a mortgage later but I would prefer not to wait until then. &nbsp;</p><p></p><p>My concern with Help to Buy is all the controversy that surrounds it and comments from economists about inflating the property market but it would help me personally get a foot on the property ladder. Should I take advantage of Help to Buy or should I wait longer to save a bigger deposit further down the line (though due to my age I wouldn't want to do this any later than 40 and I may not catch up if prices continue to rise)? <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> A lot has been written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme in recent weeks because it has been launched earlier than originally planned. Unlike the first part, which offers homebuyers an interest-free loan, the second phase of Help to buy doesn't give the buyer any cash but instead provides a limited number of mortgage lenders with a partial mortgage guarantee to encourage them to offer mortgages of up to 95% of the value of the property. In common with the first phase of Help to Buy, buyers will have to provide a cash deposit on their home of at least 5% of the purchase price.</p><p></p><p>The taxpayer-backed guarantee does not, however, guarantee that you will get a 95% mortgage, as you will need to pass lender affordability checks and have no history of difficulties in meeting debt repayments. Even if you do qualify for a 95% Help to Buy mortgage, the question you should be asking yourself is not whether you want to use Help to Buy but whether you want to take on that level of debt. If you bought somewhere for £160,000 with a 95% 25-year repayment mortgage (interest-only aren't allowed) with an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage payments would be just under £890. Only you (and a potential lender) can say whether that's affordable but over a year, it works out as just under a third of your pre-tax salary.</p><p></p><p>I suspect that if you really do want to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible, you might be better off going for a new build property with the first stage of Help to Buy. For a property costing £160,000, you would need a deposit of £8,000, a 75% mortgage of £120,000 and a cash loan of £32,000 from the bank of Dave and George to put towards the purchase price. Again, assuming an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage repayments would be about £700.  In addition, for the first five years, there would be no interest to pay on the government loan so if, as you say, your salary will increase in the future, you could aim to save up enough to repay at least some of the interest-free money before you have to start paying interest on it in year six of the loan.</p><p></p><p>Note that the equivalent of the first stage of the Help to Buy scheme in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales works differently, although the second mortgage-guarantee Help to Buy scheme is available throughout the UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420041609|2013-11-05T11:22:54Z|bc4d2545ce8bf373f7959c6d8f9299b0bb9046bf -->",
