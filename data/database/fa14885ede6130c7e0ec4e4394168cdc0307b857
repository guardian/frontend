        "body":"<h2>Grey Horse</h2><p>The Grey Horse is a little glimpse of what pubs used to be like. The bar staff are super chatty, as are the regulars, the gents are still outside in the yard and the soundtrack is old northern soul and Johnny Cash. Yet this Hydes' pub is something of a pioneer, too. Alert to the threat posed by the craft beer scene, Manchester's traditional family brewers are responding in different ways. Robinsons has drafted in Elbow and Iron Maiden to help design its beers (try these at <a href=\"http://thecastlehotel.info/\" title=\"\">the Castle</a>. Hydes, meanwhile, has launched the Beer Studio, a craft brewery within its main plant, turning out monthly specials – which the Grey Horse carries. A sample half of the Studio's Titian Tipple (a malty, reddish ale) was fine, if less exciting than the blurb on the Beer Studio website. Perhaps all Hydes needs to do is refresh and rebadge its Original? It's a little sweetly, wishy-washy in the body, but, for a beer of its ilk, it has a real thirst-quenching bitterness to it. Kept well, it is Manchester's best old school pint.<em>• Pint from £2.80. 80 Portland Street, 0161 236 1874, </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Grey-Horse-MCR/519857821404204?ref=stream\" title=\"\"><em>facebook page</em></a></p><h2>Sandbar</h2><p>Sitting between university buildings, Sandbar has a busy cultural programme (from comedy nights to life drawing classes), and lots of very good beer. It was originally known for its range of continental and specifically German beers, and you can still find rare goodies here (for instance, bottles from Munich's Hacker-Pschorr, £4.70). However, these days, its primary emphasis, across eight cask and 13 keg lines, is on British beers, several commissioned directly from small breweries. These exclusives include 4.1 (pint, £2.90) from Bury's Outstanding Brewery; a lemony Czech-style pils, rampant with Saaz hops; and Tarantula (£2.90), a lightly roasted, clean-drinking dark ale from Manchester brewery, Privateer, who are based – boom, tish! – on Temperance Street.  <br /><em>• Pint from £2.70. 120 Grosvenor Street, 0161 273 1552, </em><a href=\"http://sandbarmanchester.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>sandbarmanchester.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Marble Arch</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622528'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381418355611/The-Marble-Arch-pub-Manch-008.jpg' alt='The Marble Arch pub, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's 125 years old but this handsome Victorian boozer – all glazed tile work and vintage detail – has never been busier. The flagship for Manchester's finest microbrewery, Marble, it attracts beer fans of all stripes. Get there early to bag a table or risk internal exile to a much uglier back room. Eleven hand-pulls and three craft keg lines showcase mainly Marble beers. Historically, Manchester loves dry, pale session ales and Marble's laconically named Pint is a corker in that style. Its revelatory best bitter and lush chocolate stout may suggest a brewery that is all about reviving traditional styles, but a new Earl Grey IPA and its legendary, ever-evolving Ginger ale (now in its 5.1% iteration) illustrate how Marble has its finger on craft beer's creative pulse. Food is good quality (mains from £9.95) and the extensive cheese menu is a boon (from £6.95, four choices). Marble also has a modern bar in the Northern Quarter (57 Thomas Street). <br /><em>• Pint from £2.80. 73 Rochdale Road, 0161 832 5914, </em><a href=\"http://www.marblebeers.com/marble-arch/\" title=\"\"><em>marblebeers.com</em></a></p><h2>Knott Bar<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622529'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415714188/The-Knott-Manchester--008.jpg' alt='The Knott, Manchester ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's a stone's throw from Deansgate Locks, a noisy, flashy strip of so-called style bars, but Knott Bar couldn't be more different. There are indie tunes on the jukebox, Ramones posters and Schneider Weisse adverts by way of decor, and beer lovers crowded around its large tables. Seven cask ales (Castle Rock's reliable Harvest Pale is one of two permanents) and eight craft keg lines feature a rotating cast of trend-setting northern brewers, with Thornbridge, Magic Rock, Summer Wine and the awesome Red Willow appearing regularly. Prices for the craft keg beers (from £4.60 a pint) can get silly, but it goes with the territory. Knott also carries a solid Belgian range, various German pilsners and wheats, and a newly expanded range of American bottles. As they put it, their stock runs the gamut: \"from Scottish punks to Trappist monks.\" Food includes popular burgers (from £7.95) and there's a good smoking terrace.<br /><em>• Pint from £2.95. 374 Deansgate, 0161 839 9229, </em><a href=\"http://knottbar.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>knottbar.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Port Street Beer House<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622530'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381417945200/Port-Street-Beer-House-Ma-008.jpg' alt='Port Street Beer House, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Manchester's premier craft beer bar. Long before <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/bars/manchester\" title=\"\">Brewdog</a> opened, Port Street was already turning Mancunians on to explosively hoppy US imports, edgy craft keg beers and impoverishing those who couldn't resist that second bottle of Alesmith Speedway Stout (750ml, £18). Expect to find the cream of local, national and international breweries represented across 25 pumps (seven of those cask) and around 120 bottled beers, with Wirral \"nanobrewery\" Madhatter and London's fantastic Partizan currently getting the nod from Port Street's enthusiastic bar staff. Regular meet-the-brewer evenings and sporadic themed beer festivals add interest. <br /><em> • Pint from £3. 39-41 Port Street, 0161 237 9949, </em><a href=\"http://www.portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Cask</h2><p>CAMRA militants may complain that actual cask ale is somewhat underrepresented at Cask, on just four pumps. But more rounded beer fans will find plenty to enjoy in its vast array of bottles (a bit bewildering, as there was no menu on a recent visit) and 13 keg lines. Cask is one of a select band of British beer hubs that serves Budvar yeast beer (half, £1.90). This unfiltered, unpasteurised version of the Czech classic is, naturally, a shade more in-your-face than its mainline version. Much more impressive, however – as it should be at an eye-watering £3.70 a half – was Belgian Coast IPA, a collaboration between Americans Green Flash and St-Feuillien. Basically, it does what it says on the tin; it's spicy, it's peppery, it's sour, as you would expect of a Belgian beer, but it's also got all those tropical flavours jostling around in there. It's a complex mouthful. Cask itself is a plain, utilitarian space, but its covered patio garden is a lovely little spot.<br /><em>• Pint from £3. 29 Liverpool Road, 0161 819 2527, </em><a href=\"http://www.caskmanc.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>caskmanc.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Font Bar</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622531'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381419130746/The-Font-Bar-Manchester-008.jpg' alt='The Font Bar, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Located in a raucous bit of Studentsville, Font (\"...#partyvibes since 2000...\") isn't the first place you would look for good beer. But fear not, those £2 cocktails are just camouflage for one of the best-stocked beer bars in the city. It carries four real ales (including, last week, the excellent Hop from Salford's First Chop, £3.30), while numerous craft pumps dispense  ales from local and international breweries in thirds, halves and pints. There is serious fun to be had browsing its huge bottled beer menu, which runs the gamut of new wave UK breweries, including Kernel, Wild Beer, Hardknott, Camden, and their US inspirations, such as Left Hand and Magic Hat. Font also does a fine line in German beers, from fearsomely dry pils, Jever (500ml, £3.80), to that old smoked classic Schlenkerla Rauchbier (500ml, £4.60).<br /><em>• Pint from £3. 7-9 New Wakefield Street, 0161 236 0944, </em><a href=\"http://thefontbar.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thefontbar.wordpress.com</em></a></p><h2>City Arms</h2><p>Most of Manchester's best pubs fringe the city centre, but this traditional two-roomed boozer (polished leather banquettes, black-and-white photos, etched mirrors) fights the good fight bang in the heart of the city. Eight hand pulls, featuring such steady breweries as Hornbeam, Moorhouse's, Titanic and, often, a couple of beers from Thwaites, keep the regulars happy. Many of these are suits from the surrounding business district, diluted with beer lovers and those who relish that rarity: a simple, unpretentious city pub, where you can settle in and natter the night away. • <em>Pint from £3.20. 46-48 Kennedy Street, 0161 236 4610</em></p><h2>The Molly House</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622532'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415391543/Molly-House-Manchester-008.jpg' alt='Molly House, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Manchester's Gay Village is plastered with posters advertising offers on Smirnoff Ice and the like, but the Molly House is taking a stand. This real ale redoubt for dissenting Village drinkers serves six cask ales (from local outfits such as Little Valley, Beartown, Dunham Massey, etc), two craft keg beers from Bury's Outstanding and a short, solid list of imported bottled beers, including Flying Dog's Raging Bitch and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. The groundfloor bar space, with its open kitchen and cake displays (the Molly is also a cafe and restaurant), won't suit pub purists, but it's pleasant enough. If you want to drink real ale while listening to 1980s synth classics from Sparks and Blancmange, this is the place to do it.<br /><em>• Pint from £3.60. 26 Richmond Street, 0161 237 9329, </em><a href=\"http://www.themollyhouse.com/\" title=\"\"><em>themollyhouse.com</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Bar Fringe</h2><p>It's a bit rum, is Bar Fringe. Its decor – a lifesize cardboard Sid Vicious, a motorbike in the eves, a skeleton tangled-up in barbed-wire in the cobbled beer garden – should give you a feel for this earthy, hard-drinking joint. Every pub draws the audience it deserves, and Bar Fringe's crowd is an unlikely mix of hairy bikers, bohemian folk, gnarled beer-tickers and brainy students, who leave mystifying, maths-related graffiti in the toilets. On a recent visit, its ale pumps included far-flung beers from Darkstar and Franklin's in Sussex and (an unusual, citrussy best bitter) Blue Sky Drinking from Bristol's Arbor. Cask beer aside, Fringe majors on continental and Belgian bottles, with the likes of Duvel, Leffe and Timmerman's on draught, as well as real perries and ciders. It's CAMRA's cider month through October, so if you like Badger's Spit and Wonky Donkey, this is the place to be.<br /><em>• Pint from £3. 8 Swan Street, 0161 835 3815</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419609475|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|e715dd27aa6382156834b3c141c8c71bc41ab7ab -->",

For many regulars, its chilli, its chicken and chorizo stew and, particularly, its falafel and halloumi open kebab, form a beer-food Holy Trinity. This year, however, the kitchen has really upped its game. The menus are now designed by Laurence Tottingham, one half of the husband-and-wife chef duo who run Prestwich's acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.aumbryrestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aumbry</a> and, alongside a range of sandwiches and classy burgers (try the pastrami-and-Emmental-topped Reuben), you can expect to see broadly New York deli-inspired dishes on the specials menu, such as an excellent shredded salt-beef sauerkraut stack, huevos rancheros and an Italian meatball sub. Common is the sister bar of <a href=\"http://www.portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Port Street Beer House</a>, and so, naturally, it carries an interesting range of cask, imported keg and bottled beers.<br />• <em>Light bites and sandwiches, &pound;2.50-&pound;5.95, meals &pound;6-&pound;8.50. 39-41 Edge Street, 0161 832 9245, </em><a href=\"http://www.aplacecalledcommon.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>aplacecalledcommon.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Slice Pizza &amp; Bread Bar</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774132\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364988925641/Slice-Manchester-008.jpg\" alt=\"Slice, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Counter culture at Slice </figcaption></figure><p>In Rome pizza isn't round; it's rectangular and served <em>al taglio</em> (by the slice). The owners of this pizza bar travelled to the Italian capital to learn how it's done, and it shows. Everything is made onsite, every day, and it's all good, from the elegant simplicity of the beautifully light, bouncy focaccia, dressed with olive oil, rosemary and sea salt, to classic toppings such as broccoli, sausage and chilli. Those pizzas that employ very thinly sliced potato stand out (it adds a buttery dimension and boosts overall savoury oomph). If you end up staggering around the Northern Quarter late at night, looking to stave off a hangover, it's worth noting that at weekends, Slice remains open, for takeaway only, from 10pm to 1am.<br />• <em>Slices &pound;2-&pound;2.75. 1A Stevenson Square, 0161 236 9032, </em><a href=\"http://slicepizza.co/\" title=\"\"><em>slicepizza.co</em></a></p><h2>Gorilla</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774134\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364988703701/Gorilla-Manchester-008.jpg\" alt=\"Gorilla, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Half a tandoori chicken with apricot bulgar wheat, flat bread and saffron garlic mayo at Gorilla</figcaption></figure><p>Do you love eggs Benedict? Do you want to listen to the Pixies while you eat it? If so, you're in the right place. A gig venue and late-night bar, Gorilla is also a surprisingly good casual dining space, open from 9am at weekends. The various elements of that eggs Benedict (&pound;5.50) are bright, fresh, pin-sharp. The full English, meanwhile, comes with Gorilla's own-recipe sausages (made by renowned Chorlton butcher WH Frost) and quality bacon from over the border in Cheshire. The coffee's not bad, either. Although, for Manchester's best flat white (&pound;2.60), head to <a href=\"http://northteapower.co.uk/\" title=\"\">North Tea Power</a> (36 Tib Street, 0161 833 3073).</p><p>Later in the day, the menu expands to take in snazzy sandwiches (a ciabatta of stuffed porchetta, crackling and salsa verde), burgers, dogs, interesting seasonal soups and salads, and an African chermoula-spiced kebab. One warning: tread carefully with the more interesting bottled and canned craft beers, which, in all Trof's venues (they own a few across town) tend to be pricey. Think &pound;4.50 for a 35.5cl can of Brooklyn lager. <br /><em>• Breakfast, &pound;4-&pound;9.95, light meals and sandwiches, &pound;4.50-&pound;8.50, mains from &pound;7.50. 54-56 Whitworth Street, 0161 407 0301, </em><a href=\"http://www.thisisgorilla.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thisisgorilla.com</em></a></p><h2>Pancho's Burritos</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774135\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364988596499/Pancho-s-Burritos-008.jpg\" alt=\"Pancho’s Burritos\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Topped tacos at Pancho’s Burritos</figcaption></figure><p>The Arndale Market food hall (don't worry, it is not as posh as that might sound) has numerous affordable places to eat but, personally, I rarely get past Pancho's. Run by Mexican chef Enrique Martinez, it deals in big, fat, sloppy burritos, stuffed with slow-cooked meats – pulled pork with lime, pork with fleshy cactus, beef in <em>pasilla</em> chilli sauce – that deliver masses of flavour. Grab a seat, because there is no way you'll be able to walk and eat one of these monsters, unless you want meat juices, refried beans, sour cream and <em>pico de gallo</em> salsa all down your shirt. Pancho's also does topped tacos and quesadillas, but the new hit is its tomato-and-ancho-chilli azteca soup (&pound;2.50), which is all upfront fruity tomato flavours, riding waves of smokiness and lip-tingling heat.<br /><em>• Burritos from &pound;3.99.

A riverside pub with a certain faded 1980s wine bar glamour, it has a once-ritzy fa&ccedil;ade that could not be more at odds with the ethos of its chef, Robert Owen Brown. A local lad, Owen Brown loves gutsy, no-nonsense northern cooking. He lives to do rib-sticking things with tripe, Bury black pudding and Eccles cakes – and at affordable prices, too. At lunch, you could do worse than share a few of the bar snacks: a Manchester egg (a northern take on the scotch egg), spam fritters and the Blacksticks blue cheese bhajis, which are a meal in themselves. There are also sandwich meals with chips and, at night, the budget traveller can choose between a cheese and p&acirc;t&eacute; platter, and a couple of the sub-&pound;10, pub-style mains (a serviceable burger, better fish 'n' chips).</p><p>Try to save some money to sample a couple of halves from the six real ales (pint from &pound;3.10). As well as beers from Macclesfield's fantastic Red Willow, the pumps often feature beers from the region's less well-known micros. Indeed, if you're more interested in drinking than eating, use this pub as the starting-point for a short pub crawl down Chapel Street into Salford (technically, the Mark Addy is just over the border). Don't miss the King's Arms (11 Bloom Street, 0161 839 8726, <a href=\"http://kingsarmssalford.com\" title=\"\">kingsarmssalford.com</a>) run by the Beautiful South's Paul Heaton, which is also the &quot;local&quot; in Channel 4's Fresh Meat – and exceptional ale enclave the New Oxford (Bexley Square, 0161 832 7082, <a href=\"http://thenewoxford.com\" title=\"\">thenewoxford.com</a>).<br /><em>• Snacks, sandwich meals and platters, &pound;2.40-&pound;7.25, mains from &pound;9.45.

It's a no-frills joint, but the food is fresh, homemade and uses whole spices to give the dishes the kind of wallop of flavour that you wouldn't normally expect at a sub-&pound;5 price. The various lamb curries usually deliver a good savoury gravy and a reasonable amount of tasty meat, but, for me, its the veggie curries – particularly the chana masala, the daals and the spinach curry – that really sing with flavour. The help-yourself curry toppings (coriander, green chillies, raw onion) are a nice touch, and, of the supplementary snacks, the samosas (a shade greasy, perhaps, but packed with beautifully seasoned mince, potato and onion) are recommended.<br />• <em>Meal from &pound;3.30. 3 Soap Street, 0161 832 4971, </em><a href=\"http://thisandthatcafe.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>thisandthatcafe.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Almost Famous </h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774138\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364988329564/Almost-Famous-Manchester-008.jpg\" alt=\"Almost Famous, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Jam-packed burgers at Almost Famous</figcaption></figure><p>I almost didn't include AF. Not because it's hugely over-hyped (which it is) and not because, at weekends, the queue for a table will sap your will to live. No, I almost didn't include it because AF sells itself in a very un-Manchester tone of, not hipster cool exactly, more lippy idiocy. On the website and on the walls, there is a lot of attitude and a lot of pointless posturing about its take-it-or-leave-it, love-us-or-hate-us untamed approach. There are signs banning photography. It sells a cocktail, Bitch Juice, which the menu warns (promises?) &quot;may result in actual orgasm&quot;. Almost Famous asks so desperately and repeatedly, &quot;Are we cool? Are we cool yet? Are we edgy?&quot; The only reasonable answer is no. There is, however, no arguing with the burgers. They are sensational. The best in Manchester, by some distance. The &quot;triple nom&quot; (of course the burgers have irritating names) is the pick. It's packed with, not just two juicy patties, but a wad of moist, nicely charred barbecue rib meat, whose savoury depth acts as the best counterpoint to AF's slightly too sweet, but well-delineated sauces. The kitchen likes to keep things sloppy, so that burger also comes with a thick layer of fine red cabbage and red onion coleslaw. The reasonably durable semi-brioche bun doesn't quite hold everything in, but keeps it manageable. The fries, mined with pieces of sweet potato, are good; the &quot;chilli cheese fries&quot; (&pound;5, chilli over fries, topped with a further mustardy-cheesy sauce) aren't worth the expense. The beer (Brooklyn lager, 33cl, &pound;4.50) is pretty expensive, too.</p><p>Note: if you can't be bothered with the queues, nearby SoLita (Turner Street, +44 (0)161 839 2200, <a href=\"http://solita.co.uk/\" title=\"\">solita.co.uk</a>), serves a fairly good, bone marrow-moistened burger from its Inka grill (&pound;10.90). It's &pound;5.95 lunchtime menu is worth a look, too. Or, over the other side of town, the Lincoln cheeseburger at Brewdog (35 Peter Street, 0161 832 1922, <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/\" title=\"\">brewdog.com</a>) is a doozy. It's just &pound;4.95, and, naturally, the beer choice (pint from &pound;3.95) is far superior. <br /><em>• Burgers &pound;6-&pound;7, fries &pound;2. 100 High Street, no phone, </em><a href=\"http://almostfamousburgers.com/\" title=\"\"><em>almostfamousburgers.com</em></a></p><h2>KuKoos</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774139\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364989423662/Kukoos-Manchester-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kukoos, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Kukoos' colourful collection of pickle jars </figcaption></figure><p>Ingeniously located on Oxford Road, or &quot;student alley&quot;, this modish, utilitarian canteen specialises in affordable Moroccan, Lebanese and Indian street food. A little surprisingly, given that it's a spin-off from well-regarded local curry house Zouk, the dosas need work. The masala potato filling was top, long on flavour, full of herbs and mustard seeds, and the chutneys – a minted, almost sour, green coconut one, and a fruity carrot number – were great. But the dosa &quot;pancake&quot; itself wasn't crisp and light enough. It was a shade flabby. KuKoos spritzy salads, however, are unquestionably A1. Its verdant, citrusy tabbouleh could hold its own in Beirut; the golden quinoa, dressed with orange juice and studded with fat raisins, was as tasty as health food is ever going to get. The menu also runs to hot wraps and snacks such as samosas and soups. With service as bright and cheery as its salads, and prices kept very keen – that dosa was just &pound;3.50 – it is little wonder that KuKoos is already thriving.<br />• <em>Snacks from &pound;1, light meals &pound;3-&pound;5. 12a Oxford Road, 0161 236 7989, </em><a href=\"http://kukoos.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>kukoos.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Vnam</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774140\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364989256974/Vnam-008.jpg\" alt=\"Vnam\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Vnam's pho –&nbsp;a bouncing broth with cinnamon and star anise flavours</figcaption></figure><p>Modern Manchester looks polished and shiny, but you don't have to walk very far out of the centre to see another side of the city. And you should. Shabby Oldham Road is every bit as representative as swanky King Street and, thanks to this small, simple Vietnamese cafe, much tastier. Vnam's pho – that iconic noodle soup – is a belter: the broth bouncing with cinnamon and star anise flavours, the various cuts of beef included unusually flavourful, many edged with tasty fat. For the money (from 12pm to 1.30pm, the pho is &pound;7.95 with a soft drink), the detail is excellent. That pho arrives with a good side of fresh mint and coriander, bean shoots, chillies and lime to add as you see fit. If pho seems a bit too familiar, there is plenty more to explore on the menu, from BBQ quail and lamb chops – served with a lime, sea salt and black pepper dipping sauce – to a prawn and pork lotus root salad. Also BYO (&pound;1 corkage).<br /><em>• Main noodle and rice dishes, &pound;6.25-&pound;8.35. 140 Oldham Road, 0161 205 2700, </em><a href=\"http://vnam.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>vnam.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Habesha</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-408774141\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364990527336/Habesha-Manchester-008.jpg\" alt=\"Habesha, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Habesha serves Ethiopian food under a tenner</figcaption></figure><p>Normally, &pound;8 doesn't buy you much in terms of foodie adventure. However, at this east African restaurant, for less than a tenner, you can sample Ethiopian dishes, such as <em>awaze tibs</em> and <em>gored gored</em>, and wash them down with a bottle of imported (and fairly generic, actually) St George lager (&pound;2-&pound;2.50). It's rustic stuff. My <em>doro wot</em> comprised a bowl of sauce with the trimmed, central section of a chicken carcass in it, pieces of chicken breast still attached to the bird's breastbone. There wasn't a huge amount of meat there, but, as a dish, this was less about protein than that luscious sauce. It was an impossibly rich (many Ethiopian dishes are begun by frying off the ingredients in seasoned butter) red pepper and onion stew, highly but not particularly hotly spiced – ginger and cardamom are the primary seasonings – that, as a rough guide, was halfway between a proper rogan josh and the deep, savoury silkiness of a French onion soup. I wasn't sold on the hard-boiled egg that is also part of the dish, but the sauce worked brilliantly with the <em>injera</em>, the huge spongy, lemony-sour pancakes that you use to mop everything up with. Neatly decked out with African fabrics, pictures and knick-knacks, Habesha is basic, but much nicer than you might imagine, given that it is above a busy takeaway. You'll find it upstairs in the Istanbul Express kebab house in the Gay Village.<br /><em>• Mains &pound;5.50-&pound;7.50. 29-31 Sackville Street, 0161 228 7396, <a href=\"http://habesharestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">habesharestaurant.co.uk</a></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406605838|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|628b519623b6db206d15ef91de57c2e572d32afd -->",

        "body":"<h2>Grey Horse</h2><p>The Grey Horse is a little glimpse of what pubs used to be like. The bar staff are super chatty, as are the regulars, the gents are still outside in the yard and the soundtrack is old northern soul and Johnny Cash. Yet this Hydes' pub is something of a pioneer, too. Alert to the threat posed by the craft beer scene, Manchester's traditional family brewers are responding in different ways. Robinsons has drafted in Elbow and Iron Maiden to help design its beers (try these at <a href=\"http://thecastlehotel.info/\" title=\"\">the Castle</a>. Hydes, meanwhile, has launched the Beer Studio, a craft brewery within its main plant, turning out monthly specials – which the Grey Horse carries. A sample half of the Studio's Titian Tipple (a malty, reddish ale) was fine, if less exciting than the blurb on the Beer Studio website. Perhaps all Hydes needs to do is refresh and rebadge its Original? It's a little sweetly, wishy-washy in the body, but, for a beer of its ilk, it has a real thirst-quenching bitterness to it. Kept well, it is Manchester's best old school pint.<em>• Pint from £2.80. 80 Portland Street, 0161 236 1874, </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Grey-Horse-MCR/519857821404204?ref=stream\" title=\"\"><em>facebook page</em></a></p><h2>Sandbar</h2><p>Sitting between university buildings, Sandbar has a busy cultural programme (from comedy nights to life drawing classes), and lots of very good beer. It was originally known for its range of continental and specifically German beers, and you can still find rare goodies here (for instance, bottles from Munich's Hacker-Pschorr, £4.70). However, these days, its primary emphasis, across eight cask and 13 keg lines, is on British beers, several commissioned directly from small breweries. These exclusives include 4.1 (pint, £2.90) from Bury's Outstanding Brewery; a lemony Czech-style pils, rampant with Saaz hops; and Tarantula (£2.90), a lightly roasted, clean-drinking dark ale from Manchester brewery, Privateer, who are based – boom, tish! – on Temperance Street.  <br /><em>• Pint from £2.70. 120 Grosvenor Street, 0161 273 1552, </em><a href=\"http://sandbarmanchester.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>sandbarmanchester.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Marble Arch</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622528'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381418355611/The-Marble-Arch-pub-Manch-008.jpg' alt='The Marble Arch pub, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's 125 years old but this handsome Victorian boozer – all glazed tile work and vintage detail – has never been busier. The flagship for Manchester's finest microbrewery, Marble, it attracts beer fans of all stripes. Get there early to bag a table or risk internal exile to a much uglier back room. Eleven hand-pulls and three craft keg lines showcase mainly Marble beers. Historically, Manchester loves dry, pale session ales and Marble's laconically named Pint is a corker in that style. Its revelatory best bitter and lush chocolate stout may suggest a brewery that is all about reviving traditional styles, but a new Earl Grey IPA and its legendary, ever-evolving Ginger ale (now in its 5.1% iteration) illustrate how Marble has its finger on craft beer's creative pulse. Food is good quality (mains from £9.95) and the extensive cheese menu is a boon (from £6.95, four choices). Marble also has a modern bar in the Northern Quarter (57 Thomas Street). <br /><em>• Pint from £2.80. 73 Rochdale Road, 0161 832 5914, </em><a href=\"http://www.marblebeers.com/marble-arch/\" title=\"\"><em>marblebeers.com</em></a></p><h2>Knott Bar<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622529'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415714188/The-Knott-Manchester--008.jpg' alt='The Knott, Manchester ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's a stone's throw from Deansgate Locks, a noisy, flashy strip of so-called style bars, but Knott Bar couldn't be more different. There are indie tunes on the jukebox, Ramones posters and Schneider Weisse adverts by way of decor, and beer lovers crowded around its large tables. Seven cask ales (Castle Rock's reliable Harvest Pale is one of two permanents) and eight craft keg lines feature a rotating cast of trend-setting northern brewers, with Thornbridge, Magic Rock, Summer Wine and the awesome Red Willow appearing regularly. Prices for the craft keg beers (from £4.60 a pint) can get silly, but it goes with the territory. Knott also carries a solid Belgian range, various German pilsners and wheats, and a newly expanded range of American bottles. As they put it, their stock runs the gamut: \"from Scottish punks to Trappist monks.\" Food includes popular burgers (from £7.95) and there's a good smoking terrace.<br /><em>• Pint from £2.95. 374 Deansgate, 0161 839 9229, </em><a href=\"http://knottbar.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>knottbar.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Port Street Beer House<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622530'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381417945200/Port-Street-Beer-House-Ma-008.jpg' alt='Port Street Beer House, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Manchester's premier craft beer bar. Long before <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/bars/manchester\" title=\"\">Brewdog</a> opened, Port Street was already turning Mancunians on to explosively hoppy US imports, edgy craft keg beers and impoverishing those who couldn't resist that second bottle of Alesmith Speedway Stout (750ml, £18). Expect to find the cream of local, national and international breweries represented across 25 pumps (seven of those cask) and around 120 bottled beers, with Wirral \"nanobrewery\" Madhatter and London's fantastic Partizan currently getting the nod from Port Street's enthusiastic bar staff. Regular meet-the-brewer evenings and sporadic themed beer festivals add interest. <br /><em> • Pint from £3. 39-41 Port Street, 0161 237 9949, </em><a href=\"http://www.portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Cask</h2><p>CAMRA militants may complain that actual cask ale is somewhat underrepresented at Cask, on just four pumps. But more rounded beer fans will find plenty to enjoy in its vast array of bottles (a bit bewildering, as there was no menu on a recent visit) and 13 keg lines. Cask is one of a select band of British beer hubs that serves Budvar yeast beer (half, £1.90). This unfiltered, unpasteurised version of the Czech classic is, naturally, a shade more in-your-face than its mainline version. Much more impressive, however – as it should be at an eye-watering £3.70 a half – was Belgian Coast IPA, a collaboration between Americans Green Flash and St-Feuillien. Basically, it does what it says on the tin; it's spicy, it's peppery, it's sour, as you would expect of a Belgian beer, but it's also got all those tropical flavours jostling around in there. It's a complex mouthful. Cask itself is a plain, utilitarian space, but its covered patio garden is a lovely little spot.<br /><em>• Pint from £3. 29 Liverpool Road, 0161 819 2527, </em><a href=\"http://www.caskmanc.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>caskmanc.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Font Bar</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622531'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381419130746/The-Font-Bar-Manchester-008.jpg' alt='The Font Bar, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Located in a raucous bit of Studentsville, Font (\"...#partyvibes since 2000...\") isn't the first place you would look for good beer. But fear not, those £2 cocktails are just camouflage for one of the best-stocked beer bars in the city. It carries four real ales (including, last week, the excellent Hop from Salford's First Chop, £3.30), while numerous craft pumps dispense  ales from local and international breweries in thirds, halves and pints. There is serious fun to be had browsing its huge bottled beer menu, which runs the gamut of new wave UK breweries, including Kernel, Wild Beer, Hardknott, Camden, and their US inspirations, such as Left Hand and Magic Hat. Font also does a fine line in German beers, from fearsomely dry pils, Jever (500ml, £3.80), to that old smoked classic Schlenkerla Rauchbier (500ml, £4.60).<br /><em>• Pint from £3. 7-9 New Wakefield Street, 0161 236 0944, </em><a href=\"http://thefontbar.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thefontbar.wordpress.com</em></a></p><h2>City Arms</h2><p>Most of Manchester's best pubs fringe the city centre, but this traditional two-roomed boozer (polished leather banquettes, black-and-white photos, etched mirrors) fights the good fight bang in the heart of the city. Eight hand pulls, featuring such steady breweries as Hornbeam, Moorhouse's, Titanic and, often, a couple of beers from Thwaites, keep the regulars happy. Many of these are suits from the surrounding business district, diluted with beer lovers and those who relish that rarity: a simple, unpretentious city pub, where you can settle in and natter the night away. • <em>Pint from £3.20. 46-48 Kennedy Street, 0161 236 4610</em></p><h2>The Molly House</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419622532'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415391543/Molly-House-Manchester-008.jpg' alt='Molly House, Manchester' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Manchester's Gay Village is plastered with posters advertising offers on Smirnoff Ice and the like, but the Molly House is taking a stand. This real ale redoubt for dissenting Village drinkers serves six cask ales (from local outfits such as Little Valley, Beartown, Dunham Massey, etc), two craft keg beers from Bury's Outstanding and a short, solid list of imported bottled beers, including Flying Dog's Raging Bitch and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. The groundfloor bar space, with its open kitchen and cake displays (the Molly is also a cafe and restaurant), won't suit pub purists, but it's pleasant enough. If you want to drink real ale while listening to 1980s synth classics from Sparks and Blancmange, this is the place to do it.<br /><em>• Pint from £3.60. 26 Richmond Street, 0161 237 9329, </em><a href=\"http://www.themollyhouse.com/\" title=\"\"><em>themollyhouse.com</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Bar Fringe</h2><p>It's a bit rum, is Bar Fringe. Its decor – a lifesize cardboard Sid Vicious, a motorbike in the eves, a skeleton tangled-up in barbed-wire in the cobbled beer garden – should give you a feel for this earthy, hard-drinking joint. Every pub draws the audience it deserves, and Bar Fringe's crowd is an unlikely mix of hairy bikers, bohemian folk, gnarled beer-tickers and brainy students, who leave mystifying, maths-related graffiti in the toilets. On a recent visit, its ale pumps included far-flung beers from Darkstar and Franklin's in Sussex and (an unusual, citrussy best bitter) Blue Sky Drinking from Bristol's Arbor. Cask beer aside, Fringe majors on continental and Belgian bottles, with the likes of Duvel, Leffe and Timmerman's on draught, as well as real perries and ciders.
