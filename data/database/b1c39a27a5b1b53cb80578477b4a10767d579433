But I understand, with the situation of staying in league, that might not be an option. </p><p>\"But it's good to have made my intentions clear for the next three years. I wanted to put it all out there as I am overhearing what I am going to do as everyone else.\" </p><p>Controversy is never far from Williams and even his decision to play in the upcoming league World Cup involved a backflip on his original plan and another player being dropped.</p><p>With Williams also hoping to feature in the New Zealand sevens team at the 2016 Olympics, he said he had decided to put his boxing career on hold. </p><p>\"I won't have the time to box in the next three years,\" he said.  The NZRU had better luck in their negotiations with All Blacks No8 Kieran Read and lock Sam Whitelock, who on Sunday announced they had committed to playing on with the national team and Canterbury Crusaders until 2017.<br /> <br />\"The fact that two world-class players in Kieran and Sam have re-signed for four more years is a huge positive for the All Blacks,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said in a news release. </p><p>\"Not only are they part of the current success of the team, but it means we have a nucleus of experienced players to take the team into the future beyond 2015, which is fantastic.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419814857|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|31a12e2e9fd94abe9e1a698b5061676c78d11210 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sonny Bill Williams says he'll stay with the NRL champions, Sydney Roosters, next season after knocking back a return to rugby union in New Zealand.</p><p>The Roosters said in a statement on Friday that Williams had pledged his commitment to the club for 2014 and it expected him to sign a new deal in mid-February on the same terms and conditions as his 2013 contract.</p><p>Williams had been weighing up a return to the World Cup holders, New Zealand, and Super Rugby champions the Chiefs since spearheading the Roosters to their NRL grand final triumph over Manly on Sunday in his first season at the club.</p><p>The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) broke the news first that Williams had rejected their offer on the official All Blacks Twitter account.</p><p>\"@SonnyBWilliams NOT coming back to play rugby for @ChiefsRugby and #AllBlacks in 2014. It is likely he will be playing for the Roosters,\" it wrote. \"Disappointing but we put our best foot forward, &amp; in the end @SonnyBWilliams made his decision, NZ Rugby's Neil Sorensen said.\"</p><p>Sorenson, the NZRU general manager of professional rugby, indicated they would leave the door open for Williams to return in 2015 ahead of that year's Rugby World Cup.</p><p>\"We obviously worked pretty hard to bring Sonny home, and we have had some really good conversations with him,\" he said. \"As we do with many players who leave New Zealand, we will continue to keep the lines of communication open with him about his playing career.\"</p><p>The Chiefs coach Dave Rennie took a similar line after failing to get Williams back to the club  where he won a title in 2012.</p><p>\"While we are disappointed that Sonny won't be with us in 2014 now, well be keen to keep talking to him about future options,\" said Rennie.</p><p>Williams and his agent Khoder Nasser were on Thursday filmed having lunch with Sorenson, Rennie and his assistant coach Wayne Smith in Sydney, fuelling speculation he was returning to rugby union.</p><p>The 28-year-old looked set to walk away from the NRL when he made himself unavailable for the Rugby League World Cup on Monday.</p><p>However, later that day he contacted Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney to say he had changed his mind and wanted to help New Zealand defend their title in Britain later this month.</p><p>Williams was subsequently added to the squad at the expense of Melbourne back-rower Tohu Harris.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419665044|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|12de751669190d7f31b7d3cf2f666f6196a67d7e -->",

        "body":"<p>Wigan have welcomed suggestions from Australia that they will be offered the chance to become the first British team to play a World Club Challenge fixture in Sydney for almost 40 years.</p><p>The Super League champions have enjoyed home advantage in each of the 14 games against Australasia's champion club team since the challenge was revived in 2000. But now the Sydney Roosters, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\" title=\"\">won the National Rugby League Grand Final by beating Manly last weekend</a>, are said to be receptive to the idea of hosting the fixture.</p><p>\"We would love to go to Sydney,\" said Wigan's chairman, Ian Lenagan. \"Wigan were the last British club to play in Australia, with that great win against the Broncos in Brisbane in 1994, so this would be an elegant way to celebrate the 20th anniversary. The practicalities aren't marvellous, but we would be delighted to find a way around them.\"</p><p>The Roosters were the last Sydney team to stage the challenge, when they were known as Eastern Suburbs and beat St Helens 25-2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1976.  That was the first World Club Challenge, and since then it has been held only once in Australia – when Wigan claimed their famous victory in Brisbane in 1994.</p><p>English clubs – most often Leeds, who have played in five of the last six games – have regularly urged the Australian authorities to show more enthusiasm for the concept, rather than complaining about the odds being stacked against them when they swapthe southern-hemisphere summer for a one-off game in February in the north of England.</p><p>That has not stopped Australian dominance of the fixture, with four wins in the last five years. But Andrew Hill, the NRL's general manager, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph: \"There is a strong consideration for the game to be played in Australia.\"</p><p>Hull have made a rare signing from English rugby union, recruiting Tom Biggs, a Bath wing who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens team but was born in east Yorkshire, on a three-year contract.</p><p>Sam Burgess has welcomed the surprise inclusion of Sonny Bill Williams in New Zealand's World Cup squad. The South Sydney forward, who is currently in South Africa with his younger twin brothers Tom and George at England's training base in Potchefstroom, has relished <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-dhEcvkY7U&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">two clashes with Williams in derbies between the Rabbitohs and the Roosters this season</a>.</p><p>\"He's one of the best players in the world so I'm certainly looking forward to that,\" said Burgess. \"I'll stick within the structure here and hopefully not go stray far out and go looking for him. But if it arises in the middle of the game, I'm sure neither me nor him will shy away from the confrontation.\"</p><p><em>• England will kick off their Rugby League World Cup 2013 campaign against Australia on 26 October at the Millennium Stadium.

        "body":"<h2>Team of the year: Roosters</h2><p>A no-brainer this one. The Roosters were by comfortable margins the best attacking team all year and the best defensive team. Accordingly they won 18 of their 24 matches and secured the minor premiership. Then, in order to win their first grand final since 2002, they beat seasoned pros Manly twice in the finals (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\">despite entering the last half hour of the decider 18-8 down</a>). The Tricolours proved a perfect storm of big money well spent (Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings), hardened regulars (eight of whom suffered through the Roosters' 2010 grand final defeat), and the ability of rookie coach Trent Robinson to pull all these components together and make them tick.</p><h2>Players of the year: Daly Cherry-Evans and Andrew Fifita</h2><p>Before his injury in State of Origin, Souths' fullback Greg Inglis was on track to win this award and any other award ever invented (Miss North Dakota? Why not?). He'll be gutted to miss out on this gong, no doubt, but his relatively quiet second half of the year – conducted on one-and-a-half knees – saw him slip out of contention.</p><p>For my money (about $4.25 in change) Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans was the year's best back with Cronulla's Andrew Fifita pipping Sonny Bill Williams and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves as best forward. Cherry-Evans is one of the game's best first receivers and he was the WD40 that kept Manly's right-side attack lubricated. An astute kicker, dangerous with the ball in hand, and always willing to test the defence himself, Cherry-Evans has really matured as a footballer and any New South Welshmen who were waiting for Cooper Cronk to go off the boil so NSW could win another Origin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDolu85Dfvs\">will now have to wait out Cherry-Evans's term as well</a>.</p><p>Fifita, meantime, was NSW's best player, and though he played an average of 50-odd minutes a game for the Sharks he averaged huge metres (about 150-a-game) and was so much more than a battering ram. He's got a step, he's evasive, he's got good hands and genuine speed. And in further good news for the Sharks (a team always in need of good news, particularly this Asada-affected year), <a href=\"http://www.sharks.com.au/news-display/Fifita-a-fan-favourite/85507?pid=sharks_around\">he's also got a twin brother, David</a>.</p><h2>Try most likely to make you sit up and go 'wow!': David Nofoaluma</h2><p>The Wests Tigers were like idiot savants this year. Though bad enough on the field to finish second last they provided more than their fair share of spectacular tries, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IildDyAahHE\">from a length-of-the-field effort against the Storm</a>, to a piece of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg9G8GEHZuE\">individual brilliance from youngster Tim Simona</a>. The try of the year, however, was scored by the Tigers' other winger, David Nofoaluma, against Manly. Leaping for a Benji Marshall cross-field bomb Nofoaluma took the ball above Jorge Taufua but in doing became inverted at the same time his body was drifting over the sideline in-goal. No matter. As if he had all the time in the world to think about the problem and find a solution to it, Nofoaluma calmly reached out and grounded the ball. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61iHH5z0zlw\">But words are inadequate</a>.</p><h2>Most entertaining press conference: Geoff Toovey</h2><p>You've got to enjoy Manly coach Geoff Toovey. In a game of increasingly bland interviews and scripted sound bites the angry ant wears his heart on his sleeve. When Manly lost 22-10 to South Sydney in August, Toovey, believing Manly had been hard done by, wasn't about to be put off by the threat of a $10,000 fine. His querulous tone, his bulging eyes, his well-chosen words (\"C'mon, that's ridiculous! That's <em>ridiculous</em>! There's gotta be an investigation into this! Someone's gotta be accountable for this!\") <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2pkS_TW3a8\">capped a perfect performance</a>.</p><h2>Best rookie: George Burgess</h2><p>Raiders rookie fullback Anthony Milford was a gun this season making 17 line-breaks in 18 matches and helping those in Canberra forget the man he replaced, <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/josh-dugans-management-fear-nrl-will-face-calls-to-deregister-canberra-raiders-star/story-e6frexnr-1226596729134\">the Rooftop Recalcitrant, Josh Dugan</a>. In a mediocre team who were worse travellers than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pilkington\">Karl Pilkington</a> he was a real ray of light. So too was Penrith's dynamic fullback Matthew Moylan who had old timers tilting their hats back and whistling after his man-of-the-match debut against the Eels in April. But for me, the rookie of the year was George Burgess, the 21-year-old South Sydney colossus who arrived at Redfern very much in the shadow (figuratively speaking… for he's far too big to be cast in anyone's actual shadow) of his older brother Sam. Before long, however, George was making his own name, and from a bench player he became a significant member of Souths' pack, racking up 30-odd tackles a game and taking his sledgehammer frame to opposition defensive walls. And there's more to come. On the back of his stellar season he's in the England squad for the World Cup.</p><h2>Curious decisions that look worse in hindsight: Ricky Stuart's cleanout at Parramatta and Steve Price's re-signing</h2><p>Back in June, Parramatta's coach Ricky Stuart, believing a major cleanout was needed in order to rebuild the team, told 12 players they had the remainder of the season to clear out their lockers and find gainful employment for 2014. Already in a hole the Eels preceded to dig themselves a deeper one, finishing wooden spooners. In September, not long after the Eels were beaten 64-4 by the Storm, Stuart activated a get-out clause in his contract and signed a three-year deal to coach at his alma mater, Canberra, from 2014. That rebuilding project? No longer Stuart's problem. Unfortunate timing to say the least. </p><p>Steve Price, meantime, struggled with St George Illawarra through 2012 and you felt he had 2013 to prove his credentials. After the Dragons lost their first three matches, they won their next three. It was a spirited, if unspectacular return to equilibrium, but then, <em>during</em> the Dragons' next game, one against the Roosters on Anzac Day, it was announced that Price had been granted a contract extension to coach until the end of 2014. To celebrate, the Dragons were duly thumped 34-10 and won just four of their next 17 games including losses to the last placed Eels, and second-last placed Tigers. Given this form Price will surely start 2014 as favourite for the unwanted book kept on coach most likely… to be sacked.</p><h2>Most expensive wee: Russell Packer</h2><p>When school children need to go to the toilet they either put their hands up and asked to be excused or they do it in their pants, whatever's more convenient. When faced with a similar decision against the Broncos at Suncorp, New Zealand Warrior Russell Packer chose Option B and, with hands on hips, relieved himself where he stood, giving himself away by staring into the middle distance (like he was thinking about puppies frolicking in a sprinkler on a warm summer's day) and by rigorously shaking his legs dry when he was done. Only a professional offense taker would have been offended by it but, still, the NRL can't allow carte blanche when it comes to such things (talking about opening Pandora's Box) so it had little choice but to fine Packer $15,000. A golden stream indeed.</p><h2>Most frustrating team: New Zealand Warriors</h2><p>With footballers like Shaun Johnson, Kevin Locke, Manu Vatuvei, Konrad Hurrell, Thomas Leuluai and Feleti Mateo in the squad, the Warriors were, on their day, the best team to watch by some distance. Exciting, chancy and adventurous, they played with childlike joy at times, as if there were no consequences if things went wrong. On other days, however, they just didn't seem interested; or at least you questioned their willingness to roll up the sleeves when a grind was the most prudent course of action. Oh Warriors, you coulda been a contender.</p><h2>Most comical interview that wasn't an interview: Blake Ferguson</h2><p>Raiders winger Blake Ferguson was brilliant when he made it on to the field this year and he earned himself a Blues jersey. Off the field, however, he brought himself into disrepute, if such a thing can be done. During his enforced convalescence he was taken under the wing of his well-intentioned, clean-living uncle, Anthony Mundine, who became Ferguson's spokesperson; even when Ferguson was sitting right next to him. Given Mundine isn't exactly Martin Luther King in the oration stakes it was like calling for a runner in cricket but picking one on crutches. <a href=\"http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/sport/nrl/news/2013/9/video-blake-ferguson-anthony-mundine-hilarious-press-conference/\">Classic stuff</a>.</p><h2>Best promotion of a game that would never be played: Channel Nine</h2><p>Nothing like being prepared for all eventualities but, like text messages from someone you're having an affair with (or so I imagine, sweetheart), you've got to destroy the evidence at the earliest opportunity or it'll come back to bite you. Whatever you do, don't broadcast it on TV. What's that, Nine?<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2JwdCAlV8hI\"> A Knights v Rabbitohs grand final, you say?</a></p><h2>Most spectacular display of contempt for your audience: Channel Nine</h2><p>A double win for Nine, well done! This award goes to Nine for its grand final coverage in Melbourne. Minutes after the conclusion of the grand final (after some on-field interviews and lingering shots of Sonny Bill Williams) coverage abruptly ended. What on earth would cause Nine to miss the awarding of the Provan-Summons trophy to the winning team, the equivalent of the kissing scene at the end of a rom-com? It would have to be huge news, right? A military coup in Washington DC? Live coverage of a wet and wild brawl between Clive Palmer and Gina Reinhart at a Korean bathhouse? An interview with Buddy Franklin about what he had for dinner? No. The Hangover II. Nine has form in this area (it's been denying fans of the winning team their due for years… and if your team wins the premiership but you don't see them lifting the trophy did it really happen?) but still. What the hell, Nine?!</p><h2>Team of the Year</h2><p>1. Greg Inglis, 2. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, 3. Jamie Lyon, 4. Michael Jennings, 5. Jorge Taufua, 6.  John Sutton, 7. Daly Cherry-Evans, 8.

But in what was a gripping grand final (a shade off a classic, I'd argue, given the number of errors) they found a way to win. That's premiership quality. Their resolve – which netted coach Trent Robinson a premiership in his rookie year, won nice-guy captain Anthony Minichiello a long-awaited second title, and showed Sonny Bill Williams is either a common denominator in success (All Blacks, Chiefs, now Roosters) or has a knack for knowing which ride to hitch his wagon to – looked even more impressive when the final stats came out. The Roosters made more errors (12-6), missed more tackles (27-22), completed fewer sets from more possessions (22/35 or 63% to Manly's 23/28 or 82%), made fewer line breaks (3-5), fewer tackle breaks (22-27), and they lost the penalty count 2-5.</p><p>So how did they win? David Williams's horror night helped (see below) but it was in the back end of the game that they scored the bulk of their points suggesting Manly's grueling final series, and the extra 37 tackles they had to make on Sunday night, became a factor. But still the Roosters had to find holes and capitalise. And that's what they were able to do, with the three players who made the difference late on being their three new signings: Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings. Nice bit of business, that.</p><h2>James Maloney had a great claim for man of the match</h2><p>Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans had a wonderful grand final but it's surprising to say the least that he won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground ahead of Maloney. The Roosters' five-eighth was instrumental in his team winning the premiership, which you'd have to think is the main criteria in selecting the Clive Churchill medallist. His pinpoint cross-field bomb set up the Roosters' opening try to Daniel Tupou, his midfield burst following a Williams offload helped create the Roosters' third, and it was his grubber kick into the Manly in-goal that Jennings swooped on in the 73rd minute to score the match-sealer. Throw in his four out of four conversions and a penalty goal and his being overlooked becomes baffling. Still, if he's actually bothered, he should be consoled by his premiership ring. </p><h2>Manly were unlucky</h2><p>Plenty will argue that Manly used up their allocation of luck when awarded a penalty try just after half-time. Perhaps they're right. Jamie Lyon was certainly tackled without the ball but could you say without any doubt that he would have scored after collecting the bouncing ball (which at this time was grubbering surreptitiously away to his left, like someone trying to sneak out of a party before his mates see him)? I couldn't. <br /> <br />Nevertheless many other decisions went against Manly, some critical. An early knock-on from Mitchell Pearce on his own 20m was let go; Kieran Foran was called for a knock-on with the refs missing Pearce's strip; Jared Waerea-Hargreaves's head-butt (though gentle, like a horse nuzzling for affection) was not deemed worthy of penalising (meaning Maloney kicked a penalty goal from in-front for Manly holding the player down too long); Jennings's touch on a Lyon grubber kick should have resulted in a Manly ball 10m out from the Roosters' line a minute from half-time; and Maloney's pass to Minichiello prior to the Shaun-Kenny Dowall match-leveller was clearly forward. It would have for made compelling TV but Geoff Toovey did well to stop his head from exploding in a rain of goop against the Perspex walls of his viewing box.</p><h2>Williams and Jennings made timely interventions</h2><p>Given he makes hairy-eared commentators swoon like girls at a One Direction concert it feels almost blasphemous to say that for the first 60 minutes of the grand final Sonny Bill Williams was close to the worst player on the field. Up until that point his contributions included a collection of passes that hit the turf, a knock-on 15m out from his own line (which gifted Manly possession which they used to score their opening try), and a bad read in defence that created space for Manly's third try. It seemed that all his earnest conversations with the heavens were being ignored. Perhaps God was watching Big Momma's House on Nine's digital dumping ground, Go! </p><p>Or perhaps not. Because on the hour mark Sonny Bill's fortunes changed. First he angled a hit-up back inside at Cherry-Evans and his half-bust made room for his big right paw to finesse the ball into Maloney's midriff. It put Maloney on the long run that set up the Kenny-Dowall try and regain the lead for the Roosters. Later, Williams burst through the guts of the Manly line like a bird's eye chilli and it was soon after that Jennings – who'd been anonymous in attack – scorched through the in-goal before diving full-length to brilliantly touch down Maloney's kick. Cometh the hour etc etc.</p><h2>Tupou and Williams: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times</h2><p>If the AFL aren't scared off after the Israel Folau debacle they could do worse than look at Roosters winger Daniel Tupou. Unlike Folau, whose enormous frame was put on breeze blocks by Greater Western Sydney's trainers and stripped back to bare bones, Tupou already has the feline lines of an Aussie Rules footballer. And he can leap and mark  (with grace) as he showed with his try over his opposite winger David Williams on Sunday, which was a carbon copy of his try last week over Akuila Uate. Oddly, however, Williams didn't even attempt to jump. Instead he looked up at Tupou like he was an eclipse of the sun. And as we all know you're not supposed to look at an eclipse.<br /> <br />The scenario almost repeated itself 13 minutes into the second half when a high ball plummeted Williams's way with Tupuo preparing his leap. Utterly rattled, Williams only had eyes for Tupou and the ball hit the Sea Eagle without him even attempting to catch it. This led to a drop out and in the next set Mitchell Pearce put Aidan Guerra into a hole and the Roosters clawed the score back to 18-14. Finally, with the game on the line, when Maloney's grubber was bobbling through the Manly in-goal, Jennings ran an opponent who seemed to pull up, as if believing the ball was going to run dead. What player? David Williams. Sport can be cruel.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419203200|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|4f590ab0ef274a635a3c8bc151b53450616d13d5 -->",

After it gets past a point in a season, if he decides not to stay, that's a huge hole you can't fill anyway. You can't find that type of player at this time of year, usually.</p><p>\"That's the risk you take with a player like that. He's proved a lot of people wrong this year. We just decided to back him and we'll do the same again. He can make a huge difference to a team.\"</p><p>Lyon's penalty try came three minutes into the second half and the decision looked like it would change the course of a contest during which his Manly side had endured the rough end of some first-half calls.</p><p>Instead, Williams set up a try which lifted the tricolours back into the game and the centre Michael Jennings touched down just millimetres short of the dead ball line, with seven minutes remaining, to secure victory.</p><p>The penalty try was one of a number of contentious calls at the end of a finals series that started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/cronulla-sharks-north-queensland-cowboys-nrl\">a seven-tackle try eliminating North Queensland</a>.</p><p>Lyon chased Daly Cherry-Evans's kick before he was pulled down by rival Mitchell Aubusson. \"I've got a try, I want to check the penalty try,\" referee Shayne Hayne told video officials Ashley Klein.</p><p>Six minutes later, centre Steve Matai added to Manly's total with a converted try but just as Geoff Toovey's side appeared set to take control, the Roosters responded with a try to Aidan Guerra.</p><p>From the opening seconds, when Manly's Glenn Stewart staggered out of an attempted tackle on Sam Moa and received medical attention before continuing, it was a grand final full of incident and controversial officiating.</p><p>Sea Eagles players claimed Sydney Roosters prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves had head-butted Justin Horo in the 33rd minute. There was definitely contact, but no classic butting action, and a previous penalty to the tricolours stood.</p><p>A penalty against Eagle Matt Ballin for tackling in the air was also open to question, as was a decision to award the Roosters a scrum feed when Jennings appeared to play at the ball before it went into touch.</p><p>It was almost written into the plot that the trend should continue and when Williams released James Maloney in the 60th minute, the pass to captain Anthony Minichiello drifted forwards – but went undetected – before Kenny-Dowall scored.</p><p>Well-known for his outbursts about refereeing this year, Toovey was measured post-match. \"Pretty tough on the big calls again tonight,\" he said. \"It was probably the lowest penalised game of the year.\"</p><p>Cherry-Evans was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match, a small consolation for someone who ended up on the losing side. </p><p>Australia back-rower Greg Bird tweeted: \"Am I the only person that finds it strange that every camera close up is on Sonny Bill. If he wins Clive I'll retire!\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419175726|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|858ac615acea2c2bc62b9126d99c1fbeb3c2b492 -->",

        "body":"<p>Manly's Brett Stewart is expected to play in Sunday's NRL grand final, despite experiencing further hamstring tightness during training this week.</p><p>Stewart's fitness sent some mild concern through the camp on the eve of the decider against the Sydney Roosters.</p><p>Reports suggest Stewart isn't 100% fit  after pulling up sore after his return against South Sydney last week, however he got through a light run with team-mates.</p><p>Both clubs completed their captain's runs on Saturday, with respective coaches Geoff Toovey and Trent Robinson putting the final polish on preparations.</p><p>For Manly, Joe Galuvao will not return from an achilles tear, but the news on Stewart is as positive as can be expected.</p><p>For the Roosters, forwards Boyd Cordner and Luke O'Donnell are both expected to be late inclusions in the side.</p><p>Roosters players got through their final run without complication, however coach Robinson says he won't publicly confirm his 17 until an hour before kick-off.</p><p>The Sea Eagles were without Stewart in week one of the playoffs when they went down to grand final opponents the Roosters 4-0.</p><p>Stewart was instrumental in last week's come-from-behind preliminary final win over South Sydney and his impact in the decider will be a crucial factor on the final outcome.</p><p>Stewart's deputy at fullback, 20-year-old Peta Hiku, has done well – but doesn't have the attacking instincts and presence of Stewart. \"They need him ... he has to play,\" said the former Manly prop Mark Carroll.</p><p>Sea Eagles premiership winner Max Brown said he couldn't split Stewart from the club's fullback from their 1970s golden era, Graham Eadie.</p><p>\"Different styles of play but both got the same result and are absolutely fantastic,\" said Brown. \"I don't think I could rate either of those as number one and two. I'd put them both as number one.\"</p><p>The inclusion of O'Donnell and particularly Cordner will provide a major boost for the Roosters. Cordner broke through for NSW Origin selection this year and was voted the Dally M second rower of the year. He was outstanding for the Roosters until he broke his ankle seven weeks ago.</p><p>Cordner was close to playing last week against Newcastle, and Robinson has indicated he'll play the 21-year-old if he's anywhere close to full fitness. </p><p>O'Donnell is an NRL veteran with grand final, Origin and Test experience.</p><p>He missed the Knights' final with a hamstring strain but has reportedly recovered. Dylan Napa and Isaac Liu are tipped to be the young Roosters to make way.</p><p>At Manly, young forward James Hasson and journeyman David Gower are vying to fill the vacant spot on the bench.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419159908|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|c4a81820bd0d07f11e69974c3228691278b8ab29 -->",
